  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind controlled study that compared the efficacy
      and safety of V. vinifera extract, calcium dobesilate (CD), and placebo in subjects with DME.
      Patients made 6 clinic visits, namely the screening visit; baseline visit (T0); and follow-up
      visits at 3 (T3), 6 (T6), 9 (T9), and 12 (T12) months.

      Eligible patients were randomised to one of the three study groups in a 1:2:2 ratio
      (placebo:GSPE:CD group). The randomization schedule was generated and prepared using
      cubeIWRS® solution (CRScube Inc., Seoul, South Korea, HQ). Randomization was performed using
      a complete randomization algorithm according to the order of the baseline visit. Subjects
      took three tablets of a masked study medication three times daily for 12 months; the first
      dose was taken in the morning of the baseline visit (T0) after baseline assessments were
      performed, and the last dose was taken in the evening before the month 12 visit (T12). Three
      daily oral doses of 50mg tablets of GSPE (Entelon®, Hanlim Pharm, Seoul, South Korea) were
      administered to patients in the GSPE group. Placebo tablets lacked GSPE, but their appearance
      was identical to that of the study group tablets. Commercially available 250mg CD tablets
      (Doxium®, Ilsung Pharm, Seoul, South Korea) were used in this study. The identity of the
      masked study medications was concealed by storing the medications in individually sealed
      envelopes at the study sites.
