      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of antiangiogenic therapy to
      choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia.

      This study is planned as a follow-up. Patients with myopia included in it will receive
      antiangiogenic therapy in accordance with the approved indications for use indicated in the
      instructions for the use of drugs in Ukraine.

      The treatment proposed in this study is based on the world experience and scientific
      developments of the Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy of the NAMS of
      Ukraine &quot;. Therefore, it is expected that the benefit / risk ratio in relation to the
      participation in this study should not be different from that described in the scientific
      literature and the benefits outweigh the risk. It is known that the absence of treatment in
      these diseases leads to an irreparable loss of central vision.

      Patients with a pathologic myopia with CNV (native) will be treated with antiangiogenic drugs
      according to the regimen pro re nata.
