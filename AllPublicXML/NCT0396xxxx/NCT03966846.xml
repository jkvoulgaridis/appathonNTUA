  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic disorders which increases the risk for diabetes
      and cardiovascular disease. In recent years, research has shown that probiotics may have
      positive effects on metabolic syndrome components. Although several health-promoting effects
      of kefir, have been suggested, there is limited evidence for its potential effect on
      metabolic syndrome. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the effects of kefir on metabolic
      disorders including obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. To address the
      research gap, this study aimed to investigate the effects of daily kefir consumption on
      metabolic syndrome components, inflammatory response and gut microbiota composition in adults
      with MetS. The study was planned as a randomized, controlled, parallel design and completed
      with a total of 62 individuals who were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome according to the
      International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. Participants were randomized into two
      groups and received daily 180 ml of kefir (n=31) or milk (as control) (n=31) for 12 weeks.
      Participants were assessed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12 and at all controls
      dietary records, anthropometric measurements, and blood samples were collected. At baseline
      and 12th-week fecal samples were also collected in order to analyze gut microbiota
      composition.
