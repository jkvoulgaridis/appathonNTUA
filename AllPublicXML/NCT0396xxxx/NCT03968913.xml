  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are extremely common. On average, 50% of
      individuals suffering an ACL injury will develop radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) 10 to 20
      years after injury. Unfortunately, ACL reconstruction does not prevent risk of future OA.

      Interleukin-1 (IL-1) levels in the human knee joint increase transiently after an ACL injury.
      In animal experiments, if interleukin-1 levels are increased in the joint, this alone causes
      arthritis to occur. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a naturally occurring
      inhibitor of IL-1. However, in ACL injuries the balance of these two proteins is disturbed
      transiently after injury, with the effects of IL-1 dominating this balance. In a large animal
      model of ACL injury, injection of IL-1Ra into the knee joint after ACL injury significantly
      decreased the amount of arthritis that was later observed.

      Thus, the investigators hypothesize that injection of IL-1 inhibitor (IL-1Ra) into the knee
      joint of patients suffering recent ACL injury will decrease the incidence of cartilage
      damage.

      After appropriate IRB approval, a total of 48 active patients will be randomized into one of
      three treatment groups. Group 1 will receive removal of the knee joint fluid (aspiration of
      hemarthrosis) using a needle and syringe within 1 week of injury. Following aspiration of the
      knee joint, an injection of 5 milliliters (mls) of sterile saline (as a placebo control) will
      be administered. In addition, a second knee aspiration procedure and an injection of 5mls of
      sterile saline into the injured knee joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 2
      will receive aspiration of the knee hemarthrosis as described in group 1 as well as
      intra-articular administration of 150mg (~5mls) of anakinra (rhIL-1Ra) within 7 days of ACL
      injury. In addition, a second knee aspiration and injection of 5mls of sterile saline into
      the injured knee joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 3 patients will
      receive aspiration of the knee hemarthrosis and injection of anakinra as described in group 2
      as well as a second intra-articular knee injection of anakinra (150mg, ~5mls) on post-injury
      day 10. Thus, all patients in this randomized placebo-controlled trial will undergo two
      injection procedures prior to surgery.

      Rather than waiting years to observe the sequelae, T1rho MRI technology will be used to
      compare MRI findings among patients in these 3 treatment groups as well as an uninjured
      control group. In addition, the investigators will analyze subjects self-reported function
      and pain scores as well as urinary levels of cartilage breakdown products over time. These
      MRI, urine and subjective outcome assessments will be obtained prior to surgery and then
      again at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months post-operatively.

      After appropriate IRB approval at total of 48 active patients who meet the inclusion criteria
      listed above will be randomized into three treatment groups: Group 1 (n = 16) will undergo
      ultrasound guided arthrocentesis of the knee hemarthrosis at the time of presentation in
      clinic. Following aspiration of the knee joint hemarthrosis, an injection of 5 milliliters
      (mls) of 0.9% sodium chloride solution (sterile saline) will be administered as a placebo
      control. In addition, a second aspiration of knee joint fluid and injection of sterile saline
      into the injured knee joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 2 (n = 16) will
      undergo arthrocentesis as described in group 1 as well as intra-articular administration of
      150mg (~5mls) of anakinra (rhIL-1Ra) within 7 days of ACL injury. In addition, repeat knee
      joint fluid aspiration and a second injection of 5mls of sterile saline into the injured knee
      joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 3 patients will receive arthrocentesis
      and injection of anakinra as described in group 2 as well as a second knee joint aspiration
      and intra-articular knee injection of anakinra (150mg, ~5mls) on post-injury day 10. Thus,
      all patients will undergo two ultrasound guided knee aspiration and injection procedures
      prior to surgery. The first injection will be after the arthrocentesis procedure to remove
      the hemarthrosis associated with acute ACL injury. To minimize pain and discomfort the same
      needle stick will be used to aspirate the hemarthrosis and to inject the saline or anakinra
      depending on the patient's treatment group. The second knee arthrocentesis and injection in
      each patient will also be performed under ultrasound-guidance at 10 days after injury. Some
      patient's injuries may fall on a day where performing these aspiration and injection
      procedures exactly 10 days after injury is not possible due to constraints of the work week
      (i.e. Monday through Friday). In this case the procedures will be performed on the next
      consecutive work day closest to the 10 days post-injury time point. An additional
      arthrocentesis procedure will be performed at the time of surgery.

      Patients in all 3 groups will be followed longitudinally with repeat MR imaging that includes
      T1rho sequences being obtained at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively (Aim 1). The MRI
      studies performed in this investigation will be non-arthrogram studies without
      intra-articular or intravenous contrast.

      Study patients in all 3 groups will undergo pre-operative collection of urine and knee joint
      fluid as described above. These time points include: i) at the time of enrollment into the
      study (within 7 days of injury), ii) at 10 days after injury, iii) on the day of surgery
      (within 30 days of injury). In addition, urine and knee joint fluid collection will be
      performed at the initial post-operative visit (approximately 10 days after surgery) followed
      by collection of urine alone at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively in all treatment
      groups. Urine and arthrocentesis samples will be analyzed for the presence of inflammatory
      cytokines and cartilage breakdown biomarkers (Aim 2) according to Osteoarthritis Research
      Society International guidelines (see cytokine and biomarker assays section below for further
      details). Given, that multiple studies have demonstrated resolution of cytokine abnormalities
      by 2 to 4 weeks after ACL injury, urine assessments of cytokine assays (IL-1, etc.) will not
      be conducted beyond 3 months post-operatively. However, ELISAs for cartilage biomarkers will
      be performed on urine collected at each time point throughout the duration of the study.
      Validated patient reported outcome assessments (KOOS, VAS and PROMIS) will be completed at
      initial presentation as well as at 3, 6, 12 and 24 month post-operatively (Aim 3).

      This study will be a single-blinded design and all aspects of the study design will be
      disclosed to subjects during the informed consent process. Given that anakinra needs to be
      ordered by the physician from the pharmacy on the day of injection, the physician performing
      the injection will not be blinded to which patients receive anakinra treatments. However, the
      patients will be blinded regarding which treatment they receive. All patients will receive
      injections of the same volume and using the same type of needle and syringe. In addition, the
      radiologist interpreting the MRI studies will be blinded to which treatment the patients
      receive. The physician administering the injections into the joint will not be involved in
      interpreting the MRI findings and will not be present when subjects complete the
      patient-reported outcome measures. In addition, the synovial fluid and urine biomarker data
      will be analyzed in a coded fashion in conjunction with a statistician to avoid bias in the
      statistical analysis.
