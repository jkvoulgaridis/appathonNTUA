  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate safety and efficacy of GSK3377794 in patients with solid tumors,
      initially in patients with synovial sarcoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) is a therapeutic approach that uses T lymphocytes of patients
      with cancer, obtained by leukapheresis, with the aim of generating an anti-tumor T-cell
      immune response. New York esophageal antigen-1 (NY-ESO-1) and LAGE-1a antigens are
      tumor-associated proteins that have been found in several tumor types. Clinical trials using
      adoptively transferred T-cells directed against NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1a have shown objective
      responses. GSK3377794 is the first generation of NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell receptor engineered
      T-cells. This is a master protocol that will initially consist of two substudies,
      investigating GSK3377794 in previously untreated patients with advanced metastatic synovial
      sarcoma (Substudy 1) and in patients with advanced metastatic synovial sarcoma who have
      progressed following treatment with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Substudy 2).
