  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of linzagolix in
      subjects with varying degrees of impaired hepatic function compared to match control subjects
      with normal hepatic function
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open label, single-dose study to evaluate the effect of
      varying degrees of impaired hepatic function (i.e., mild, moderate, and severe Hepatic
      Impairment (HI)) on the PK, safety, and tolerability of linzagolix and its major metabolite,
      KP017.

      Up to 28 adult female participants will be enrolled.

             clinical laboratory profiles, as deemed by the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee

             condition other than HI which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of linzagolix and its metabolites, or which may jeopardize

             designee

        Healthy Subjects

          1. Has any clinically significant illness, as judged by the PI or designee, within 4
