  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observer-blind, randomized, active controlled trial will be conducted among 2-29 year
      olds in two sites (Mali and The Gambia). The objectives of the study are to assess and
      compare the immunogenicity and safety of NmCV-5 with that of Menactra.

      A total of 1800 eligible participants (who or their parents/guardians have given written
      informed consent) will be randomised 2:1 (NmCV-5: Menactra) in each of the three age strata
      18-29 years, 11-17 years &amp; 2-10 years (400 NmCV-5 recipients &amp; 200 Menactra recipients in
      each age strata).

      Each subject will receive a single dose of study vaccine and will be followed up for 6 months
      post vaccination during which solicited reactions (for seven days), unsolicited AEs (28 days)
      and SAEs (until the end of study i.e. 168 days after vaccination) will be collected. A blood
      sample will be collected at baseline (pre-vaccination) and at day 28 post-vaccination for
      immunogenicity assessment by a Serum Bactericidal Activity assay using rabbit complement
      (rSBA).
