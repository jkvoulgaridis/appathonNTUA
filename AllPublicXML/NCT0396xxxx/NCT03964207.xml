    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric
             criteria at Visit 1 (Screening).

               -  Relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with a
                  post-bronchodilator 30% ≤ Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV)1 ≤80% of predicted
                  normal and FEV1/FVC ≤70%. Spirometry should be done at baseline and approximately
                  1/2 hour following 4 inhalations of albuterol.

               -  Male = exp [−10.61669 + 2.27078 × ln (− in cm) + 0.06622 × ln (age in year) +
                  Mspline] Female = exp [ −9.69716 + 2.09385 × ln (− in cm) + 0.02006 × ln (age in
                  year) + Mspline]

               -  Historical data from spirometry measurements within the past 6 months either at
                  the site or at the other hospital may be used. If the measurements are not
                  performed at the trial site a referral letter and signed copies of the
                  measurement printouts must be provided to the trial site for source data
                  verification. In case several qualifying spirometry measurements are available,
                  the most recent one should be referred to as long as it was not performed during
                  an exacerbation. Patients may not be randomised to the study without the
                  availability of spirometry data at the actual study site.

          -  Male or female, age: 40-80 years

          -  Patients must be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of ≥ 10 pack years.

             Harmonization (ICH) ICH-GCP and local legislation prior to admission to the trial

          -  Patients must be able to inhale medication from the Tiotropium Respimat® and
             Tiotropium HandiHaler®

          -  Patients must be able to perform all study related procedures, and must be able to
             maintain records (patient diary) during the study period as required by the protocol

          -  Patients have any previous experience of using Respimat® or Handihaler® or generic
             Handihaler within one year pior to screening.

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease or condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may put the patients at risk because of participation in the study or
             may influence either the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate
             in the study.

          -  All patients with an Aspartate Transaminase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic

             excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will not
             be conducted in these subjects.
