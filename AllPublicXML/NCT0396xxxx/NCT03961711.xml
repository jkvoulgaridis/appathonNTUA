  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate patient perspective on telemedicine used in 3 week
      post operative visits for knee and hip arthroplasty. It is hypothesized that patient
      satisfaction with telemedicine follow-up is equal to patient satisfaction with in-office
      followup. Patient satisfaction will be assessed at the 3-week and 9-week post-operative
      timepoints.

    <textblock>
      In 2014 there were 370,770 total hip replacements and 680,150 total knee replacements
      performed in the United States. As the elderly proportion of the population continues to
      grow, it is estimated that the number of total hip arthroplasty will grow by 71 percent and
      total knee arthroplasty will grow by 85 percent by the year 2030 (Sloan, M The Journal of
      Bone and Joint Surgery 2018). As these numbers continue to rise, health care delivery must
      evolve into a more efficient, cost effective system without compromising the quality of the
      care delivered.

      Telemedicine involves using electronic communications and software to provide clinical
      services to patients in place of an in-person visit. Benefits of telemedicine include
      avoiding unnecessary trips to hospitals, saving time, and reducing the number of working days
      missed (Asiri, A Acta Inform Med 2018). Used in general surgery followup care, anonymous
      survey responses demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction with 85% expressing a desire to
      utilize telemedicine for followup care in the future (Nikolian, V Annals of Surgery 2018).
      Postoperative telemedicine has been studied in many specialties, but literature exploring its
      use in orthopedics has been scant.

    <description>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) will be used to assess patient satisfaction of the 3 week encounter both at 3 and 9 weeks post-operatively.
The scale of the survey ranges from 8-32, with 32 being the best score and 8 being the worst. The higher a patient scores, the more satisfied the patient is with the care provided.</description>
