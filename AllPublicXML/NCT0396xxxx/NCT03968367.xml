  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have evaluated the use of magnetic-activated sperm sorting (MASS) to reduce
      apoptotic spermatozoa and improve the outcome of infertile male with assisted reproductive
      technology (ART). However, some results were inconsistent with above. The sperm of male with
      abnormal semen analysis tend to be accompanied with high apoptotic and high DNA fragmentation
      index (DFI). Hence, this study aimed at determining the efficiency of MASS in improving the
      clinical outcome of patients with high DFI).

      Patients will be recruited from our reproductive medicine center in Nanjing Drum towel
      Hospital, from July 2019 to July 2020. After semen analysis and selection of infertile men
      with at least two abnormal sperm parameters and obtaining the informed consent of the
      patients according to the admission criteria, the patients who enter the project will be
      randomly divided into the control group (n=30) whose sperm will be screened by density
      differential centrifugation (DGC) with swim up, and the observation group will be screened by
      MASS, followed by DGC. Then the procedure of in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection (ICSI) will be performed. Embryo transfer will be underwent according to the
      developmental speed and morphological characteristics of the embryo. The clinical outcomes
      after transplantation will be followed up.

    <description>A 0.5 mL aliquot of spermatozoa suspended in HTF-modified HEPES buffer, obtained either after sperm wash to remove the seminal plasma or after DGC, was centrifuged and the pellet (maximum of 107 cells) was resuspended in 80 uL of binding buffer with 20 uL of Annexin V-conjugated microspheres, both from the Annexin V microbead kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Huburn, CA, USA), for 15 min at room temperature. After addition of 400 lL of binding solution, the suspension was placed in the separation column (MiniMACS, Miltenyi Biotec). Labeled (apoptotic) cells were retained on the column and non-labeled (viable) cells passed through the column.</description>

    <intervention_name>Magnetic activated sperm sorting</intervention_name>
    <description>MACS is a technique which allows the spermatozoa with the best characteristics to be selected for use in assisted reproduction treatments. This technique removes apoptotic spermatozoa - those which will die without achieving fertilisation - and selects the healthy ones, thus increasing the possibility of pregnancy.</description>
