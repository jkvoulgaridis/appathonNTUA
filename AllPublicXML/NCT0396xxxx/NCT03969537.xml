  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cervical dystonia (CD) patients are limited in their ability to travel to the clinic for
      follow-up in between injection visits.

      A telemedicine visit at the time of peak effectiveness of neurotoxin treatment may be
      valuable in informing the neurologist's choice of muscle selection and/or dose for the next
      injection visit. The primary objective of this study is to investigate both patient and
      physician satisfaction with the use of our telemedicine tool for this type of follow-up.
      After assessment of the subject, the neurologist will decide whether or not the telemedicine
      visit was informative to the upcoming injection visit. Subjects will answer questions at the
      end of the visit regarding their satisfaction with the follow-up and overall telemedicine
      communication. The principle investigator will complete a similar survey with additional
      questions about information gathered from the visit to assess the primary objective.

      A secure video communications platform will be used for the visit, which will occur 2-4 weeks
      after the patient's last neurotoxin injection (around the time of peak effectiveness). The
      investigating neurologist will remotely assess the patient and make notes for the next
      injection visit.
