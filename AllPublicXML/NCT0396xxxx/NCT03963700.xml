  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are immune-mediated complications of cancer that
      can affect any part of the central or peripheral nervous system.

      PNS occurs at the intersection between immune system and the tumor, where a combination of
      genetical and environmental factors may play a role.

      Mechanisms leading to immune tolerance breakdown and autoimmunity in PNS remain largely
      unknown, and this reflects in an unsatisfactory repertoire of treatments available. Moreover,
      a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying PNS would allow a more precise
      identification of the modalities that permit PNS patients to have a better oncological
      prognosis than cancer patient without PNS, with obvious repercussions in clinical oncology.

      To this effect, an extremely innovative approach involves directly exploring the tumoral
      tissue of patients suffering from specific PNS via genomic and transcriptomic analysis.

      The study team hypothesizes that antigen ectopic expression by tumour cells may contribute to
      the generation of PNS.

      In the present study, the investigators will analyze the salient features of tumors
      associated with PNS, namely the histological and immune cells infiltrate characteristics,
      their transcriptomic profile, and mutational status of involved antigens.
