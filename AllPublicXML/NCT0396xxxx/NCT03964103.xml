      -  Primary purpose: To assess satisfaction with overall improvement in symptoms, including
           individual bowel symptoms, after 4 weeks of administration of gQ-lab to patients with
           irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

        -  Secondary purposes: To assess the correlation between intestinal attachment and
           therapeutic effects of gQ-lab through the visual analog scale (VAS) assessment of each
           IBS-related symptom and measurement of changes in quality of life and fecal flora in the
           placebo group and gQ-lab group after 4 weeks of gQ-lab administration.

      To assess safety, including adverse reactions, vital signs (including weight), physical
      examination, and changes in blood test results.

      To examine the rate of positive gut quotient (gQ) values in patients diagnosed with IBS as
      per the ROME III criteria. Further, to examine how the ROME III-based symptom scale score
      compared with that of the quality of life scale in the gQ questionnaire.

The range of the VAS score is 1 to 10. The lower the value of the VAS score, the better. The value of the endpoint (4 weeks) is compared in the placebo group versus the treatment group.</description>

             discomfort or abdominal pain in the past 3 months and meeting at least two of the
             following conditions: (1) improvement in defecation; (2) onset of symptoms associated
