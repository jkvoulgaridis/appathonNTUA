      The concept of normality is a cornerstone in medical practice and research. As an example, in
      clinical chemistry, a laboratory value based on a patient plasma sample, exceeding the +/-
      1.96 x standard deviation (SD) range, referenced from a normative material, is per definition
      outside the normal range (the reference interval). Obviously, a number of reasons for this
      deviation may exist. The sample value could reflect a &quot;true&quot; pathological condition, but
      could just as well also be caused by error, e.g., technical measurement error,
      drug-interaction error, random error, or, reflect a value occurring in 5% of the healthy
      population. Conversely, a sample value in the normal range evidently does not exclude a
      pathological condition.

      The reference interval is calculated from a large number of healthy subjects sampled across
      age, anthropometrics, ethnicity and gender. Normative reference intervals are certainly of
      help particularly in the screening of subjects, but may be of limited value in the detailed
      assessment of pathophysiological processes. Also, increasing the number of analyses in a
      subject expands the risk of making a type I error (acquiring &quot;false&quot; positive results). The
      likelihood of one or more type I errors in the analysis of 10 different laboratory values in
      one subject, is impressive 46% ([1 - 0.95^10] =0.46). It is well-known that multiple
      measurements are commonly performed in medical practice and research, but corrected
      significance levels are not always used.

      Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is defined as perceptually quantifiable responses to
      graded chemical (capsaicin), electrical, mechanical (pressure, punctate, vibratory, and light
      touch) or thermal (cool, warmth, cold pain, and heat pain) stimuli. Thus, QST is a
      psychophysical method primarily assessing small nerve fiber function in the skin. The method
      is ubiquitously used for the assessment of peripheral neuropathies, e.g.,
      chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, painful diabetic polyneuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia,
      and post-surgical neuropathy. Sensory mapping and QST are essential tools in grading definite
      or probable neuropathic pain as stated in the definition: &quot;Demonstration of the distinct
      neuroanatomically plausible distribution by at least one confirmatory test.&quot; During the last
      decade, the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) has acquired normative sensory
      data from healthy individuals using a standardized testing protocol. Clearly, a deviating
      sensory response from a patient with a painful peripheral neuropathy could be evaluated by
      use of these normative data and eventually be classified as an abnormal response.

      But, other alternatives exist, that hypothetically might provide an improved diagnostic
      specificity and sensitivity. First, in unilateral sensory deficits (mono-neuropathies),
      assessments at the contralateral side are possible, allowing a comparison with the
      pathological side. The within-subject variances (WSV) are often significantly smaller than
      the between-subject variances (BSV) in QST-assessments. In a normative study including
      thermal assessments (n = 100), the WSV and the BSV ranged between 18-23% and 77-82% of the
      total variance, respectively. Correspondingly, in a study of patients with the
      post-thoracotomy pain syndrome, the estimated WSV and BSV were 5-28% and 72-95%,
      respectively. Thus, scenarios using the subject as own control may reduce data variability,
      and improve diagnostic efficacy. However, the use of a contralateral homologous area as a
      control area in sensory testing has been questioned by several authors. The occurrence of
      mirror image sensory dysfunction (MISD) may affect contralateral assessments, requiring a
      neutral control area in the subject. Second, instead of using healthy controls in pain
      studies, use of pain-free patients (e.g. post-groin hernia repair, post-thoracotomy) as
      controls have been recommended in persistent post-surgical pain studies.

      In spite of the importance of selecting an optimally controlled research design, the research
      group is only aware of one QST-study, adressing the control-group problem, i.e., a study
      including patients with complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I) restricted to one
      extremity. The study examined the validity of using the contralateral side as control
      compared to using normative data from healthy individuals. The study recommended that the
      contralateral side in CPRS I patients should be used as a control.

      Thus it may be inferred, that following approaches are available evaluating sensory data from
      an anticipated pathological site: an empirical approach (á priori set reference values); an
      absolute approach (comparing the subject's pathological side with normative data); and a
      relative approach (comparing the subject's side-to-side differences with normative data).

    <measure>Thermal thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>2019-2020</time_frame>
    <description>Warmth detection threshold (WDT), cool detection threshold, heat pain threshold (HPT) and cold pain threshold (CPT) are made by a computerized contact thermode (Thermotest, Somedic AB, Sweden) with an active thermal surface of 12.5 cm^2 (2.5 x 5.0 cm^2) as previously described in detail. The thresholds are determined from a baseline temperature of 32°C with a ramp rate of + 1°C/s. Cut-offs for heat and cold are 50°C and 5°C, respectively. The assessments are made in triplicate and the mean values are used in the statistical analyses.</description>

    <measure>Pressure algometry</measure>
    <time_frame>2019-2020</time_frame>
    <description>Deep-tissue pain sensitivity is assessed using a hand-held pressure algometer with a neoprene-coated tip of area 1.0 cm2 (Somedic AB, Sweden), as previously described. The algometer is applied perpendicularly to the skin with a pressure rate of 30 kPa/s. The study subject is told to report the pressure pain threshold (PPT) by activating the button device when pain is perceived. The cut-off limit is 350 kPa. Testing is done in triplicate and the average value is used in the statistical analyses.</description>

    <measure>Suprathreshold heat stimulation</measure>

    <description>A short tonic heat stimulus (heating area 12.5 cm^2; ramp rate: 1°C/s, plateau: 47°C, 5 s; STH) is delivered in order to evaluate the suprathreshold heat pain perception (NRS).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory mapping</measure>
    <time_frame>2019-2020</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory mapping in the groin areas is assessed with a 25°C metal roll (Somedic AB), moved at a rate of 1 to 2 cm/s from skin with normal cool perception, using an octagonal approach, into the areas in order to indicate sensory changes. Changes in the study subject's cool perception are indicated by a marker on the skin, and subsequently transferred to a transparent sheet for later area assessment in a vector-based drawing drawing program (Canvas 12.0; ACD Systems, Seattle, WA).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tactile thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>2019-2020</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile detection thresholds (TDT) and tactile pain threshold (TPT) are determined by polyamide monofilaments (Stoelting, IL, USA; nominal buckling force ranging from 0.04 to 4,400 mN) using a modified Dixon up-and-down method, with 3 descending and 3 ascending stimulus intensities. The filament with the smallest buckling force leading to tactile recognition (TDT) is registered. The tactile pain threshold (TPT) is determined by the same stimulus paradigm, but registering the perception of pain (sharpness/sting; TPT).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal summation</measure>
    <time_frame>2019-2020</time_frame>
    <description>Temporal summation test, i.e., the perception in response to repetitive (0.3 to 3 Hz) mechanical stimulation [i.e., wind-up like pain: WUP], indicates presence of central sensitization. The repetitive 1 Hz stimuli for 60 s are either dynamically delivered by a brush or statically delivered by a polyamide filament (one nominal rank below TPT). The study subjects are told to report the level of pain (NRS) every 15 s-1 during the stimulation. Signs of aftersensations are followed 60 s after discontinuation of the stimulation, and the intensity of discomfort or pain is rated by NRS.</description>
