  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effectiveness of EMDR for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.
      All participants will undertake a standard course of EMDR via the National Heath Service
      program, alongside a number of questionnaires and a follow-up interview.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of Eye Movement Desensitisation
      Reprocessing (EMDR) via investigation of the changes in the individual trauma stress response
      on sexually abused adolescents and young adults, aged between 18 and 25 during EMDR
      treatment. The findings of this mixed methods study will explore (a) neuropsychological,
      emotional (namely low self-esteem, anxiety and depression), behavioural functioning and
      quality of life issues via quantitative measures conducted before, during and after treatment
      and (b) client perspectives of such changes through qualitative interviewing (interview guide
      is in Appendix 7) at one month follow-up using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
      [IPA]. The study setting will be conducted within the Improving Access to Psychological
      Therapies (IAPT) program framework, established to ensure service users accessing NHS
      treatment are presented with choice in their treatment. Therapy will routinely be delivered
      within GP Surgeries or Health Centres.

      Within this two-fold study, the following key research questions will be considered in
      relation to the effectiveness of EMDR:

        1. Qualitative data will sought to identify; In what ways was EMDR helpful? In what ways
           was EMDR perceived as being unhelpful?

        2. Quantitative data will sought to identify; Are there changes in emotional and
           behavioural functioning (in relation to trauma, anxiety and depressive symptoms)? Are
           there changes in neuropsychological functioning (memory, attention, executive
           functioning)? Are there changes in quality of life issues? Are there changes in
           self-worth?

    <measure>Impact of Events Scale-Revised 'IESR'</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline PTSD symptomology at up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>22-item self-report measure to evaluate impact of sexual abuse in terms of traumatic stress, abuse attributions and social reactions. Participants will be asked to rate their level of distress in relation to the said traumatic event on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;), ultimately providing the researcher with a total score (ranging from 0 to 88). The higher the score, the greater the PTSD symptomology.</description>

    <measure>The Psychology Experiment Building Language 'PEBL' Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline neuropsychological functioning at up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PEBL is an electronic neuropsychological battery utilised to monitor adaptations in participants' neuropsychological functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline anxiety levels at up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their level of anxiety on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;), ultimately providing the researcher with a total score (ranging from 0 to 21). The higher the score, the greater the anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline depression levels at up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their level of depression on a 9-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;), ultimately providing the researcher with a total score (ranging from 0 to 27). The higher the score, the greater the depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Problems Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline emotional and behavioural functioning at up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of 11 statements that participants are requested to rate in order to describe their feelings and interactions during the past week to gauge general emotional and behavioural functioning. Answers/statements for all questions are from a choice of the following &quot;never&quot; &quot;almost never&quot; &quot;a little of the time&quot; &quot;some of the time&quot; &quot;most of the time&quot; &quot;all of the time.&quot; Generally, the more negative the selected statement, the greater the indication of issues in functioning within that given domain.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline levels of self-worth at up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item RSES measures global self-worth by measuring both positive and negative feelings about the self. Participants will be asked to rate their level of self-worth by measuring both positive and negative feelings about the self. All items are answered using a 4-point Likert scale format as follows; &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; 1 point, &quot;Disagree&quot; 2 points, &quot;Agree&quot; 3 points, and &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; 4 points,' ultimately providing the researcher with a total score (ranging from 10 to 40). Higher scores indicate higher self-esteem.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Valued Living Questionnaire 'VLQ'</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline quality of life issues at up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VLQ is an instrument that taps into 10 valued domains of living as follows; 1. Family, 2. Marriage/couples/intimate relations, 3. Parenting, 4. Friendship, 5. Work, 6. Education, 7. Recreation, 8. Spirituality, 9. Citizenship, and 10. Physical self-care. Scoring: Respondents are asked to rate the 10 areas of life on a scale of 1 (not at all important) -10 (extremely important), indicating the level of importance and how consistently they have lived in accord with those values in the past week, ultimately providing the researcher with a total score (ranging from 10 to 100).</description>
