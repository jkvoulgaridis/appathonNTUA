  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium (POD) refers to an acute neurocognitive disorder that occurs within 1
      week after surgery or before discharge. Old age is one of the important risk factors for
      postoperative delirium. The incidence rate of the elderly is high, and the life span of human
      beings is increasing. Postoperative delirium has adverse effects on both short-term and
      long-term outcomes, including mortality, ability to work, and dependence on society.

      Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a key molecule in the cholesterol transport mechanism and is
      easily oxidized to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL). Oxidized low density
      lipoproteins are immunogenic and are also cytotoxic to endothelial cells. Some studies have
      shown that increased oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes in disease, and similar
      signs can be detected in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI), such as protein oxidation and lipids. An increase in the quality of the peroxidation
      index. For the study of anesthesiology, oxidative stress theory has long been recognized as
      one of the mechanisms of postoperative delirium. We have a hypothesis that plasma oxidized
      low-density lipoprotein levels are associated with postoperative delirium and can be used as
      an early warning marker for disease occurrence.

      Based on clinical research data, we conducted a prospective cohort study to explore the
      correlation between plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels and postoperative sputum,
      providing clinical prediction and diagnostic value.
