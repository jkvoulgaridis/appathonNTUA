  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the effects of etelcalcetide on the bone and blood-vessel
      health in patients with CKD-MBD. The investigators will test if etelcalcetide makes bone and
      blood-vessels healthier. The study hypotheses are that are that etelcalcetide keeps bones
      strong and lowers the risk of calcium deposits in blood vessels. In Aim 1, the investigators
      will test if 9-months of treatment with etelcalcetide improves bone strength in twenty ESKD
      patients with hyperparathyroidism (HPT) by bone biopsy. In Aim 2, the investigators will test
      if 9-months of treatment with etelcalcetide decreases serum propensity to calcify blood
      vessels. The potential significance of this study is to provide first-time data on the
      ability of etelcalcetide to protect bone and blood-vessel health in patients with ESKD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disease (CKD-MBD) is a disorder of bone and mineral
      metabolism in patients with CKD. When kidney function is poor, levels of vitamin D, phosphate
      and parathyroid hormone become abnormal and patients are at risk for bone disease and
      fractures (renal osteodystrophy) and the deposition of calcium in blood vessels and muscles.
      CKD-MBD increases the risk of fractures, heart attacks, strokes, and death. Treatment of
      CKD-MBD is focused on lowering levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by giving vitamin D and
      lowering levels of phosphorous by giving phosphate binders. In patients with end stage kidney
      disease (ESKD), target levels of PTH recommended by the Kidney Disease Improving Global
      Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines are in the range of 2-9 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for
      the PTH assay. In many cases, in patients with long-standing ESKD, the parathyroid gland may
      no longer respond to treatment with vitamin D and phosphate lowering. In these cases,
      treatment with a calcimimetic, a medicine that increases the sensitivity of the parathyroid
      gland to serum levels of calcium, can restore PTH levels to goal.
