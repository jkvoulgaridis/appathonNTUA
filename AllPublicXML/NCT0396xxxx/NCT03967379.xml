  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to evaluate whether the use of a mobile app can help
      transplant survivors experiencing sexual health problems.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frequently survivors of stem cell transplantation report significant problems with their
      sexual function that impacts their quality of life, mood, and their intimacy and relationship
      with their partners. These issues can be very distressing to patients and their loved ones.
      The study doctors want to know if the use of a mobile app intervention focused on improving
      sexual function may improve participants overall care.
