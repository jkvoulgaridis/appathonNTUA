    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy, which may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes, was a
      serious health problem in China. Various iron supplements used in different regions of China,
      however, the effects have not been well investigated. The objective of this study is to

      This is a nationwide multicenter prospective cohort study conducted in seven hospitals in
      China to investigate the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of iron deficiency and iron
      deficiency anemia in Chinese pregnant women. This study will enroll about 6000-7000 pregnant
      women, who established a health record in the seven hospitals. Demographic characteristics,
      laboratory tests, behavior habits during pregnancy, mental status, and pregnancy outcomes
      will been collected. All information will collect by a pregnant women self-reported
