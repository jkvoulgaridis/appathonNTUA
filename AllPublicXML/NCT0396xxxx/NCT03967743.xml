  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to apply a well-established model of developmental
      surveillance (which evolved to characterize the outcomes of very low birth weight infants) to
      infants with genetic disorders. A novel clinical model for infants with rare genetic
      disorders has been created as a joint initiative between the Division of Newborn Medicine's
      NICU Growth and Developmental Support Programs (NICU GraDS) program and the Division of
      Genetics at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). This study plans to enroll patients with
      genetic syndromes seen in this clinic into a prospective, longitudinal study in order to
      characterize their developmental profiles and needs.

      The main objective of this study is to apply a well-established model of developmental
      surveillance (which evolved to characterize the outcomes of very low birth weight infants) to
      infants with genetic disorders. A novel clinical model for infants with rare genetic
      disorders has been created as a joint initiative between the Division of Newborn Medicine's
      NICU Growth and Developmental Support Programs (NICU GraDS) program and the Division of
      Genetics at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). This study plans to enroll patients with
      genetic syndromes seen in this clinic into a prospective, longitudinal study in order to
      characterize their developmental profiles and needs. Related factors such as quality of life
      and parental stress will also be assessed which will complement the evaluation of the role of
      a &quot;developmental home&quot; for these high risk infants. It is also hypothesized that gaps in care
      - mismatches between services received and services indicated based upon the developmental
      evaluation - will be identified. The results of this study will be used to inform future
      research efforts utilizing targeted approaches to improve developmental outcomes.

      For infants with rare genetic disorders, the aims are as follows:

      Aim 1: Characterize physical and psychosocial development using standardized longitudinal
      assessments.

      Aim 2: Identify developmental service needs, prescription, and utilization.

      Aim 3: Assess parental stress and health-related quality of life.
