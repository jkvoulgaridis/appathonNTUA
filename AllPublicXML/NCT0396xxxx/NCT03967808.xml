    <textblock>
      The Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) Registry was created in 2002 (after
      study pilot in 2001) to contribute to the development and evaluation of health strategies
      aiming at improving prevention and management of end-stage renal disease, and promoting
      clinical and epidemiological research in this field. It relies on a network of nephrologists,
      epidemiologists, patients and public health representatives, coordinated regionally and
      nationally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The REIN registry is intended to include all end stage renal disease patients on renal
      replacement therapy (RRT) - either dialysis or transplantation - living in Lorraine area.

      New (incident) patients are reported from the first day of RRT. Patients with a diagnosis of
      acute renal failure are excluded, i.e. those who recover all or some renal function within 45
      days or are considered as such by experts when they die before 45 days. Patients with
      pre-emptive grafts and those living with a functioning graft are identified from the
      transplant database.

      A set of basic items, including fixed and annually updateable items, was defined for all
      dialysis patients. Five types of events are reported to the registry on occurrence from the
      first day of any treatment: (1) renal transplantation, (2) changes in dialysis setting, (3)
      changes in type of dialysis, (4) transient recovery of renal function and (5) death.

      The participation rate of centres in Lorraine is 100%. A clinical research assistant visits
      every dialysis centre to verify the completeness of patient and event registration, by
      comparing reports to the registry with centre administration files.

      The REIN guide defines all items to be recorded, includes coding instructions, and serves as
      a standard for all participating regions.

      REIN consists of a partnership network and professionals whose Biomedicine Agency is the
      institutional support. The National level consists of a national coordination, a steering
      group and a scientific board. Regional level includes a Regional Steering Group led by
      nephrologist and epidemiological coordinators and an epidemiological unit.
