  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project rolls out combined innovative low-tech thermotherapy of Buruli ulcer (BU) with
      heat packs and WHO recommended wound management in a BU endemic district of Cameroon.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project translates available clinical research findings at the secondary health care
      level into clinical practice at the primary health care and community level. The string of
      previous work from the development of the BU thermotherapy-wound management-package to the
      proof of its efficacy provides all necessary procedures, tools and documents to immediately
      proceed into practical and integrated community application.

      Main objective:

      To determine in patients with early BU lesions the effectiveness and acceptability of
      thermotherapy treatment at health post and community level.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To monitor and evaluate clinical and biological responses to thermotherapy in patients
           receiving up to 8 weeks of thermotherapy

        2. To assess within 6 months after completion of heat treatment wound closure (&quot;primary
           cure&quot;) and/or absence of BU specific features in included patients according to WHO
           healing criteria

        3. To measure the BU recurrence rate in included patient within 12 months after completion
           of heat treatment' (&quot;definite cure&quot;).

        4. To assess the compliance rate of included patients

        5. To assess the withdrawal rate of included patients

        6. To assess the ability and comfort of health personnel to use the thermotherapy device
