  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a consequence of the increasing life expectancy hospitals are seeing a growing number of
      elderly patients undergoing elective surgery. These patients are likely to suffer from one or
      more chronic illnesses, malnutrition, reduced physical strength and mobility and sensory
      impairment. Age related loss of resilience in combination with these conditions often results
      in frailty. Frailty syndrome describes a reduction in weight, mobility and strength, as well
      as declining cognitive capacities and reduced performance in daily life activities. This
      decline in constitution is accompanied by an increased risk of complications and mortality in
      the period after surgery. Frail patients are generally admitted to hospital for a longer
      period and are readmitted more often.

      A multitude of studies has demonstrated that these risks can be significantly reduced by
      offering frail patients a prevention program prior to their surgery. These prevention
      programs are often referred to as prehabilitation and combine strength and cardiovascular
      training with breathing exercises. Despite the obvious benefits, prehabilitation programs are
      not yet commonly applied outside of research settings as they carry considerable costs and
      required additional skilled personnel.

      In response to the unmet need for a widely applicable, cost and personnel efficient
      prehabilitation program a home-based prehabilitation program has been designed. This
      prehabilitation allows patients to safely perform an individualised set of exercises without
      relying on a personal trainer or a training group. Efficiency and feasibility will be
      evaluated in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The average age of hospital patients has steadily increased with the demographic change of
      Germany's ageing population. In 2014, more than 27 million people living in Germany were
      older than 60 years and more than one third of this group had to undergo surgery within that
      year.

      A relevant proportion of this patient group has to be considered frail or pre-frail. Over a
      lifetime every individual experiences a physiological reduction of functional capacity across
      all organ systems resulting in frailty. Consequently, physical and psychological stress, such
      as a hospital stay and surgery cannot be readily compensated. Therefore, frailty is a highly
      predictive pre-operative risk factor for increased post-operative morbidly and mortality,
      prolonged hospital stay and loss of independence. Multiple studies have demonstrated
      post-operative outcome of frail patients can be drastically improved if these patients are
      identified prior to elective surgery and enrolled in a multimodal prehabilitation program.
      The core of prehabilitation is physical exercise next to nutritional and psychological
      support. The improvement of cardiovascular condition, ventilator capacity and muscle strength
      gained during prehabilitation resulted in a reduced incidence of complications including
      pneumonia, shorter hospital stays and improved quality of life. Yet despite these benefits
      prehabilitation is not yet widely available outside of clinical studies as they carry
      considerable costs and demand additional skilled personnel.

      In order to provide prehabilitation to a larger group of patients, a pre-operative exercise
      program was developed, that can safely be followed by pre-frail and frail patients at home
      without the need of continuous instruction and supervision by a trainer or physiotherapist.
      Efficacy and feasibility will be evaluated in this study.

    <intervention_model_description>This trail is designed as a prospective, multicentre, randomized controlled study with two parallel groups with a total of four arms. Patients with a scheduled elective surgery will be randomly assigned into treatment and control group after having been screened for frailty. A subgroup will be formed by patients who will receive a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The preventative effect of a behaviour modification will subsequently be compared.</intervention_model_description>
