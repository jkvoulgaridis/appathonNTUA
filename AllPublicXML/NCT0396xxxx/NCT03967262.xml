  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of alcohol and other drugs is one of the main risk factors for traumatism. In
      addition, patients who have suffered an accident in relation to the consumption of these
      substances present a high risk of recidivism. In the case of alcohol, its relationship with
      traumatisms has been known for many years now and is still one of the main risk factors.

      Secondary prevention is an important area of action and improvement in the treatment of this
      type of patient by considering actions, such as a brief motivational intervention, in order
      to avoid recidivism. The objective of motivational intervention is to make the patient aware
      of the relationship between the consumption of these substances and the accident, and induce
      them to carry out a change in habits.

      The objective of the present investigation project is to determine the efficacy of secondary
      prevention in reducing recurrence of traumatisms. In order to this, a multicenter randomised
      controlled trial has been designed in which the intervention group with patients admitted for
      sever traumatism with positive screening for alcohol or other drugs, will be submitted to a
      brief motivational intervention. The main outcome will be trauma recurrence within a three
      year follow-up.
