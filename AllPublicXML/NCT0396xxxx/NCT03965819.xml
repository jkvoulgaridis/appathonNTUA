  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study to investigate the
      efficacy of Pain Bloc-R in healthy participants with non-pathological aches and discomfort.
      The study will have 3 study periods. During each study period, eligible participants will
      consume either Pain Bloc-R, comparator product, or placebo for 7 days during each study
      period (1 product per study period), with a 1-week washout period in between each period. The
      primary objective is the comparison of change in unresolved aches and discomfort from
      pre-supplement to Day 7 between the Pain Bloc-R, comparator, and placebo, as assessed by the
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire.

    <measure>Comparison of change in unresolved aches and discomfort from pre-supplementation to Day 7 between Pain Bloc-R, comparator and placebo as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire developed by MD Anderson Cancer Centre is a discomfort assessment tool used to score an individual's level of discomfort severity and discomfort interference.
Part A of the questionnaire evaluates pain severity, asking the participants to rate their &quot;worst&quot;, &quot;least&quot;, &quot;average&quot; and &quot;right now&quot; (current) levels of pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).
Part B evaluates the pain interference levels, asking the participants to rate the impact of their pain on their general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life. Together, part A and part B aim to serve as a concise quantification tool for the pain levels and the participant's resulting quality of life. The questionnaire will be administered at each visit to monitor changes in participant's pain over the course of each phase.</description>

    <measure>Comparison between Pain Bloc-R formula, comparator, and placebo in the change in musculoskeletal discomfort (MD) from pre-supplementation to Day 7 post-supplementation as assessed by modified Cornell musculoskeletal discomfort questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (mCMDQ) tool is used to assess physical discomfort. The questionnaire includes a list of body parts with an image for visualization. The questionnaire assesses the discomfort frequency score, from &quot;never&quot; (Rating Score = 0), &quot;1-2 times/week&quot; (RS 1.5), &quot;3-4 times/week&quot; (RS 3.5), &quot;every day&quot; (RS 5) and &quot;several times a day&quot; (RS 10). The questionnaire assesses discomfort severity score, as &quot;slightly uncomfortable&quot; (RS 1), &quot;moderately uncomfortable&quot; (RS = 2) or &quot;very uncomfortable&quot; (RS 3). Finally, the questionnaire determines the discomfort interference score, as &quot;not at all&quot; (RS 1), &quot;slightly interfered&quot; (RS 2), or &quot;interfered a lot&quot; (RS 3). The total discomfort score is calculated by multiplying the individual frequency, severity and interference scores for each body part, and then summed to yield a total discomfort score.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire containing 7 questions regarding the participants satisfaction, tolerability, and feelings toward the study product. The product perception questionnaire will be scored from 5,4,3,2,1 for strongly agree, agree, no opinion, disagree, strongly disagree respectively on each question. Min and max scores for each question are 1 and 5. The total score of the 7 questions is the sum scores of each question with the min and max of 1 and 35. The higher score indicates better product perception for each question and total score.</description>
