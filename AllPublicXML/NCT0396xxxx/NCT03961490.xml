  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common rhythm disorder, affecting 2 to 3 percent of the
      population. One of the major complications is the occurrence of thromboembolic events, the
      thromboembolic risk can be predicted by the ChadsVasc score. Anticoagulant treatment is
      therefore almost always indicated, however, in view of the target population, anticoagulant
      treatment is sometimes contraindicated, justifying the appearance of alternative treatment
      such as occlusion of the left auricle by surgical or percutaneous means, with the placement
      of a prosthesis in the left auricle.

      Image fusion is a new imaging technique aimed at improving the spatial view of 2D images
      (made during a catheterization session) by repositioning in real time a 3D model obtained by
      reconstruction from scanner images of the structure of interest. Once the model has been
      redesigned, it follows all the consequences that the hemodynamicist wants to take and thus
      guides the gesture as well as possible.

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the contribution of image fusion to per cutaneous
      occlusion procedures of the left atrium. This contribution will be evaluated by comparing the
      procedure time, the irradiation time, the amount of contrast material used between the
      procedures performed with the image fusion technique and without this new technique.

        This is an elderly population with multiple co-morbidities (hypertension, renal failure,
        diabetes, etc.), with a major thromboembolic and haemorrhagic risk, and with a formal
        contraindication to anticoagulant therapy.
