  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the modern era, food access is widely available and it is not uncommon for the time
      between breakfast and a late night snack to exceed 14 hours. The investigators are interested
      in studying whether limiting this window to 8 hours will have any beneficial effects of human
      health as has been demonstrated in animal models. Eight men were asked to restrict their
      energy intake window to between 8 am and 4 pm for two weeks whilst maintaining their habitual
      diet (quantity and composition). Improvements in skeletal muscle and whole-body insulin
      sensitivity were observed but these were potentially confounded by an average weight loss of
      1 kg. Therefore an additional control group was recruited to follow a daily caloric deficit
      of ~400 kilocalories without changing the timing of intake.

      All participants were monitored for a one week baseline period to establish their habitual
      physical activity and dietary patterns. This was done using food diaries, interstitial
      glucose monitors and a combined heart rate + accelerometer device. Participants consumed a
      standardised evening meal ~12h before visiting the laboratory to assess their metabolic
      response to a liquid test meal (1g/kg bodyweight dextrose and 0.4g/kg bodyweight protein)
      using the arterio-venous forearm balance model. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans,
      indirect calorimetry measurements and fasted and postprandial vastus lateralis biopsies were
      also obtained.

      From the next day, participants either restricted their daily energy intake window to between
      8 am and 4 pm or were prescribed a caloric deficit diet (~400 kilocalories/day) for two
      weeks. Physical activity, interstitial glucose concentrations and dietary patterns were
      monitored throughout. After this, participants visited the laboratory again to assess changes
      in metabolism and body composition.

    <description>The investigators observed significant weight loss in the TRF group with participants reporting to consume ~400 kilocalories less per day. Therefore the investigators added a caloric deficit group to control for the effects of weight loss on metabolism. Total energy expenditure was measured for one week and was used to prescribe a 400 kilocalories/day energy deficit diet to follow for two weeks.</description>
