  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is performed to evaluate the outcome of conservative treatment after distal radius
      fractures in patients of 65 years or older at the time of the injury, primarily with respect
      to the prognostic value of the Adolfsson-score for the functional demands of the patient on
      his hand.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adolfsson score</measure>
    <time_frame>single time point assessment at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Adolfsson-Score quantifies the patient`s utility of the Hand; 8-point scale ranging from 1 = no activity done using hand/arm to 8 = professional activity with high physical stress for the arm. Lower scores reflect fewer effort in using arm/Hand; higher scores reflect higher strain in using arm/hand</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suhm Score</measure>
    <time_frame>single time point assessment at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Suhm Score quantifies the independency of a patient in his daily life. 4-point scale ranging from 1 = living at home, independent to 4 = living in nursing home, dependency. Lower scores reflect high independency of a patient in his daily life; higher scores reflect higher dependency of a patient in his daily life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score</measure>
    <time_frame>single time point assessment at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Quick DASH score is a 11-item, self-report questionnaire that measures physical function and symptoms in people with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The QuickDASH is scored in two components: the disability/symptom section (11 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high performance sport/Music or work modules (4 items, scored 1-5). A higher score indicates greater disability.</description>
