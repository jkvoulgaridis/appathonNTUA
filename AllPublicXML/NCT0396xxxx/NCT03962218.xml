    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study: To analyse the effectiveness of aquatic physiotherapy on spinal cord
      injuries (LMi) in the improvement of balance and gait, in the inflammatory profile, and the
      impact on the quality of life.

      Main objective: To analyse if there are differences in the recovery of the balance, in
      incomplete subacute spinal cord injuries, with lesion level T1-L5 and ASIA (American Spinal
      Injury Association) C and D .

      Secondary objectives:

        1. functional gait

        2. To evaluate if the time from the injury to the start of the aquatic therapy influences
           the results on balance and functional gait.

        3. To study the effect of aquatic therapy on serum markers of systemic inflammation.

        4. Quality of life related to health. Design: Crossed, controlled and randomized clinical
           trial, with blind evaluation of the response variables.

      Scope of the study: National Hospital of Paraplegics. Toledo (Spain). Population: Subjects
      with incomplete spinal cord injury ASIA C and D. n = 50 (25 in each arm randomly).

      Intervention:

      6 weeks of specific Aquatic Physiotherapy (3 times a week). Group 1 will perform aquatic
      physiotherapy at the time of entering the study, and group 2 will perform it 6 weeks later.

      Outcomes: Static and dynamic balance (Berg test and Time Up and Go). Speed of the gait (test
      of 10 m.). Gait resistance (6 min. Test). Functional capacity of the gait (WISCI II).
      Biomechanical analysis (sensorial-dynamic, rhythmic and directional control, and gait test)
      by posturography. Questionnaires EuroQol-5Dimensions-5Level (EQ-5D-5L) and the Spanish
      Version of the Quality of Life Index (SV-QLI) in spinal cord injury (SCI).

      Biomarkers of inflammation: 20 cytokines. Analysis of results: The main outcome measure will
      be the percentage of patients who have improved. Considering improvement when the difference
      between the groups is, at least, a 10% of their score in the Berg test between V0 and V1
      (with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals). It will be adjusted for confounding and
      interaction factors with a multivariate analysis using logistic regression. All analyses will
      be performed according to the intention to treat principle.

    <description>Measures through the Questionnaire EuroQol-5D-5L. The questionnaire comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension is scored in 5 levels, 1-5 (level 1-no problem, level 5,-extreme problems). Based on the answers, a index value from 0 to 1 is calculated (0-the worst quality of life, 1-the best quality of life).</description>

    <description>Measured through the questionnaire &quot;Spanish version of the Quality of Life Index in spinal cord injury (SV-QLI / SCI)&quot;. The questionnaire evaluates 37 items, in a scale from 1 (less satisfied) to 6 (most satisfied). There are 5 scores of 0-30 (0=less satisfied, 30=most satisfied) which are calculated using the subscales: 1-Total Quality of Life score. 2-Health and Functioning Subscale. 3-Social and Economic Subscale. 4-Psychological /Spiritual Subscale. 5-Family Subscale. The final score is an average of the subscale's scores, being between 0 (0=less satisfied) and 30 (30=most satisfied).</description>
