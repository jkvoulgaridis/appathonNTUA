  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to objectively assess if interactive multimedia
      tutorials (online videos) enhances patients' comprehensive understanding of assisted
      reproductive technology (ART) adding EngagedMD, an online library of interactive videos,
      compared to the traditional process of consent and one-on-one teaching using a 15 question
      evaluation. The secondary outcome will be to qualitatively assess patients' overall
      experience of the teaching process comparing the addition of the EngagedMD content to solely
      traditional teaching for infertility treatment.

      Participants: This will be a multi-center trial with each center planning on recruiting 100
      couples. Half of the couples will be planning on undergoing ovulation induction with
      insemination (OI/IUI) and the other half in-vitro fertilization (IVF).

      Procedures (methods): This is a multi-center prospective randomized controlled trial where
      couples undergoing OI/IUI or IVF will be randomized to receiving the current traditional
      standard of in-person treatment teaching by their physician and nursing team with standard
      paper consents or to the identical process of in-person teaching with the addition of
      unrestricted access to the EngagedMD online video resource platform with online consents.

      Patient demographics, knowledge base, psychological impact of with the treatment, teaching
      and the consent process and overall satisfaction with the process as a whole will be assessed
      using surveys administered at three time points throughout the treatment process. A subset of
      patients that agree will be contacted after the completion of the treatment cycle for a live
      phone interview.

    <description>Patient understanding of infertility diagnoses and treatment by use of a pre and post test. The test comprises of 15 multiple choice questions and the patients will receive a score of 0-15 and this will be compared as a paired continuous variable from the pre-test score to their post-test score as well as an un-paired continuous variable between the conventional group and the EngagedMD group for pre- and post-test scores as well as delta scores between the two.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be followed for one treatment cycle, or approximately 2-4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with their infertility treatment and consent processes will be assessed using questionnaires using a 5 point Likert scale progressing from very unsatisfied to very satisfied across a number of questions. The 5 point Likert questions will be assigned a value of 1-5 (with 1 being very unsatisfied and 5 being very satisfied) and will be assessed as a sum of points from the individual questions and compared as continuous variables between the conventional arm and the EngagedMD arm. There is an additional question asking patients to rank their satisfaction on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 being not satisfied at all and 10 being extremely satisfied) which will be used independently as a measure of patient satisfaction overall.</description>
