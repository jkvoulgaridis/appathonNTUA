  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Skin grafting; both partial and complete thickness is frequently used in
      reconstruction of traumatic soft tissue defects. It is of great value not only for functional
      and aesthetic purposes in the field of plastic surgery, but also for other surgical
      specialties.

      Of all the problems in the early postoperative period, pain is considered the most important,
      ameliorating it can lead to significant reduction in postoperative morbidity and faster
      recovery of the skin donor site.

      Objective: To evaluate use of dexamethasone as adjuvant for bupivacaine in subcutaneous local
      anesthesia infiltration for skin graft donor sites, on quality of pain relief and total dose
      of analgesic requirements in the early hours postoperatively.

      Methods: 97 patients were randomly allocated to receive local bupivacaine infiltration (group
      LB), or dexamethasone plus bupivacaine (group LB + D) in skin donor site after skin
      harvesting. In addition to basic demographic data; patients were compared for Numerical
      Rating Scale (NRS), total dose of morphine or morphine equivalents, time to 1st breakthrough
      pain, and duration of surgery.

      The patients included in the study were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 parallel groups: 1)
      bupivacaine plus dexamethasone (LB+D) group (n = 50): received 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% + 18 ml
      normal saline + 8 mg dexamethasone 2 ml, 2) bupivacaine only (LB) group (n = 50): received 20
      ml bupivacaine 0.5% + 20 ml normal saline. A random allocation sequence was generated
      electronically using online randomization service from https://www.random.org. The project
      medicine was prepared by 2 independent assistants not involved in other parts of the study.
      All persons involved were blinded to the randomized allocation.
