  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine a dose of moxidectin for children 4 to 11
      years that is equivalent to an 8 mg dose administered for treatment of onchocerciasis in
      people 12 years and over.

    <intervention_model_description>Prospective, age-stratified, adaptive, open-label, single-dose study with 3, age-defined cohorts. Cohort 1 (12 to 17 years, n = 9) and Cohort 2 (8 to 11 years, n = 9) will receive moxidectin 8 mg. Cohort 3 (4 to 7 years, n = 9) will receive moxidectin at a dose to be determined from safety and pharmacokinetic data analyses of Cohorts 1 and 2.
If the starting dose for Cohorts 2 and 3 results in at least 3 subjects with moxidectin exposures above the target range, a revised dose will be determined in decrements of 2 mg and the Cohort(s) will be repeated with at least 9 new subjects. For Cohort 3, if the starting dose results in at least 3 subjects with moxidectin exposures below the target range, a revised dose will be determined in increments of 2 mg to a maximum dose of 8 mg.Therefore, it is expected that the study will enroll 27 subjects. However, if additional cohorts are required to meet pharmacokinetic outcomes, up to a maximum of 63 subjects may be enrolled.</intervention_model_description>
