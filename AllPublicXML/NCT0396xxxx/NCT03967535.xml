  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Washington University Early Recognition Center is conducting a research study to examine
      brain functional connectivity and network patterns in participants with dementia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study extends the assessment of brain connectivity and function, being conducted in the
      Human Connectome Project (HCP), to psychiatrically ill populations. The HCP consortium has
      made significant improvements in MRI instrumentation, data acquisition, preprocessing, and
      analysis. These improvements are currently providing publicly available data on the
      structure, function, and connectivity of young adult human (age 22-35) brains at
      unprecedented spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy. This study will focus on
      individuals aged 45-85 years who have a diagnosis of dementia, or are healthy controls.
      Additionally, similar to the HCP, the investigator will study the effect of genetics on the
      patterns of brain connectivity in various psychiatric populations. DNA will be collected
      non-invasively from saliva. Furthermore, this investigator will study cortisol levels in hair
      samples as an additional assessment to help characterize brain imagining findings.

    <description>The current project aims to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical characteristics. The investigator will use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to identify brain signatures that cut across psychiatric disorders.</description>

    <description>Saliva samples will be collected from participants for DNA extraction and the development of lymphoblastoid cell lines. DNA is used for research purposes only, for studies assessing brain connectivity.</description>
