  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gut-derived endotoxaemia, microbial imbalance and bacterial translocation play an
      increasingly recognized role in the progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD) to its more advanced state, NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). Animal model
      studies confirmed that Yaq-001 reduces liver injury and prevents steatosis in these models
      which leads to the theoretical potential of Yaq-001 altering the microbiome and gut
      permeability in patients with NASH.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the safety and tolerability of Yaq-001 in
      patients with NASH. Results from this study will lead to the design of future pivotal
      performance and safety trials for registration purposes.

      Candidate patients must be between 18-70 years old and have a clinical diagnosis of NASH,
      determined histologically or phenotypically, as well as meeting other clinical
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive standard of care treatment plus
      Yaq-001, or standard of care treatment plus placebo).

      The treatment lasts for 48 weeks. During treatment, the patient will have 6 study visits. At
      all the visits, the patients will undergo a routine physical examination, electrocardiogram,
      collection of blood and urine samples. On three occasions the patients will be asked to
      provide additional samples of blood, urine and stool for analysis outside the hospital. On
      two occasions the patient will have a liver Multiscan and on three occasions the patient will
      have a liver Fibroscan.

      70 patients from 9 hospitals in UK, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland will
      participate in this study.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial to intended to
      evaluate safety and tolerability of oral administration of Yaq-001 therapy.

      70 Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis patients will be randomized (1:1) to:

        -  Standard medical treatment + Yaq-001 (8 g/ day) - n= 35

        -  Standard medical treatment + placebo-control (placebo for 8 g of Yaq-001/ day) - n= 35

      Study patients will be dosed daily with Yaq-001 (or an equivalent quantity of placebo) for 48
      weeks.

      Assessment of DSMB will take place when 15 Yaq-001- and 15 placebo-treated patients have
      completed 12 weeks of dosing.

      Investigational centres specialized in the management of patients with Non-Alcoholic
      Steatohepatitis will participate in the study.

      For each patient, the study duration will be up to 54 weeks, including the screening (up to
      45 days), treatment (48 weeks) and 7-day follow up period.

      The total study duration is estimated to be approximately 18 months from screening of first
      patient until study completion of the last patient.

      This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and
      innovation programme.
