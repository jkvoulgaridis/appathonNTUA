    <textblock>
      Our study used a randomized controlled trial to validate the clinical efficacy of a
      combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of children with
      rapid progressive central precocious puberty.

    <textblock>
      In the research, 164 subjects diagnosed with rapid progressive idiopathic precocious puberty
      are randomly divided into Group Ziyinxiehuo Granules and Megestrol Acetate Tablet（82
      cases）and Group Gonadotrophin ( 82 cases). Patients in Group Ziyinxiehuo Granules and
      Megestrol Acetate Tablet are treated with ziyinxiehuo Granules and megestrol acetate tablet ,
      whereas the Group Gonadotrophin received with gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist, and
      all the subjects in two groups are continuously treated for 6 months.
