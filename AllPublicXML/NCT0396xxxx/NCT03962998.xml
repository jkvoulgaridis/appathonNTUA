  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral
      administration of MB-102, and to evaluate the use of MB-102 as a means of measuring gut
      permeability in normal participants (n=10) and in those with radiologic evidence of small
      bowel Crohn's disease (n=10).

      This study is a single center, randomized, open label, cross-over study evaluating MB-102
      versus dual sugar testing using lactulose and rhamnose for the assessment of gut
      permeability. Participants will be screened within 30 days of Day 1, and eligible
      participants will be randomized to receive either an oral dose of MB-102 or the dual sugar
      test on Day 1. At a second study visit occurring between 3 to 7 days after completion of the
      first test, participants will return to the study center for the second test. Following
      completion of the second test, participants will return to the study center 7 ±3 days for a
      follow-up visit to evaluate safety.

    <description>For MB-102 excretion evaluation, urine samples will be collected pre-dose (time 0), each time the participant voids, and at the protocol-defined time points after oral administration of MB-102. The total volume of urine excreted will be recorded. Urine samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods. For the dual sugar test, participants will consume a 10 mL solution (1000 mg of lactulose and 200 mg of rhamnose). Urine will be collected pre-dose (time 0), each time the participant voids, and at the protocol-defined time points after consuming the sugar solution. The total volume of urine excreted will be recorded. Urine samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods.</description>
