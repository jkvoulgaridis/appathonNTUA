  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent girls in developing countries face high rates of adversity and are at an elevated
      risk of depression and other forms of psychological distress. Untreated depression can have
      negative consequences on life outcomes such as early pregnancies, social exclusion and school
      dropout. These can result in a cycle of poverty for young women and their families. Despite
      this being a very pressing problem there is little evidence on what types of interventions
      can help break the vicious cycle of poor mental health and poverty.

      This research program aims to evaluate, through the use of a cluster-Randomized Control Trial
      (cluster- RCT), the effect of group-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-G) and
      unconditional cash transfers on adolescent girls' mental health and social functioning.
      Working with Strong Minds Uganda in collaboration with BRAC Uganda's Empowerment and
      Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) clubs, the evidence generated from this research will create
      a better understanding of whether adolescent mental health improves through this
      cost-effective approach, and whether improved mental health impacts other outcomes of
      interest.

    <description>14 weeks of group-based interpersonal therapy (IPT-G): StrongMinds is focused on treating depression in Uganda by training community members (in this case ELA club mentors) to act as mentors in IPT-G techniques. This intervention will be offered to 13-19 year old young women who score a 10 or higher on the PHQ-8. These adolescents who take up the offer will then be enrolled in the 14 weeks of therapy. Group therapy sessions build bonds between young women and encourage them to actively engage in the healing process and to support each other in the exploration of their depression triggers. With new healthier patterns and skills, women can learn to manage their current depression and ensure future depressive episodes can be quickly identified and resolved before the onset of any long-term consequences.</description>
