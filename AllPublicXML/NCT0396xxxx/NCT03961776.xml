        The study population consists of men and / or women over 18 years of age, with no upper
        limit age, with histologically confirmed non-metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma and for whom
        treatment with nRCT has been indicated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient over 18 years old.

          2. Diagnosis of histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma for which nRCT has been
             indicated.

          3. Karnofsky Index (KPS) â‰¥ 70 or ECOG = 0 or 1

          4. Signed consent to participation.

          5. For women of childbearing age, effective contraception must also be agreed for the
             duration of treatment.

          6. Affiliation to a social security regimen, or beneficiary of such a regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Predominant mucinous component on initial MRI, biopsy and / or definitive pathology.
             Mucin may lead to overestimation of ADC values on DWIs.

          2. Contraindications to the MRI procedure (non compatible pacemaker or other metallic
             foreign body, severe claustrophobia).

          3. Exclusive radiation therapy.

          4. Other associated neo-adjuvant treatment.

          5. Delayed completion of the surgery (more than approximately 10 weeks after the end of
             the nRCT) or cancellation of the surgical procedure.

          6. Contraindications to capecitabine: Severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment
             (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml / min),

          7. Known deficiency of Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), known hypersensitivity to
             5-FU / capecitabine and / or its excipients.

          8. Participation in a protocol with concurrent treatment.

          9. Pregnant or likely to be pregnant (without effective contraception) or breastfeeding

         10. Person in emergency situation, person of legal age subject to a legal protection
             measure, or unable to express his / her consent.

         11. Impossibility of attending the medical examination of the test for geographical,
             social or psychological reasons.
