      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of roxadustat pediatric
      azo dye-free tablet and roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free mini-tablet (solid and suspension)
      (new formulations) compared to roxadustat azo dye-containing tablet (reference formulation)
      in healthy male and female adult subjects.

      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of roxadustat pediatric azo
      dye-free tablet and roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free mini-tablet (solid and suspension) (new
      formulations) and roxadustat azo dye-containing tablet (reference formulation) in healthy
      male and female adult subjects.

    <textblock>
      This is a 4-period, 4-sequence single dose crossover study. Each participant will participate
      in 4 treatment periods separated by a washout of at least 7 days between study drug
      administrations in each period. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 sequences.

      Participants will be screened for up to 21 days prior to study drug administration on day 1
      of period 1. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 of each
      period and will be residential for 5 days/4 nights.

      Participants will receive a single dose of roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free tablet,
      roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free mini-tablet (suspension), roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free
      mini-tablet (solid) (new formulations) or roxadustat azo dye-containing tablet (reference
      formulation) under fasting conditions on day 1 of each period.
