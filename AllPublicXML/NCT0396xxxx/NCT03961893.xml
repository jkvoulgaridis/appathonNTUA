  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard for colorectal cancer prevention by allowing the resection
      of superficial colorectal adenomas or adenocarcinomas. This protection, more effective in the
      left colon than in the right colon, is imperfect and there are some adenomas and cancers
      omitted during colonoscopy. The G-EYE colonoscope equipped with an integrated distal balloon
      would better unfold the haustrations and stabilize the endoscope. Thus, the detection rate of
      adenomas would be improved by this better vision. The main objective of this study is to
      confirm that the use of the G-EYE colonoscope allows better detection of adenomatous polyps,
      decrease the rate of omitted adenomes and then is more effective.
