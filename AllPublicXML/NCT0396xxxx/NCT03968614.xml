  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare two different approaches for treating patients
      with achilles tendinopathy: eccentric exercise, stretching and manual therapy VS Electric dry
      needling, eccentric exercise, stretching and manual therapy. Physical therapists commonly use
      all of these techniques to treat achilles tendinopathy. This study is attempting to find out
      if one treatment strategy is more effective than the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with achilles tendinopathy will be randomized to receive 8-10 treatments (1-2
      treatments per week) over 6 weeks (10 treatments max) of either: (1)Eccentric exercise,
      stretching, manual therapy and electrical dry needling or 2. eccentric exercise, stretching
      and manual therapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult &gt;18 years old that is able to speak English.

          2. Report of at least 3 months of Achilles pain clinically diagnosed as Achilles
             tendonitis or Achilles tendinopathy

          3. Patient has not had physical therapy, massage therapy, chiropractic treatment or
             injections for Achilles pain in the last 6 months:

          4. Diagnosis of noninsertional tendinopathy, defined as the following

               -  Subjective report of pain located 2-6 cm proximal to the insertion of Achilles
                  tendon to the calcaneus, particularly with running or jumping

               -  Tenderness to palpation of the Achilles tendon while the clinician gently
                  squeezes the tendon between the thumb and index finger in a proximal to distal
                  direction

               -  Positive Arc Sign - Intratendinous swelling moves relative to the malleoli with
                  the tendon during active dorsi/plantar Flexion

               -  Royal London Test - Tenderness to palpation decreases significantly or disappears
                  with max dorsiflexion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Report of red flags to manual physical therapy to include: hypertension infection,
             diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, heart disease, stroke, chronic ischemia, edema,
             severe vascular disease, malignancy, etc.

          2. History of previous Achilles tendon surgery, ankle arthrodesis, hind foot fracture, or
             leg length discrepancy of more than one half inch.

          3. History of arthrosis or arthritis of the ankle and/or foot.

          4. History of significant ankle and/or foot instability

          5. Two or more positive neurologic signs consistent with nerve root compression,
             including any two of the following:

               1. Muscle weakness involving a major lower extremity muscle group

               2. Diminished lower extremity patella or Achilles tendon reflexes

               3. Diminished / absent sensation in any lower extremity dermatome

          6. Involvement in litigation or worker's compensation regarding foot pain

          7. Any condition that might contraindicate the use of electro-needling

          8. The patient is pregnant.
