  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to establish the value of circulating microparticles as a new
      biomarker for neurological prognosis of patients recovered from sudden cardiac death who
      remain comatose.

      This is a pilot study. Analytical, observational, longitudinal, retrospective and
      prospective, non-randomized. Patients recovered from sudden cardiac death of ischemic cause
      and remain comatose will be included in the protocol if they fit the pre-specified inclusion
      criteria. Biological samples will be collected (at admission, at 24 and 72 hours) and stored
      in the Biobank of Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau for further analysis. In addition
      demographic, clinical and analytical variables will be collected. At the end of the
      recruitment period, we will analyse the concentrations of circulating microparticles
      according to ICCC-IIBSantPau methodology in the samples obtained. The primary outcome
      variable will be the neurological status at Coronary Care Unit discharge and at 6 months. The
      objective of the study will evaluate the relationship between the neurological status and the
      blood concentrations of circulating microparticles.

    <measure>Change in Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories Scale for neurological outcome.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories Scale at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Good cerebral performance: conscious, alert, able to work, might have mild neurologic or psychologic deficit.
Moderate cerebral disability: conscious, sufficient cerebral function for independent activities of daily life. Able to work in sheltered environment.
Severe cerebral disability: conscious, dependent on others for daily support because of impaired brain function. Ranges from ambulatory state to severe dementia or paralysis.
Coma or vegetative state: any degree of coma without the presence of all brain death criteria. Unawareness, even if appears awake (vegetative state) without interaction with environment; may have spontaneous eye opening and sleep/awake cycles. Cerebral unresponsiveness.
Brain death: apnea, areflexia, EEG silence, etc.</description>

    <description>The microparticles contained in the blood sample will be isolated by ultracentrifugation and quantified by flow cytometry. The microparticles concentration will be determined by the number of microparticles per uL of plasma, based on the volume of the sample, the flow rate of the cytometer and the number of fluorescent events.</description>

      Blood samples from patients enrolled in the study will be collected at admission, at 24 and
      at 72 hours. Blood collection will be obtained from arterial access whenever possible
      (otherwise preferably central or peripheral venous lines will be used without using
      tourniquet) and stored in tubes sodium citrate 3.8 %. Immediately after blood collection, the
      proteolipid protein fraction will be obtained by centrifugation fraction. To do this ,
      samples will be centrifuged twice to exclude any cell rest. The aliquots obtained will be
      frozen first with liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80째C in the Biobank IIB Sant Pau until
      further analysis.

        We will include patients who have suffered a sudden cardiac death of ischemic cause
        admitted to the Coronary Care Unit of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona
        from the date of commencement of the study. The sample will be retrospectively completed
        with patients of the same features admitted to the unit since January 2012 and who have
        biological samples stored in the Biobank of Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau.

             the Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;8 ) for &gt; 5-10 minutes after ROSC.

          -  Treated with hypothermia as recommended by the European guidelines for resuscitation (
