  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment of
      malignant hematopoietic diseases. However, poor hematopoietic reconstitution including poor
      graft function (PGF) and prolonged isolated thrombocytopenia (PT), remains a life-threatening
      complication after allo-HSCT. Especially with the increasing use of haploidentical allo-HSCT
      (haplo-HSCT) in the past ten years, PGF and PT have become growing obstacles contributing to
      high morbidity and mortality after allo-HSCT. Due to the limited mechanism studies, the
      clinical management of PGF and PT is challenging.

      Recent prospective case-control studies reported that the reduced and dysfunctional bone
      marrow (BM) endothelial cells (ECs) after allo-HSCT are involved in the pathogenesis of PGF
      and PT. Moreover, in vitro treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could enhance the
      defective hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function through repairing the dysfunctional BM ECs
      of PGF and PT patients. The investigators performed a small-scale pilot cohort study and saw
      encouraging clinical results that oral administration with NAC could partially repair the
      dysfunctional BM ECs and improve megakaryocytopoiesis in PT patients, which suggests that NAC
      is a promising drug in PT patients after allo-HSCT. In addition, prior prospective trial of
      the investigators suggests that BM ECs&lt;0.1% pre-HSCT is the risk factor for occurrence of the
      PGF and PT two months following allo-HSCT. Previous single-arm clinical cohort studies of the
      investigators showed that prophylactic use of NAC before allo-HSCT reduced the incidence of
      poor hematopoietic reconstitution after allo-HSCT in patients with ECs &lt;0.1% pre-HSCT.

      Therefore, the investigators designed the study with acute leukemia patients who will be
      scheduled to receive haplo-HSCT. The patients who are in the first complete remission at time
      of haplo-transplant will be enrolled in the study. Exclusive criteria are bronchila asthma
      and NAC allergy. The enrolled patients were risk-stratified into BM ECs≥0.1% group (low-risk
      group) and BM ECs&lt;0.1% group (high-risk group). Patients in high-risk group (ECs&lt;0.1%) will
      be randomized to 1 of 2 arms: (a) NAC 400 mg three times per day from 14 days pre-HSCT to 2
      months post-HSCT, (b) No-NAC concurrent control according to a 2:1 schedule. The aim of the
      trail is to assess the effects of NAC for prevention of poor hematopoietic reconstitution in
      patients with acute leukemia undergoing haplo-HSCT.

      This study is designed as a phase III, open-label, randomized study assessing the safety and
      efficacy of NAC (400 mg, orally, three times daily) versus no-NAC control for prevention of
      poor hematopoietic reconstitution in patients with acute leukemia undergoing haploidentical
      HSCT in a 2:1 ratio. The study will consist of three phases: a pre-randomization phase, a
      treatment phase, and an observational follow-up phase.

      The screening period: Patients will be screened during a 1 week screening period prior to
      entering the trial to allow for the collection of BM samples to evaluate the quantity and
      function of BM ECs at 21-14 days before HSCT. The enrolled patients were risk-stratified into
      BM ECs≥0.1% group (low-risk group) and BM ECs&lt;0.1% group (high-risk group). Approximately 126
      patients with BM EC &lt;0.1% at day-14 pre-HSCT (84 patients in NAC treatment arm and 42
      patients in control arm) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 arms: (a) NAC 400 mg
      three times per day, (b) No-NAC concurrent control.

      The treatment phase: Study medication will be administered orally, 400 mg three times daily
      from -14 days pre-HSCT to +2 months post-HSCT. All patients should continue their pre study
      dose of NAC throughout trial participation. Following randomization, patients will have 3
      hospitalized or at-clinic trial visits at day 0 before-HSCT and 1, 2 months post-HSCT to
      evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability and compliance with study medication. Patients will
      be contacted by trial site staff on a monthly basis between visits beginning with day 0.

      The observational follow-up phase: Upon completion of the trial participation phase all
      eligible patients will enter an open label follow-up phase. Clinic visits will occur every 3
      months (± 1 week).

      Patients will have a pretreatment bone marrow aspiration conducted and have a follow up bone
      marrow aspiration conducted at day0 before-HSCT and 1, and 2 months post-HSCT. All patients
      who complete or discontinue from the trial, for any reason, will have a follow up visit, 4
      weeks after their last dose of study medication. The primary outcome is the incidence of PGF
      and PT at 2 months after HSCT, as well as the safety. Secondary endpoints included cumulative
      incidences of relapse (CIR), acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), non-relapse mortality
      (NRM), overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), the related laboratory evaluation
      of ECs and HSC in BM microenvironment, etc.
