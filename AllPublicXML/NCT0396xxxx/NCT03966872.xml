  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 600 people with serious mental illness who receive services at
      Centerstone in KY or TN and will compare two different evidence-based self-management
      interventions: Integrated Illness Management and Recovery (I-IMR), a program developed by the
      study team at Dartmouth that trains people with serious mental illness on physical and mental
      health self-management, and the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP), a
      program largely focused on physical health self-management that has been used widely in the
      general population.

      The proposed study will be the first to compare two commonly used but substantially
      different, evidence-based self-management interventions. Integrated Illness Management and
      Recovery (I-IMR), is an individually-tailored, 16-session, integrated program combining both
      physical and mental health self-management specifically developed for people with SMI. In
      contrast, the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) is a group-based,
      6-session, chronic disease self-management program largely focused on physical health
      self-management alone. I-IMR is delivered by community mental health providers or by
      community outreach workers, while CDSMP is co-delivered by two peers or by a health
      professional and a peer. Both programs have been widely recommended, disseminated, and used.
      The proposed study will randomize people with serious mental illness to I-IMR (n=300) and
      CDSMP (n=300).
