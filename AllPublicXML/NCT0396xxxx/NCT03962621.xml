  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Facial aging is a progressive, multifactor-induced and multidimensional process which is
           naturally irreversible. The prominent clinical features of skin aging include loss of
           volume, pigmentation irregularity, low light reflectance, static and dynamic wrinkles,
           etc.

        2. The development of superpulsed CO2 and Erbium: YAG 2940 nm resurfacing lasers was
           considered as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the treatment of facial aging [8,9]. However, many
           drawbacks including intraoperative pain, post procedural erythema, edema, high risk of
           changes of pigmentation and long downtime have drawn concerns to patients and
           practitioners. Therefore, the facial rejuvenation therapies based on combined modalities
           to target various factors simutaneously have raised more and more interests.

        3. The Fotona 4D laser platform incorporates the long pulsed 1064 nm and 2940 nm lasers,
           which provides versatile modalities to target various skin aging problems
           simultaneously. The 1064 nm laser can penetrate deep into the skin to explode pigment
           particles, destroy blood vessels and heat the dermal collagen by targeting melanin and
           haemoglobin. The 2940 nm Er:YAG laser in Fotona 4D system integrates a non-ablative
           Smooth® mode and cold peel SupErficial™ mode. the half-face treated by a 2940 nm laser
           alone showed a significant improvement on indexes of skin wrinkles, texture, pores and
           elasticity as compared to the baseline.
