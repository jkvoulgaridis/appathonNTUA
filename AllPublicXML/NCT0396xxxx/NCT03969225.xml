  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A functioning vascular access provides a lifeline for patients requiring haemodialysis but
      vascular access dysfunction remains one of the leading causes of excessive morbidity,
      mortality and healthcare costs in this group. Despite increasing numbers of vascular access
      trials, successful interventions to improve vascular access function have been sparse and
      compromised by highly variable, often selectively reported outcome measures of limited
      relevance to patients and health professionals. Through engagement of all relevant
      stakeholders including patients and caregivers, vascular access function, defined by the need
      for interventions to enable and maintain the use of a vascular access for haemodialysis, has
      been identified as one of the most critically important outcome measures for trials in
      haemodialysis. This prospective, multi-centre, multinational validation study aims to assess
      the accuracy and feasibility of measuring vascular access function part of routine clinical
      practice and across different clinical settings to ensure successful global implementation of
      this core outcome measure in future trials in haemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haemodialysis is the most common treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease
      worldwide and can only be provided via a functional vascular access. Patients, caregivers and
      health professionals consider vascular access function one of the most critically important
      outcomes in haemodialysis but trial-based evidence to improve vascular access function is
      limited by the inconsistent and selective reporting of this outcome. Reporting of a
      standardised outcome measure for vascular access function across all trials in haemodialysis
      will enhance the consistency and relevance of trial evidence to guide patient-centred care.
      Based on international contribution of all relevant stakeholders including patients, the need
      of interventions to enable and maintain the use of a vascular access for haemodialysis was
      considered a simple, pragmatic, and meaningful measure of vascular access function. To ensure
      global implementation across all trial in haemodialysis, it needs to be feasible to
      accurately collect this outcome measure as part of routine clinical practice without
      requiring additional resources or expertise in vascular access.

      VALID is a prospective, multi-centre, multinational validation study to assess the accuracy
      and feasibility of measuring vascular access function, defined by the need for interventions
      to enable and maintain the use of a vascular access for haemodialysis by clinical staff as
      part of their routing clinical practice and across different clinical settings.

      The primary objective of the VALID study is to determine whether vascular access function can
      be measured accurately by clinical staff as part of routine clinical practice compared to the
      reference standard of a research team with expertise in vascular access during a 6-month
      follow-up period.

      An estimated 612 participants will be recruited from approximately 10 dialysis units of
      difference size, type (home-, in-centre and satellite), governance (private versus public),
      and location (rural versus urban) across Australia, Canada, China, France, United Kingdom,
      Netherlands, Malaysia and the United States of America (USA).

      Implementation of a validated outcome measure for vascular access function across clinical
      trials will improve the reliability, comparability and relevance of future research in
      haemodialysis to inform patient-centred care.

        All patients receiving chronic haemodialysis in the participating unit and who are able and
        willing to provide informed consent, will be invited to take part in the trial. Patients
        who are expected to require haemodialysis for less than 3 months due to anticipated
        recovery of renal function will be excluded. The eligibility criteria are deliberately kept
        broad to reflect routine clinical practice (i.e. not excluding non-English speaking
        patients) and avoid selection bias within participating units. Paediatric patients are
        excluded because vascular access outcomes were not considered a core outcome domain for
        research in paediatric patients with chronic kidney disease as established by the SONG-Kids
        initiative involving children, adolescence, their family members, and health professionals.
