    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open label, parallel, 16-week study to explore and
      evaluate the therapeutic effects of liraglutid, dapagliflozin and acarbose on the cognitive
      function, olfactory function, and odor-induced brain activation in overweight/obese patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

      This is a prospective, randomized, open label, parallel, 16-week study to explore and
      evaluate the therapeutic effects of liraglutid, dapagliflozin and acarbose on the cognitive
      function, olfactory function, and odor-induced brain activation in overweight/obese patients
      with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.We have 1 principle
      investigator, 6 sub-investigators and 1 nurse in research centre. The sub-investigators will
      screen in the outpatient and inpatient departments to enroll 87 patients (29 for each arm)
      totally with the inclusion and exclusion criteria in 12 months. The patients will be
      randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio into liraglutid, dapagliflozin and acarbose treatment group with
      a computer-generated random order. All patients will also continue on their existing dose and
      regimen of metformin throughout the study. At the baseline, clinical information collection,
      100g-steamed bread meal test, biochemical measurement, body composition analysis, cognitive
      assessment, olfactory test and functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) scan will be
      conducted for all patients. During the treatment period, visits at 4-week intervals will be
      performed to evaluate the safety of drugs and adjust the dose of metformin if hypoglycaemia
      occurs; meanwhile, fasting and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose assayed by fingerstick,
      physical examination, and olfactory test will be conducted. At the end of the study, all of
      the assessments will be performed again for all recruited subjects, including early
      withdrawal patients.

    <description>Compare the change of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA, beijing version) from baseline to 16 weeks' follow-up.

    <description>The olfactory threshold test (score range 1-13.5) is determined based on a series of binary dilutions of the N-butanol solution in light mineral oil. The higher the score is, the more sensitive the participant is in detecting an odor. Scores of 8-10 were considered normal olfactory sensitivity, whereas scores of 1-3 signified olfactory dysfunction or anosmia, and scores of ≥10 indicate better olfactory sensitivity.</description>

    <description>Liraglutid will be titrated from 0.6mg/day to a final dose 1.8mg/day during the first 2 weeks, if well tolerated. Meanwhile, All patients will also continue on their existing dose and regimen of metformin throughout the study. Visits at 4-week intervals will be performed to evaluate the safety of drugs. Metformin dose can be reduced in response to hypoglycaemia, but liraglutid could not be adjusted. If the plasma glucose still not achieve the target at the maximum dose, the maximum dose will be maintained until the completion of the study.</description>
