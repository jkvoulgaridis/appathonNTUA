      Cohort A will consist of 100 CRAC patients with stage II/III resectable disease due for
      adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Cohort B will consist of 30 patients with stage II resectable disease for observation only.

      Both cohorts will have a follow up period of up to 2 years, post chemotherapy for cohort A
      and post resection for cohort B.
