  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and its related disorders (e.g., trichotillomania) are
      characterized by the marked difficulty in inhibiting unwanted or inappropriate responses.
      There is compelling evidence that poor response inhibition is a core cognitive feature of OCD
      and its related disorders, but no effective intervention exists that directly attempts to
      address this problematic cognitive deficiency. This study will examine the feasibility and
      clinical utility of a computerized cognitive training program designed to improve response
      inhibition among individuals diagnosed with OCD or trichotillomania.This training program
      offers systematic practice of response inhibition in the form of a 40-level computer game.
      Individuals with these conditions will be randomized to either 8 sessions of (a) computerized
      response inhibition training (RIT) or (b) placebo computer training (PLT). We hypothesize
      that RIT will outperform PLT in improving response inhibition capabilities and reducing
      relevant clinical symptoms. In sum, this project is expected to generate important knowledge
      to guide the development of effective computer-based treatment approaches that may help
      reduce critical problems of existing treatments such as suboptimal patient retention and
      treatment under-utilization, thereby improving overall treatment response rates among
      individuals suffering from OCD and related conditions.

    <measure>Composite Score of Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>This is a clinician-administered rating scale of OCD symptom severity, most widely used in treatment outcome research for OCD, and a clinician-administered rating scale of hair pulling symptoms, widely used in clinical trial research for trichotillomania. Given the inclusion of two different diagnostic conditions, the primary outcome for the current study is the z score of the symptom rating severity obtained from the two rating scales, with higher values indicating greater symptom severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stop Signal Reaction Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT; time taken to complete the inhibitory process) is estimated using the tracking algorithm on the computerized stop-signal task, which adjusts the stop signal delay automatically (by 50ms) to maintain the rate of successful inhibition on stop-signal trials at 50%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement (CGI) is a clinician-administered rating scale widely used to assess the overall severity of the target condition in treatment outcome research. The CGI is assessed on a 7-point scale, with the severity scale from 1 (Normal, not at all ill) through to 7 (Among the most severely ill patients). Thus, the higher CGI severity rating score indicate a greater level of overall illness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Commission Errors on the Go/No-go Task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The number of commission errors on the go/no-go task is a commonly used measure of response inhibition. In this task, participants are asked to withhold their responses on no-go trials. If they fail to withhold their response in a no-go trial (i.e., pressing the response key to the no-go signal), this response counts toward the total number of commission errors. Therefore, a greater number of commission errors on this task reflects a greater level of inhibitory control deficit.</description>

        <title>Commission Errors on the Go/No-go Task.</title>
        <description>The number of commission errors on the go/no-go task is a commonly used measure of response inhibition. In this task, participants are asked to withhold their responses on no-go trials. If they fail to withhold their response in a no-go trial (i.e., pressing the response key to the no-go signal), this response counts toward the total number of commission errors. Therefore, a greater number of commission errors on this task reflects a greater level of inhibitory control deficit.</description>
