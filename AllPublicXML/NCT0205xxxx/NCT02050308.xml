  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored
      Internet-based program that helps American Indian (AI) tribal college students quit smoking.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many of the approximately 25,000 American Indian (AI) students enrolled in tribal
      colleges/universities in the US arrive there as smokers. A 2011 study of high school seniors
      reported that the smoking prevalence among AI students is approximately 40%, the highest rate
      among all racial and ethnic groups studied. Although prevalence data on smoking among AI
      college students are limited, studies have shown that the majority of smokers in high school
      continue to smoke once they reach college. Prohibited from marketing to adolescents and
      children, the tobacco industry in recent years has shifted its most intense marketing to
      college students, resulting in increases in smoking rates among them. The transition to
      college provides amble opportunities for young adults to acquire new and harmful habits. Many
      of these habits do not seem so alien to young AIs: Cigarette smoking is the number one cause
      of preventable death among AIs. Cancer is the second leading cause of death among AIs, and
      lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both AI men and women. Cultural
      factors, socioeconomic circumstances, and lack of culturally-tailored cessation programs for
      American Indian tribal college students have prevented access to effective interventions that
      promote smoking cessation. To date, few studies have focused on methods to encourage smoking
      cessation among tribal college students and no randomized clinical trials have yet been
      conducted. To address this public health deficit, we propose an innovative, effective,
      culturally and individually-tailored smoking cessation programs to promote cessation.

      Primary aim is to: To test the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored internet-based smoking
      cessation intervention (I-ANBL) compared to an internet-based heart healthy diet
      (I-FV:fruit/vegetable) control condition in a randomized controlled trial with Tribal College
      students. Our hypothesis is that American Indian tribal college students randomized to the
      culturally-tailored smoking cessation arm will have significantly higher 7-day point
      prevalence abstinence (defined as no cigarettes in the past 7 days, biochemically verified)
      rates at 6 months than those receiving the heart healthy diet intervention.

    <description>The culturally-tailored program includes 9 individual Internet-based sessions across a 12 week period and an additional individual Internet-based session at 6 months. Web sessions will last about half-an-hour (30 minutes) and will discuss topics that are important to quitting smoking (like: preparing to quit, dealing with cravings, and support systems, etc.) and topics relevant to American Indian culture (like traditional use of tobacco).
We plan to give participants in our cessation program a choice of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy or no pharmacotherapy. We choose to give our participants a choice because our experience shows that we would be unlikely to recruit AI participants into a trial that requires pharmacotherapy use.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to log into the website prior to the first session to allow for any problems with the site to be fixed prior to sessions starting. Topics we anticipate covering include, but are not limited to: preparing to quit, dealing with cravings, support systems, traditional tobacco, stress reduction, weight management, and staying quit, along with other topics determined during program development. For each session, the tribal college student will begin the session by answering a series of questions to produce an individually-tailored report that will be provided on the screen at the end of each week's session so that the smoker can work on strategies during the week before the next internet session
Weekly procedures will follow the same format as for the first session</description>

    <description>These sessions help American Indians learn about what they can do to prevent heart disease. We will emphasize the increase consumption of fruits and vegetables as well as addressing other heart healthy activities. Honoring the Gift of Heart Health is a user-friendly program developed especially for American Indians. The manual provides the &quot;how-to&quot; for leading group education sessions. It offers &quot;hands-on&quot; activities that help people build the skills they need to make simple, practical, and lasting changes to help them fight heart disease. The protocol will follow procedures as the I-ANBL arm, however, this fruit and vegetable arm will not include individually tailored components, but just interactive web-based materials related to increasing heart health, including certain activities.</description>
