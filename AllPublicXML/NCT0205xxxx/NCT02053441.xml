  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study will measure differences in how muscle responds to both exercise and protein
      supplements in healthy women aged 60-69. We are studying two different protein supplements- a
      standard Whey Protein and a Leucine enriched supplement. Each patient would receive either
      one of these.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the factors that plays an important role in the loss of functional performance and, as
      such, the capacity to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle is the progressive loss of
      skeletal muscle mass with ageing (i.e., sarcopenia). Indeed, sarcopenia is a more robust
      predictor of functional status and mortality in the elderly than chronological age or indeed,
      any other co-morbidity. Sarcopenia is an incipient process whereby lean muscle mass
      contributing up to ~50% of total body weight in young adults declines to ~25% when reaching
      the age of 75-80 y. Adequate nutritional intake, and in particular dietary protein, is
      important for offsetting age-related declines in muscle mass. The aim of this project is to
      seek the most effective nutrition with which to counteract sarcopenia, specifically in women.
