  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study in children with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis
      (PFIC) designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LUM001. Efficacy will be assessed by
      evaluating the effect of LUM001 on pruritus and the biochemical markers of pruritus
      associated with PFIC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into 5 parts: a 4-week dose escalation period, a 4-week stable dosing
      period, a 5-week stable dosing period, a 59-week long-term exposure period, and an optional
      follow-up treatment period for eligible participants who continue treatment with LUM001.
      Participants in the optional follow-up treatment period will continue to receive study drug
      until they are eligible to enter another LUM001 study or until LUM001 is available
      commercially, whichever occurs first.

    <measure>To evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of LUM001 in Pediatric Participants with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study treatment until Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability of LUM001 will be assessed for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical laboratory results, vital signs, physical exam findings (including body weight and height), concomitant medication usage and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study or use of investigational drug product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the investigational drug product.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate the effect of LUM001 on Pruritus in Pediatric Participants with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus will be assessed by using the Itch caregiver/patient reported outcome measure (ItchRO) administered as a twice daily electronic diary. The clinician's assessment of the participant's pruritus is focused on scratching and visible damage to the skin as a result of scratching as observed by the physician. The clinician scratch scale uses a 5-point scale, in which 0 designates no evidence of scratching and 4 designates cutaneous mutilation with bleeding, hemorrhage and scarring. It will be evaluated for change from Baseline (Day 0) to Week 13.</description>
