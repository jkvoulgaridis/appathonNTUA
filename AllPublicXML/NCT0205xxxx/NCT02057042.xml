      The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial of Peer-Supported cCBT versus
      enhanced usual care (EUC) for 330 patients with new episodes of depression in primary care at
      three VA sites and their associated Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Antidepressant medications and evidence-based psychotherapies are effective treatments for
      depression. However, antidepressant medication adherence continues to be suboptimal and
      offering access to and retaining patients in evidence-based psychotherapies for depression is
      challenging. The VHA has made major efforts to expand access to and capacity for depression
      focused evidence-based psychotherapies. However in 2012, only 35% of VA patients with
      depression completed any psychotherapy visit and only 6% completed 8 psychotherapy visits in
      14 weeks, a proxy for an adequate trial.

      Initiation and engagement in depression treatment may be increased if patients are offered
      timely access to a highly flexible, evidence-based treatment options, such as a tailored,
      web-based computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy (cCBT) program. cCBT has sufficient
      evidence for effectiveness to be a covered benefit in United Kingdom National Health Service,
      but has much larger effects when it is supported by clinicians or other trusted individuals.
      VA peer specialists, an increasing workforce in VHA mental health, are ideal candidates to
      support patients' engagement in depression treatment and in cCBT. Peers have been shown to
      promote use of Internet self-management tools, and peer specialist support for cCBT may
      enhance its completion and overall effectiveness through regular &quot;check ins&quot; and also through
      providing peer specific experiences, such as sharing of lived experiences and modeling of
      self management and recovery.

      Objectives:

      We are conducting a Hybrid Type I RCT of Peer-Supported cCBT versus enhanced usual care (EUC)
      for 330 patients with new episodes of depression in primary care at three VA sites and their
      associated CBOCs. Our specific aims are to compare PS-cCBT versus enhanced usual care (EUC)
      on: a) patient symptomatic, functional, and recovery-oriented outcomes, b) depression coping
      skills, antidepressant medication adherence, and initiation and completion of more intensive
      traditional psychotherapy (contingent on symptom level). Our secondary aims are to assess
      patient, peer, and providers' experiences in PS-cCBT versus EUC using mixed methods. Finally,
      our exploratory aim is to assess potential mediators of improvements in depressive symptoms
      or functional status.

      Methods:

      This is a Hybrid I randomized controlled trial (RCT) of peer-supported cCBT compared to
      enhanced usual care (EUC) among Veterans with new diagnoses of depression in primary care.
      The cCBT program consists of 8 modules and will be supported by VA peer specialists with
      weekly contact for 12 weeks. We will assess patient symptomatic, functional and
      recovery-oriented outcomes at 12 and 24 week following randomization. We will also assess
      potential mediators of these outcomes. Bivariate and multivariate study analyses will assess
      the impact of the two study arms at each assessment point and over time.

      Status:

      Study is currently ongoing, study recruitment and follow-up is active.

    <time_frame>change over time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional status will be measured using the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12). Developed from VR-36, VR-12 includes 12 original question items from the VR-36. The questions in this survey correspond to seven different health domains inlcuding general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, energy/fatigue levels, social functioning and mental health. Answers are summarized into a Physical Component Score (PCS) and a Mental Component Score (MCS) which allows for a comparison between the respondents physical and psychological health status.The VR-12 has somewhat greater precision at the lower end of the health status continuum than the SF-12. The VR-12 has been used in numerous prior VA focused studies. VR-12 MCS component scores are standardized to a mean of 50, with higher scores indicating better mental health and related functioning.</description>

    <measure>Depression Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS) at baseline, 3 months post intervention and 6 months post intervention. The ISD is a 16-item self-report instrument for measuring the severity of depression among individuals. Each item is rated on a four-point scale (0-3), and aggregate scores range from 0 to 27. The IDS has been widely used and shows acceptable reliability, with Cronbach's of 0.86. Severity of depression is scored according to the following ranges: 1-5 (no depression), 6-10 (mild), 11-15 (moderate), 16-20 (severe), and 21-27 (very severe).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery Orientation</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Recovery orientation will be measured using the Recovery Assessment Scale - Short Form (RAS-SF). This 20-item scale is a shorter version of the RAS and has four factors: personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, reliance on others, and no domination by symptoms. The RAS-SF shows evidence for both convergent and discriminate validity when compared to quality of life, social support, and symptomatic scales. The scale is scored by summing all items (or scale items), with 100 being the highest possible overall score. Higher scores indicate greater sense of recovery.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) is a valid proxy for the longer Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction (Q-LES) form and will be used to assess quality of life. It consists of 14 items that patients rate on a 5-point scale to indicate their satisfaction with a variety of life domains, including physical health, mood, work, household activities, social relationships, etc. The Q-LES-Q-SF has been shown to have high levels of reliability and has been used in numerous studies of depression, including the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded STAR*D study. Responses are scored on a 5-point scale, where higher scores indicate better enjoyment and satisfaction with life (possible range 14-70).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>CBT skills will be assessed using the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Skills Questionnaire (CBTSQ). The CBTSQ is a 16-item scale consisting of two factors, Behavioral Activation and Cognitive Restructuring. The scale shows construct validity, appears sensitive to change among patients undergoing CBT treatment, and predicts reduction in depressive symptoms. Scores are summed with a maximum score of 80. Higher scores indicate greater uptake of CBT skills.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety will be measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7). Total score ranges from 0 to 21, with &quot;cut scores&quot; for mild, moderate and severe anxiety. Although originally developed for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, the GAD-7 has good operating characteristics for detection and severity ratings of panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. Scores are summed with a range of 0-21. Scores represent: 0-5 mild, 6-10 moderate, 11-15 moderate/severe, and 15-21 severe anxiety.</description>

        <title>Functional Status</title>
        <description>Functional status will be measured using the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12). Developed from VR-36, VR-12 includes 12 original question items from the VR-36. The questions in this survey correspond to seven different health domains inlcuding general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, energy/fatigue levels, social functioning and mental health. Answers are summarized into a Physical Component Score (PCS) and a Mental Component Score (MCS) which allows for a comparison between the respondents physical and psychological health status.The VR-12 has somewhat greater precision at the lower end of the health status continuum than the SF-12. The VR-12 has been used in numerous prior VA focused studies. VR-12 MCS component scores are standardized to a mean of 50, with higher scores indicating better mental health and related functioning.</description>

        <description>Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS) at baseline, 3 months post intervention and 6 months post intervention. The ISD is a 16-item self-report instrument for measuring the severity of depression among individuals. Each item is rated on a four-point scale (0-3), and aggregate scores range from 0 to 27. The IDS has been widely used and shows acceptable reliability, with Cronbach's of 0.86. Severity of depression is scored according to the following ranges: 1-5 (no depression), 6-10 (mild), 11-15 (moderate), 16-20 (severe), and 21-27 (very severe).</description>

        <title>Recovery Orientation</title>
        <description>Recovery orientation will be measured using the Recovery Assessment Scale - Short Form (RAS-SF). This 20-item scale is a shorter version of the RAS and has four factors: personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, reliance on others, and no domination by symptoms. The RAS-SF shows evidence for both convergent and discriminate validity when compared to quality of life, social support, and symptomatic scales. The scale is scored by summing all items (or scale items), with 100 being the highest possible overall score. Higher scores indicate greater sense of recovery.</description>

It consists of 14 items that patients rate on a 5-point scale to indicate their satisfaction with a variety of life domains, including physical health, mood, work, household activities, social relationships, etc. The Q-LES-Q-SF has been shown to have high levels of reliability and has been used in numerous studies of depression, including the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded STAR*D study. Responses are scored on a 5-point scale, where higher scores indicate better enjoyment and satisfaction with life (possible range 14-70).</description>

The CBTSQ is a 16-item scale consisting of two factors, Behavioral Activation and Cognitive Restructuring. The scale shows construct validity, appears sensitive to change among patients undergoing CBT treatment, and predicts reduction in depressive symptoms. Scores are summed with a maximum score of 80. Higher scores indicate greater uptake of CBT skills.</description>

        <description>Generalized Anxiety will be measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7). Total score ranges from 0 to 21, with &quot;cut scores&quot; for mild, moderate and severe anxiety. Although originally developed for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, the GAD-7 has good operating characteristics for detection and severity ratings of panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. Scores are summed with a range of 0-21. Scores represent: 0-5 mild, 6-10 moderate, 11-15 moderate/severe, and 15-21 severe anxiety.</description>
