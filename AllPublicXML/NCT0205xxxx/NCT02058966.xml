  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction to methamphetamine is a serious health problem. There are no medications that a
      doctor can give someone to help them stop using methamphetamine. Entacapone (ComtanÂ©) is a
      medication that could help people addicted to methamphetamine.

      This study will see how entacapone works in healthy people who are given methamphetamine. We
      think that the study drug will be well tolerated, and that it will prevent some of the
      effects of methamphetamine that make it so addictive. We also want to see how differences in
      people's genes may cause differences in the ways the study drug and methamphetamine work for
      them.

      The study has six total visits. The first visit is for screening. Tests and procedures will
      make sure it is safe for subjects to participate.

      The second visit is a familiarization day. Subjects will receive methamphetamine, but no
      entacapone. This is done to make sure they can tolerate the drug and recognize its effects
      before being given a second drug on the same day. Subjects will take surveys and computer
      tests to see how the medications change mood, thinking, and liking the drug.

      The final four visits are the actual study days. Subjects will be randomly assigned (like the
      flip of a coin) to the different ways to get either 1) study medication or placebo (placebo
      contains no active study medication) and then 2) methamphetamine or placebo. Subjects will be
      in all four groups during the study, which means that each day a subject will get a different
      group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of Entacapone on Methamphetamine-induced Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements acquired before drug ingestion (baseline) then hourly for 4 hours. The peak interaction effect of entacapone and methamphetamine occurs 1 hour after ingestion, therefore the reported values are from this timepoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Profile of Mood States is a 65 item questionnaire using a Likert rating scale to assess transient, distinct moods. The questionnaire contains 65 words/statements that describe feelings people have. The test requires you to indicate for each word or statement how you have been feeling in the past week including today. A Total Mood Disturbance score is calculated by adding scores for Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue and Confusion and then subtracting the Vigour score. The Total Mood Disturbance scale ranges from -32 to 200 with lower scores indicative of people with more stable mood profiles.</description>

    <measure>Effect of Entacapone on Subjective Effects of Methamphetamine</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements acquired before drug ingestion (baseline) then hourly for 4 hours. The peak interaction effect of entacapone and methamphetamine occurs 1 hour after ingestion, therefore the reported values are from this timepoint.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective effects of the study drug were evaluated with the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI-49), a 49 item questionnaire consisting of true/false items. True items receive a score of 1 if answer is 'True', false items receive a score of 1 if answer is 'False'. No points are given when answer is opposite to scoring direction. There are 5 subscales: Morphine Benzedrine group scale to measure euphoria (range: 0-16 with higher numbers indicating more euphoria), A Lysergic Acid Diethylamide group scale to estimate dysphoria and agitation (range: 0-14 with higher scores indicating more dysphoria), a Pentobarbital Chlorpromazine Alcohol group scale to measure sedation (range: 0-15 with higher scores indicating more sedation), and a Benzedrine group scale and an Amphetamine Scale to assess stimulant effects (range: 0-13 and 0-11, respectively, with higher scores indicating higher stimulant effects) .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of Entacapone on Methamphetamine-induced Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements acquired before drug ingestion (baseline) then hourly for 4 hours. The peak interaction effect of entacapone and methamphetamine occurs 1 hour after ingestion, therefore the reported values are from this timepoint.</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Rating of Stimulation is a 1-item question &quot;I feel light-headed, restless, or speeded-up&quot; in which the participant is asked to circle one answer on a scale from 0-4, 0 is 'normal', 1 is 'slightly', 2 is 'moderately', 3 is 'very much', and 4 is 'extremely'. Whichever number they circled is their reported score. A higher score is indicative of a greater stimulating effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements acquired before drug ingestion (baseline) then hourly for 4 hours. The peak interaction effect of entacapone and methamphetamine occurs 1 hour after ingestion, therefore the reported values are from this timepoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Two computer tests were administered to measure how each medication intervention effects cognitive functioning. The tests administered included the Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVIPT), a 6 minute test of sustained attention in which participants are requested to detect target sequences of digits and the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), a 2 minute test of psychomotor speed and sustained attention consisting of digit-symbol pairs followed by a list of digits where the subject identifies the symbol that corresponds to each digit as fast as possible. The number of correct responses within the allowed time is measured. Higher scores on both tasks indicate better performance.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Study staff screened 80 subjects over the phone between June 2014 to June 2016 at a clinical hospital in Portland, OR.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>51 subjects failed the pre-screen primarily due to history of substance use disorder, time commitment conflicts, or unwilling to take methamphetamine. 14 of 29 subjects completed first randomization. Of the 29, 6 declined to participate, 4 did not meet inclusion criteria, 1 was excluded due to an adverse event, and 6 dropped out.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>All Subjects</title>
          <description>Subjects will get either entacapone or placebo, then one hour later, either methamphetamine or placebo.
Placebo: capsules compounded to be of similar appearance to the active drugs
Entacapone: Entacapone 200 mg oral dose
Methamphetamine: Methamphetamine 20 mg oral dose
The research pharmacy will assign randomization; they have no contact with the subjects or clinical staff involved in direct subject care so this medication combination could occur at any of the 4 randomization visits.</description>

        <title>Effect of Entacapone on Methamphetamine-induced Mood</title>
        <description>Profile of Mood States is a 65 item questionnaire using a Likert rating scale to assess transient, distinct moods. The questionnaire contains 65 words/statements that describe feelings people have. The test requires you to indicate for each word or statement how you have been feeling in the past week including today. A Total Mood Disturbance score is calculated by adding scores for Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue and Confusion and then subtracting the Vigour score. The Total Mood Disturbance scale ranges from -32 to 200 with lower scores indicative of people with more stable mood profiles.</description>
        <time_frame>Measurements acquired before drug ingestion (baseline) then hourly for 4 hours. The peak interaction effect of entacapone and methamphetamine occurs 1 hour after ingestion, therefore the reported values are from this timepoint.</time_frame>

        <description>The subjective effects of the study drug were evaluated with the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI-49), a 49 item questionnaire consisting of true/false items. True items receive a score of 1 if answer is 'True', false items receive a score of 1 if answer is 'False'. No points are given when answer is opposite to scoring direction. There are 5 subscales: Morphine Benzedrine group scale to measure euphoria (range: 0-16 with higher numbers indicating more euphoria), A Lysergic Acid Diethylamide group scale to estimate dysphoria and agitation (range: 0-14 with higher scores indicating more dysphoria), a Pentobarbital Chlorpromazine Alcohol group scale to measure sedation (range: 0-15 with higher scores indicating more sedation), and a Benzedrine group scale and an Amphetamine Scale to assess stimulant effects (range: 0-13 and 0-11, respectively, with higher scores indicating higher stimulant effects) .</description>

        <title>Effect of Entacapone on Methamphetamine-induced Stimulation</title>
        <description>The Global Rating of Stimulation is a 1-item question &quot;I feel light-headed, restless, or speeded-up&quot; in which the participant is asked to circle one answer on a scale from 0-4, 0 is 'normal', 1 is 'slightly', 2 is 'moderately', 3 is 'very much', and 4 is 'extremely'. Whichever number they circled is their reported score. A higher score is indicative of a greater stimulating effect.</description>
        <time_frame>Measurements acquired before drug ingestion (baseline) then hourly for 4 hours. The peak interaction effect of entacapone and methamphetamine occurs 1 hour after ingestion, therefore the reported values are from this timepoint.</time_frame>

        <description>Two computer tests were administered to measure how each medication intervention effects cognitive functioning. The tests administered included the Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVIPT), a 6 minute test of sustained attention in which participants are requested to detect target sequences of digits and the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), a 2 minute test of psychomotor speed and sustained attention consisting of digit-symbol pairs followed by a list of digits where the subject identifies the symbol that corresponds to each digit as fast as possible. The number of correct responses within the allowed time is measured. Higher scores on both tasks indicate better performance.</description>
