  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will conduct a phase I/II trial in recurrent (temozolomide
      resistant) glioma patients. The overall goal of this study is to provide a foundation for
      future studies with indoximod tested in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with radiation
      and temozolomide, or in combination with vaccine therapies.

      The aim of this study is to identify the safety profile and the recommended dose for phase 2
      study of the combination of indoximod (portion 1, phase 1b study). Investigators will then
      evaluate the tolerability and the preliminary activity in patients with recurrent GBM in
      three different situations:

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide (bevacizumab-naive patients)

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide in patients currently receiving or having
           received and failed bevacizumab.

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide with stereotactic radiation. Ancillary studies
           will be conducted to assess the correlation between intra-tumoral IDO expression or
           serum biomarkers (immune monitoring) and treatment efficacy.

      If the current study shows an acceptable safety profile and suggests preliminary evidence of
      activity, this will provide the justification for subsequent randomized phase 2 studies in
      refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

    <description>Phase 1b component:
To determine the adverse event profile (event type, incidence severity, duration causality and treatment intervention) and identify regimen-limiting toxicities (RLT) of indoximod plus temozolomide in combination therapy.
Specifically, investigators define regimen-limiting toxicity (RLT) as a toxicity that delays the planned administration of the next cycle of the backbone chemotherapy. The goal of the trial will be to find the maximum dose of indoximod that does not induce RLT in more than 1/6 of patients treated with temozolomide.</description>

    <description>Phase 1B patients will receive Indoximod given in escalating doses. Initial dosing will be 600 mg BID by mouth with escalation planned to 1200 mg BID by mouth. The medication should be taken twice daily for 28 days each cycle.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV glioma) or
             gliosarcoma. In addition, the Phase 1b cohort will include patients with progressive
             WHO grade III glioma.

          -  Patients will be eligible if the original histology was lower grade glioma and a
             subsequent diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made.

          -  Unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by MRI. It is understood that
             some patients may be resected prior to enrolling onto protocol

          -  Patients must have completed a course of radiation therapy and at least 2 adjuvant
             cycles of temozolomide for the phase 2 component.

          -  Patients enrolling onto Cohort 2b who have been taken off bevacizumab must have had at
             least a 28 day washout from any previous administration of bevacizumab. It is
             preferred that patients who fail bevacizumab prior to trial entry remain on
             bevacizumab in the trial.

          -  Prior temozolomide is not required for the phase 1 component; prior radiation is
             required for the phase 1 arm.

          -  Patients must be on a steroid dose less than or equal to 2 mg of dexamethasone daily
             (or equivalent), and this dose must not have increased for at least 14 days prior to
             obtaining the enrollment.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 or Karnofsky ≥70%.

          -  Age between 16

          -  Must be 28 days from the administration of any investigational agent or prior
             cytotoxic therapy with the following exceptions:

          -  Must be 14 days from administration of non-cytotoxic agents (e.g., bevacizumab (except
             COHORT 2b), interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor, etc.).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior invasive malignancy that is not low-grade glioma, high-grade glioma,
             glioblastoma, or gliosarcoma (except non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix) unless the patient has been disease free and off therapy for that
             disease for a minimum of 3 years.

          -  Patients on the phase 2 portion of the study may not have more than 2 prior regimens
             for recurrent disease for glioblastoma/gliosarcoma. Patients on the phase 1 portion of
             the study may not have had more than 3 prior regimens.

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy &gt; 2 mg of dexamethasone daily (or equivalent) at study
             enrollment.

          -  Active or history of autoimmune disease
