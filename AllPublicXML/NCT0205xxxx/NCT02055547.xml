  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      MK-8521.

      Part 1 primary hypothesis: Administration of single subcutaneous (SC) doses of MK-8521 is
      sufficiently safe and well- tolerated in healthy participants, based on assessment of
      clinical and laboratory adverse experiences, to permit continued clinical investigation.

      Part 2: Administration of multiple once daily SC doses of MK-8521 is sufficiently safe and
      well-tolerated in healthy lean and obese participants, based on assessment of clinical and
      laboratory adverse experiences, to permit continued clinical investigation.

    <textblock>
      This was a 3 part, randomized, single and multiple ascending-dose trial that evaluated the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of MK-8521 in healthy
      non-obese male (Part 1-Panels A and B, Panels C, D, and E of Part 2, and Part 3 Panel H)
      participants between the ages of 18 and 45 years and obese male participants (Part 2, Panel
      F) 45 to 65 years of age. An optional Panel G in Part 2 per protocol did not occur.

      Part 1 was a single rising dose study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of single
      subcutaneous (SC) doses of MK-8521. Two panels of 8 healthy young non-obese male participants
      were dosed in up to 3 alternating dosing periods of MK-8521 or placebo (in a 6:2 ratio).
      Participants had a minimum 7 day washout between dosing periods.

      Part 2 was a multiple-rising dose study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple
      SC doses of MK-8521. Three panels (C-E) of 8 healthy young non-obese male participants
      received daily SC doses of MK-8521 or placebo (in a 6:2 ratio) as a titration regimen for 10
      consecutive days. One panel (Panel F) of 8 older obese male participants received daily SC
      doses of MK-8521 or placebo (in a 6:2 ratio) as a titration regimen for 14 consecutive days.

      Part 3 was a single dose, 3-period crossover study in 12 healthy lean male participants.
      Participants were randomized into 6 treatment groups and received a sequence of 3 treatments
      (MK-8521 at 35μg, 125μg and placebo). All participants in Part 3 received MK-8521 (high dose
      of 125μg and low dose of 35 μg) and placebo. There was a minimum 7 day washout between each
      dosing period for each individual participant.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE) (Part 1)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE) (Part 2)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Treatment Due to an AE (Part 2)</title>
          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

        <description>Apparent Terminal Half-life (t1/2) is the time required for a given drug concentration in the plasma to decrease by 50%. Mean pharmacokinetic parameter values for MK-8521 following administration of multiple subcutaneous once daily doses for 14 Days (with dose escalation on Day 7) to obese male participants (Part 2, Panel F) are presented. Method of dispersion is coefficient of variation (%CV). Apparent terminal t1/2 was not reported for certain days since the terminal phase was not adequately captured with sampling up to 24hr post dose. No pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on participants receiving Placebo. Blood collections occurred at the following time points for Part 2, Panel F: Days 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14 pre-dose; Days 1, 7, 14: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24 hrs. post-dose; Day 14: 72, 96, 120 hrs. post-dose.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE) (Part 3)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

        <description>Pancreatic beta cell sensitivity to ambient glucose concentration after a single dose of MK-8521 125μg/35μg or placebo at Tmax was quantified as the slope of insulin secretion rate relative to glucose concentration (ISR/G) during GGI (160 minutes duration) and assessed against MK-8521 average plasma concentration (Cave) during the GGI to preliminarily characterize the PK/ pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship. Study drug was administered on Day -1. Plasma concentrations of MK-8521 were determined at -10 min pre-GGI and 40, 80, 120 &amp; 160 min and blood concentrations of glucose, insulin &amp; C-peptide were determined at -10, -5 (pre-GGI), 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 &amp; 160 minutes after start of GGI on Day 1 of each period. ISR calculated by deconvolution of C-peptide concentrations using a two-compartmental model was regressed on glucose concentration via simple linear regression; beta cell glucose sensitivity was defined as slope from the regression line.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time-weighted Average From 0 to 24 Hrs (TWA0-24hr) of Heart Rate (HR) After a Single Dose of MK-8521 (Part 1)</title>
        <description>Heart rate was assessed on Day 1 (predose &amp; 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 &amp; 24 hrs. postdose) &amp; Day 2 (36 &amp; 48 hrs. postdose). Predose and postdose HR were assessed using triplicate and duplicate measurements, respectively. The repeated measurements were averaged before conducting the statistical analysis. TWA0-24hr of HR on Day 1 &amp; Day 2 of MK-8521 single dosing was calculated as the area under the measurement-time curve divided by the time period of over which the measurements were made (i.e., 24 hrs.). The change from baseline TWA0-24hr HR was calculated for each participant where baseline was defined as predose baseline on Day 1.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA 0-24 Hrs. Heart Rate (HR) of Participants Treated With Multiple Doses of MK-8521 (Part 2, Panel C, D, and E)</title>
        <description>Heart rate was assessed on Day -1 (at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hrs post admission), Day 1 and Day 6 (predose and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hrs postdose) and Day 10 (predose &amp; 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hrs. postdose). Predose HR on Day 1 was assessed using triplicate measurements while Day -1, Day 1 (postdose), Day 6, and Day 10 HR were assessed using duplicate measurements. The repeated measurements were averaged before conducting the statistical analysis. TWA0-24hr of HR on Day 1, Day 6, and Day 10 of MK-8521 multiple dose treatment was calculated as the area under the measurement-time curve divided by the time period of over which the measurements were made (i.e., 24 hrs). The change from baseline TWA0-24hr HR was calculated for each participant using TWA0-24hr on Day -1 as the baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA 0-24 Hrs. Semi-recumbent Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) of Participants Treated With Multiple Doses of MK-8521 (Part 2, Panel F)</title>
        <description>Diastolic blood pressure was assessed on Day -1 (at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hrs. post admission), Day 1 and Day 8 (predose and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hrs. post dose) and Day 14 (predose and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hrs. postdose). Predose DBP on Day 1 was assessed using triplicate measurements while Day -1, Day 1 (postdose), Day 8, and Day 14 DBP were assessed as duplicate measurements. The repeated measurements were averaged before conducting the statistical analysis. TWA0-24hr of DBP on Day 1, Day 8, Day 14 of MK-8521 multiple dose treatment was calculated as the area under the measurement-time curve divided by the time period of over which the measurements were made (i.e., 24 hrs). The change from baseline TWA0-24hr. DBP was calculated for each participant using TWA0-24hr. on Day -1 as the baseline.</description>

        <title>Slope of Insulin Secretion Rate/Glucose (ISR/G) During Graded Glucose Infusion (GGI) at Tmax After a Single Dose of MK-8521 (Part 3)</title>
        <description>Pancreatic beta cell sensitivity to ambient glucose concentration after a single dose of MK-8521 125μg/35μg or placebo at Tmax was quantified as the slope of insulin secretion rate relative to glucose concentration (ISR/G) during GGI (160 minutes duration). Study drug was administered on Day -1 and blood concentrations of glucose, insulin &amp; C-peptide were determined at -10, -5 (pre-GGI), 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 minutes after start of GGI on Day 1 of each period. ISR calculated by deconvolution of C-peptide concentrations using a two compartmental model was regressed on glucose concentration via simple linear regression; beta cell glucose sensitivity was defined as slope from the regression line.</description>

          <title>Ratio of ISR/G at the Highest Glucose Infusion Rate During GGI Due to Treatment With A Single Dose of MK-8521 (Part 3)</title>
          <description>Pancreatic beta cell sensitivity to ambient glucose concentration after a single dose of MK-8521 125μg/35μg or placebo at Tmax was quantified as the ratio of the insulin secretion rate to glucose (ISR/G) at the highest glucose infusion rate during GGI (i.e., time weighted average between 120 to 160 minutes [TWA120-160min] of ratio [ISR/G]). Study drug was administered on Day -1 and blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were determined at -10, -5 (pre-GGI), 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 minutes after start of GGI on Day 1 of each period.</description>
