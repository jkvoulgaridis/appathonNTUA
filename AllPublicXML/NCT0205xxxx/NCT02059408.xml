    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis of this trial is that screening for chronic kidney disease, followed
      by education or treatment program will improve blood pressure control among hypertensive
      non-diabetic persons.

      To evaluate a CKD screen-and-educate program in primary care for improving blood pressure
      management compared with usual care, among non-diabetic adults with hypertension.

PCPs randomized to this arm will have the additional option to refer their higher-risk patients to a clinical pharmacist-led CKD management program with education. A primary care clinical pharmacist will schedule a series of appointments with patients found to have confirmed higher-risk CKD (defined as eGFRcreat-cys &lt;45, or eGFR 45-59 and ACR ≥ 30 mg/g). The pharmacist will follow treatment algorithms recommended by the 2012 KDIGO international CKD guidelines, and designed by a team of internists and nephrologists.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The entire primary care medical practice at SFVAMC will be considered. Randomization will
        occur at the team (nurse) level. Within each team, individual patients will be considered
        eligible for chronic kidney disease screening by this protocol and inclusion in our trial
        if they have hypertension without concomitant diabetes, and no prior recorded diagnosis of
        chronic kidney disease. Hypertension will be defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;140 or
        diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg at more than two encounters (any encounter) within the
        previous 3 years or a documented diagnosis of hypertension (listed in problem list or ICD-9
        code). Diagnosed chronic kidney disease will be defined as a documentation of chronic
        kidney disease in the problem list or ICD-9 code or on-going nephrology follow up. We
        define diagnosed chronic kidney disease without consideration of estimated glomerular
        filtration rate by creatinine or albumin-creatinine-ratio in the laboratory section of the
        medical record, since work from our group and others has shown that awareness and
        recognition of chronic kidney disease is extremely low, even among persons with documented
        reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria. Persons will be required to
        have seen their physician at least one time within the past 18 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Kidney transplant recipients, pregnant women, and individuals with an estimated glomerular
        filtration rate &lt;15 ml/min/1.73 m2 will be excluded from this study as they likely need
        specialty care for uncontrolled hypertension. Persons aged &gt;80 will be excluded because
        data on aggressive blood pressure lowering in this population are less clear and adverse
        effects associated with aggressive blood pressure control have been well documented. We
        will exclude persons with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, known
        ejection fraction &lt;25%, or documented allergy to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme/Angiotensin
        II Receptor Blockers. Other exclusion criteria relate to the required ability to
        communicate with providers and provide informed consent: prevalent dementia, impaired
        cognition or severe mental illness; expected life expectancy &lt;6 months; severe visual
        impairment in the absence of an available caretaker who can read.
