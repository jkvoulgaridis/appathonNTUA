  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the facts of multiple pathways involvement in cholangiocarcinoma tumor genesis,
      including EGFR, Ras, Raf, VEGFR, and PDGFR, with evidence of overexpression of these proteins
      associated with tumor stage, prognosis and response to therapy. Multikinase inhibitor
      targeting multiple tumor pathways agent as regorafenib should be the ideal candidate for
      evaluating the anti-cancer activity for the disease as cholangiocarcinoma. More importantly,
      regorafenib likely holds promise in this disease setting with known effectiveness either as a
      single agent or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in multiple solid tumors as
      above and the toxicity profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Ras, Raf, Vascular
      Endothelial Growth Factor Receptors (VEGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR)
      appear to be involved in cholangiocarcinoma tumor genesis. Overexpression of these proteins
      has been shown to be associated with tumor stage, prognosis, and response to therapy.
      However, therapies targeting a single pathway have shown no clear benefit. A number of Phase
      2 trials have been completed, or are underway, studying agents targeted to EGFR or VEGF -
      both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. These have shown varying increases
      in response rate, but have not found marked increases in progression-free or overall
      survival. This suggests that inhibition of multiple pathways simultaneously may be needed.
      Regorafenib, is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting multiple tumor pathways, which has
      showed effectiveness as a single agent in multiple solid tumors.

      Patients with advanced and metastatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma) who
      had been treated with and failed first-line chemotherapy will be treated with regorafenib
      (120 mg) (160 mg for second and subsequent treatment cycles) orally once daily 21 days (3
      weeks) on and 7 days (1 week) off in the 28-day (4-week) cycle.
