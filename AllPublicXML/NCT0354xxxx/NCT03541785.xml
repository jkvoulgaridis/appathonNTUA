  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study follows a group of patients admitted to the PICU who are identified as being at
      risk for developing acute kidney injury. The investigators will use risk-stratification,
      biomarker testing, and a functional assessment to predict patients who will become fluid
      overloaded and develop acute kidney injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the pediatric population, acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly observed in critically ill
      patients. At this time, there are no standardized care pathways that begin at identifying
      patients at risk for developing AKI and progress through to early recognition and treatment.
      Through previous work, the investigators have developed, tested, and integrated an AKI
      risk-stratification/clinical recognition tool (RAI) and a urine biomarker (NGAL) to try to
      identify patients at risk vs. not at-risk for developing AKI. However, these factors alone
      have yet to be integrated into clinical decision support to optimize AKI therapies and
      patient outcomes. The furosemide stress test (FST), previously described in adults, may be a
      good predictor for the patients who need acute dialysis for AKI versus those that can be
      managed medically.

      Through this study, the investigators will be following a cohort of patients admitted to the
      PICU who are identified as being at risk for developing AKI through RAI and NGAL results. The
      aim is to standardize the FST in this population, as well as determine the accuracy of the
      RAI-NGAL-FST clinical decision tool in predicting patients who become fluid overloaded and
      develop AKI.
