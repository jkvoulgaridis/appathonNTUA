  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop a culturally sensitive smart phone application to enhance
      neurocognitive function (memory and attention in particular) of participants with attenuated
      psychosis syndrome (APS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will conduct a pilot study of 80 APS subjects (age 18-45). Forty subjects
      will be randomly put in the SMART plus routine care (RC) group and 40 to RC group only. At
      baseline and 3-month follow-ups, all subjects will complete questionnaires including Mobile
      App Rating Scale SMART feasibility and engagement. 1:1 in-depth interviews will be conducted
      at the two time points to cross-validate the findings obtained from the questionnaires. The
      questionnaires and in-depth interviews for APS subjects for the RC group seek to explore
      their preference and likelihood to use SMART given the opportunity. Examine Cognitive
      Function Change. In order to prepare for future large scale randomized clinical trials, the
      investigator will examine the effectiveness of SMART in improving working memory and
      attention of APS subjects. At baseline and 3-month follow-ups, all subjects will complete
      MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) subtests measuring working memory (Spatial Span)
      and attention (Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs). A between and within group
      design allows examining change of outcome variables over time and group differences. Enhance
      mHealth research capacity of SMHC at individual and organization levels.

    <description>The subjects in SMART training group will receive add-on SMART intervention for 3 months. Subjects will play cognitive games for 1 hour per day, five days per week. SMART will track game time, resource use, and text messaging information on a daily basis, which allows researchers/clinicians to monitor subjects' daily SMART activities. Daily end-of-day RedPocket incentives will be delivered to subjects' designated account based on their resource use and game time. Top 5 APS subjects who play the game for the most time in a week will be rewarded</description>

    <description>The investigator will conduct a pilot study of 80 APS subjects (age 18-45). The investigator will examine SMART feasibility and user engagement using a randomized control trial research design. Using a simple random method, 40 APS subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group to receive add-on SMART intervention for 3 months and 40 APS subjects will just get naturalistic treatment with no SMART intervention. At baseline and 3-month follow-up, subjects will complete questionnaires on app use habits and attitudes towards SMART feasibility and engagement. In-depth interviews will be conducted at both time points to cross-validate the findings obtained from the questionnaires.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 45 years old.

          -  Understand and sign an informed consent (or assent for minors) document.

          -  Must meet the substance use criteria: No DSM IV Alcohol or Drug Dependence in the past
             3 months; No use on the day of assessment, clearly not high or hung-over.

          -  Meet diagnostic criteria for a prodromal syndrome. If under the age of 19 and meets
             diagnostic criteria for Schizotypal Personality Disorder or meets the diagnostic
             criteria called the Criteria for Prodromal Syndromes (COPS) which are operationalized
             as follows:

               -  Genetic Risk and Deterioration Syndrome (GRDS): First degree relative with
                  psychosis or subject with Schizotypal Personality Disorder and a 30% drop in GAF
                  score compared to one year ago, sustained over the past month, or

               -  Attenuated Positive Symptoms Syndrome (APSS): Severity rating of moderate (rating
                  of 3), moderately severe (4) or severe but not psychotic (5) on any one of the
                  five SOPS positive symptoms; symptom occurs at above severity level at an average
                  frequency of at least once per week in the past month; symptom must have begun in

                  least several minutes per day at a frequency of at least once per month;

             psychoses and psychosis NOS.

          -  Impaired intellectual functioning (i.e. IQ&lt;70).

          -  Past or current history of a clinically significant central nervous system disorder
             that may contribute to prodromal symptoms or confound their assessment.

          -  Traumatic Brain Injury that is rated as 7 or above on the Traumatic Brain Injury

             non-psychotic disorders will not be exclusionary (e.g. substance abuse disorder, major
             depression, anxiety disorders, Axis II Disorders), as long as the disorder does not
             account for the diagnosis of prodromal symptoms.
