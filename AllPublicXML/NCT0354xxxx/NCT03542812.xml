  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects up to 35% of very low
      birth weight infants (VLBW &lt; 1500 g). Based on the current numbers of VLBW infants born
      annually in the U.S., between 5,000-10,000 neonates will develop BPD each year. It is
      estimated that 8-42% of infants with BPD will develop pulmonary hypertension (PH). Moreover,
      it has been known since the 1980's that echocardiographic evidence of PH in infants with BPD
      is associated with up to 40% mortality.

      Treatment options to ameliorate PH in infants with BPD (BPD-PH) are limited. There have been
      no randomized clinical trials of any therapy in infants with BPD-PH. The standard care for
      the management of BPD-PH is to attempt to resolve the underlying lung disorder and the
      judicious use of oxygen as a potent pulmonary vasodilator. Using this management approach,
      which has not changed since the 1980's, the survival rates for infants with BPD-PH in the
      2000's has been reported to be 64% at 6 months and 53% at 2 years after diagnosis of PH. The
      lack of improvement in outcomes for the past 3 decades has led to the widespread agreement
      that novel and effective therapies are desperately needed for infants with BPD-PH.

      The goal is to develop oral L-citrulline clinically for the treatment of pediatric pulmonary
      hypertension associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD-PH); before pursuing a large
      scale treatment trial, pharmacokinetic (PK) dose-finding, tolerability studies in patients at
      high risk of developing BPD-PH are warranted.

      The hypothesis is that oral L-citrulline will be well tolerated, without significant adverse
      effects in infants at high risk of developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with
      BPD. The investigators propose to first characterize the PK profile of oral L-citrulline in
      order to define an appropriate dose range and treatment interval for infants at high risk of
      developing BPD-PH. Then using the doses and intervals generated by the PK profile, with a
      maximum dose of 3 g/kg/d, the investigators propose to evaluate the tolerability and ability
      to achieve the target study drug level (100-150 micromolar) in babies treated for 72 hours
      with oral L-citrulline. These studies will provide the data needed to design a full-scale
      randomized multi-center trial to evaluate the efficacy of oral L-citrulline therapy to
      ameliorate BPD-PH in human infants, a patient population that has a desperate need of new
      therapies.

    <description>Participants will be enrolled into the two groups, Group 1 (which will consist of 10 participants) and Group 2 (which will consist of 8 participants) in an alternating basis. Both Group 1 and Group 2 participants will receive a single, 150 mg/kg dose of oral L-citrulline. Population PKs will be done for both groups, at up to 3 time points.
Multiple interim time points and following completion of enrollment into Groups 1 and 2, data analysis will be done and results reviewed by the data safety monitoring board (DSMB). After the DSMB review is complete, enrollment into Group 3 will begin.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the tolerability and ability to achieve target trough L-citrulline levels of 100-150 µM, an additional group of 18 infants (group 3) will be given oral L-citrulline doses at intervals over a total of 72 hours. If the participant is not nipple feeding, the dose will be delivered via the participant's indwelling gavage feeding tube. The dose and interval of L-citrulline will be based on results from the studies that assess pharmacokinetic parameters using a maximum daily dose of 3 g/kg/d. Blood draws for PKs will be done at baseline and prior to last dose of L-citrulline. Urine will be collected to measure nitric oxide metabolites.</description>

Therefore, 3 ml/kg of the solubilized L-citrulline (50 mg/ml) will be administered per dose for the single-dose groups and the dose administered to the steady-state group will be determined from results from the single-dose studies.</description>
