      The patients were randomly separated into three groups. Group M (n=35) applied CD player and
      Group S (n=35) received the independent anesthesiologist placed earplugs into the patients'
      ears. Group N (n=35) exposed to the ambient operating room noise.

      Hundred and five pediatric patients who scheduled for abdominal surgery in ASA I-II risk
      groups were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomly separated into three groups.
      Group M (n=35) applied CD player and Group S (n=35) received the independent anesthesiologist
      placed earplugs into the patients' ears. Group N (n=35) exposed to the ambient operating room
      noise. The preoperative children's anxiety levels were assessed with the M-YPAS in the
      operating room. Heart rate (HR) and mid-arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded at 30-minute
      intervals until the completion of surgery, end of surgery and postoperative. During each
      measurement, noise level recordings were performed using sonometre. Pediatric Anesthesia
      Emergence Delirium Score (PEAD) was assessed after extubation, postoperative.
