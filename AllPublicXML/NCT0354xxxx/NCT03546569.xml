  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate levels of circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor
      DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTC) and immunological changes after self-expanding
      metal stent (SEMS) placement for malignant obstruction in the colon, and interpret these
      levels in relation to overall- and disease-free survival.

      Furthermore, we intend to study the opportunity to identify patients with a higher risk of
      recurrence due to the SEMS placement by monitoring cfDNA and ctDNA-levels, as it may be a
      potential biomarker to initiate or optimize chemotherapy and thereby ensure a better
      prognosis for the patients.

      Study design This prospective study will include 20 patients undergoing SEMS placement as a
      bridge to elective surgery at Koege- and Slagelse Hospital. Baseline blood samples will be
      collected before the procedure. After the procedure blood samples will be collected 1, 4, 12
      and 24 hours after SEMS placement. After elective surgery a tumor sample will be collected.

      Prior to SEMS placement:

      When potential candidates are admitted to the hospital they will be presented to the study by
      the relevant surgeon. The investigators will be contacted, when the patient is admitted to
      hospital.
