      This cohort study will recruit patients with treatment-naïve chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL) with TP53 disruption (i.e. 17p- or TP53 mutations) or relapsed/refractory CLL who were
      treated with idelalisib and rituximab between 01/07/2014 and 31/05/2017 at European centres
      adhering to the GIMEMA group and the ERIC group.
