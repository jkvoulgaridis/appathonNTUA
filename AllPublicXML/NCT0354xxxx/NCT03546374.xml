  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardioblate
      iRF and CryoFlex hand held devices for the treatment of non-paroxysmal AF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective, non-randomized, interventional study. A
      maximum of 160 subjects will be treated at up to 15 centers in the US. The study will include
      male and female patients with a history of non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are
      undergoing concomitant cardiac surgery. Subjects will be followed and assessed after
      procedure and for 12 months.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardioblate
      Surgical Ablation iRF and CryoFlex hand held devices to support an indication expansion to
      include treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation and long-standing persistent atrial
      fibrillation (non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) to the product labeling.
