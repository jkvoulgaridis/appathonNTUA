      This is a prospective phase II study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk+
      valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy, brachytherapy,
      external beam radiotherapy, and prostatectomy in previously untreated high-risk prostate
      cancer.

      This phase II study plans to assess efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk+ valacyclovir gene
      therapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy, brachytherapy, external beam
      radiotherapy, and prostatectomy in previously untreated high-risk prostate cancer patients.

      Clinical response as evaluated by changes in serum PSA level and digital rectal examination
      as well as by histological alterations on re-biopsy and prostatectomy such as the presence of
      apoptosis, necrosis, tumor proliferation and immunologic response, will be assessed following
      HSV-tk + valacyclovir treatment. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological
      response, blood counts and liver functions tests. Toxicity will be graded by the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
      neuro-toxicity scores (See Appendices). Additionally, patients will be followed closely to
      assess nadir PSA, freedom from PSA-progression, and freedom from local and distant
      progression and overall survival.

    <description>The investigational gene therapy, ADV/HSV-tk, will be administered by injection into the prostate at 5 x 10[11] virus particles (1.25 x 10[11] virus particles per tumor quadrant in 4 quadrants) on day 0 and day 30.
The recommended dose of Valacyclovir for this trial is 2 g orally t.i.d. for 14 days (day 1 to day 15 and days 31 to 45).
The recommended dose for Bicalutamide therapy in combination with an LHRH analogue is one 50 mg tablet once daily (morning or evening).
Leuprolide acetate 7.5mg depot injection will be injected monthly for a total of 2 months.</description>

    <description>Injection of the HSV-tk gene therapy product in four quadrants of prostate to enhance the immune system via &quot;bystander effect&quot; in which cytotoxicity is conferred to non-transduced neighboring cells. In vivo bystander effects are likely due to a combination of host immunological responses and to gap junction-mediated transport of phosphorylated prodrug metabolites to surrounding cells.</description>

    <description>The recommended dose for this trial is 2 g orally t.i.d. for 14 days (day 1 to day 15 and days 31 to 45). This dose has been calculated to give a similar AUC as 10 mg/kg of intravenous acyclovir administered every 8 hours. This is the same dose regimen used in a previous phase I clinical trial of ADV/HSV-tk plus acyclovir and topotecan in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.</description>

    <description>The recommended dose for Bicalutamide therapy in combination with an LHRH analogue is one 50 mg tablet once daily (morning or evening), with or without food. It is recommended that Bicalutamide be taken at the same time each day.
The use of an oral antiandrogen with medical castration for the treatment of prostate cancer is referred to as combined androgen blockade (CAB). Compared with LHRH-agonist monotherapy, CAB with bicalutamide did not reduce overall QoL but provided an early improvement in QoL related to lower urinary tract symptoms and pain.</description>
