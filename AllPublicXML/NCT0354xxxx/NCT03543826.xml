  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an estimation study, prospectively evaluating the incidence of postoperative residual
      neuromuscular blockade (PRNB) when a best practice protocol is implemented for a cohort of
      abdominal surgery and orthopedic surgery patients. The protocol is developed within the
      constraint of subjective monitoring, quantitative monitoring is not used, and use of
      rocuronium for paralysis and either neostigmine or sugammadex for reversal. The primary
      outcome is the incidence of PRNB on arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit, defined as a
      train-of-four ration &lt;0.9.

    <textblock>
      This study estimates the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular block when
      rocuronium neuromuscular block is managed by protocol for qualitative monitoring and reversal
      with neostigmine or sugammadex. The study is an extension of the recently published study by
      Thilen and co-workers which evaluated a protocol which used neostigmine as the sole reversal
      agent (doi: 10.1016/j.bja.2018.03.029). It demonstrated that use of a protocol was associated
      with a reduced incidence of severe residual paralysis, defined as normalized train-of-four
      (TOF) ratio &lt;0.7 at time of tracheal extubation. It was also associated with a highly
      significant reduction in PRNB as defined for several secondary outcomes, including
      non-normalized (i.e. raw) TOF-ratio &lt;0.9 at time of arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit
      (PACU).

      The current study does not include a control group, only an intervention group. The
      investigators hypothesize that PRNB can be prevented by adhering to a protocol which
      incorporates several current recommendations by experts. Importantly, the protocol preserves
      a role for neostigmine when the pre-reversal assessment indicates that spontaneous recovery
      has progressed to a so-called minimal block which is defined as the subjective absence of
      fade in the adductor pollicis TOF response. The investigators will study only abdominal
      surgery and orthopedic surgery patients. The primary outcome is incidence of PRNB, defined as
      TOF-ratio &lt;0.9 on arrival to the PACU. The investigators plan to enroll 120 patients, and if
      no more than one patient has PRNB, the upper bound for the 95% confidence interval will be
      less than 5%.
