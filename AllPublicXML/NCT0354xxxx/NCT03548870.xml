  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended after an episode of severe exacerbation of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, its implementation is challenging
      particularly as regard exercise training. Several studies showed that transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) could improve dyspnea and pulmonary function. The aim of
      this study is to assess the acute effect of TENS on exercise tolerance in post-exacerbation
      COPD patients

    <description>4 self adhesive surface electrodes will be positioned by pair on quadriceps. Patients will have a low frequency TENS for 20 min at rest. During this period, intensity will be increased every 5 minutes to the maximum tolerated by the patient (below pain threshold, sensation strong but comfortable). Thereafter, intensity is not increased anymore during the test.
