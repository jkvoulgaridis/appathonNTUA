  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decades, advances in treatment have led to an increasing number of children who
      survive cancer, resulting in a growing population of childhood cancer survivors. After end of
      cancer treatment on common protocols survivors are enrolled in non-harmonized follow-up
      programs with frequent visits and blood samples. However, the evidence for the value of these
      follow-up programs with respect to the effect on detecting relapse and the effects on overall
      survival is scarce.

      The aim of the study is to give a comprehensive description of the detection mode of relapsed
      acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), including symptoms and blood test results. Further, we
      aim to evaluate if the mode of detection affects survival.

      Investigators have identified a cohort of children with B-precursor ALL and T-ALL enrolled in
      the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-92, ALL-2000 and
      ALL-2008 trials and experienced a relapse as the first event after cessation of maintenance
      therapy (360 patients). From medical charts and blood test results it will be decided whether
      the relapse was diagnosed at a routine visit (including routine blood tests) or if the
      relapse was diagnosed because of symptoms at a non-scheduled visit or blood test.

      As the NOPHO database probably is one of the most complete databases globally, it is an
      advantage to perform this study as a NOPHO study.

      Results of this population based relapse study will provide an evidence-based background for
      planning optimal and relevant follow-up programs for children after therapy of ALL treated
      according to contemporary Nordic ALL protocols.

      The study is important and relevant in the light of today's high ALL cure rates and a need
      for optimal follow-up programs after cessation of ALL treatment and possible prediction of
      relapse.

      The timing of the project is an increased focus on the clinical relevance of routine clinical
      follow-up of patients treated for cancer.
