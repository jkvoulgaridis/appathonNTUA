      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with various dose
      levels of TAK-906 in adult participants with gastroparesis compared with placebo during 12
      weeks of treatment.

      17-Apr-2020 Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. TAK-906 is being tested to treat
      people who have symptomatic idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis.

      The study will enroll approximately 280 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups (in 1:1:1:1 ratio) which
      will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

      TAK-906 Maleate 5 mg TAK-906 Maleate 25 mg TAK-906 Maleate 50 mg Placebo (dummy inactive
      pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule twice daily, at approximately the same
      time each day throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall study duration is
      approximately 17 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 40 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

          8. Previous diagnosis of gastric bezoar (the presence of retained liquid, bile, or small
             amounts of poorly organized food residue is permitted).

          9. Poor control of diabetes within 30 days prior to randomization, including diabetic
             ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia requiring medical intervention, admission for control of
             diabetes or diabetic complications

         10. Elevated serum prolactin (&gt;upper limit of normal [ULN]) at Screening Visit 2.

         11. Has concurrent hypogonadism, current clinically significant menstrual abnormalities,
             such as amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, or other clinical features of hyperprolactinemia
             such as galactorrhea or gynecomastia.

         12. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled medical or psychiatric comorbidities which might
             affect their ability to participate in the study.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
