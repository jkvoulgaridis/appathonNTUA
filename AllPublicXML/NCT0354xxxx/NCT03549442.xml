  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 1 study to assess the safety and pharmacodynamics of CART-BCMA,
      with or without huCART19, in patients responding to first- or second-line therapy for
      high-risk multiple myeloma. The regimen evaluated in this study is based on established
      safety of CARTBCMA demonstrated in UPCC 14415/IRB#822756 at dose of 5x108 cells, administered
      as split infusions, following cyclophosphamide 1.5 g/m2 in patients with relapsed/refractory
      myeloma. This study tests CART-BCMA (1) as consolidation of early therapy for multiple
      myeloma, (2) with addition of fludarabine to the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen, (3) in
      combination with huCART19, and (4) as a single rather than split-dose infusion.

      Phase A: Safety Run-in to test the safety of CART-BCMA + huCART19 as split-dose infusions
      after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine in patients who have
      relapsed/refractory myeloma after two prior regimens but who are responding to their current
      therapy. Phase A Expansion: To occur once safety is demonstrated in Phase A. - Phase B:
      Randomization Phase in which patients responding to first or second-line therapy will receive
      either CART-BCMA alone (Cohort

      1) or CART-BCMA + huCART19 (Cohort 2) as split-dose infusions after lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine. Phase C: Single-dose infusion phase to test
      the safety of single-dose infusion of CART-BCMA alone (Cohort 1) and CART-BCMA + huCART19
      (Cohort 2) as single-dose infusions after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide
      + fludarabine in patients responding to first- or second-line therapy.

             maintenance therapy, and progresses within six months of this transition) iii. Within
             one year of a high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (Phase A

             has been refractory to one prior regimen if their prior/current therapy collectively
             has included all of the following: an &quot;imid/PI&quot; combination, pomalidomide,
             lenalidomide, daratumumab, and carfilzomib. Refractoriness is defined as disease
             progression on-therapy or within 60 days of stopping therapy.

             b. Subjects must have achieved at least a minimal response (as defined by IMWG 2016
             criteria1) to their current regimen.

             c. Subjects must not have received prior treatment with anti-BCMA cellular therapy.
             Subjects may have received treatment with other BCMA-directed agents (e.g., anti-BCMA

                  following exception: subjects who have advanced to second-line therapy due to
                  disease progression during first-line therapy are eligible if such progression
                  occurred within six months of beginning first-line therapy. Lines of therapy are

             i. Low-dose weekly cyclophosphamide (≤500 mg/m2/week) ii. Continuous infusion
             cyclophosphamide, if limited to a single cycle. c. Subjects must not have undergone
             autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. d. Subjects must have initiated
             systemic therapy for multiple myeloma ≤1 year prior to enrollment.

             3. Subjects must not have achieved a complete or stringent complete response according
             to IMWG 2016 criteria1 at time of enrollment unless clonal plasma cells are detectable
             in bone marrow by flow cytometry. (I.e., subjects in complete or stringent complete
             response are eligible if minimal residual disease can be documented by bone marrow
             flow cytometry). 4. Subjects must have signed written, informed consent. 5. Subjects
             must be ≥ 18 years of age. 6. Subjects must have adequate vital organ function:

               1. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 or creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min (measured or estimated
                  according to CKD-EPI) and not dialysis-dependent.

                  performed within 8 weeks of enrollment.

                  7. Toxicities from prior/ongoing therapies, with the exception of peripheral
                  neuropathy attributable to multiple myeloma therapy, must have recovered to grade
                  ≤ 2 according to the CTCAE 4.03 5.0 criteria or to the subject's prior baseline.

                       leptomeningeal disease, parenchymal masses) with myeloma. Screening for this
                       (e.g. with lumbar puncture) is not required unless suspicious symptoms or
                       radiographic findings are present. Subjects with calvarial disease that
                       extends intracranially and involves the dura will be excluded, even if CSF
