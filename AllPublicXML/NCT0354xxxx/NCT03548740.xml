  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since other genital infections enhance HIV susceptibility by inducing inflammation, the
      investigators study the relationship between the vaginal microbiota composition and the risk
      of HPV infection, cervical cytological abnormalities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent infection with oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary but not
      sufficient for the development of cervical cancer. Additional factors correlated with HPV
      persistence include immunodeficiency caused by HIV, smoking, use of oral contraceptives and,
      more recently reported, vaginal dysbiosis. In a state of dysbiosis, there is a marked
      reduction of Lactobacillus and a high diversity of bacteria, with increased abundance of
      anaerobic bacterial species. Based on this, the investigators are going to analyze the
      changes of microbiota in women with high-risk HPV and the cervical lesions. And the
      investigators hope to figure out the difference and change in microbiota to realize the
      tanning of cervical lesions.
