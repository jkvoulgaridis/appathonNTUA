  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is commonly accompanied in patients undergoing
      surgery under general anesthesia. The patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery
      have multiple risk factors for developing PONV such as female gender, nonsmoker,
      postoperative opioids, and laparoscopic surgery. Thus, it is important to prevent PONV in
      these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium is a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist that is known to be effective in
      reducing opioid consumption and controlling postoperative pain. This opioid reducing effect
      can be associated with reduction of the incidence of PONV. However, the effect of magnesium
      on preventing PONV have not been investigated before. Thus, the investigators hypothesized
      that intraoperative infusion of magnesium will be effective in preventing PONV in patients
      undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.
