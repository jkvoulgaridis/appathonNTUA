    <textblock>
      Multicentre, prospective cohort study in patients with a history of HF with preserved or
      reduced ejection fraction admitted to hospital with acutely decompensated HF. Eligible and
      consenting patients will be enrolled at 3 Hamilton, Ontario area hospitals and receive 28-day
      ECG monitoring implemented at the time of hospital discharge. Patients will be followed for a
      total of 1 year from hospital discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients discharged from hospital after an admission for acute heart failure (HF)
      decompensation, subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) of 30 minutes or greater in duration is
      common (at least 15% of patients without prior AF) and is associated with increased risk of
      re-hospitalization within 30-days.

      Study Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the prevalence of subclinical AF ≥30 minutes in duration in patients
           discharged from hospital following an admission for acute HF exacerbation and who have
           no known history of clinical AF.

        2. To examine the temporal association between subclinical AF ≥30 minutes in duration and
           30-day hospital readmission for HF.

    <description>Measured by simple questionnaire that has not been validated. Patients will be asked to respond to satisfaction questions on a scale of a) strongly agree b) agree c) somewhat agree d) disagree or e) strongly disagree. The questions will ask about their experience with the device, such as: were instructions on using the device clear, the device was easy to use, the device did not limit my usual daily activities, the size of the device was not cumbersome, etc.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Hospitalized with a most responsible diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure.

          2. Clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure as per the Boston criteria (i.e. score
             ≥8)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of clinical atrial fibrillation

          2. History of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease.

          3. End stage renal disease or advanced renal dysfunction (e.g. estimated glomerular
             filtration rate, eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m2)

          4. Cardiothoracic surgery in the past 30 days or imminently planned (does not include
             percutaneous procedures).

          5. Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent.

          6. Presence of a pacemaker or an ICD with an atrial lead (which can already diagnose AF).
