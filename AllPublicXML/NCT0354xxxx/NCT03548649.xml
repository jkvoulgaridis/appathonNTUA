  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, there are more than 23,000 individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI, mean age:
      27 years), with an increment of new 1,200 SCI individuals each year. Recovery of ambulatory
      function is among the most important therapeutic goals because 92% of the individuals with
      SCI have to use the wheelchair for the rest of their lives.

      The lower limb powered exoskeleton robot, FREE Walk, used for training in this research was
      developed by FREE Bionics Inc. The main purpose of this research is to test the safety and
      feasibility of FREE Walk exoskeleton robot. In addition, the research will further
      investigate the range of injury levels for the intended SCI users and the learning time
      needed for the users to independently operate the exoskeleton robot.

      Individuals with SCI who meet the inclusion criteria will be referred to the investigators.
      Participants will be given consent forms and explained the research before participating. The
      participants must pass the initial evaluation described below in order to go through robot
      training: (1) medical history, (2) bone density, (3) joint range of motion, ROM (4) strength
      (manual muscle test, MMT), (5) muscle tone (modified Ashworth scale, MAS).

      The training program consists of 5-min preparation, 50-min of functional activities training
      including weight shifting, sit-down, stand-up, stepping and walking, and 5-min training
      feedback. Every participant will receive at least 20 training sessions (1 hour per session,
      2-5 sessions per week) and an post-training evaluation after completion of training. The
      post-training evaluation includes the following tests: timed up-and-go test, 10-meter walk
      test, and 6-minute walk test.
