  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HHT is a relative rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder of the fibrovascular tissue.
      Diagnosis of HHT is often delayed for decades (Pierucci 2012). However, it would be desirable
      to achieve an early diagnosis as early screening and treatment decrease disease-associated
      complications and increase life expectancy (Kroon 2018). Our approach is a nationwide call
      and awareness campaign to dentists in Germany, as nearly all persons visit a dentist from
      time to time. This approach is promising to us, as most patients develop nosebleeds and
      multiple, typical telangiectases of the skin or mucosa. A predilection site is the oral
      mucosa and the face, including the lips (Shovlin 2000).

      The German self-help group is taking down the number of inquiries from patients and
      physicians per months since April 2017. In June 2018 an article about HHT is planned to be
      published in the journal of the German dental association and the Federal Association of Fund
      Dentists of Germany. This journal is distributed to all dentists in Germany and is a set book
      for them. Total circulation in 2017 was 77,621
      (http://www.aerzteverlag.de/portfolio/fachwissen-medizindental/zm-zahnaerztliche-mitteilungen
      /profil/ ). The article describes the case of visceral abscesses after dental screening in a
      patient with HHT and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. These could probably have been
      prevented if the dentist had prescribed an antibiotic prophylaxis to the patient. The article
      includes a call to search for telangiectases. If those are seen the dentist is recommended to
      ask the patient if he or relatives have nosebleeds. If both apply, the dentist is asked to
      inform the patient about HHT and give him the address of the national German self-help group.

      After 3 and 6 months a reminder shall be published in the same journal.

        Telagiectases seen by the dentist should lead to the question if the patient or relatives
        have nosebleeds. If both apply, the dentist is asked to inform the patient about Hereditary
        Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and give the address of the national German self-help group to
        the patient.
