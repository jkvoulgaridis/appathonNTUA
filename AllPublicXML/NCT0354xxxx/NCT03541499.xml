  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, partially blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial evaluating a single
      intranasal dose of BPZE1 in healthy adults. The study will evaluate a lyophilized formulation
      of the product, with the goal of testing for the optimal dose for subsequent clinical trials.
      Fifty healthy adults, 18-49 years of age will be randomized to one of the four following
      treatment groups in a 3:3:3:1 ratio: 10^7 colony forming units (CFU) of BPZE1 administered by
      VaxINator device, 10^9 CFU of BPZE1 administered by VaxINator device, placebo administered by
      VaxINator device, 10^9 CFU of BPZE1 administered by needleless tuberculin syringe. Study
      duration will be approximately 12 months with a subject participation duration of
      approximately 6 months. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of a single intranasal dose of either 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of lyophilized BPZE1
      vaccine.

      This is a phase 2a, single center, randomized, partially blind, placebo controlled, clinical

      CFU of BPZE1 in healthy adults. The study will evaluate a lyophilized formulation of the

      BPZE1 administered by VaxINator device, placebo administered by VaxINator device, 10^9 CFU of
      BPZE1 administered by needleless tuberculin syringe. Study duration will be approximately 12
      months with a subject participation duration of approximately 6 months. The primary objective
      of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single intranasal dose of either
      10^7 or 10^9 CFU of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine. The secondary objectives of this study are: 1)
      to assess the humoral immunogenicity of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine at Day 15, Day 29 and Day
      181 following receipt of one intranasal dose of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1; 2) to assess
      mucosal immunogenicity of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine at Day 29 and Day 181 following receipt
      of one intranasal dose of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1; 3) to evaluate nasal clearance of BPZE1
      by culture at Day 29 (and if still positive, at Day 46) following receipt of one intranasal
      dose of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible to participate in this study must meet all inclusion criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all
             study visits.

          3. Males or non-pregnant females, 18-49 years of age, inclusive.

          4. In good health*.

             *As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
             currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have
             been present for at least 90 days that would affect the assessment of the safety of
             subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or
             conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic
             prescription medication, dose, or frequency because of deterioration of the chronic
             medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription
             change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that
             is done for financial reasons, if it is in the same class of medication, will not be
             considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription
             medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site
             principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a
             deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)
             medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of
             reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis
             or condition. Similarly, medication changes after enrollment and study vaccination are
             acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical
             condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk to
             the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination.
             Note: Topical and inhaled medications (with the exception of inhaled or nasal
             corticosteroids within 30 days prior to enrollment), herbals, vitamins, and
             supplements are permitted.

          5. Oral temperature is &lt; / = 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

          6. Pulse is 45 to 100 bpm, inclusive*. *Pulse can be 45 to 50 bpm, inclusive, if no other
             symptoms are present. Otherwise, pulse should be 50-100 bpm.

          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive.

          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mm Hg, inclusive.

          9. White blood cell count is 3,900 cells/microliter or greater*.

             *Abnormalities in white blood count, hemoglobin, platelet count, alanine
             aminotransferase, and serum creatinine that are suspected to be due to laboratory
             anomalies may be repeated once to ensure accuracy; additionally, otherwise eligible
             subjects with grade 1 abnormalities in these values may be considered for enrollment
             if, in the opinion of the investigator (or clinician on the 1572), the abnormalities
             are not clinically significant and do not pose additional risk to the study or the
             volunteer.

         10. Hemoglobin is 13.0 g/dL or greater (men) or 11.8 g/dL or greater (women)*.
             *Abnormalities in white blood count, hemoglobin, platelet count, alanine
             aminotransferase, and serum creatinine that are suspected to be due to laboratory
             anomalies may be repeated once to ensure accuracy; additionally, otherwise eligible
             subjects with grade 1 abnormalities in these values may be considered for enrollment
             if, in the opinion of the investigator (or clinician on the 1572), the abnormalities
