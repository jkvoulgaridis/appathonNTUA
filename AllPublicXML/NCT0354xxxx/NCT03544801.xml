      We aim to make clear the impact with the mechanisms of variant pathological injuries on the
      outcomes of CSVD, to find independent imaging markers and establish prediction model of it.

    <textblock>
      A cohort of post stroke cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) patients with different
      cognitive status are consecutively recruited in this study. Detailed full domain cognitive
      assessment and multi-modal MRI (including brain morphology , DTI indices, microbleed counts,
      brain volumes as well as brain network characters, etc.) are performed. Cognitive
      states(including attention-executive function, memory, language, visuo-spatial and global
      cognition with the transition to dementia) and the overall prognosis (cardiovascular events,
      stroke recurrence, death due to cardiovascular event and all cause death) are longitudinally
      followed up. The correlations between baseline and followed MRI parameters with the outcomes
      are analyzed in order to make clear the impact with the mechanisms of variant pathological
      injuries on the outcomes of CSVD, to find independent imaging markers and establish
      prediction model of it.
