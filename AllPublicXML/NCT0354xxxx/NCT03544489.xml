    <textblock>
      This is the first feasibility test of a highly portable home-based exercise intervention
      after an ICD, using technology monitoring (rather than self-report) of intervention progress
      and outcomes. Evidence for intervention effectiveness will inform algorithms for initiating
      exercise post-ICD more broadly in clinical practice. This study aligns directly with recent
      scientific statements that recommend testing behavioral interventions for ICD patients that
      are based on participant engagement, use cognitive behavioral approaches, and are readily
      available when most needed.

      The goal of this study is to test an exercise intervention that we developed in previous RCTS
      for feasibility in routine clinical practice. Based on results from our two completed
      randomized trials of exercise after an ICD, the investigators created a home based exercise
      program called (E-ICD) for use in routine practice that assists individuals to start and
      monitor exercise safely after an ICD. The study uses a randomized, two group parallel
      mixed-methods intervention trial, to determine the feasibility of the home-based E-ICD
      exercise program in routine clinical care. Ninety patients in 3 study sites (30/site) will
      participate in this 2 year study. The study sites are in the greater Seattle, WA area. This
      intervention study is guided by the Reach-Efficacy-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance
      (RE-AIM) model. The E-ICD intervention consists of 12 weeks of home walking exercise after an
      ICD using the E-ICD program, with an exercise prescription and protocols validated in our
      previous work. The primary outcome of the study is total physical activity (steps/day) at 3
      months. Measures will be taken at baseline, after the intervention at 3 months, and at 6
      months. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) determine the reach, adoption and
      implementation of E-ICD into the clinical setting, 2) compare intervention efficacy for
      patient total daily activity (primary outcome) for E-ICD vs. usual care from baseline to
      intervention completion at 3 months, and 3) describe exercise maintenance for patient
      outcomes in E-ICD vs. usual care at 6 months.

    <description>E-ICD Intervention over 3 months, consists of home walking to achieve the goal of 30 minutes on all or most of the days at moderate level intensity. E-ICD elements are: 1) exercise instructional DVD and manual, 2) exercise monitoring tools (Polar HR monitor, Digi-walker, Borg scale, and exercise logs), and 3) telephone coaching by clinic RNs. Each participant receives an exercise prescription based on the ICD information using HR cut-offs, a minimum of 4 walking sessions/week will be prescribed. Exercise maintenance: At the 3 month conclusion of the E-ICD intervention, each patient will receive an exercise prescription based on the level they were able to achieve, with guidelines about increasing exercise to reach the target of 30 minutes/walking on all or most days over the ensuing 3 months. Participants will record walking sessions each week in the exercise logs that will be collected again at 6 months.</description>

    <description>Usual Care will receive treatment &quot;as usual&quot; from their health care clinicians with outcomes measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Participants will not be discouraged from physical activity, but will be asked not to change their current level of activity for 6 months while in the study. Usual care involves ICD interrogation and follow-up every 3 months, measured either in-person or with home telephonic transmissions. Because participants in usual care may choose to participate in another exercise program, we will monitor those who participate in exercise programs and use the StepWatch monitor to quantify the amount and timing of physical activity. To control for group differences in attention, investigators will telephone usual care participants requesting information about health care utilization twice during the study at 3 and 6 months.</description>
