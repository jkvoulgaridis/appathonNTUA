  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are going to establish &quot;organoid&quot; models from pancreatic cancer biopsies achieved via
      EUS-FNA. Then the sensitivity of the selected FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs will be tested
      in these organoids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The survival rate of pancreatic cancer, a kind of malignant tumor, remains poor due to lack
      of effective treatments. Recently, a new model called &quot;organoid&quot; has been generated from
      human and murine pancreatic cancer tissues. These organoids are developed from large pieces
      of surgical tissues or small biopsies taken from EUS-FNA guided samples. Here in our study we
      are going to establish &quot;organoid&quot; models from pancreatic cancer biopsies achieved via
      EUS-FNA. After successful generation of these organoids, we will treat them with the selected
      FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs, and assess the responses to these anti-cancer agents in our
      established organoids.
