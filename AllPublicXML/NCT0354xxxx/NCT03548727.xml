  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      66% of HNC patients present with advanced-stage disease at initial diagnosis. The 5-year
      survival rates for stages IVa, IVb, and IVc are 32%, 25%, and &amp;lt;4% respectively. Accurate
      pre-treatment staging is vital in determining the optimum procedure for the management of
      HNC. Early identification of non-responders may allow modification of their treatment through
      the introduction of more intensive therapies. Identifying prognostic factors that predict
      patient outcome will ultimately lead to new treatment regimens. Tumor hypoxia and
      proliferation are two key characteristics of cancer that were shown to correlate with poor
      response to treatment in HNC. In this proposal, the investigators assess the prognostic
      values of these two markers. Combining information from these two biological markers shall
      result in prognostic information superior to those of any of the two separately. Imaging
      those vital tumor characteristics simultaneously shall provide more coherent assessment of
      tumor microenvironment than does registration of corresponding images acquired in different
      imaging session, thus subject to uncertainties resulting from transient biologic changes and
      image registration process. The investigators propose to use a method that the investigators
      previously developed to simultaneously and non-invasively image tumor hypoxia (FMISO-PET) and
      proliferation (FLT-PET) within a single PET/CT study. CT Perfusion scan will be performed
      1st, followed by PET imaging with staggered FMISO and FLT injections. FMISO and FLT signals
      will be separated retrospectively using kinetic modeling. The investigators believe imaging
      tumor hypoxia and cell proliferation simultaneously yield information underpinning for
      image-guided and radiobiological based dose painting, adaptive therapy, and patient medical
      management. If successful, this pilot study will constitute the basis for a NIH grant
      proposal that aims to improve treatment outcome assessment in HNC.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the feasibility to tease out the FMISO and FLT kinetics in simultaneous FMISO/FLT PET/CT imaging. FMISO and FLT kinetic parameters will be measured from the combined FMISO/FLT dynamic study. The accuracy of those measurements will be tested by comparing the FLT kinetic measurements deduced from the combined FMISO/FLT study on day1 with those from the sole FLT study of day2.</description>

    <description>To assess the repeatability of FLT kinetics. Subjects will undergo two dynamic FLT PET studies up to 3 days apart. The repeatability of the corresponding kinetic parameters from the two studies will be measured using statistical methods (e.g. Bland-Altman analysis)</description>
