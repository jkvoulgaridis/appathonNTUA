  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether IV acetaminophen can decrease the need for
      subsequent opioid administration in the acute management of sickle cell crisis pain in the
      pediatric emergency room.

      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study in an
      academic urban pediatric emergency department of children with sickle cell disease presenting
      with acute sickle cell crisis pain between ages of 4 to 16 years, with a pain score of 6/10
      or higher on the Wong-Baker modified FACES pain scale. In order to detect a difference of 0.2
      mg/kg in cumulative dosage of morphine (at our institution, 0.3 mg/kg morphine deems an
      inpatient admission for parenteral pain management) with 80% power and alpha of 0.05, we
      calculated a sample size of 33 patients in each group. All patients will receive IV ketorolac
      and IV morphine. Patients will be randomized to receive IV acetaminophen or IV saline
      (volume-equivalent). Pain scores will be obtained at baseline, and again at 30 minutes, 60
      minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes after medication administration. Cumulative morphine
      dosing, rates of admission, and rates of adverse effects of morphine will also be analyzed.
      Our primary objective is to decrease the need for subsequent opioid administration. Our
      secondary objectives are to determine if IV Acetaminophen decreases pain score at 30 minutes,
      60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes, decreases the rate of admissions, and decreases the
      rate of adverse effects from opioids.
