  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of JNJ-55308942: 1) high dose at steady
      state on the single dose pharmacokinetics of a cocktail containing selective probes of
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) in healthy adult participants (Part
      1); 2) high dose at steady state on the single dose pharmacokinetics of a combination oral
      contraceptive containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol in healthy female participants
      (Part 2); and 3) low dose at steady state on the single dose pharmacokinetics of a cocktail
      containing selective probes of CYP enzymes (CYP3A, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) in healthy adult
      participants (Part 3).

             neurologic, hematologic (including coagulation disorders), rheumatologic, psychiatric,
             or metabolic disturbances, any inflammatory illness or any other illness that the
             Investigator considers should exclude the participant

          -  History of or current positive testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
             Hepatitis B core (HBcAb) or hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) positive, or other
             clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for HBsAg or anti-HCV at screening

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or tests positive for
             HIV at screening

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, with written concurrence with the sponsor's
             medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)

          -  History of at least drug or alcohol use disorder according to Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (latest edition DSM-5) criteria within 6 months
