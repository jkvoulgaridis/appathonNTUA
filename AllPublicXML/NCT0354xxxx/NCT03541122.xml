  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetabular dysplasia often accompanies by acetabular bone hyperplasia and osteonecrosis of
      the femoral head. These pathological changes can alter the position of the center of the
      femoral head. Thus, measurement errors will be generated on the anteroposterior radiographs
      of the adult pelvis involving centre-edge angle, acetabular angle (Sharp angle), and
      acetabular head index, eventually resulting in the inaccurate diagnosis of acetabular
      dysplasia. Herein, the investigators describe the protocol to verify three novel X-ray
      indicators, including offshoring index (OFI), moving up index (MUI) and teardrop baseline
      offshoring index (TBOI) of the femoral head. All data will be expressed as relative ratios,
      as the investigators expect to make an accurate diagnosis through avoiding the generation of
      errors resulting from measurement angles.

    <textblock>
      Acetabular dysplasia is a developmental malformation of the hip joint where the acetabulum
      become shallow and cannot fully cover the femoral head and the centre of the hip joint moves
      outward, resulting in an increased risk for joint subluxation or dislocation.

      Current diagnosis of acetabular dysplasia mainly depends on the pelvic anteroposterior X-ray
      film to understand whether there is dislocation of the hip joint, whether the concentricity
      of the femoral head and acetabulum is consistent, and whether there is secondary
      osteoarthritis or other hip diseases, such as femoral head ischemic necrosis, hip joint
      tuberculosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The commonly used measurement indicators include
      centre-edge (CE) angle, acetabular angle (Sharp angle), and acetabular head index (AHI).
      Moreover, some differences exist in the measurement results between male and female patients.
      Acetabular dysplasia often accompanies by acetabular bone hyperplasia and necrosis of the
      femoral head, which have a greater impact on radiographic measurements, especially when
      measured with angles. It is difficult to determine the radiological landmark for the lateral
      edge of the acetabular roof due to the existence of bone hyperplasia, which produces a great
      influence on the accuracy of the measurement of the centre-edge angle and Sharp angle.

    <description>Patients will undergo pelvic X-ray examinations. Measurement indicators will include OFI, MUI, TBOI, CE angle, Sharp angle and AHI of the affected and healthy femoral heads. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of OFI, MUI and TBOI for the diagnosis of adult acetabular dysplasia, and compare the accuracy of diagnosis between these three indicators and CE angle, sharp angle, and AHI. Further analysis of risk factors for hip function will be implemented.</description>
