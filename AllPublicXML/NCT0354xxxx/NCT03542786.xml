  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate a therapy for the inflammaging (premature
      aging).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's been demonstrated that the HIV-1 virus is associated to the reduction of the microbiota.
      Some studies suggest that because of this bacterial reduction, the premature aging appears.
      So this study aims to demonstrate that our probiotic can balance the microbiota as a
      preventive solution for the inflammaging.

    <intervention_model_description>100 patients will be included in this trial. Patients will be randomized 2: 2: 1 to one of the following 3 branches according to the use of integrase inhibitors (INI), protease inhibitors (PI) or non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( ITINAN) and according to the CD4 count nadir is greater or less or equal to 200 cells / mm3: Branch A: add probiotic i3.1 to the antiretroviral therapy Branch B: add probiotic i3.1 and ProSeed prebiotic to the antiretroviral therapy Branch C: add placebo to ART The treatment periods will be of 6 months and follow-up will be carried out at month, at 3 months and at 6 after the start of the study treatment, and a last visit will be made at 3 months after discontinuing it (wash-out period).</intervention_model_description>
