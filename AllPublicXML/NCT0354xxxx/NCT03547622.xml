  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a randomized pilot feasibility study to evaluate the effects
      of galantamine versus placebo on preventing relapse to opioid use following tapering from
      methadone or buprenorphine maintenance (Medication Assisted Treatment, or MAT) among adults
      with opioid use disorder, with additional behavioral therapy (web-based cognitive behavioral
      therapy) provided across all conditions to help individuals successfully transition from MAT
      to a drug-free state.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study to examine the potential use of galantamine as an adjunct to
      the standard buprenorphine or methadone taper in the context of behavioral support. Early
      abstinence from opioids is associated with high relapse rates and there is a great need to
      develop interventions that will prevent relapse to opioid use.

      In this randomized pilot, 30 adults enrolled in the methadone or buprenorphine maintenance
      programs at the APT Foundation and who have sought a medically supervised, voluntary taper
      from these medications will be offered participation in a double-blind, placebo controlled,
      randomized trial of galantamine as an adjunct to standard tapering procedures at this clinic
      along with the combined approach utilizing concurrent behavior therapy. Primary outcomes will
      be: (1) successful completion of taper (achieving a methadone/buprenorphine dose of 0), (2)
      opioid withdrawal symptoms, and (3) opioid use, assessed by self-report and urine samples
      during and up to 3 months after the end of opioid taper. The investigators will also closely
      monitor patient comfort and safety (assessed by opioid withdrawal symptoms, adverse events,
      with measures of stress, sleep and pain) as well as cognitive function (assessed by the
      CANTAB).

          -  Are male and females, between the ages of 18 and 65

          -  Are enrolled in the APT methadone or buprenorphine program, have been stabilized for
             at least one year, and who voluntarily wish to taper off MAT.

          -  For women of child-bearing age, have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening,

             treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are undergoing administrative (non-voluntary) tapering (e.g., example due to
