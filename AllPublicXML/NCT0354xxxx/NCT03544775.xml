  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective, population-based cohort study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness
      of peripheral nerve blocks on patient outcomes after ambulatory shoulder surgery in adults
      patients undergoing surgery in Ontario.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, investigators will validate health administrative data codes to demonstrate the
      accuracy of Ontario-wide anesthesia type and regional anesthesia interventions using a
      reference standard (Ottawa Hospital Data Warehouse data). Then, these validated exposures, in
      combination with validated outcome measures, will be used to examine the impact of anesthesia
      interventions on patient and health system outcomes for ambulatory shoulder surgery.

        This will be a retrospective, population-based, cohort study based in Ontario, Canada. Our
        study population will include all Ontario residents, aged 18 years and older, who have
        undergone elective ambulatory shoulder surgery. The study period extends from April 2009 to
        March 2016.

          -  Elective ambulatory shoulder surgery performed in Ontario between April 2009 and
             December 2016.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Emergency Surgery

          -  If a patient undergoes multiple elective shoulder surgeries within the time period,
