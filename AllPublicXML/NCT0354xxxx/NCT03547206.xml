  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) administration of RPh201 in
      participants with previous NAION. All participants enrolled in Cohort A of the study will
      have a documented history of NAION for at least 12 months and at most, five years prior to
      enrollment. Participants enrolled in Cohort B of the study will have a documented history of
      NAION for at least 6 months and at most, three years prior to enrollment.

      This study is designed as a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SC administration of RPh201 in participants with previous
      NAION.

      Following a screening phase of 1-8 weeks, participants will attend a baseline visit in which
      they will undergo testing and visual function assessments. Participants then will be
      randomized to receive RPh201 or control.

      Cohort A After randomization, participants will begin a 26-week schedule consisting of
      twice-weekly treatment. Participants will return to the clinic for visits at Week 1, Week 4,
      Week 12 and Week 26 and Week 52

      Cohort B After randomization, participants will begin a 12-week schedule consisting of
      four-times-per-week treatment. Participants will return to the clinic for visits at Week 4
      and Week 12.

      Safety and efficacy parameters will be recorded throughout the duration of the study.

          8. The participant has a medical condition, social or psychological issue, or other
             condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, could be a safety concern or
