  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple solid tumors have positive targets of mesothelin expressed on the surfaces of the
      tumor cells, we use the technique of CRISPR-Cas9 to knocked out the PD-1 and TCR of chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to effect the immuno-microenvironment around tumors.

      1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated PD-1 and TCR gene-knocked
           out chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients with mesothelin positive
           multiple solid tumors.

        2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of transferred CAR-T cells.

        3. To observe and measure anti-tumor responses for patients with detectable mesothelin
           positive tumor lesions.

             bile duct obstruction by tumor v. Creatinine &lt; 1.5x the institutional normal upper
             limit vi. Albumin ≥2 vii. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 5x the institutional normal upper limit viii. Cardiac
             ejection fraction of &gt;55% as measured by resting echocardiogram, with no significant
             pericardial effusion.

          8. Blood coagulation parameters: PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is ≤
             1.5 and a PTT &lt; 1.2 time the upper limit of normal unless the patient is
             therapeutically anti-coagulated for history of cancer-related thrombosis and has
             stable coagulation parameters.

             induced pericarditis or that may worsen as a result of toxicities expected for this
             study. This determination will be made by a cardiologist.
