  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study AG348-C-006 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered AG-348 as
      compared with placebo in participants with pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD), who are not
      regularly receiving blood transfusions. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either
      AG-348 or matching placebo. The study is comprised of two parts. During the Part 1 Dose
      Optimization Period of the study, participants will start on a dose of 5 mg AG-348
      administered twice daily. Over the course of Part 1, each participant's dose of AG-348 may be
      sequentially increased to 20 mg twice a day, followed by 50 mg twice a day depending on their
      tolerance. During the Part 2 Fixed-Dose Period, participants will receive AG-348 at their
      optimized dose from Part 1.
