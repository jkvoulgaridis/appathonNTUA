  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, the estimated prevalence of patients with ESRD receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD)
      or maintenance hemodialysis (HD) increased from 51.7 per million population (pmp) at the end
      of 2007 to 79.1 pmp at the end of 2008. There is a growing body of evidence that large uremic
      solutes play a significant role in clinical complications in dialysis patients. Since
      high-flux membranes show low permeability for large uremic solutes, extracorporeal blood
      purification treatments using these membranes have failed to significantly eliminate and
      reduce plasma levels of these molecules. To remove large sized uremic solutes by dialysis the
      membrane needs to have adequate permeability properties (pore size, porosity) for these
      solutes. The Theranova 400 contains a dialysis membrane that has a sharper sieving profile
      and a higher cutoff than that in conventional high-flux dialysis membranes. The primary
      objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Theranova Dialyzer compared
      to the FX80 with clinical endpoints.
