  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Malignant tumors may lead to a catabolic state with loss of muscle and adipose
      tissue. The full picture of catabolism is termed cachexia and is associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality of cancer patients. Although the full picture is rarely observed up
      to 50% of children with cancer suffer from significant malnourishment. Additionally to
      tumor-induced catabolism, side-effects of chemotherapy may be problematic for the patients.
      In this regard up to 60% of children suffer from gastrointestinal mucositis presenting with
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation and abdominal pain. In the worst case, mucositis
      may lead to bacterial translocation with life-threatening inflammatory response. Clinically
      this may require a reduction of the dosage or the number of chemotherapy cycles resulting in
      reduced effectivity. Up to now the therapy of mucositis is only symptomatic. Recent research
      of the applicant has shown a significant reduction of Lactobacilli in mice with neuroblastoma
      (a malignant childhood tumor). The dysbiosis was associated with catabolism, increased gut
      permeability and inflammation. Astonishingly, chemotherapy alone also leads to a significant
      reduction of Lactobacilli compared to sham mice, which may be linked to the development of
      mucositis clinically. Overall, the intestinal microbiome seems to play an essential role in
      the development of tumor-associated catabolism and chemotherapy-induced mucositis.

      Aim: The aim of this project is to determine if the changes in the intestinal microbiome
      observed in mice can also be seen in children with neuroblastoma.

      Methods: One part of the study will include 10 children with neuroblastoma (inclusion after
      verification of the diagnosis) and 10 healthy controls. The fecal microbiome will be
      determined by 16S-ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) pyrosequencing. Volatile organic
      compounds in the breath will be sampled and measured by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy.
      A basic science human work package will address the question if there are differences.

      In the second part serial investigations in children with neuroblastoma will assess whether
      or not these patients show alterations of the intestinal microbiome under chemotherapy.
