      Pembrolizumab plus autologous dendritic cell vaccine in patients with PD-L1 negative advanced
      mesothelioma who have failed prior therapies.This is an exploratory, single-arm, open-label,
      phase 1b clinical trial.

      Patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg and autologous dendritic cell vaccine every 3
      weeks for the first 6 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks until confirmed
      progression or for a maximum of 2 years (see Figure 1 Study Schema).

      After each vaccine administration patients will receive IL-2 3 MU s.c. for 5 days, from day
      +2 to day +6.

      Pembrolizumab plus autologous dendritic cell vaccine in patients with PD-L1 negative advanced
      mesothelioma who have failed prior therapies.This is an exploratory, single-arm, open-label,
      phase 1b clinical trial.

      The study will explore treatment safety and the ability to induce PD-L1 expression of the
      study treatment. Secondary objective will include clinical activity and immunological
      efficacy.

      18 Patients will be enrolled . To ensure patients' protection and avoid unacceptable
      toxicity, a formal safety analysis will be conducted after six patients have been observed
      for at least 30 days after the third treatment cycle.

      The study will be conducted on PD-L1 negative advanced mesothelioma patients with progressive
      disease after standard therapy. Previous therapies must have included an antifolate agent and
      a platinum compound.

      Study treatment: Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV q3w until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity
      or informed consent withdrawal, or for a maximum of 2 years Autologous dendritic cells loaded
      with autologous tumor homogenate, 107 cells ID q3w for up to six doses Interleukin-2 3 MU
      s.c. from day +2 to day +6 after each DC administration.

             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Patients who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiotherapy
             within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         11. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis or
             interstitial lung disease.

         12. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         16. Any known history of or positivity of any serologic marker indicative of infection by
             Treponema pallidum, hepatitis B virus (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAB), hepatitis C virus (HCVAb,
             HCV RNA quantitative), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), whether actual or previous.
             The sole positivity for antibodies against the HBsAg Ab (i.e. with all other HBV
             markers negative) is indicative of previous HBV vaccination and therefore is
             acceptable.

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.
