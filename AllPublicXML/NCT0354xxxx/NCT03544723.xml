      This is a Phase 2 study of the combination of Ad-p53 administered intra-tumorally in
      combination with physician's choice of FDA approved immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic cancers. This is a safety and efficacy study with a
      single cohort, consisting of the combination of Ad-p53 and infusions of immune checkpoint
      inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments will be administered in accordance with
      FDA package inserts. Comparison will be made to historical data. General safety and
      preliminary efficacy will be determined using RECIST 1.1, ECOG status and Immune-Related
      Response Criteria. Biomarker testing of archival or fresh tissue is performed during the
      study. Enrollment will be up to 40 patients.
