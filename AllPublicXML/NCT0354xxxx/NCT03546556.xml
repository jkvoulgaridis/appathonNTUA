  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic HSCT is potentially curative for numerous high risk hematologic malignancies and
      offers several advantages over traditional chemotherapy. First, higher doses of cytotoxic
      chemotherapy and/or irradiation can be given since patients are subsequently rescued from the
      severe myelosuppression induced by the pre-transplant conditioning regimen by the infusion of
      healthy hematopoietic stem cells.

      Second and perhaps more importantly, mature T cells contained in the graft are able to mount
      immune responses against residual cancer cells surviving the conditioning regimen due to
      major and/or minor MHC disparities between the donor and recipient. Unfortunately, the
      allo-immune responses driving the GVL effect are typically not specific for malignant cells.
      As a consequence, donor immune cells attack normal host tissues resulting in a process known
      as acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD is primarily T cell driven, usually
      occurs within the first few months after transplant, and results in skin rash, diarrhea,
      cholestatic liver damage, and, on occasion, acute lung injury.

      The current proposal explores the use of a novel imaging modality, FLT PET/MRI, to correlate
      allogeneic transplant outcomes with FLT and MRI findings during early stem cell engraftment
      and at a later time point following stable count recovery. Specifically, this study will
      determine if the strength of the early FLT signal within the bone marrow correlates with
      engraftment success and if isolated areas of cellular proliferation within the marrow at a
      later time point might predict for leukemia relapse. In addition, based on the important role
      that host lymphoid tissues are known to play in GVHD pathogenesis in mice, this study will
      determine if the FLT signal within host SLT after transplant can predict for the development
      of GVHD in human BMT patients. Because FLT imaging by itself cannot distinguish between bone
      marrow engraftment/proliferation and the allo-immune driven T cell expansion that ultimately
      results in GVHD, this study will image autologous transplant patients as a comparator arm.
      Autologous HSCT like allogeneic transplantation involves the administration of very high
      doses of chemotherapy to high risk cancer patients in order to achieve better tumor kill.
      However, in this situation patients are administered their own cryopreserved stem cells to
      reconstitute the ablated hematopoietic system. Under those circumstances there is no
      allo-immune reactivity to drive T cell activation and expansion after transplant, and as a
      result there is no GVHD in the autologous transplant setting. Thus, these patients will help
      us to elucidate how much of the FLT signal seen in the allogeneic setting is the result of
      allo-immune driven T cell expansion.
