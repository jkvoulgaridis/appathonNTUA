  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of insulin and pramlintide
      is better than insulin alone at helping the pancreas release glucagon in response to a low
      blood sugar episode.

      A secondary goal is to assess whether basal pramlintide will delay gastric emptying.

      Participation in this study will require three (3) study visits over 12 weeks: one screening
      visit lasting 2-3 hours, and two overnight study visits at the university's Clinical Research
      Unit (CRU). The two overnight visits will last about 22 hours.

      During the CRU admission, all subjects will wear a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) starting
      2-3 days prior to the CRU admission and after having a CGM training.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to either insulin- or exercise-induced hypoglycemia
      group. Each subject will have two overnight CRU admissions in randomized order: Experimental
      (basal pramlintide + 25% reduction of basal insulin) or Control (standard basal insulin
      therapy) admissions. During these two admissions, the study team will deliberately induce
      hypoglycemia as follows:

      Subjects randomized to insulin-induced hypoglycemia admission will receive an insulin
      bolus(s) dosed to reach blood sugar of less than 55 mg/dL.

      Subjects randomized to exercise-induced hypoglycemia will participate in three 15 minute
      exercise bouts (45 minutes total) to lower blood sugar to less than 55 mg/dL.

      After hypoglycemia induction, all subjects will receive one and the same standard meal
      (lunch) mixed with 1.5 g liquid acetaminophen to measure how quickly acetaminophen is
      absorbed to estimate the rate of gastric emptying.

      The study team will collect blood samples during the hypoglycemic induction and the gastric
      emptying monitoring which will be analysed for levels of various substances used to address
      the study goals.

    <description>The primary outcome is the relative glucagon counterregulation (GCR) response, computed as the ratio between average glucagon concentration in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and the pre-hypoglycemic baseline value. The baseline glucagon level is defined as the average concentration of glucagon when the falling plasma glucose is below 100mg/dl but above the hypoglycemic threshold of 60mg/dl. The response to hypoglycemia is the average concentration of glucagon between the hypoglycemic threshold crossing point and the time of the meal ingestion.</description>
