  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive minute ventilation for patients who experience cardiac arrest may cause pulmonary
      injury and decrease the overall effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
      Although clinicians are trained with the correct technique for manual ventilation, evidence
      still shows that clinicians tend to deliver a higher respiratory rate than recommended during
      CPR. Little is known about tidal volume delivery during CPR; either the amount of volume give
      or even the impact of tidal volume on the effectiveness of CPR. There are many factors that
      may influence variations of tidal volumes and RR during CPR. These factors include
      distractions in the room (noise/cross talk), inability to assess tidal volume delivery,
      anxiety, and stress of the situation. This study will evaluate tidal volume and respiratory
      rate (RR) delivery during a simulated CPR situation. Participants will be asked to provide
      care for an intubated adult patient in cardiac arrest, which will include all components of
      advanced cardiac life support training.

      This will be a cross-sectional study, conducted during regularly scheduled ACLS courses at
      Rush University Medical Center. Enrollment will be by random assignment as participants
      arrive for the ACLS course. Those that consent to the study will be informed that the
      investigator's study is to observe ACLS performance, but the exact parameters being measured
      will not be disclosed in an effort to mitigate any changes in behaviors.

      During the course of the study, groups will be assigned sequentially, and the first group to
      participate will be termed as &quot;Group 1&quot;. Within the group, each participant will be assigned
      a letter to identify the sequence of rotation with the skills. For example, the first
      participant in group 1 to perform manual ventilation will be assigned the study identity of
      &quot;1A&quot;. The second person in the first group will be &quot;1B&quot;, and so on.

      During the ACLS megacode component of the ACLS training, each study participant will be given
      the opportunity to manually ventilate the simulated intubated adult patient, as per the
      normal rotation during a megacode. During the megacode, information will be collected via the
      NICO2 Respiratory Management System (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, Pennsylvania) that is
      attached to the endotracheal tube, which will be video recorded, as this system does not have
      function of data storage or downloaded. This is to assure each breath is captured so the
      study team can assure accuracy of data collection. None of the study participants will be
      video recorded.

      At the completion of the study, each participant will be debriefed on their performance and
      informed of the true nature of the study; which is to evaluate respiratory rate and tidal
      volume delivery during manual ventilation to an intubated patient during an ACLS rescue
      attempt.
