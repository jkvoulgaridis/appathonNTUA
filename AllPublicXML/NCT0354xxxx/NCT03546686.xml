      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of pre-operative cryoablation,
      ipilimumab and nivolumab versus standard pre-operative care on on 3-year Event Free Survival
      (EFS), in women with triple negative breast cancer after taxane-based neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. Our strategy combines two interventions: induced activation and maturation of
      dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens via local
      destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation. Second, we administer ipilimumab, a CTLA4
      blocking antibody that enhances the magnitude and potency of the tumor specific T cell
      response, with nivolumab, a PD-1 blocking antibody that interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell
      regulatory signaling. Women with residual triple negative resectable breast cancer after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be randomized to standard peri-operative management versus
      tumor cryoablation with pre-operative nivolumab and ipilimumab followed post-operative
      nivolumab. Women undergoing either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery are eligible.

          -  Women of childbearing potential** (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30

             after the last dose of investigational drug

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the
             start of nivolumab

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding

          -  Willing to adhere to the study visit schedule and the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in this protocol.

               -  &quot;Women of childbearing potential&quot; is defined as any female who has experienced
                  menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined
                  clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other
                  biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 62 must
                  have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40
                  mIU/mL.

        Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab will be
        instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 23 weeks after the last dose of
        investigational product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP
        will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose
        of investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of
        the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP
        use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with WOCBP
        use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history and concurrent diseases

               -  Autoimmune disease: subjects with a documented history of inflammatory bowel
                  disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are excluded from this
                  study as are subjects with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid
                  arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], Systemic Lupus
                  Erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]). Subjects
                  with motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre
                  Syndrome) are excluded from this study.

               -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
                  investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the
                  interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent or poorly
                  controlled diarrhea.

               -  Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies

               -  Chronic use of immunosuppressants and/or systemic corticosteroids (used in the
                  management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses). Brief periods of steroid
                  use, for example for the management of chemotherapy-associated toxicities, are
                  allowed. The use of corticosteroids on study is allowed for the treatment of
                  immune related adverse events (irAEs) and other medical conditions including
                  adrenal insufficiency.

               -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases
                  within 4 weeks prior to first dose of ipilimumab.

               -  Prior treatment with a CTLA4 inhibitor or PD1 inhibitor;

               -  Prior investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to ipilimumab/nivolumab;

               -  Prior therapy with any anti-cancer agents including chemotherapy, adjuvant
                  chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, surgery or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
                  prior to first dose of ipilimumab.
