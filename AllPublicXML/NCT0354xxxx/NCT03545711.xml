  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pretreated advanced colorectal cancer are recruited to the phase I portion of
      this prospective non-randomised study in an escalated dose cohort. The primary endpoint of
      the dose-escalation phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of anlotinib when given in combination with irinotecan. The phase II
      (dose-expansion) portion is designed to characterize the safety and potential efficacy of the
      combination therapy in pretreated advanced colorectal cancer patients.
