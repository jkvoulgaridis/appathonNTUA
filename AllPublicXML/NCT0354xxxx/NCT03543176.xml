  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to assess the burden of illness for, COPD using both
      patient-reported symptom burden and claims-based economic burden, among the subjects treated
      with single-inhaler dual therapy treatments, Fluticasone/Salmeterol FLUT/SAL; Advair) or
      Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UMEC/VI; Anoro) to support Global Initiative for Chronic Lung
      Disease (GOLD) category B recommendations. The study will use a health plan recruitment
      strategy and subject's will be recruited using Optum's health plan recruitment strategy to
      collect information relating to the subject's condition history, current treatment, smoking
      history, symptoms and symptom severity (Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale
      [mMRC] and COPD Assessment Test [CAT]), and demographic and sociodemographic characteristics.
      A total of 2700 subject's, are planned to be enrolled in the study to reach the target
      evaluable sample size, n=770 subjects. Following completion of data collection, results of
      the survey, will be merged with claims data, covering the 12-month Baseline period for
      analysis. Pharmacy and medical claims data, will be used to calculate all-cause and
      COPD-related health care utilization and costs, treatment patterns, and Baseline clinical
      characteristics. The study duration is estimated to be of 12-months.
