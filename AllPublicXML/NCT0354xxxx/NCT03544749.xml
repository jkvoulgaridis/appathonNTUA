  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The supraglottic airway device(SAD), as an alternative to the endotracheal tube is inserted
      into the oral cavity and seals the upper esophagus and the surrounding tissue, effectively
      securing airway. SAD has evolved in recent years to increase efficiency and secure safety.
      The recently developed Ambu® AuraGain™ is a second-generation SAD with a built-in gastric
      port and is designed to be fitted well in the larynx and oral cavity after insertion because
      the shaft is bent at an angle of 90 degrees and has an inflatable cuff.

      In a previous study, Ambu® AuraGain™ showed a higher sealing pressure and better fibreoptic
      finding compared to LMA Supreme in laparoscopic surgery.

      On the other hand, I-gel and Ambu® AuraGain™, both of the second-generation SAD, show
      comparatively excellent performance according to the results of previous studies. However,
      there are no studies comparing the characteristics of two airway devices in adults.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of I-gel and Ambu® AuraGain™ to make
      a difficult airway-like situation using cervical collar for adult patients receiving
      mechanical ventilation under general anesthesia.
