      Next Generation Sequencing in cancer: a feasibility study in France to assess sample circuit
      and to perform analyzes within a limited time.

    <textblock>
      The first France disease genomic medicine program in the field of cancer has been retained by
      the 2025 Genomic Medicine France Plan. This program, called MULTIPLI encompasses two
      innovative personalized medicine clinical trials in soft-tissue sarcoma and colorectal
      carcinoma involving targeted molecules according to the tumor profile of each patient.

      This 1st clinical research program aims implementing exome sequencing and RNA sequencing to
      determine the genomic profile and to provide a therapeutic decision for each patient. Genomic
      analyzes will be performed on different technical platforms: samples will be collected in
      each investigating center, nucleic acids extraction will be performed on two genetic
      platforms, Inca labeled and identified for the purpose of this study: Institut Bergonié and
      Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou. CNRGH (Centre National de Recherche en Génomique Humaine)
      was retained for operational platform genomics and Institut Bergonie for bioinformatics data
      processing. Each genomic profile will be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumor board
      which aims at providing a therapeutic decision for each patient and to propose a targeted
      treatment in case of actionable molecular alteration.

      The purpose of this program is to perform analysis on a set of gene, in order to provide
      results no more than after 6 weeks after the sample arrival on the biopathological platform.
      This gene panel analysis is based on the predefined list of genes that are direct targets of
      the drugs available in the MULTIPLI program.

      Before implanting this program in a large-scale launch, it was essential to set up a pilot
      study in order to evaluate both sample's management between several platforms, and the time
      to report the results, and to verify that it was in line with the objectives set.

    <description>Tumor and blood samples will be sequenced at medium-high coverage at the whole genome (exome) and transcriptome levels (RNA Seq). This will allow detecting variants in a larger set of samples even though only from the main clone will be precisely measured. The whole exome will be performed at a mean coverage of at least 60x for the normal DNA samples and 120x for the tumor DNA samples. The transcriptome of the tumor will be performed at enough depth of coverage to detect gene fusions, transcriptome variants and measure the digital expression of already annotated isoforms.
For both sequencing configurations:
Data from each cancer and normal genome will be analysed for the presence of somatic variants.
DNA and RNA sequencing results will be integrated.
Technical replication for the mutations / chromosome alterations / transcript fusions that most likely drive the tumour process will be performed via Target Resequencing of the genomic / coding regions of interest.</description>
