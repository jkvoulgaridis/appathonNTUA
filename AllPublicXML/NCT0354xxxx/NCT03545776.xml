  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge of the basic fundamental skills of electroencephalography would enable medical and
      nursing staffs to provide efficient and effective bedside EEG monitoring in critically ill
      patients.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of a 10-points EEG teaching program to allow
      bedside caregivers (medical and nursing intensive care unit staff) interpreting EEG in the
      critical care setting.

    <description>Medical and nursing staff will be given a 10-points EEG face-to-face initial training course that will be preceded by a pre-test evaluation and followed by delayed post-test evaluations.
Training will be followed by an online teaching consisting on additional questions and answers quizzes based on the 10 educational goals already described elsewhere.
In order to avoid any risk of intrasite contamination, all the learners benefiting from the training in the same department will be trained in a uniform time, with respect to the training schedule regarding post-test evaluations (day-1, day-15 and day-30). A final evaluation will be performed at day-90 after beginning of the training course.</description>
