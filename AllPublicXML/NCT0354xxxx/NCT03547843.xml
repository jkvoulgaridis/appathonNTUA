  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peer co-led education describes educators who are expert patients, user representatives or
      former patients, participating and teaching in educational interventions in cooperation with
      health care professionals. Peer co-led education is included in the Norwegian national
      guidelines for treatment of mental disorders, but despite some promising results for the
      treatment of other conditions, still little is known about the efficacy of peer co-led
      educational group interventions interventions for adults with attention deficit and
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

      This pilot trial will evaluate patient satisfaction with and preliminary efficacy of a
      2-session peer co-led educational group program designed to address specific challenges faced
      by adults diagnosed with ADHD at an outpatient clinics in mid-Norway.
