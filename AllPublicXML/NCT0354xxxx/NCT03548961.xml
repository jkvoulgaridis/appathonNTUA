  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by local excision
      and post-operative chemoradiotherapy in patients with early stage, low rectal adenocarcinoma.
      After completion of pre-treatment tests/procedures (including pelvic MRI/ERUS; MRI is
      mandatory at baseline and other imaging is encouraged) and confirmation of eligibility,
      systemic therapy with FOLFOX will be administered for 12 weeks. 2 to 4 weeks after the
      chemotherapy, restaging of the primary tumor will be done to evaluate response to therapy
      (Pelvic MRI and /or sigmoidoscopy). Patients with disease progression or inadequate response
      to chemotherapy to allow local excision will continue with evaluation and treatment per the
      current standard of care (chemoradiation followed by TME). These patients will be considered
      failures for the primary endpoint of the study. Patients who respond to the neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy will proceed with local excision (open, TEMS or TAMIS), 6-12 weeks after the
      completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by 5-FU based chemoradiotherapy 4-12 weeks
      after local excision. Patients with positive margins at the time of local excision will also
      be treated as per standard of care and will be considered as failures. Number of patients who
      can undergo successful local excision with this approach will define the success of the
      strategy. After chemoradiation therapy post local excision, patients will be followed closely
      every 3 months for the first 3 years and then every 2 months for the next 2 years
      (history/physical, CEA and pelvic MRI). Patients who are deemed failures for the primary
      end-point will be followed as per standard of care, off-study.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (lower border â‰¤6 cm from anal
             verge as assessed by pelvic MRI).

          2. Clinical stage T1N0, T2N0, T3N0; high risk T1 and low risk T3 stage patients are also
             allowed. Clinical staging should be estimated based on the combination of the
             following assessments: physical exam by the primary surgeon, CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
             or PET/CT along with Pelvic MRI and Endoscopic Rectal Ultrasound (ERUS). If a pelvic
             MRI is performed, it is acceptable to perform CT of the chest/abdomen, omitting CT
             imaging of the pelvis.

                  above institutional normal

          7. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA
             consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with contraindication to use FOLFOX chemotherapy and pelvic radiation.

          2. Low risk T1 tumors that fulfill all of the following - size&lt;4 cm, lack of
             lymphovascular invasion and well differentiated histology, are excluded

          3. High risk T3 tumors that fulfill any of the following - circumferential tumor,
             extension into mesorectal fascia &gt; 5mm, prediction of positive circumferential
             resection margin, are also excluded.

          4. T4, node positive or advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. Node positivity defined as nodes
             greater than 1cm in short axis with loss of uniform cortex/fatty hilum

          6. Patients who have had chemotherapy (for other malignancies) within 3 years prior to
             registration

          7. Patients with any prior pelvic radiation therapy

          8. Prior malignancies requiring systemic therapy within the last 3 years (as prior
             therapy can increase toxicity of current chemo regimen, those patients should be
             excluded).

          9. History of allergic reactions attributed to compound of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to the agents used in this study

             study requirements.

         11. Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with chemotherapeutic drugs.
             In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy.

         12. Pregnant or breast feeding.
