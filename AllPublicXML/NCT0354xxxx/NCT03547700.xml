    <textblock>
      Single arm phase I/II study of ixazomib and romidepsin in relapsed/refractory PTCL. Each
      cycle is 28 days. Patients will continue to receive therapy until progressive disease,
      unacceptable toxicity, or if any other withdrawal criteria are met. The phase I study
      includes three dose levels. The phase II study will include treatment with ixazomib and
      romidepsin at the MTD established in the Phase I study.
