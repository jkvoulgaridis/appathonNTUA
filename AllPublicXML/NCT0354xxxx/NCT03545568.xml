  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at assessing the impact of short-term (3 days) exogenous sialic acid
      supplementation on endogenous biomarkers of sialic acid metabolism in NANS deficient
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NANS deficiency is a genetic disorder presenting clinically with intellectual development
      disorder, skeletal dysplasia and dysmorphic features. It has recently been described in 9
      patients (4 children and 5 adults). Biallelic mutations in the NANS (N-Acetylneuraminic acid
      synthase) gene cause a block in the endogenous synthesis of sialic acid and accumulation of
      the precursor, N-acetyl mannosamine (ManNAc). In a cell culture model, this block results in
      hyposialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. It seems likely that in human, this enzyme
      deficiency impairs the sialylation of glycolipids and glycoproteins, known to be essential
      for brain development. Exogenously added sialic acid partially rescued the phenotype of
      NANS-deficient zebra fish. Currently there is no approved treatment for patients with NANS
      deficiency. The investigators concluded that exogenous sialic acid supplementation might be
      useful for NANS patients. Given that sialic acid is found as both, a free sugar and in a
      bound form in standard nutrition as well as in high quantities in breast milk, it can be
      considered as a safe nutritional ingredient; this notion is fully supported by animal
      toxicity studies.

      The use of sialic acid in NANS deficiency is in line with oral supplementation of specific
      sugars for treatment of other glycosylation and sialylation defects such as congenital
      disorders of glycosylation (CDG) and myopathy with mutation in the gene GNE. This novel
      monosaccharide therapy represents an opportunity to address fundamental biochemical questions
      about the relative contribution of endogenous and dietary sources on sialic acid metabolism
      and its potential role as a future therapy for NANS patients.
