      The overall purpose and objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that high
      intensity endurance exercise causes beneficial brain adaptation in patients with mild
      cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI). Aim 1 will determine the effect of high
      intensity endurance exercise on cognitive function and other clinical symptoms in PD-MCI. Aim
      2 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on brain structure and
      function in PD-MCI. Aim 3 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on
      cortisol in PD-MCI. Aim 4 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on
      inflammation-related biomarkers found in blood in PD-MCI. Aim 5 will determine the effect of
      high intensity endurance exercise on peripheral levels of neurotrophic factors found in blood
      in PD-MCI.

    <measure>Mean Change in Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in cognitive function from baseline to 6-months as measured by global statistical test (GST) for cognitive domains. This will be a composite score reported as Z-scores. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean, which is based on normative (healthy control) data. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean of the normative data with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. A positive change in Z-scores indicates a favorable outcome.
The GSTs will be calculated from the following neuropsychological tests administered in the cognitive test battery reflecting specific cognitive domains:
Attention/Working Memory - Trail Making Test-Part A
Executive Function - Trail Making Test-Part B, Clock Draw, Raven's Progressive Matrices
Memory - Hopkin Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Figural Memory Test
Processing Speed - Symbol Digit Modality Test</description>

    <measure>The Boston Naming Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner begins with Item 1 and continues through Item 60, unless the patient is in distress or refuses to continue. The patient is told to tell the examiner the name of each picture and is given about 20 seconds to respond for each trial. The examiner writes down the patient's responses in detail, using codes. If the patient fails to give the correct response, the examiner at her or his discretion may give the patient a phonemic cue, which is the initial sound of the target word. After the patient completes the test, the examiner scores each item + or - according to the response coding and scoring procedures.</description>

    <measure>New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q) is a clinician-administered tool that aims to assess both the clinical aspects of FOG as well as its subsequent impairments on quality of life. The task ratings and scales are calculated into a summed NFOG-Q score. Part I detected the presence of FOG using a dichotomous item in which individuals were classified as a freezer (FR) or a non-freezer (NFR) if they had experienced FOG-episodes during the past month. Parts II and III were designed for FRs only, providing a total summed score between 0 and 28. Part II (items 2-6, scoring range 0-19) rated the severity of FOG based on its duration and frequency in its most common manifestation, i.e. during turning and initiation of gait. Part III rated the impact of FOG on daily life (items 7-9, scoring range 0-9). No separate on and off rating of parts II and III was considered to avoid unreliable assessment.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Cognitive Function</title>
        <description>Mean change in cognitive function from baseline to 6-months as measured by global statistical test (GST) for cognitive domains. This will be a composite score reported as Z-scores. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean, which is based on normative (healthy control) data. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean of the normative data with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. A positive change in Z-scores indicates a favorable outcome.
The GSTs will be calculated from the following neuropsychological tests administered in the cognitive test battery reflecting specific cognitive domains:
Attention/Working Memory - Trail Making Test-Part A
Executive Function - Trail Making Test-Part B, Clock Draw, Raven's Progressive Matrices
Memory - Hopkin Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Figural Memory Test
Processing Speed - Symbol Digit Modality Test</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 6 Months</time_frame>
        <population>Raw scores for cognitive tests were transformed to Z-scores based upon normative data. Cognitive domain scores were calculated by averaging Z-scores for neuropsychological tests within specific domains, thereby accounting for any unequal distribution of tests per domain. Higher (more positive) scores indicate better outcome.</population>

        <title>6 Month Change in Sleep Quality Evaluated by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</title>
        <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions rated by the bed partner or roommate (if one is available). Only self-rated questions are included in the scoring. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven &quot;component&quot; scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points.The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>

        <title>6 Month Change in Quality of Life Evaluated by the Parkinson Disease Neuro Quality of Life (Neuro-QOL)</title>
        <description>The NeuroQOL is a self-report of health related quality of life in 17 domains and sub-domains for adults. Item banks consist of 302 items in total (range from 5 to 45) which are used adaptively to test a variable number and content of items in a computer assisted testing format. All items are rated on a five option scale based on intensity (e.g. 1 = not at all, 2 = a little bit, 3 = somewhat, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = very much) or frequency (&quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot;). Raw scores are converted based on consistent metric (T-distribution) with data from the US general population with a T-score mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

        <title>6 Month Change in Quality of Life Evaluated by the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39)</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is a 39-item self-report questionnaire, which assesses Parkinson's disease-specific health related quality over the last month covering 8 dimensions 1) Mobility (10, #1-10) 2) Activities of daily living (ADL) (6, #11-16) 3) Emotional well-being (6, #17-22) 4) Stigma (4, #23-26) 5) Social support (3, #27-29) 6) Cognition (4, #30-33) 7) Communication (3, #34-36) 8) Bodily discomfort (3, #37-39) on a 5 point ordinal system (0=never, 4=always). Dimension score = sum of scores of each item in the dimension divided by the maximum possible score of all the items in the dimension, multiplied by 100. Each dimension total score range from 0 (never have difficulty) to 100 (always have difficulty). Lower scores reflect better QoL. Overall score can be summarized in the Parkinson's Disease Summary Index (PDSI) or PDQ-39 Summary Index (PDQ-39 SI).PDSI or PDQ-39 SI = sum of dimension total scores divided by 8.</description>

        <title>The Boston Naming Test</title>
        <description>The examiner begins with Item 1 and continues through Item 60, unless the patient is in distress or refuses to continue. The patient is told to tell the examiner the name of each picture and is given about 20 seconds to respond for each trial. The examiner writes down the patient's responses in detail, using codes. If the patient fails to give the correct response, the examiner at her or his discretion may give the patient a phonemic cue, which is the initial sound of the target word. After the patient completes the test, the examiner scores each item + or - according to the response coding and scoring procedures.</description>

        <title>New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q) is a clinician-administered tool that aims to assess both the clinical aspects of FOG as well as its subsequent impairments on quality of life. The task ratings and scales are calculated into a summed NFOG-Q score. Part I detected the presence of FOG using a dichotomous item in which individuals were classified as a freezer (FR) or a non-freezer (NFR) if they had experienced FOG-episodes during the past month. Parts II and III were designed for FRs only, providing a total summed score between 0 and 28. Part II (items 2-6, scoring range 0-19) rated the severity of FOG based on its duration and frequency in its most common manifestation, i.e. during turning and initiation of gait. Part III rated the impact of FOG on daily life (items 7-9, scoring range 0-9). No separate on and off rating of parts II and III was considered to avoid unreliable assessment.</description>
