    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of various forms of upper extremity exercise on
      postprandial glycemia and lipemia in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Participants are
      measured at rest and fed a standardized meal following seated rest (CON), moderate intensity
      continuous arm cycling (MICT), high intensity interval arm cycling (HIIT), and circuit
      resistance exercise (CRT) matched for exercise energy expenditure.

    <description>Participants complete upper extremity resistance maneuvers (lifts) interspersed with low-load/high-speed arm cycling for a combined 30 repetitions of 6 lifts and ~20 min of arm cycling. During this time energy expenditure is measured via open-circuit indirect calorimetry. Following the intervention they are fed.</description>
