  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachial non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring is recommended as part of the American
      Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) basic monitoring package. Although brachial NIBP is often
      practical, some surgeries and patients may require NIBP measurement elsewhere (e.g. the
      ankle).

      Several studies have shown that ankle NIBP overestimates brachial NIBP measurements.
      Algorithms have been proposed, based on correlation studies, to estimate brachial NIBP from
      ankle NIBP during general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. These algorithms, however,
      are based on both heterogeneous populations and surgeries.

      Our aim was to determine if ankle brachial NIBP difference occurs in in young ASA physical
      status 1 patients undergoing general anesthesia in the supine position. We also aim to
      determine if this difference is constant during anesthesia or if it varies according to
      different predefined time points.
