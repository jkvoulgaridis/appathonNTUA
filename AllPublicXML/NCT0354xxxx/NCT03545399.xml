  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of the seaweed extract were evaluated on the animal model equivalent of
      depression compared with a control group treated with the carrier (spring water) and a
      reference group treated with Imipramine and showed significative effect. This clinical trial
      was intended to confirm in humans the potential efficacy identified in animals. The primary
      objective was to compare against a placebo the effect of Ulva L.L extract in healthy
      volunteers whose anhedonia was characterized by a component of depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial comprised three visits: a medical enrollment visit on D0, an intermediate visit on
      D28 and a final visit on D84. A psychologist made a telephone call after 7 days to check
      there was no sudden change in the subject's depressive state. During the visits, the subject
      was examined by a doctor and the psychometric tests were administered by a psychologist.
      Outside the visits, the subject was monitored by a self-reporting questionnaire in the manner
      described below.

      After obtaining informed written consent and validating the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      notably the absence of MDE as per DSM V, the investigator enrolled the subject in the trial.
      The physician described the subject's demographic and general clinical characteristics, the
      main medical and surgical history and any current treatment if those pathologies were still
      present, and any previous antidepressant, anxiolytic or neuroleptic treatments. The doctor
      asked the subject to complete the SHAPS and QIDS -SR questionnaires and item 7 of the HAM-D.
      The doctor then handed the subject self-evaluation questionnaires explaining how to complete
      them and the dates at which they were to be completed. The physician gave the patient a batch
      of the placebo or a batch of Ulva lactuca as per the randomization. The doctor told the
      subject a psychologist would be in touch after one week by telephone to check no DSM V
      severity criterion had arisen.

      The investigating doctor saw the subject again at the four-week intermediate visit and at the
      final visit at the end of the 12th week of follow-up. The doctor collected the
      self-questionnaires at these visits and the same items as at the enrollment visit were
      recorded by the physician for describing how the items had evolved and notably the SHAP scale
      score, the QIDS-SR and item 7 of the HAM-D. In addition, the physician recorded the subject's
      satisfaction with the treatment evaluated on the PGII (Patient Global Improvement
      Impression), reported any undesirable affects and gave his/her own opinion on the efficacy of
      treatment using the Clinical Global Improvement Impression (CGII).

    <description>The evolution of anhedonia in healthy subjects whose anhedonia was characterized by a component of depression was measured by the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS).The SHAPS questionnaire is composed of 14 questions, the total score of the SHAPS varies between 0 and 14. Severe anhedonia will be observed if the SHAPS score is strictly greater than 5.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of the subject's mood</measure>
    <time_frame>84 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evolution of the mood of subjects measured by the Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS).Each &quot;positive&quot; item (Dynamic, Happy, Compassionate, Content, Energetic, Quiet, Affectionate and Vivid) is rated from 1 &quot;Not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;Absolutely&quot;. Each item &quot;negative&quot; (Sad, Tired, Melancholic, Excited, Exhausted, Grumpy, Nervous and Annoyed) is inversely rated from 1 &quot;quite&quot; to 4 &quot;not at all&quot;. The BMIS questionnaire is composed of 16 questions, and will be calculated by adding the answers of these 16 items. The BMIS score varies between 16 and 64.</description>

    <description>The effect on work and other activities according to item 7 of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D).The HAM-D is a scale for depression composed of 17 questions and varies between 0 and 58.
The HAM-D score will also be classified into 5 classes according to the following model:
0-7 None; 8-13 Light; 14-18 Moderate; 19-22 Severe; &gt; 23 Very severe</description>

    <description>Evolution of the components of depression is measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -Self-Report (QIDS-SR).QIDS-SR questionnaire is composed of 16 questions. Each answer is scored from 0 to 3. The symptomatology is more important with a higher score. The total score fluctuates between 0 and 27.
The QIDS score will also be classified into 5 classes according to the following model:
0-5 None; 6-10 Lightweight; 11-15 Moderate; 16-20 Severe; &gt; 20 Very severe</description>
