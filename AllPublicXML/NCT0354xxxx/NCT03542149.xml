      A single-centre Phase 1b study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile,
      and antimalarial activity of single doses of coadministered artefenomel (OZ439) and
      piperaquine phosphate (PQP) against early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection in
      healthy adult volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, adaptive, study using the P. falciparum induced blood
      stage malaria (IBSM) inoculum as a model to characterise the pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of
      combined single dose administration of OZ439 and PQP.

      The study will be conducted in a maximum of three cohorts (up to 8 subjects per cohort) using
      up to 4 different doses of OZ439 and PQP in each cohort. Subjects will be malaria naïve
      healthy males or females, aged between 18-55 years old, who meet all of the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

      The first cohort will be composed of 4 groups of 2 subjects each. Subjects will be randomised
      into one of 4 dose groups and administered single oral doses of OZ439 and PQP in combination
      The combined dose of OZ439 and PQP will be different for each of the 4 groups in this cohort
      as shown in Table 1.

      Table 1 OZ439 and PQP Cohort 1 Dose Drug Dose group

      1A 1B 1C 1D OZ439 (mg) 200 200 400 400 PQP (mg) 480 640 480 640

      The data captured from this first cohort will be used to determine the relationship between
      OZ439 and PQP concentrations and parasitaemia levels. Based on safety and tolerability data
      up to Day 35 post-dose, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis outcomes (based
      on PD data up to Day 35 and PK data up to Day 28 post-dose) of the drugs given in
      combination, the dose(s) for the subsequent cohort will be determined. A similar analysis
      will be done at the end of cohort 2 combining cohorts 1 and 2 data to decide the dose(s) to
      be tested in cohort 3. This will be decided by the funding sponsor and the Principal
      Investigator following review of the data by the Safety and Data Review Team (SDRT) and
      scientific evaluation.

      The doses used in all cohorts will not exceed the maximum acceptable doses predefined for
      this study (800 mg for OZ439 and 1440 mg for PQP) as determined in previous safety, pilot
      efficacy and phase 2 studies.

      Each subject will be inoculated on Day 0 with approximately 2,800 viable parasites of P.
      falciparum-infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously. Subjects will be followed
      up daily via phone call or text message on Days 1 to 3 post-inoculation to solicit any AEs.

      Subjects will then come to the clinical unit once daily from Day 4 until presence of asexual
      parasites is established by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the 18S
      rRNA gene (referred to hereafter as malaria 18S qPCR). Once qPCR becomes positive and until
      OZ439 and PQP administration, subjects will come to the clinical unit twice-daily, separated
      by approximately 12 hours, for clinical evaluation and blood sampling.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit for single dose administration of OZ439 and
      PQP 8 days after malaria inoculation or at Investigators discretion (i.e. as per parasitaemia
      levels). Subjects will be followed up as inpatients for at least 72 hours to ensure tolerance
      of the investigational treatments and clinical response, then if clinically well on an
      outpatient basis for safety and clearance of malaria parasites via qPCR.

      After discharge from the clinical unit, subjects will be followed up regularly for safety
      assessments, PK sampling, clinical evaluation, and malaria qPCR blood sampling until 35 days
      after OZ439 and PQP administration. All subjects will receive a standard course of therapy
      with Riamet® (artemether-lumefantrine) 34 days after OZ439 and PQP administration, or earlier
      in the event of failure of clearance of parasitaemia or recrudescence of parasitaemia. The
      presence of gametocytes in subjects' blood will be determined by parasite lifecycle stage
      qRT-PCR or by the presence of stable low level parasitaemia. If gametocytes are present at
      the time of treatment with Riamet®, Primacin™ (primaquine) will also be administered as a
      single oral dose.

      AEs (AEs) will be monitored via telephone, within the clinical unit, and on outpatient review
      after malaria challenge inoculation and antimalarial study drugs administration. Blood
      samples for safety evaluation, malaria monitoring, and red blood cell antibodies will be
      drawn at screening and/or baseline and at nominated times after malaria challenge.

             doxycycline etc.).

         29. Ingestion of any poppy seeds within the 24 hours prior to the screening blood test
             (subjects will be advised by phone not to consume any poppy seeds in this time
             period).

         30. Excessive consumption of beverages or food containing xanthine bases including Red
             Bull, chocolate, coffee etc. (more than 400 mg caffeine per day, equivalent to more
             than 4 cups of coffee per day).

         31. Unwillingness to abstain from consumption of grapefruit or Seville oranges from
             inoculation day until end of Riamet® treatment.

         32. Unwillingness to abstain from consumption of quinine containing foods/beverages such
             as tonic water and lemon bitter, from inoculation day until end of Riamet® treatment.

         33. Use of prescription drugs or non-prescription drugs or herbal supplements (such as St
             John's Wort), within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the
             malaria inoculation. As an exception, ibuprofen (preferred) may be used at doses of up
             to 1.2 g/day or paracetamol at doses of up to 4 g/day after discussion with the
             Investigator. Limited use of other non-prescription medications or dietary
             supplements, not believed to affect subject safety or the overall results of the
             study, may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following approval by the Sponsor in
             consultation with the Investigator. Subjects are requested to refrain from taking
             non-approved concomitant medications from recruitment until the conclusion of the
             study.

         34. Any subject who, in the judgment of the Investigator, is likely to be non-compliant
             during the study, or is unable to cooperate because of a language problem or poor
             mental development.

         35. Any subject in the exclusion period of a previous study according to applicable
             regulations.

         36. Any subject who is the Principal Investigator or any sub-Investigator, research
             assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, or other staff thereof, directly involved in
             conducting the study.

         37. Any subject without a good peripheral venous access. Biological status

         38. Positive result on any of the following tests: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag),
             anti-hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc Ab), anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV)
             antibodies, anti-human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies (anti-HIV1 and
             anti-HIV2 Ab).

         39. Positive urine drug test. Any drug listed in Section 7.2.1 in the urine drug screen
             unless there is an explanation acceptable to the Investigator (e.g., the subject has
             stated in advance that they consumed a prescription or over-the-counter product which
             contained the detected drug) and/or the subject has a negative urine drug screen on
             retest by the pathology laboratory. Any subject testing positive for acetaminophen
             (paracetamol) at screening may still be eligible for study participation, at the
             Investigator's discretion.

         40. Positive alcohol breath test.

         41. Cardiac/QT risk:

               -  Family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval
                  or known congenital prolongation of the QTc interval or any clinical condition
                  known to prolong the QTc interval.

               -  History of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant
                  bradycardia.

               -  Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or
                  hypomagnesaemia.

               -  ECG abnormalities in the standard 12-lead ECG (at screening or at pre-inoculation
                  on inoculation day) which in the opinion of the Investigator is clinically
                  relevant or will interfere with the ECG analyses.

         42. Known hypersensitivity to artesunate or any of its excipients, artemether or other
             artemisinin derivatives, piperaquine phosphate, proguanil/atovaquone, primaquine, or
             4-aminoquinolines.
