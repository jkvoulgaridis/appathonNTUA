  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the bioequivalence of the test product (Nicotine Prototype Mini
      lozenge 4 milligrams [mg]) to a commercial reference product (nicotine polacrilex mini
      lozenge 4mg) in healthy smokers under fasting conditions.

      This study will be a single center, randomized, open label, single dose, two-way crossover in
      healthy smokers that smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking. This study will
      consist of following Visits: Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Study Period 1), followed by a
      Washout period and Visit 3 (Study Period 2). This will ensure approximately 29 evaluable
      participants per treatment arm. Each participant will be treated with a single dose of the
      two study treatments (test and reference) in a randomized sequence, under fasting conditions.
      Participants will be confined in the study facility for approximately 60 hours during each
      study session (for 36 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during which
      pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be obtained. Participants are to abstain from smoking
      during the confinement periods and be subject to random measurements of expired carbon
      monoxide (CO) to confirm abstinence. The CO levels must be â‰¤10 parts per million (ppm)
      throughout the study session. There will be at least 5-day and not more than 7-day clinical
      furlough period between treatment periods. For each treatment period, the clinical
      confinement period with restriction of smoking is at least 36 hours prior to dosing.

    <measure>Assessment of Bioequivalence of Prototype Mini Lozenges With Nicorette Mini Lozenge by Measuring Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to Time t (AUC [0-t])</measure>
    <time_frame>0.75, 0.5, 0.25 hours predose and 0.08, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 10, 14, 16, 20 and 24 hours postdose in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Bioequivalence of prototype mini lozenges with nicorette mini lozenge was assessed by measuring AUC(0-t), where t= time of the last measurable plasma concentration. AUC(0-t) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal with linear interpolation method. A linear mixed-effects model was fit to the natural log (ln)-transformed PK variable (AUC0-t), as the dependent variable, and treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects. Participant nested within sequence was a random effect. The treatment difference and its 90% CI were exponentiated to obtain the geometric mean ratios (GMR) between the test and reference products and its 90% CI. Geometric Coefficient of variation was provided as percentage.</description>

    <description>Bioequivalence of prototype mini lozenges with nicorette mini lozenge was assessed by measuring AUC(0-inf). AUC(0-inf) = AUC0-t + (Clast/kel), where, AUC0-t= area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to time t; Clast= last observed/measured plasma concentration and kel= elimination rate constant. A linear mixed-effects model was fit to the natural log (ln)-transformed PK variable (AUC[0-inf]), as the dependent variable, and treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects. Participant nested within sequence was a random effect. The treatment difference and its 90% CI were exponentiated to obtain the GMR between the test and reference products and its 90% CI.

          <description>Participants randomized to this group received a single dose of Treatment A: 4 milligrams (mg) of Prototype Mini Lozenge administered orally on Day 0 in Treatment Period 1. It was followed by a washout period of at least 5 days to a maximum of 7 days, then participants received Treatment B: 4 mg of Nicorette Mini lozenge administered orally on any one day from Day 5-Day 7 (depending upon washout period) in Treatment Period 2.

Participants were confined in the study facility for approximately 60 hours during each treatment period (for 36 hours predose and for 24 hours postdose) with abstinence from smoking during which they were subjected to random measurements of expired carbon monoxide (CO) to confirm abstinence (CO levels must have been less than or equal to(&lt;=) 10 parts per million (ppm) throughout the treatment period).</description>

        <title>Assessment of Bioequivalence of Prototype Mini Lozenges With Nicorette Mini Lozenge by Measuring Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to Time t (AUC [0-t])</title>
        <description>Bioequivalence of prototype mini lozenges with nicorette mini lozenge was assessed by measuring AUC(0-t), where t= time of the last measurable plasma concentration. AUC(0-t) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal with linear interpolation method. A linear mixed-effects model was fit to the natural log (ln)-transformed PK variable (AUC0-t), as the dependent variable, and treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects. Participant nested within sequence was a random effect. The treatment difference and its 90% CI were exponentiated to obtain the geometric mean ratios (GMR) between the test and reference products and its 90% CI. Geometric Coefficient of variation was provided as percentage.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Bioequivalence of Prototype Mini Lozenges With Nicorette Mini Lozenge by Measuring Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve Calculated From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC [(0-inf])</title>
        <description>Bioequivalence of prototype mini lozenges with nicorette mini lozenge was assessed by measuring AUC(0-inf). AUC(0-inf) = AUC0-t + (Clast/kel), where, AUC0-t= area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to time t; Clast= last observed/measured plasma concentration and kel= elimination rate constant. A linear mixed-effects model was fit to the natural log (ln)-transformed PK variable (AUC[0-inf]), as the dependent variable, and treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects. Participant nested within sequence was a random effect. The treatment difference and its 90% CI were exponentiated to obtain the GMR between the test and reference products and its 90% CI. Geometric Coefficient of variation was provided as percentage.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Bioequivalence of Prototype Mini Lozenges With Nicorette Mini Lozenge by Measuring Maximum Observed Plasma Nicotine Concentration (Cmax)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at designated timepoints. Bioequivalence of prototype mini lozenges with nicorette mini lozenge was assessed by measuring Cmax that was taken directly from bioanalytical data. Geometric Coefficient of variation was provided as percentage. A linear mixed-effects model was fit to the natural log (ln)-transformed PK variable (Cmax) as the dependent variable, and treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects. Participant nested within sequence was a random effect. The treatment difference and its 90% CI were exponentiated to obtain the GMR between the test and reference products and its 90% CI. Geometric Coefficient of variation was provided as percentage.</description>
