  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fat is the most energy dense macronutrient and consuming fat has been positively correlated
      to obesity. Individuals afflicted with obesity crave fat more frequently, have a higher
      preference for fatty taste, and consume a higher quantity of fatty foods. People who have
      undergone Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) or Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) weight-loss surgeries
      dramatically decrease their fat preferences and consumption of fat, at least within the first
      year after surgery. These surgeries are very effective in helping people lose weight over the
      first couple of years; however, approximately 30% of those who undergo these surgeries start
      regaining weight after the second year mark. Why some people are able to keep the weight off
      long-term but others are unable to is unclear. In addition, it is well-known that fat can
      modify the flavor of foods and flavor plays a critical role in consumption, as well as in
      responses that gear up the body to consume the food. These are known as cephalic phase
      responses and include neural, physiological, and hormonal aspects. The main goals of the
      study are twofold: 1) To test the immediate effects of RYGB surgery, SG surgery, and
      laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) surgery (a weight loss control group) on fat preferences,
      sensory perception, and cephalic phase responses and 2) to compare fat preferences, sensory
      perception, and cephalic phase responses between those who are able to achieve sustained
      weight loss 2-5 years after RYGB or SG surgery and those who either regained weight or did
      not lose the desired amount.

      For the first goal, the investigators will assess a longitudinal group of subjects both
      before RYGB surgery (n=15) SG surgery (n=15), and LAGB surgery (n=15), and then again after
      they lose ~16% of their body weight post-surgery. the investigators will also study the same
      variables in a cross-sectional design consisting of two groups: a weight success group (n=30)
      and a weight failure group (n=30) 2-5 years post RYGB or SG surgery. The weight success group
      will include subjects who lost ≥40% body weight by 2-5 years post-surgery and the weight
      failure group will include subjects who lost &lt;25% body weight by 2-5 years post-surgery. In
      addition, the investigators will also explore the extent to which fat preferences and sensory
      perception in these subjects are affected by flavor related genes.
