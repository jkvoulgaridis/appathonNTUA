  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 single center, parallel group study to assess and compare the safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD of 4 single ascending doses of P1101 (100, 200, 300, and 450 μg)
      following subcutaneous administration in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four healthy eligible Japanese male subjects and 24 healthy eligible Caucasian male
      subjects, each divided into 4 cohorts of 6 subjects, will participate in this study. No
      subject will participate in more than 1 cohort and all subjects will receive a single dose of
      P1101. Caucasian subjects will be body weight- and height-matched to Japanese subjects.

      Dosing will be initiated with the lowest dose of 100 μg in both Japanese and Caucasian
      subjects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria
        apply:

          -  Adult Japanese and Caucasian males aged 21 to 50 years inclusive and body mass index
             (BMI) between 19 and 30 kg/m2.

          -  Japanese subjects must be first generation (born in Japan) with parents and
             grandparents born in Japan, lived for &lt; 10 years outside of Japan, and have no
             significant change in life style since leaving Japan.

          -  Caucasian subjects must have both parents of Caucasian descent; Caucasian subjects are
             defined as descendants of the original peoples of Europe.

          -  Individual Caucasian subjects should be selected to match body weight (± 20%) and
             height (± 15%) of corresponding Japanese subjects.

          -  Subjects must be willing to use effective methods of contraception during the entire
             study period and for 12 weeks after dosing on Day 1.

          -  Subjects who are healthy as determined by pre-study medical history, physical
             examination, and 12-lead ECG.

          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test results are within the reference ranges for
             hematological parameters and liver function tests at Screening and Day -1. For results
             outside the reference range at Screening and considered not clinically significant by
             the Investigator a repeat test is allowed once during the Screening period. Note:
             subjects with an absolute neutrophil count below 2.0 × 109/L will be excluded. All
             other clinical laboratory test results must be within the reference range or judged
             not to be clinically significant and acceptable to the Investigator.

          -  Subjects whose thyroid function tests are within the study reference range.

          -  Subjects who are negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb) and human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) I and II tests at Screening.

          -  Subjects who are negative for drugs of abuse and alcohol tests at Screening. Alcohol
             will be measured using breathalyzer test. If the tests are negative at Screening, and
             if they meet other eligibility criteria, the subject may be included. A repeat test
             for suspected false positive at Screening (with documented rationale) may be performed
             at the discretion of the Investigator. However, if the tests are subsequently positive
             on Admission, the subject should be withdrawn from the study. Repeat tests are not
             allowed at Admission.

          -  Subjects who are non-smokers for at least 6 months preceding Screening.

          -  Subjects who are able and willing to give a valid written informed consent.

          -  Female subjects.

          -  Subjects who have a clinically relevant history or presence of respiratory,

          -  Subjects who have a first degree relative with autoimmune disease (e.g. thyroiditis,
             lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) or other clinically relevant medical history which
             in the opinion of the Investigator poses a risk to the subject.

          -  Subjects with a history of latent or active tuberculosis or exposure to endemic areas.

          -  Subjects with a positive result in the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and/or clinically
             significant abnormality on chest X-ray.

          -  Subjects who have a clinically relevant surgical history and history of any prior
             malignancy.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have clinically relevant medical
             history in their immediate family (first degree relative).

          -  Subjects with current symptoms of eczema or hay fever, or subjects with a history of
             hay fever requiring medication when their hay fever season starts within the expected
             duration of the study.

          -  Subjects who have a history of severe allergy and severe drug reaction (e.g.,
             anaphylaxis, or other drug reaction requiring hospitalization to beta lactam
             antibiotics OR any other relevant drug hypersensitivity).

          -  Subjects who have a history of alcoholism.

          -  Subjects who consume more than the recommended number of 14 units of alcohol per week.
