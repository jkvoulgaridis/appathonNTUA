  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients usually experience some level of pain after their hernia repair. To control pain
      after the operation, surgeons have many options. One of them is to make some injections of
      pain blocker medications into the nerves that are responsible for the sensations the
      abdominal wall.This procedure is called TAP block (transversus abdominis place block). These
      medications are called local anesthetics, and there is a variety of medications that can be
      used. One of such medications is called Exparel® (Liposomal Bupivacaine). Exparel® has the
      potential benefit of lasting more hours than regular anesthetics. Although this drug is being
      used with increasing frequency, the investigators do not have good quality studies
      investigating the benefits of using this medication during a hernia repair, especially when
      compared to other types of local anesthetics (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride) or when compared to
      not injecting this medication at all. This study aim to investigate if Exparel®, when
      injected in the nerves of the abdominal wall during hernia repair can: (1) reduce the dose of
      additional opioid medications (morphine and similar) needed to achieve good pain control and
      (2) result in lower pain scores. The hypothesis is that Exparel® will result in a 30%
      decrease in the total requirements for opioid medications during the first 72 hours after
      surgery. Patients will be randomized to receive either Exparel®+Bupivacaine Hydrochloride,
      Bupivacaine Hydrochloride or Placebo (normal saline) during the operation through a TAP
      block. All patients will receive a patient controlled analgesia device after the operation,
      where patients can simply push a button every time they feel pain and the device will
      administer a dose of opioid medications. The investigators of the study will record the
      necessary amount of opioids used by the patients to achieve good pain control and also record
      pain scores several times during hospital stay.

      This will be a double-blind, 3-arm, randomized controlled trial with a treatment 1: treatment
      2: control allocation ratio of 1:1:1. Primary outcomes of interest are opioid requirements
      and pain scores over initial 72 hours of the postoperative period. Opioid requirements will
      be assessed by measuring the cumulative dose of opioids administered intravenously (infused
      through a patient-controlled analgesia device as well as the quantity of opioids administered
      intravenously as rescue, if needed) and the quantity of opioids administered through oral
      preparations. This will be assessed at time points: while patients are at the post-anesthesia
      care unit (PACU), at postoperative days 1(24h±4 hours), 2(48h±4 hours), 3(72h±4 hours) and at
      the date of hospital discharge. The total dose of opioids used at each time point will be
      recorded and converted into morphine equivalents for standardization and analysis. The
      cumulative dose of opioids from 0 hours to 72 hours after the operation and for the total
      hospital length of stay will be recorded. In addition, the dose of opioids administered
      intra-operatively by the anesthesiologist, time for first oral opioid dose over the first 72
      hours (discontinuation of PCA), and the percentage of patients not requiring opioids over the
      first 72 hours will also be recorded.

      Pain scores will be determined using a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a 100mm
      horizontal line with two endpoints: 0 (no pain) and 100 (worst imaginable pain). Pain scores
      will be assessed at baseline during preoperative evaluation, at the PACU, at postoperative
      days 1(24h±4 hours), 2(48h±4 hours), 3(72h±4 hours), and at the time of hospital discharge.

      Additional pain scores will be obtained using the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS) Pain Intensity 3a survey at baseline and 30-day follow-up. This
      survey will be completed by patients in person during enrollment and 30-day follow-up.
      Secondary outcomes of interest include the length of hospital stay and Patient-Reported
      Quality of Life (PRQOL). Both information is already routinely collected through the Americas
      Hernia Society Quality Collaborative (AHSQC). Length of hospital stay will be recorded in
      days. PRQOL will be assessed using the Hernia-Related Quality-of-Life survey (HerQLes). The
      HerQLes is a 12-item, validated, hernia-specific survey that assesses quality of life through
      abdominal wall function after ventral hernia repair. HeQLes scores will be assessed at
      baseline and 30 days after the operation.

      All patients will undergo the same operation, under a standard of care protocol. Skin
      preparation, hair removal, perioperative antibiotics and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis
      will be performed per Surgical Care Improvement Project protocol guidelines. The procedure
      will be performed through a midline incision. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, all
      adhesions between intra-abdominal contents and the anterior abdominal wall are routinely
      lysed using sharp dissection. When present, hernia contents are reduced back to the cavity.
      At the end of adhesiolysis, the surgeon will ask the OR nurse to contact the investigational
      pharmacy via telephone, who will randomize the subject. The investigational pharmacy will be
      responsible for preparing and dispensing the assigned intervention. The OR nurse will receive
      the drug from the investigational pharmacy in a standardized bag and will dispense it to the
      surgeon at the time of the TAP block. Neither the surgeon nor other members of the surgical
      team will be informed about which of the interventions were assigned to the specific patient.
      Electronic medical records will contain the information: &quot;Patient was randomized and assigned
      to receive intervention according to randomization performed by investigational pharmacy.&quot;
      Retromuscular hernia repair is performed initially incising the posterior rectus sheath just
      lateral to the linea alba. The release will be performed at least 5 cm above and below the
      fascial defect, and retrorectus dissection is carried out laterally in the direction of the
      linea semilunaris. If deemed necessary, a posterior component separation will be performed by
      incising the posterior lamella of the internal oblique, dividing the fibers of the
      transversus abdominis muscle and dissecting the preperitoneal and retroperitoneal spaces of
      the lateral abdominal wall laterally.

      At the end of the myofascial release, randomization will occur and the assigned intervention
      drug will be dispensed in syringes to the surgeon who will perform the perform a TAP block
      under direct visualization. Patients will be randomized using a computer-generated random
      allocation sequence, by the investigational pharmacy personnel.

      Injections of the designated drug (group 1, 2 or 3) will be performed under direct
      visualization by the attending surgeon, in 5 vertical levels, to the thoracoabdominal nerves
      (from T7 to T11).

      The interventions are:

        -  Treatment 1- Administration of a solution of Exparel® combined with Bupivacaine
           Hydrochloride 0.25% and normal saline, through a bilateral TAP block performed
           intraoperatively by the attending surgeon, during open ventral hernia repair;

        -  Treatment 2: Administration of a solution of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride 0.25% and normal
           saline, through a bilateral TAP block, performed intraoperatively by the attending
           surgeon, during open ventral hernia repair ;

        -  Control (Placebo): administration of normal saline through a bilateral TAP block
           performed intraoperatively by the attending surgeon, during open ventral hernia repair.

      The posterior sheath will be reapproximated, and a standard piece of polypropylene mesh will
      be placed in the retromuscular space.

      Mesh type will be defined by the surgeon intraoperatively according to the patient and
      hernia-specific variables. Mesh fixation will be performed circumferentially using mechanical
      sutures. Closed suction drains will be placed above the mesh and in the subcutaneous space,
      and the timing of removal will be based on the surgeon's standard practice. Fascial closure
      and management of wound dressings will also follow the surgeon's standard practice.

      For postoperative analgesia, all patients will also receive a patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA) device according to the standard of care; preferably:

      • Hydromorphone HCL 0.5mg/ml (Dilaudid®, Purdue Pharmaceuticals, Stamford, CT) in 100ml of
      normal saline, with no basal rate infusion, a patient bolus dose of 0.2-0.4mg, bolus interval
      of 6 minutes (maximum 10 doses per hour).

      To ensure the comfort and adequate pain postoperative pain control, additional intravenous or
      oral opioids are allowed in the protocol, to be administered for breakthrough pain (as
      needed). Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request, and for pain control.

      Estimated patient accrual time is 2 years with data collection to occur over 30 days from
      randomization of each patient. Data analysis and manuscript production will occur within 6
      months of the completion of data collection.

      As with any surgical procedure, patients may experience pain, bleeding, and discomfort.
      Common occurrences following hernia repair include seroma, hematoma, inflammation, wound
      dehiscence, and infection. Risks of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride include allergic reactions,
      arrhythmias, chest pain or pressure, dizziness, confusion, restlessness, tinnitus, blurred
      vision, dyspnea, seizures, nausea, emesis, and lethargy. Risks of Exparel® include nausea,
      vomiting, constipation, as well as (rarely) seizures and cardiac arrest. Patients receiving
      placebo intraoperatively will not necessarily experience higher levels of pain, as all
      individuals, regardless of intervention arm, will be provided a multimodal pain management
      regimen with patient-controlled analgesia postoperatively. There are no direct benefits to
      subjects for participation in this study. Subject participation will, however, help
      physicians and hospital administrators better understand the outcomes of Exparel® use
      concerning postoperative pain management and its influence on opioid consumption, hospital
      length of stay and quality of life. Patients are under no obligation to participate in this
      study. A member of the research team will discuss all available surgical options with
      patients. It will be emphasized that refusal to participate in this study will not impact any
      patient's ability to receive surgical care. There will be no payment for the subjects for the
      participation in this study.

    <time_frame>Measured during the 30-day follow-up visit, expected to occur 30-days after the day of surgery, up to a maximum of 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Intensity 3a survey. This survey has 3 questions:(1) How intense was your pain as its worst? (2) How intense was your average pain? and (3) What is your level of pain right now?. Each question has 5 response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. To find the total raw score, sum of the values for each question is performed; lowest possible raw score is 3 and highest possible raw score is 15.A raw score of 10 converts to a T-score of 54.5 with a standard error (SE) of 2.9. Thus, the 95% confidence interval around the observed score ranges from 48.8 to 54.5 (T-score + (1.96*SE) or 54.5 + (1.96*2.9). A score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. For negatively-worded concepts like Pain Intensity, a T-score of 60 is one SD worse than average. By comparison, a Pain Intensity Tscore of 40 is one SD better than average.</description>

    <description>Measured using the Hernia Related Quality of Life survey (HerQLes) during the 30-day follow-up visit. The HerQLes is a valid and reliable hernia-specific quality of life measure. Each questions has 6 response options ranging in value from one to six. To find the raw score for the HerQles, a sum of the values of the response to each question is performed. For example, the lowest possible score is 12; the highest possible score is 72. All questions must be answered to provide a valid score. Mean and standard deviations of the scores of the entire study population will be calculated. Next, the Z score will be calculated as follows:
(Raw score-mean) / Standard Deviation. Next step is to calculate the Standard Score, as follows: (-(Z score)*Mean)+Standard Deviation. The standard score will be used for comparisons and reports, and should provide a value ranging from 0 to 100. Lower scores means lower quality of life and higher scores means higher quality of life.</description>
