  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized evaluation for which 160 adult patients will be imaged at outpatient
      wound care clinics who present with a wound of unknown infection diagnostic status and are
      receiving standard treatment. The MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device will be used as an
      adjunctive tool in the assessment of the wound and may be used to guide the targeted sampling
      of a wound (using a conventional punch biopsy method).

    <description>The i:X Imaging Device uses built-in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emitting 405 nm violet excitation light to illuminate the wound during fluorescence imaging in (FL-Mode). The light excites biological components of the wound and surrounding tissues. Non-biological components may also fluoresce although their presence in wounds is less common, provided the wound has been cleaned following standard care protocols. The resulting wound fluorescence wavelengths emitted are typically between 420 - 700 nm in the visible wavelength spectrum. In FL-mode, a customized fluorescence emission filter, which is mechanically placed in front of the built in imaging sensor and allows real-time capture of wound, limits the visualization of fluorescence to wavelengths between 500-545 nm, which typically appears green in color, and 600-665 nm, which typically appears red in color.</description>
