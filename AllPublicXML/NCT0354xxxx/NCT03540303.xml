      Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of CAR19 T cells carrying cytoplasmic activated PD1 in
      patients with refractory relapsed B-cell lymphoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although CAR19 T cell therapy brings hope, the patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell
      lymphoma is still a problem for the current treatment. There are still some patients with
      poor therapeutic efficacy, and the efficacy of CAR19-T cell therapy remains to be improved.
      Basic research shows that there is a synergistic effect between CAR-T cell therapy and
      anti-PD1 pathway, and it did have efficacy in clinic. However, the regimen of CAR19-T cells
      combined anti-PD1 inhibitors need to be combined with the application of anti-PD1 antibody
      and culture of CART cells during the treatment, there may be adverse events to PD1
      antibodies. In this study, CAR19T cells carrying cytosolic activated PD1 possess the dual
      effects of CAR19T cells and anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies while overcoming the adverse
      events of anti-PD1 inhibitors, and might have better efficacy than conventional CAR19T cells
      plus anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment, with fewer side effects.

    <intervention_model_description>CAR19 T cell therapy improves the clinical efficacy of refractory/relapsed B-cell lymphoma, and the combined PDL1 inhibitors may further improve the efficacy of CD19 CART in the treatment of lymphomas. The clinical efficacy of KITE's CAR19 T cells and PD-L1 inhibition was reported. This phase 1 study was conducted in 9 patients with DLBCL, 8 patients got remission and during which 5 got complete remission. However, this type of treatment requires more data and observation in a larger sample of patients. In addition, Kite Pharmaceuticals' CD19 CART is priced at 370,000 US dollars. The cost of immune checkpoint inhibitors is also very expensive. Only very small proportion of patients could afford for that expenses. In this study, genetically engineered CAR T cells, which carry cytoplasmic activated PD1, are not inhibited by PDL1 molecules, will avoid the simultaneous application of immune checkpoint antibodies and the according adverse events.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>step 1: Collect 50-100ml of peripheral blood for culture of CAR19 T cells carrying cytoplasmic activated PD-1 step 2. After 72 hours, pretreated with FC regimen, details as follow Cyclophosphamide 600-800mg/m2 for 2 days Fludarabine 25-30mg/m2 for 3 days step 3: After another 48 hours transfusion the cells back to the patients the numbers of infused CAR T cells are 2x106 /kg for the first 3 patients, 6x106 /kg for the second 3 patients and 18x106 /kg for the third 3 patients.
After finishing this, another 6 patients will be enrolled for observation of efficacy.</description>
