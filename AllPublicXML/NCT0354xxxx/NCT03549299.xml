  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring
      neovascularization and epithelial defects) of up to four doses of the investigational
      medicinal product (IMP) LSC2 topically administered on the target eye of patients with LSCD.
      Further, safety of the IMP during and after application will be investigated (by monitoring
      adverse events [AEs]).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, open-label, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of up to four doses of the IMP topically administered on the target eye of
      patients with LSCD. Patients will be treated in up to four ascending dose groups.

      The allogeneic investigational product LSC2 contains ABCB5-positive limbal stem cells (from
      corneal rims of cadaveric donors, expanded ex vivo, isolated and stored in a donor cell
      bank).

      The IMP will be applied on the target eye. Prior to application, the conjunctival pannus will
      be removed under general or local anesthesia.

      Patients will be followed up for efficacy for 1 year. Efficacy of the IMP will be monitored
      by assessing neovascularization and epithelial defects.

      To assess long-term safety of LSC2 one follow-up visit at Month 24 post IMP application is
      included.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be treated in up to four ascending dose groups. After the first treated patient of the first dose group (Group A) was followed for 2 weeks, a safety and tolerability assessment of the applied IMP dose will be conducted by an internal committee. The same approach applies to the second subject.
Dose escalation and recruitment of additional patients into the second dose group (Group B) will depend on the safety and tolerability of the IMP in Group A. A safety and tolerability assessment will be conducted after the last treated patient of the first dose group (Group A) was followed for 12 weeks.
The same approach applies to Group C and D.</intervention_model_description>
