  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the prevalence of motor impairment increases with age, the proportion of the population
      affected by physical limitations is likely to increase in the coming years, considering that
      one in three people will be over 60 in 2050 (compared to one in five in 2005, INSEE
      projections). The possibility of reducing recovery time and / or improving the improvement of
      motor deficits is today a public health issue. The possibility of developing new therapeutic
      tools using innovative motor imaging rehabilitation technologies is an opportunity to offer
      rehabilitation adapted to specific disorders, personalized in relation to the patient's
      performance, and in continuity with the therapist. In this research project, we will use the
      principle of neurofeedback rehabilitation (EEG) based on motor imaging with a brain-computer
      interface. Feedback will consist of therapeutic video games.Here, we will test the
      feasibility of such approach in 10 healthy subjects, 10 patients with amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis and 10 patients with uppel shoulder surgery.
