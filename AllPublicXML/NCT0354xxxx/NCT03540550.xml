  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inulin-type fructans (ITF) are fermentable dietary fibres that can confer beneficial health
      effects through changes in the gut microbiota. However, their effect on gut sensitivity and
      nutritional behaviour is a matter of debate.

      The investigators evaluated, in healthy individuals, the impact of shifting from their usual
      food habits towards a diet based on the daily consumption of ITF-rich vegetables on gut
      microbiota, gastro-intestinal symptoms and food-related behaviour.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gut microbiota composition</measure>
    <time_frame>33 days</time_frame>
    <description>Gut microbiota composition is assessed by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. This analysis allows to obtain the relative abundance (%) of the different bacterial taxa and OTUs (operational taxonomic units).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gut microbiota fermentation in vivo</measure>
    <time_frame>33 days</time_frame>
    <description>Gut microbiota fermentation is assessed in vivo by an hydrogen breath test. After an oral load of purified inulin, the level of expired hydrogen (ppm) is measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gut microbiota fermentation in vitro</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Gut microbiota fermentation is assessed in vitro by the measurement of total gas (ml/g of dry matter) produced from subject feces incubated with inulin-rich substrates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>33 days</time_frame>
    <description>Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (horizontal line of 100 mm). Each subject completed seven separate scales, one for each symptom (rumble, burp, bloating, discomfort, nausea, flatulence, cramp), ranging from &quot;no sensation&quot; (0 mm) to &quot;very severe sensation&quot; (100 mm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetite-related feelings</measure>
    <time_frame>33 days</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite-related feelings were assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (horizontal line of 100 mm). Each subject completed seven separate scales, one for each appetite-related feeling (satiety, intention to eat, fullness, sweet envy, very sweet envy, fat envy, salt envy), ranging from &quot;no sensation&quot; (0 mm or 100 mm depending on the feeling) , to &quot;very strong sensation&quot; (0 mm or 100 mm depending on the feeling).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of gastrointestinal symptoms with gut bacteria</measure>
    <time_frame>33 days</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of gastrointestinal symptoms were correlated (Spearman correlations) with the relative abundance of bacterial taxa and OTUs (operational taxonomic units)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short chain fatty acids production</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production was assessed in vitro by the measurement of total SCFAs (mg/g of dry matter) produced from subject feces incubated with inulin-rich substrates.</description>
