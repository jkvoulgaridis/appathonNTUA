  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental trauma injuries during childhood may have an adverse impact on oral health throughout
      life. If trauma injuries causes pulpal necrosis, then the root stop forming. These teeth have
      consequently a questionable long-term survival.

      Dental management of necrotic teeth with aberrant root formation represents a challenging
      clinical situation. The classical approach for treating these teeth includes apexification.
      Both apexification with Calcium hydroxide and MTA do not achieve the goals of continued root
      development or restoration of pulp tissue functionality.

      In the last decades, a biological based approach referred as &quot;revascularization&quot;, or
      &quot;regeneration&quot; has emerged as a biological treatment for necrotic pulps with aberrant root
      development. This treatment aims to regenerate pulp-like tissue within the root canal space
      after inducing an influx of stem cells from the apical papilla that results in
      reestablishment of pulp protective functions. There is evidence supporting the regeneration
      potential of dental tissues after regenerative endodontic treatment. However, root formation
      in traumatized immature teeth seems variable.

      The overall goal of this study is to gain knowledge about the treatment of immature necrotic
      teeth in young individuals due to dental trauma. The primary goal is to compare volumetric
      hard tissue formation between the MTA apexification and the regeneration treatment.

      A randomized controlled trial, employing 34 young individuals aged 6-18 years, with immature
      necrotic teeth will be included. The test group will be treated by the regeneration procedure
      and the control group by the application of an MTA-plug. Clinical and low-dose cone-beam
      computed tomography scans (preoperatively and at 18-months follow-up) will be retrieved.
      Clinical data with information about tooth survival, absents of symptoms, resolution of
      infection and root development will be taken at every session.
