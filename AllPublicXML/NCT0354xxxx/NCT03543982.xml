    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of an oral probiotic product on
      the vaginal microbiome and on parameters of vaginal health. Eligible subjects will utilize
      the investigational product as directed for a period of 28 days. The vaginal microbial
      community and parameters of vaginal health will be measured at baseline and after 14 and 28
      days of supplementation. A follow-up post-supplementation visit will be conducted on Day 42.
