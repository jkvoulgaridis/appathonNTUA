  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to determine whether LRRK2 kinase activity and/or
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage could serve as potential biomarkers in PD.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Assess the levels of phosphorylated LRRK2 and LRRK2-phosphorylated Rabs, as measures of
           LRRK2 kinase activity, in PBMCs and neutrophils from LRRK2 PD, idiopathic PD,
           non-manifesting LRRK2 mutation carriers and healthy controls.

        -  Assess the levels of mtDNA damage in buffy coat from LRRK2 PD, idiopathic PD,
           non-manifesting LRRK2 mutation carriers and healthy controls.

        -  Correlate LRRK2 kinase activity to mtDNA damage in blood from LRRK2 PD, idiopathic-PD,
           non-manifesting LRRK2 mutation carriers and healthy controls.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the ability of the network to efficiently conduct a study involving biosample
           collection for PD research. Efficiency will be assessed using measures of the time taken
           to meet specific milestones within the study.

        -  To assess the ability of the network to collect high quality biospecimens adhering to
           agreed-upon, standardized protocols

        -  To gauge the willingness of participants to participate in subsequent Fox BioNet studies
