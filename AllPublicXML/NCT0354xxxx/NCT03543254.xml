    <textblock>
      There is no doubt that chronic migraine is a large public health problem, which is both
      disabling and costly. Many patients and headache doctors see Botulinum toxin (Botox)
      treatment as a big stride forward, but it is a problem that the effect has been shown in only
      one study, with a low therapeutic gain. For this reason, before this costly treatment is
      expanded to potentially several thousand patients in Norway, it would be highly desirable
      that 1) there is additional good scientific evidence for use of Botox , 2) a more effective
      treatment procedure is developed, 3) the potential for unblinding is reduced, and 4) the
      dose, number of injection sites and cost can be halved, and 5) the adverse effects are
      minimized. These may be the results of this pilot project where injections are given along
      the sutures, which can open up for a later randomized, blinded and controlled study.

First 100 U of Botox® is solved in 4 ml (cc) of isotone saline water (9 mg/ml), distributed in 4 syringes. This is half the usual concentration, allowing for better diffusion in order to reach the target structures.</description>

          -  Previous exposure at any time to any botulinum toxin serotype

          -  Infection at one or more injection site(s)

          -  Having received extracranial nerve block, cervical facet injection, or other
             interventional procedure for headache within the prior 3 months

          -  Use of opioids or barbiturate containing medication(s) &gt; 10 days per month within the
