  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large full-thickness skin defects, such as those resulting from trauma, large and giant
      congenital nevi, disfiguring scars, or tumor resection remain major clinical problems to
      patients and physicians. Skin flaps and grafts represent the current standard of care (SOC),
      but often present limitations associated with surgical morbidity and donor site availability.
      The investigators will enroll 64 patients who have their skin cancer surgically removed and
      require reconstructive procedure such as a skin flap/graft.

      To objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a nanofat-seeded
      biological scaffold versus the SOC in healing larger surgical defects (&gt;1.5cm) involving the
      lower limb that cannot be closed by direct suture and thus need a reconstructive procedure
      such as a skin flap/graft.

      Large full-thickness skin defects, such as those resulting from trauma, large and giant
      congenital nevi, disfiguring scars, or tumor resection remain major clinical problems to
      patients and physicians. Skin flaps and grafts represent the current standard of care (SOC),
      but often present limitations associated with surgical morbidity and donor site availability.
      To overcome these limitations, cultured epidermal autografts consisting of keratinocytes were
      developed to provide enough autologous skin. However, the routine use of these cultured
      epidermal autografts was hampered by its high risk of recurrent wound opening, long-term
      fragility, and increased rates of scar contractures.

      Tissue-engineered dermal skin substitutes containing complex dermal layers have also been
      developed to produce large, near-natural skin substitutes. They promote healing and avoid
      scar contracture; however, the healing times are long as they lack the active cellular and
      paracrine components of healing, and they often need a second delayed surgical procedure, a
      split-thickness skin graft, to obtain complete epithelization.

      The term &quot;nanofat grafting&quot; was first used by Tonnard et al. and constitutes a rich reservoir
      of regenerative precursor cells (including stromal vascular fraction cells, among which
      adipose-derived stem cells) with pro-angiogenic capabilities. The many proprieties of nanofat
      and the stromal vascular fraction in regenerative and aesthetic surgery are just being
      discovered. In particular, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the
      ability of these cells to differentiate into various skin cell lineages. Moreover, they are
      recognized as a powerful source for tissue regeneration because of their capability to
      secrete paracrine factors, initiating tissue repair and accelerating wound closure by skin
      regeneration instead of fibrotic scar formation.

      Few anecdotal reports have documented the efficacy of the stromal vascular fraction in acute
      as well as chronic wounds. However, no observation has explored the efficacy of nanofat in
      healing surgical defects. Of note, nanofat is substantially easier, faster, and remarkably
      less expensive to obtain when compared to the mechanically- or enzymatically-isolated stromal
      vascular fraction. At present, there is a noticeable lack of randomized-controlled evidence
      in the international literature. Thus, this would represent the most comprehensive and the
      first randomized, controlled experience documenting the use of nanofat for wound healing.

    <intervention_model_description>Nanofat is obtained via lipoaspiration of 10cc of fat from abdomen under moderate local tumescent anesthesia w/ saline. Cannula access point is anesthetized by local lidocaine infiltration. Lipoaspirate is processed into the nanofat using the Tonnard method, after 3-minute decantation. Aspiration is performed using a multihole 3mm cannula. Wound margin + bed is treated w/ topical &amp; local injections of nanofat, then covered w/ a biological scaffold, the inferior surface of which is soaked in nanofat; scaffold is fixed w/ external dressings or resorbable sutures; external covering includes polyurethane film &amp; 3 layers of dressings. Topical application creates a fine &lt;1mm nanofat layer. Scaffold (Puracol Plus) is left in place to integrate w/ surrounding skin, while external dressings changed at 7 &amp; 15 days. Lipoaspirate donor site needs mild to moderate compression for 24 hours &amp; suture removal (if not absorbed) at 7 days.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A blinded study physician will assess the healing surface area at each visit. A wound is considered &quot;healed&quot; when the wound has healed &gt;95% in surface by the physician assessment. Wounds in the intervention group are expected to have faster healing compared to the standard of care group.</description>

    <description>A physician blinded to the treatment group the subject is in will self-administer the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) which documents change in scar appearance over time. The VSS ranges from 0 (most desirable outcome) to 13 (least desirable outcome), thus, a lower score is considered to have a better outcome and a higher score is considered a worse outcome. The VSS consists of four sub-scales, with each sub-scale reporting a value. The &quot;pigmentation sub-scale&quot; ranges from 0 (normal pigmentation) to 2 (hyperpigmentation); the &quot;vascularity sub-scale&quot; ranges from 0 (normal appearance) to 3 (purple appearance); the &quot;pliability sub-scale&quot; ranges from 0 (normal pliability) to 5 (contracture); and the &quot;height sub-scale&quot; ranges from 0 (normal [flat]) to 3 (&gt;5mm). Sub-scale scores are totaled to give an overall VSS assessment score.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete a Visual Analogue Scale (Patient Scar Assessment Scale, PSAS) for scar assessment to rate how they think their wound site appears cosmetically compared to normal skin, and any complaints about how painful the site is, and how itchy it feels. Each question ranges from 1 (no complaints with itch or pain/as normal skin) to 10 (worst imaginable itch or pain/very different from normal skin). The PSAS ranges from 6 (best outcome score) to 66 (worst outcome score), thus a lower score is considered to have a better outcome and a higher score is considered a worse outcome.</description>
