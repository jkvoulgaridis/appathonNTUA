  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate evaluated the impact of preoperative HbA1c in diabetic
      patients on perioperative glycemic variability and outcome after off-pump coronary artery
      bypass (OPCAB).

      The medical records of patients who had a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes and underwent
      OPCAB from 2005 to 2017 will be reviewed. Patients are divided by HbA1c levels (&lt;7.0% or
      ≥7.0%). Glycemic variability during surgery and up to 24 hours after surgery is assessed by
      the coefficient of variation. The primary outcome is defined as a composite of postoperative
      permanent stroke, prolonged ventilation, deep sternal wound infection, renal failure,
      reoperation, mortality according to the definition of STS (Society of Thoracic Surgery)
      version 2.81 adult cardiac surgery database. If one or more of the above five morbidity or
      mortality occur, it is assumed that composite morbidity/mortality had occurred. We compare
      postoperative complications, mortality and perioperative glycemic variability between
      patients with HbA1c ≥7.0% and &lt;7.0%, and examined the effects of perioperative glycemic
      control on postoperative morbidity and mortality (composite morbidity/mortality).
