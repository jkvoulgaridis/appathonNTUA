    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement in Skin Laxity in Submental Region and Neck at Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Lift improvement as measured by quantitative analysis was considered greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20.0 square millimeter (mm^2) of the submental area Day 90 photograph compared to baseline photograph. The quantitative analysis was calculated by using five evenly spaced points on the neck. Area was calculated in between each of the 5 points and then sum of the five calculations was the total area of the region of interest.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Lift in Brow Region at Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Lift improvement as measured by quantitative analysis was considered minimum 0.5 millimeter (mm) Day 90 photograph compared to baseline photograph. The quantitative analysis was calculated by using five evenly spaced points along the natural outline of each participant's brow. Brow height was calculated using the sum and average of the five calculations in each brow area.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Overall Aesthetic Improvement as Assessed by the Principal Investigator Using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (PGAIS) at Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Overall aesthetic improvement was assessed by the principal investigator using global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS). At 90 days post-treatment, each principal investigator completed a GAIS, known as physician global aesthetic improvement scale (PGAIS) .The GAIS is 5-point scale (1-5), where: 1(very much improved); 2 (much improved); 3 (improved); 4 (no change); 5 (worse). Only participants who had any improvement were reported.</description>
