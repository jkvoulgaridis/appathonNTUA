      This study aims to evaluate the effect of platelet rich plasma combined with exercise therapy
      for patients with partial thickness rotator cuff tears.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to exam the outcome of rotator cuff tear patients who received
      platelet rich plasma injection followed by rehabilitative exercise. The specific aim of this
      study is to determine the outcomes of treatment of partial thickness rotator cuff tears with
      platelet rich plasma (PRP) and rehabilitative exercise. Subjects with partial thickness
      rotator cuff tears will be designated to receive an injection of PRP or hyaluronic acid,
      followed by rehabilitative exercise. Shoulder function and tendon healing will be evaluated
      using the patient surveys as well as ultrasound. Subjects will be followed for 3 months to
      determine the outcomes of the treatment.

      The hypothesis is that there is no difference in healing rate or functional outcomes in
      patients treated with PRP injections plus rehabilitative exercise compared with hyaluronic
      acid injection plus rehabilitative exercise for the treatment of partial thickness rotator
      cuff tears.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant-Murley shoulder score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change is measured from baseline to 1.5 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant score assesses pain, function, ROM, and strength. Pain is allotted a maximum of 15 points, activities of daily living (function)20 points, ROM 40 points, and strength 25 points. The component scores are summated to achieve a maximum possible total score of 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change is measured from baseline to 1.5 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) is a 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing no pain to '10' representing worst pain imaginable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Change is measured from baseline to 1.5 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The shoulder range of motion (ROM) is measured in both active and passive manner and in four direction including flexion, extension, internal rotation and external rotation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change is measured from baseline to 1.5 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>SPADI contains 13 items that assess two domains; a 5-item subscale that measures pain and an 8-item subscale that measures disability. The scores from both domains are averaged to derive a total score with 0 being the best outcome (less disability) and 100 the worst (greater disability).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Size of rotator cuff tear</measure>
    <time_frame>Change is measured from baseline to 1.5 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rotator cuff tear size will be determined using ultrasound imaging. The image will be conducted in sagittal plan, transverse plan and will measure the maximal size of tear.</description>
