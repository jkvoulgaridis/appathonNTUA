    <textblock>
      This experiment has now collected 50 cases, all through CT chest scans and blood exosome
      detection. Twenty-two patients underwent surgical treatment and 14 tissue specimens were
      examined for cancer and paracancerous tissue exosomesWe found that exosomal micor-A was
      highly expressed in early stage lung cancer tissues and was significantly higher than
      paracancerous tissues. The micor-A in the adjacent tissues was significantly higher than that
      in peripheral blood exosomes

        From November 2017 to June 2019, there were nodules on the lungs, both men and women, and
        patients of the same age who had CT target reconstruction and miRNA and ctDNA detection at
        the same time had complete follow-up data.

        Inclusion Criteria:1. At least 18 years of age, male or female; 2. No patients with acute
        disease; 3. Chest or LDCT examination for the first time found 5-30mm pulmonary nodule
        patients, and ruled out disseminated tuberculosis; 4. Past pulmonary nodes Festival failed
        to diagnose. 5. Have not received a history of surgical treatment of the lungs; 6. Patients
        who have not received targeted drugs, biological treatments, immunosuppressive agents, and
        modulators; 7. No organ transplants; 8. Signed informed consent before undergoing clinical
        studies Consent and adherence to the research protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:1. Pulmonary nodules have been treated surgically (considering that
        surgery has been performed to interfere with the study); 2. History of organ transplants
        such as lung transplantation (consider the use of allogeneic genes and immunosuppressive
        agents); 3. Pregnancy or lactation (consider Failure to perform regular CT follow-up and
        fetal component effects. 4. Known HIV-positive or only AIDS-related diseases (taking into
        account interference with the use of immune drugs); 5. Being targeted drugs,
        immunosuppressive agents, immunomodulators, biotherapies Patients; 6. Active pulmonary
        tuberculosis (consider infectious and referral missing factors); 7. RNA-like viral
        infections: such as SARS, HIV, hepatitis virus (except for hepatitis B, the other four are
        all RNA viruses), influenza virus, Bird flu virus, H5N1, Ebola, measles, etc. 8. Various
        blood system diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic
        syndrome, anemia, hemolysis, hemophilia, DIC, etc. 9. Recent history of blood transfusion
        (within 3~6 years) and potential for blood transfusion; 10. Patients with neurological
        disorders and mental disorders unable to cooperate; 11. Emergency treatment for acute and
        severe diseases; 12. No Willing to sign a written informed consent and follow the study
        protocol before they are willing to conduct clinical research; 13. The presence of the
        patient may interfere with any psychological, family, social or geography conditions that
        obey the requirements of the research protocol or the follow-up procedure. Discuss these
        conditions with the patient before entering the study.
