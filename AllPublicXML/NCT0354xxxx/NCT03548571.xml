    <textblock>
      Open, randomized study of a trivalent dendritic cell therapy compared to standard therapy in
      primary treated patients with IDH wild-type, MGMT-promotor methylated glioblastoma. The IMP
      is dendritic cells transfected with mRNA of survivin, hTERT og autologous tumor stem cells
      derived from tumorspheres.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous leukapheresis for enrichment of PBMCs is performed after enrollment of the patient
      into the trial. Ex vivo generated DCs will be frozen and stored in the vapour phase of liquid
      nitrogen.

      At first surgery, tumor biopsies will be cultured under sphere-forming conditions under ex
      vivo conditions for enrichment of glioblastoma stem cells. mRNA will purified and amplified
      from these autologous tumor stem cells.

      At specified intervals patients randomized to the vaccine group will receive intradermal
      injections of DCs transfected with mRNA from autologous tumor stem cells, survivin and hTERT.
      Injections will be given as three separate injections at three separate sites.

      Vaccination will be continued for as long as there are vaccines available.

             first vaccination). Women of childbearing potential and sexually active male
             participants must use reliable methods of contraception during the whole treatment
             period and 3 months after the last trial drug dose. Reliable methods of contraception
