  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first study that evaluates the effectiveness of antenatal
      corticosteroid (ACS) in late preterm twin neonates.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) has been proven to prevent adverse outcomes including
      respiratory morbidities in preterm neonates before 34 weeks of gestations. Recently, it has
      been suggested that ACS may be also effective for reduction of respiratory complications in
      singleton late preterm pregnancies. On the contrary, there is a paucity of information
      regarding the effectiveness of ACS in twin neonates with late preterm birth, and nowadays
      guidelines are recommending the use of ACS in twin pregnancies based on the evidences in
      singleton pregnancies. However, the effect of ACS in twin needs to be determined, because the
      rate of neonatal morbidities in twin preterm neonates seems to be different from that in
      singleton neonates. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of ACS in late preterm
      twin neonates.

    <intervention_model_description>In this multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, women who are at risk for late preterm birth (34+0wks-36+5wks) will be enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups receiving betamethasone(ACS) or placebo.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Enrolled women will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to ACS (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2). The randomization will be done by web-based randomization system which is operated by medical research collaborating center of Seoul National University Hospital. The ACS or placebo will be prepared by unblended researchers [clinical trial pharmacy]. Unblinded researchers will be designated at the beginning of this trial, and they will not participate in the subsequent process of data management and data analysis. Neither the enrolled pregnant women nor the other investigators (except predeterminate unblinded researchers) will be aware of the result of random assignment.</masking_description>
