  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compare Male Health Sexual Questionnaire (MHSQ) before and after bariatric surgery to assess
      the sexual health of the obese men with a recommended and exhaustive tool. There are few data
      that evaluate the sexual health of this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sexual dysfunctions are more commonly in the obese men population. For example, erectile
      dysfunction is more than twice as common as in the general population. However, the data on
      sexuality in the broad sense are rarer. The latter are in favor of an inconsistent
      improvement and use the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory. The MHSQ is now recommended by
      the French Urology Association to evaluate more fully male sexuality. Its relatively recent
      validation explains the few studies referring to. The investigators believe that one of the
      major determinants of sexual health in obese men is the self-image.

      The investigators will submit to the patients the male heath sexual questionnaire, the Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Multidimensional Body Self Relations Questionnaire -
      Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) and collect weight, BMI and age during the classic follow up.
      The data will be collected during the preoperative assessment as well as 6 months and 12
      months postoperatively.
