    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical trial of cytotoxic T cell injection induced by dendritic cells
      loaded with 6B11 anti-idiotype minibody (6b11 - OCIK injection) for recurrent
      platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. Main purpose of this research is to determine
      the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of 6B11-OCIK injection in the treatment of patients with
      epithelial ovarian cancer. Moreover, secondary purpose is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerance of autologous 6B11-OCIK injection in the treatment of patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer. Thirdly, exploratory purpose is to obtain an initial understanding of effect
      of autologous 6B11-OCIK injection on patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, and evaluate
      the effect of autologous 6B11-OCIK injection on the immune system of patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer.

      Epithelial Ovarian Cancer remains the most lethal of all gynecologic malignancies.
      Immunotherapy is considered to be one of the most promising approaches in cancer therapy.
      This is a phase I clinical trial of cytotoxic T cell injection induced by dendritic cells
      loaded with 6B11 anti-idiotype minibody (6b11-OCIK injection) for drug -resistant and
      recurrence epithelial ovarian cancer. The investigators plan to recruit for 10 patients with
      epithelial ovarian cancer. The result of this study was statistic and analyzed with the
      record of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.1) evaluation standard.

      In this experiment, the initial dose of 1-2 x 10^9 cell infusion was designed for each
      patient.

      The primary endpoints of the Phase I study are:

      Dose limited toxicity (DLT) - it will be used to determine the maximum tolerance dose (MTD).

    <description>Cell infusion dose: 1-2×10^9 cells was used as the initial dose for each subject. Each patient received the same dose-climbing infusion strategy. Specifically, each patient received 1-2×10^9 on day 1, 3-5×10^9 on day 6±2, 6 -10×10^9 on day 11±2, 6-7×10^9 on day 25±7 and 39±7. The maximum dose was 10×10^9. If the cell culture fails to reach the specified number of cells (6-10×10^9) during the third, fourth and fifth cell infusion, the patients was transfused with the maximum number of cells obtained in the actual culture.</description>
