      In order to evaluate the effectiveness of musical treadimll on gait parameters in patients
      with Parkinson's Disease, the investigators compare the outcome measures on two group of
      patients: one will undergo a 4-week daily musical treadmill training and one will undergo a
      4-week daily traditional treadmill training

      Gait is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It has been shown that treadmill
      training is useful in improving the gait's parameters in patients in early-moderate stages of
      disease. Moreover, it has been shown that the music, exploiting the entrainment, is effective
      in order to ameliorate several gait parameters, as step lenghts and cadence. No data are
      available about the effectiveness of the association between treadmill and music. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the effect of a gait training using musical treadmill in patients
      in stages I-II-III Hoehn &amp; Yahr (H&amp;Y).

      100 patients with PD in early-moderate stage of disease will be enrolled. All patients will
      undergo an intensive treatment: 2 session of 20-minutes treadmill training per day, 5 times a
      week, for 4 weeks. Treadmill speed will be previously set at 20% less the confidence speed
      and progressively increased of 20%. All patients will be evaluat at the enrolment and at the
      end of the treatment. The outcome misures are: 6 Minute Walking Test and Timed Up and Go
      Test.
