  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a widely applied therapy to treat chronic neuropathic pain,
      and one of the most common indications is persisting radicular neuropathic pain following
      lumbar spine surgery. In traditional SCS therapies, the objective has been to replace the
      pain sensation with paresthesia. The anticipation is that the electrical current alters pain
      processing by masking the sensation of pain with a comfortable tingling or paresthesia.
      Although patients mostly cope with paresthesia, a significant proportion reports that the
      sensation is unpleasant.

      'Burst' SCS utilizes complex programming to deliver high-frequency stimuli. This SCS
      technique seems to provide paresthesia-free stimulation, resulting in better pain relief of
      low back and leg pain then traditional tonic stimulation.

      The widespread use of SCS has not been backed by solid evidence. The absence of
      placebo-controlled trials has long been an important point of criticism, but due to the
      nature of the intervention with sensation of paresthesia, studies with placebo control have
      so far not been considered possible. When 'burst' SCS is used the stimulation is often
      unnoticed by the patient, allowing comparison with placebo stimulation.

      The aim of this randomized double-blind sham-controlled crossover trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy of 'burst' spinal cord stimulation for chronic radicular pain following spine
      surgery.

The ODI questionnaire quantifies disability for degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine and covers intensity of pain, ability to lift, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. The index is scored from 0 to 100. Zero means no disability and 100 reflects maximum disability.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have undergone ≥1 back surgeries and developed chronic radicular pain that has
             remained refractory to non-surgical treatment for ≥6 months

          -  Minimum pain intensity of 5/10 on the leg pain NRS at baseline

          -  Successful two-week SCS testing period with tonic stimulation (≥2 points reduction in
             leg pain NRS from baseline). This means patients will experience paresthesia during
             the SCS trial period

             Olavs University Hospital

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Coexisting conditions that would increase procedural risk (e.g., sepsis, coagulopathy)

          -  History of laminectomy or posterior fusion at the thoracolumbar junction, where
             percutaneous electrode end tips are routinely placed.
