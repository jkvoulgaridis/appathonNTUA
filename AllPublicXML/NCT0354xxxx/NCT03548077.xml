  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With funding from the Candian Cancer Society, the Men's Healthy Eating Active Living (MHEAL)
      project began the development, evaluation, and optimization of a program called POWERPLAY to
      promote men's health at work.

    <textblock>
      The MHEAL project began November 2013 and a program (called &quot;POWERPLAY&quot;) was developed to
      support men's active living and healthy eating based on a systematic review of the literature
      and consultations with groups of men. From 2014-2017 six male-dominated worksites in northern
      BC offered POWERPLAY and participated in this study. Using a quasi-experimental pre-post
      design as well as interviews with worksite leads, the program was demonstrated to be an
      effective, feasible, and acceptable approach to the promotion of modifiable behaviours known
      to reduce the risk of cancer among working men in northern settings, and several manuscripts
      were published. Furthermore, the POWERPLAY program was optimized based on feedback received
      to include friendly competitions, weekly motivational messages, men-friendly language/images,
      and pedometers, and a manual for employers and website were developed
      (http://www.powerplayatwork.com/). A new module to support mental well-being was created in
      2017 based on a systematic review of the literature for men's mental wellness programs,
      consultations with men working in northern workplaces, and interviews with workplace
      representatives. A module to support smoking cessation module was created in 2018.
