  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease leading to
      cirrhosis. Researches reported patients with PBC may involve abnormalities on skeleton,
      thyroid and exocrine glands. However, whether this autoimmune disease would cause cardiac
      impairment is scarcely investigated. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance(CMR) is recently
      developed as a reliable modality to evaluate the cardiac tissue characteristics and
      functions. This study aims to investigate the cardiac status in PBC patients based on CMR.

      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive and uncommon inflammatory autoimmune
      cholesteric liver diseaseï¼Œwhich will contribute to cirrhosis. Symptoms and course of primary
      biliary cholangitis can be diverse, wherefore the targets of the current treatment are
      focused on the prevention of end-stage liver disease. Researches reported patients with PBC
      may involve abnormalities on skeleton, thyroid and exocrine glands. However, whether this
      autoimmune disease would cause cardiac impairment is scarcely investigated. From our clinical
      practice, the cardiac structural abnormal can be found in certain patients with PBC detected
      by cardiovascular magnet resonance (CMR). CMR is the primary and emerging imaging modality
      for myocardial tissue characterisation, and it is recommended as a gold standard for
      functional imaging and assessment. This single-center, prospective observational study plans
      to identify the type and the severity of cardiac changes in PBC.

        Consecutive subjects were prospectively enrolled into 2 cohorts between September 2017 and
        December 2018. The cohorts were divided as follows: the PBC patients group and the control
        group.
