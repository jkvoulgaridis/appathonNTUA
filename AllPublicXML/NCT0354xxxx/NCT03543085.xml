      This study is a prospective, single-arm, open label, single center to confirm the
      effectiveness and safety of an ultra-high frequency (500 KHz) spinal cord stimulation in
      patients with chronic back pain or lower limb pain. The trial length is 14 days. Patients
      will be given ultrahigh frequency pulse stimulation, up to 3 times in every 24 hours, and VAS
      will be obtained at least once a day. Compared to previous study conducted last year, patient
      can now have two lead implant sites for different pain locations. The electrode implantation
      site will be epidural space instead of Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≧20 and ≦75

          2. Have a symptom of back or lower limb pain with a diagnosis related to spinal lesion,
             herniated disc, nerve injury, stenosis, failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), complex
             regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or ischemic lower limb pain and have pain history of &gt;6
             months.

          3. Have an average pain score &gt;5 by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on inclusion.

          4. Has failed to achieve adequate pain relief from prior pharmacologic treatments.

          5. In the judgement of the investigator, the subject is an appropriate candidate for the
             trial procedure.

          6. The subject is willing and able to comply with the procedure and requirements of this
             trial.

          7. The participant is able to understand and provide informed consent, and has signed

             pain or uncontrolled Diabetes mellitus (DM).

          4. Has had corticosteroid therapy at an intended site of stimulation within the past 30
             days.

             discretion.

          6. Currently has an active implantable device including International Classification of
             Diseases (ICD), pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator or intrathecal drug pump or subject

          8. Have a known terminal illness with life expectancy less than one year.

          9. Have a systematic or local infection, which may increase study risk.

         10. Currently has an indwelling device that may pose an increased risk of infection.

         11. Be pregnant or breast feeding.

         12. Have a medical history of drug or alcohol addiction within the past 2 years.

         13. Participation in any investigational study in the last 30 days or current enrollment
             in any trial.

         14. Be currently involved in an injury claim law suit or medically related litigation,
             including workers compensation.

         15. Be a prisoner.
