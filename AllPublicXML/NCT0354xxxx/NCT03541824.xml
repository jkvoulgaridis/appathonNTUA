  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of an intervention aimed at promoting a
      healthy lifestyle and reducing risk factors associated with eating pathology, nonsuicidal
      self-injury, and suicidal behavior. We are also interested in assessing whether this
      intervention has the potential to prevent future symptoms of eating problems and self-harm
      urges and behaviors. The broader goal of this research is to identify factors that may help
      us better understand the prevention of self-harm behaviors and develop more effective
      treatments for these problems.

      The current study was designed as a proof-of-concept study to test the association between
      weight suppression (WS; difference between one's highest and lowest weight) and non-suicidal
      self-injury (NSSI). Previous research has found an association between current WS and
      lifetime NSSI and that this association was mediated by depressive symptoms and drive for
      thinness. The current study therefore modified an existing online cognitive dissonance-based
      program (the e-Body Project) using mixed gender content (from the Body Project 4 All scripts)
      to target posited mediators, i.e., depressive symptoms and weight and shape concerns, in a
      sample of individuals with WS and engagement in current NSSI.
