  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates analgesic, antiinflammatory and metabolic effects of a supplement
      Epigenome-Antivir (extracts of glycyrrhiza roots, hippophae rhamnoides leaves, curcumin,
      green tea, and vitamin C) combined with acupuncture in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA)
      and metabolic syndrome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epigenome-Antivir components have long been used in traditional medicine and have been shown
      to exert anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. It has also been shown that
      acupuncture can provide a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis. It is anticipated that
      the combination of Epigenome-Antivir and acupuncture will reduce pain, inflammatory and
      metabolic markers in patients with OA and metabolic syndrome.

    <description>KOOS Pain consists of 9 items, which are answered on a 4-point likert scale (0=no problems, 4=extreme problems). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life with the The Short Form (36) Health Survey score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>he Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section.Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
