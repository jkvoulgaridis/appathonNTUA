  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients felt no pain or only mild discomfort with the unsedated colonoscopy. However,
      unsedated colonoscopy was thought to be an option for some but not for all. If we could able
      to identify which patients at high risk for painful colonoscopy in preoperational stage,
      targeted administration of sedatives or special techniques to these patients would be an
      attractive option.

      Here we prospectively collected the data during colonoscopy and investigated the possible
      risk factors associated with painful colonoscopy by using a step-wise multivariate regression
      model. Furthermore we developed a novel point score to predict whether the patients at high
      risk for painful colonoscopy and targeted offer an appropriate method of colonoscopy or with
      the aid of special techniques to help the completion of procedure.

        All patients were prescribed polyethylene glycol electrolyte for bowel preparation
        according to the preference of physicians. They were asked to drink the first 2L of
        PEG4000e at19:00-20:00 PM on the night before colonoscopy within 2 hours. Then, on the day
        of the examination, patients were asked to take the remaining 2L 5 hours before the
        procedure. Patients were encouraged to drink more clear liquids after purgatives for
        adequate hydration before colonoscopy. In addition, patients were instructed to have a
        regular meal for lunch and only liquid diets for dinner the day before the operation.
