  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with progressive decreases in arterial health and function as well as
      overall fitness. It is crucial to prevent or reduce the negative effects of aging on the
      vasculature and fitness components by implementing appropriate lifestyle interventions, such
      as exercise training. We examined the effects of a swimming (SWM) regimen on arterial
      stiffness (pulse wave velocity, PWV), blood pressure (BP), wave reflection (AIx), muscle
      strength and aerobic capacity in elderly women with stage 2 hypertension.

    <textblock>
      Using a parallel experimental design, participants were randomly assigned to either SWM
      (n=52) or non-exercising control group (n=48) for 20 weeks. Participant in the SWM group
      trained 3-4 days/week, progressing in duration from 25 to 45 min. Participants' carotid to
      radial PWV (crPWV), systolic and diastolic BP, AIx, strength and VO2max were measured at
      baseline and after 20 weeks of their assigned intervention.

    <description>Participants performed SWM training (combination of free style, breast stroke, and backstroke) for 20 weeks. For the first 5 weeks subjects swam 25-30 minutes/day, 3-4 days/week at ~60% of maximal heart rate. As their overall level of fitness and exercise skill improved, the intensity and duration of exercise increased to 40-45 minutes/day, 3-4 days/week at an intensity of 70-75% of the HRmax. Target HR was adjusted based on the observation that maximal heart rate during SWM is approximately 12 beats/min lower than that during running. Each subject was instructed to swim continuously except during the time needed for checking a target heart rate</description>

            <description>Participants performed SWM training (combination of free style, breast stroke, and backstroke) for 20 weeks. For the first 5 weeks subjects swam 25-30 minutes/day, 3-4 days/week at ~60% of maximal heart rate. As their overall level of fitness and exercise skill improved, the intensity and duration of exercise increased to 40-45 minutes/day, 3-4 days/week at an intensity of 70-75% of the HRmax. Target HR was adjusted based on the observation that maximal heart rate during SWM is approximately 12 beats/min lower than that during running. Each subject was instructed to swim continuously except during the time needed for checking a target heart rate

          <title>Swimming</title>
          <description>Participants performed SWM training (combination of free style, breast stroke, and backstroke) for 20 weeks. For the first 5 weeks subjects swam 25-30 minutes/day, 3-4 days/week at ~60% of maximal heart rate. As their overall level of fitness and exercise skill improved, the intensity and duration of exercise increased to 40-45 minutes/day, 3-4 days/week at an intensity of 70-75% of the HRmax. Target HR was adjusted based on the observation that maximal heart rate during SWM is approximately 12 beats/min lower than that during running. Each subject was instructed to swim continuously except during the time needed for checking a target heart rate
