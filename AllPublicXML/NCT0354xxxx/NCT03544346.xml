  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been significant recent interest on the issue of brain health in athletes.
      Participation in sports is generally viewed as extremely positive. Consistent evidence
      supports associations among exercise, cognitive vitality, neural functioning and decreased
      risk of cognitive decline. However, In the last decade, a dramatic shift in both public and
      scientific perception around the long-term consequences of concussion is evident. Rugby is a
      popular full-contact sport played throughout the world at varying levels of competition,
      including professional level. The game exposes players to inherent risk of injury including
      repetitive head impacts, due to the high number of collisions and tackles involved. Perhaps
      not surprisingly, given the physical nature of the sport, rugby has one of the highest rates
      of concussion of all full-contact sports. Evidence from a recent meta-anaysis found the
      incidence of concussion to be 4.73 per 1000 player match hours. Given the high incidence of
      concussion that has been reported in the literature to date, the issue of concussion and
      repeated head impact exposure is of particular concern in rugby.

      Comprehensive investigation of cognition in living retired sports persons with previous
      exposure to repetitive head impact is noticeably lacking in the literature to date. Findings
      are inconsistent and investigations are shrouded by consistent methodological biases and
      flaws, reducing the overall quality of the studies. Relatively little research has been
      conducted on the long-term effects of repetitive mild TBI or sports concussion on the retired
      athlete's brain health with ageing. The potential long-term consequences are poorly
      understood and warrant more research. This study aims to investigate the brain health of
      retired rugby players in comparison to retired rowers who have achieved the same levels of
      exercise, without exposure to SRCs

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate brain health and wellness of retired
      professional Irish rugby players in comparison to retired professional Irish rowers.

      Objectives:

      The objectives will be to:

      Obtain detailed demographic and overall health information from the retired rugby players and
      retired rowers.

      Use a battery of cognitive function tests to assess the cognitive health of the retired rugby
      players and retired rowers.

      Obtain blood samples from the retired rugby players and retired rowers in order to test for
      biomarkers indicative of neurodegenerative disease.

      Investigate rugby player's self-report history of sports-related concussion (number and
      nature of concussions) during their career. Player's self-report will be correlated where
      possible with established individual player medical data.
