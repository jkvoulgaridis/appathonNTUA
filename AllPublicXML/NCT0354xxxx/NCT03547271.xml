    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody
      response against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following a 3-dose series of MenACYW
      conjugate vaccine compared to a 3-dose series of a licensed meningococcal vaccine when each
      vaccine is given concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines (10-valent pneumococcal
      vaccine and diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Haemophilus
      influenzae type b [DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine]) to infants and toddlers 6 weeks to 18 months
      old.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response against meningococcal
           serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of 2 doses in infancy of MenACYW
           conjugate vaccine compared to 2 doses of a licensed meningococcal vaccine when each
           vaccine is given concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines (10-valent pneumococcal
           vaccine and DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine) to infants and toddlers 6 weeks to 18 months old.

        -  To describe the antibody responses against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W when
           MenACYW conjugate vaccine is administered in a 3-dose series concomitantly with the
           routine pediatric vaccines.

        -  To describe the antibody responses against the antigens of the routine pediatric
           vaccines administered in a 3-dose series concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or
           a licensed meningococcal vaccine.

        -  To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and a licensed meningococcal
           vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy infants and toddlers will receive MenACYW conjugate vaccine or a licensed
      meningococcal vaccine, and routine pediatric vaccines.

      All participants will be assessed for immunogenicity before and after vaccination.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study period, and includes solicited injection site
      and systemic reactions as well as unsolicited adverse events after each vaccine injection,
      and serious adverse events occurring throughout the study.
