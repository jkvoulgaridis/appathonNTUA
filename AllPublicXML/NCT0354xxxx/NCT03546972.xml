    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well a diabetes prevention program with or without hunger
      training works in helping to lower breast cancer risk in obese participants. A diabetes
      prevention program involves learning about and receiving materials on different strategies to
      encourage weight loss, and hunger training involves learning how to recognize hunger. It is
      not yet known whether adding hunger training to a diabetes prevention program helps
      participants control their weight that could reduce the risk of some cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of adding hunger training to the Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP) using the following criteria: accrual rates &gt; 50%, attrition rates &lt; 20% and, in the
      DPP-plus-hunger training (HT) group, training protocol adherence rates &gt; 75%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the magnitude of effect sizes and variation in outcome variables for the DPP-only
      and DPP-plus-HT interventions on changes in weight; in metabolic and breast cancer risk
      biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and blood glucose [BG] levels, levels of glycosylated
      hemoglobin, insulin resistance, adiponectin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein); and in
      proposed behavioral mediators (e.g., reduction in total energy intake, overall eating
      frequency, percent of eating events occurring at or below the average fasting blood BG
      level).

      II. Examine the mediation effects of proposed mechanisms of the interventions related to
      individual-level behavioral measures of eating self-regulation on the proposed outcomes using
      a multimodal approach of validated questionnaires and reliable ecological momentary
      assessment method.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Participants take part in DPP once a week over 1 hour for 16 weeks.

      GROUP B: Participants take part in DPP once a week over 1 hour for 16 weeks and hunger
      training once a week during weeks 2-6.

             model lifetime risk &gt; 20% or a 5 year risk &gt;1.66%, a history of deleterious BRCA1/2
             mutation or mantle radiation, a history of ductal cancer in situ, or a history of high
             risk premalignant breast lesion.

             eligible.

          -  Has a current measured BMI less than 27 kg/m^2.

          -  Reports being unwilling to use Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), which requires daily
             blood sampling by finger pricks.

          -  Currently being actively treated for cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer.

          -  Known inability to participate in the ongoing appointments for the four months of the

          -  Previous or current treatment with any insulin regimen other than basal insulin, e.g.
             prandial or pre-mixed insulin (short term treatment due to intercurrent illness
             including gestational is allowed at the discretion for the investigator).
