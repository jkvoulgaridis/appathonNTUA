  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial is a pilot study to investigate the effect of auricular acupressure on
      insulin resistance in women with PCOS.A total of 100 subjects will be enrolled into this
      study and will be randomized into two groups.

      Auricular acupressure or sham auricular acupressure will be treated for three months. The
      primary outcome is the whole body insulin action assessed with HOMA-IR.
