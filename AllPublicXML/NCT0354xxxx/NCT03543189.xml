  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the
      investigational drug nivolumab (Opdivo™) in combination with high dose radiation.
      Investigators also want to see if these study drugs help to delay the progression of prostate
      cancer.

    <measure>Phase 1: Safety Run In - Rate of Dose Limiting Toxicity (CTCAE V5.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks after initiation of Nivolumab</time_frame>
    <description>An initial set of 6 participants will be enrolled at Dose Level 1. If 0 or 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed during Cycle 1, enrollment in the phase II at Dose Level 1 will be initiated. If DLT is observed in 2 patients during Cycle 1, an additional 3 participants will be enrolled at Dose Level 1 (total 9 patients). If DLT is observed in ≤ 2 of 9 patients, enrollment in the phase II as Dose Level 1 will be initiated. If DLT is observed in 3 or more of 9 patients at Dose Level 1, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded, this combination will be determined to be unsafe to conduct the phase II portion of the trial, and the trial will be discontinued.

    <intervention_name>Nivolumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Treatment with nivolumab will begin four weeks prior to the first brachytherapy treatment. Nivolumab will be given through a vein every 2 weeks for 4 courses. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response, resulting in decreased tumor growth.</description>
