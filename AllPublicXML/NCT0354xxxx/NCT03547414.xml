  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is one of the leading causes of death in patients admitted to the intensive care
      unit (ICU). Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in almost 50% of septic patients and is
      associated with significant mortality. Progression to the last stage (KDIGO stage 3) of AKI
      is an important step in the disease, as it usually requires initiation of RRT. Renal
      biomarkers are unable to accurately identify those patients who will progress to severe AKI
      (KDIGO 3). However, identification of patients at risk of progression to severe AKI could
      help the clinician to initiate optimal therapy including RRT. A new urine test, the
      Nephrocheck™ corresponding to the product of the urinary concentrations of 2 markers of renal
      tubule injury (TIMP2 and IGFBP7) has been validated. The Investigator have already performed
      two previous studies including septic shock patients (AKICHECK and BIOOCHECK). those previous
      datas will be reanalysed to examine whether the new urinary biomarkers TIMP2 and IGFBP7 can
      predict progression within 24 hours and 72 hours from mild and moderate (KDIGO 1 or 2) to
      severe AKI (KDIGO 3) in patients with septic shock.

      -All the datas required will be collected from two previous studies (AKICHECK and BIOCHECK)
      performed in 3 centers: Amiens medical ICU, Melun medico surgical ICU and Montpellier Medical
      ICU.

    <description>A fresh urine sample was collected on inclusion (maximum 6 hours after starting catecholamines) through the urine collecting tube and frozen at -80°C. At the end of the study, urine samples were thawed and centrifuged as recommended by the manufacturer and the urinary TIMP2*IGFBP7 concentration was determined using the Nephrocheck™ test. The Nephrocheck™ test simultaneously measures into the Astute 140™ meter (a bench top analyzer) the urinary concentrations of TIMP2 and IGFBP7 on 100 µl of urine mixed with 100 µl of buffer. The result is expressed as a single number corresponding to the product of TIMP2 and IGFBP7 concentrations.</description>
