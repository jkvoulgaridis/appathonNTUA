      Multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, partially blinded trial comparing the safety
      and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation versus placebo both delivered by rectal
      enema in subjects 18 years of age or older with recurrent Clostridium difficile Associated
      Disease (CDAD). 162 male or female subjects will be enrolled in the study. Enrolled subjects
      will be randomized at each site to receive either FMT by enema or placebo by enema in a 2:1
      ratio. Study duration is 3 years, subject participation duration is approximately 1 year. The
      primary study objectives are: 1) to evaluate the safety of FMT(s) delivered by enema vs.
      placebo delivered by enema and 2) to determine efficacy of FMT delivered by enema vs. placebo
      delivered by enema.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, partially blinded trial comparing the
      safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation versus placebo both delivered by
      rectal enema in subjects 18 years of age or older with recurrent Clostridium difficile
      Associated Disease (CDAD). 162 (108 in the FMT group, 54 in the placebo group) male or female
      subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects must have had treatment for most recent CDAD
      with at least 10 days of either metronidazole po/IV (500 mg tid), oral vancomycin (at least
      125 mg qid), or oral fidaxomicin (200 mg bid) and have no diarrheal symptoms (&lt;3 unformed
      stools per 24 hour period) off antibiotics during the washout period. Enrolled subjects will
      be randomized at each site to receive either FMT by enema or placebo by enema in a 2:1 ratio.
      The study is described as partially blinded because by design subjects are to be blinded only
      to a certain point. Subjects will be followed for clinical response (efficacy) and safety.
      The study duration is 3 years, subject participation duration is approximately 1 year. The
      primary study objectives are: 1) to evaluate the safety of FMT(s) delivered by enema vs.
      placebo delivered by enema and 2) to determine efficacy of FMT delivered by enema vs. placebo
      delivered by enema. Secondary objectives: 1) to evaluate the sustained clinical response rate
      of FMTs delivered by enema vs. placebo delivered by enema, 2) to evaluate the rate of
      recurrent CDAD, and 3) to evaluate the time to recurrent CDAD.
