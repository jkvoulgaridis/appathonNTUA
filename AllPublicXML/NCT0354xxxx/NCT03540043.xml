          4. Patients with IGA score of 2 to 3 (mild-to-moderate) at Day 0.

          5. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum
             Beta-hCG) at the screening visit - unless they are surgically sterile (hysterectomy,

             weeks for hormonal contraceptives) before Day 0 and at least 1 month after the last
             study drug administration. Effective contraceptive methods include:

               -  Barrier methods such as condom, sponge or diaphragm combined with spermicide in
                  foam, gel or cream;

                  include Depo Provera, Evra and Nuvaring; and

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD).

          7. Patients must be capable of giving informed consent and the consent must be obtained
             prior to any study related procedures.
