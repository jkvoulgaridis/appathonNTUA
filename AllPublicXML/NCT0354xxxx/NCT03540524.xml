        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male subject ≥18 years of age, on the day of signing the Informed Consent
             Form (ICF)

          -  Confirmed clinical diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) (documented in the subject's
             medical record).

          -  Eligible cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genotype at
             screening:

               -  Cohort A: Homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation

               -  Cohort B: Heterozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation with a potentiator
                  non-responsive mutation on the second allele

               -  Cohort C: Homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation

          -  A body weight of ≥40 kg at screening.

          -  Stable concomitant medication for pulmonary health for CF for at least 4 weeks prior
             to the first study drug administration and planned continuation of the same
             concomitant medication for the duration of the dosing period of the study. Subjects
             with diabetes mellitus and/or pancreatic insufficiency are eligible for the study
             provided they are on stable treatment (e.g. medication, diet, pancreatic enzyme
             replacement therapy) for at least 4 weeks prior to the first study drug administration
             in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1): 40% ≤ FEV1 ≤ 90% of predicted normal for
             age, sex, and height at screening (pre- or post bronchodilator) at screening.

          -  Sweat chloride concentration ≥60 mmol/L at screening.

          -  Non-smoker and non-user of any nicotine and or cannabis containing products. A
             non-smoker is defined as an individual who has abstained from smoking for at least 1
             year prior to the screening. A non-user is defined as an individual who has abstained
             from any nicotine containing products for at least 1 year prior to the screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or ongoing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

          -  Medical history of cataract (or lens opacity) and/or glaucoma.

             screening period.

          -  Unstable pulmonary status or respiratory tract infection (including rhinosinusitis)
             requiring a change in therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first study drug
             administration.

          -  History of clinically meaningful unstable or uncontrolled chronic disease that makes
             the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Need for supplemental oxygen during the day, and &gt;2 L/minute while sleeping.

          -  History of hepatic cirrhosis with portal hypertension (e.g., signs/symptoms of
             splenomegaly, esophageal varices).

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin with no evidence of recurrence and/or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has
             been treated with no evidence of recurrence).

          -  Use of any moderate and strong inhibitor(s) or inducer(s) of CYP3A4 within 4 weeks
             prior to the first study drug administration (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole,
             ketoconazole, telithromycin, rifampin, carbamazepine).

          -  Use of CFTR modulator therapy (e.g., lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor) within 4 weeks prior
             to the first study drug administration.

          -  Use of any oral corticosteroid within 3 months of screening; or history of oral
             corticosteroid use for ≥30 days (cumulative) within 2 years of screening.

          -  Abnormal liver function test at screening; defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or alkaline phosphatase and/or
             gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) ≥3× the upper limit of normal (ULN); and/or total
             bilirubin ≥1.5× the ULN.
