  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, with the increasing intensities of the tobacco industry and air pollution in
      China, the incidence and mortality of lung cancer have become the most important issue that
      threatens human health.Over the past two decades, the treatment of SCLC still stays in the
      mode of treatment based on radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

      This is a prospective, single-center, one-arm clinical study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of apatinib plus chemotherapy for second-line and above treatment of
      advanced SCLC.

      30 patients will receive apatinib 500mg qd orally, if the patient has a grade 3/4 adverse
      reaction during apatinib treatment, it can be reduced to apatinib 250mg qd orally.The dose
      was later reduced from 500 mg to 250 mg per day based on a recommendation of the principal
      investigator to reduce the adverse events. Chemotherapeutic agents are limited to irinotecan
      or docetaxel alone.The primary outcome endpoint was progression-free survival
