  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of GSK2857916 when administered
      in combination with approved regimens of either Lenalidomide Plus Dexamethasone [Len/Dex (Arm
      A)] or Bortezomib Plus Dexamethasone [Bor/Dex (Arm B)] in participants with RRMM, i.e., those
      who have relapsed or who are refractory to at least 1 line of approved therapy. Part 1 of the
      study is a dose escalation phase to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 3 dose
      levels and up to 2 dosing schedules of GSK2857916 in combination with the two standard of
      care (SoC) regimens. Part 2 will further evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical
      activity of GSK2857916 at selected dose levels and dosing schedules in combination with
      Len/Dex or Bor/Dex.

      Up to a total of 123 evaluable participants will be enrolled in the study with up to 33 Part
      1 and up to 90 in Part 2. Participants receiving treatment Arm A, may continue combination
      treatment until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), intolerable adverse events (AEs
      ), consent withdrawal, or death. The participants receiving treatment Arm B, may continue
      combination treatment for a total of up to 8 cycles. After 8 cycles of combination therapy,
      the participants will continue treatment with GSK2857916, as a monotherapy until the
      occurrence of PD, intolerable AEs, consent withdrawal, or death.

Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 3 dose levels and up to 2 dosing schedules of GSK2857916 in combination with two SoC regimens (Arm A - GSK2857916 with Len/Dex and Arm B - GSK2857916 with Bor/Dex) For Arm A (GSK2857916 with Len/Dex), Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical activity of up to 3 dose levels and up to 2 dosing schedules of GSK2857916 with Len/Dex .
For Arm B (GSK2857916 with Bor/Dex), Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical activity of up to 2 dose levels and up to 2 dosing schedules of GSK2857916 with Bor/Dex.</intervention_model_description>

Up to 3 dose levels of GSK2857916 (1.9 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg), 2.5 mg/kg; 3.4 mg/kg) and 2 alternate dosing schedules will be evaluated in combination with a fixed dose of Len/Dex. Based on data from Arm A, first dose investigated in Amendment 2 will be 1.9 mg/kg. Cohorts will be recruited in blocks of 3 participants and will enroll with at least 1 day between each participant's first dose of GSK2857916 to reduce risk of exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). For a move to the next dose level, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)- from 3 evaluable participants will be reviewed. Participants in Arm A will receive Len, 25 mg or 10 mg orally daily, on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle with Dex, 40 mgs weekly per oral (PO) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle.
