  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study included patients who underwent secondary alveolar bone grafting by harvesting
      graft from the anterior iliac crest, in Oral and Maxillofacial Department, Faculty of
      Dentistry, Ankara University, Turkey, during the period from January 2012 to March 2016. All
      patients were operated using the same technique and by the same surgical team. Patients will
      be interviewed to fill Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and Postsurgical Patient Satisfaction
      Questionnaire (PSPSQ) 6 months postoperatively. The questionnaires will be used to assess the
      relationship between health quality and patient satisfaction. Also, grafted sites will be
      evaluated with respect to fistula, the presence of cleft palate, and infection.The
      descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analyses will be made using PSPSQ scores and
      SF-12 PCS and MCS scores.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The postsurgical patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSPSQ) was designed to assess each
      patient's overall satisfaction with the procedure(s), functional improvements, and recognized
      or perceived negative effects of the procedures. One of the most commonly used measures of
      HRQoL is SF-36, which has been reduced to 12 items with the minimal loss of information to
      form SF-12 . HRQoL was assessed using SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental
      Component Summary (MCS) scores.

    <description>all participants will be called to faculty. SF-12 will be done. SF-12 is calculated using the scoring table. Health-related quality of life, which was measured using the Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores of SF-12 was assessed. Physical component is scored from 0 to 100 with 0 representing the worst and 100 representing the best health status.</description>

    <measure>Postsurgical Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSPSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>all participants will be called to faculty. PSPSQ will be done. Patient satisfaction will be assessed by analyzing data gathered from PSPSQ. PSPSQ included seven questions. It is designed to assess each patient's overall satisfaction with the procedure(s), functional improvements, and recognized or perceived negative effects of the procedures. The 7-point Likert (poor to excellent), scale is used so that the person who answers the questions can rate the level of related satisfaction with each question. The final outcome is between 7 and 49. Higher scores are associated with satisfaction.</description>
