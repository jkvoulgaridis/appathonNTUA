  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is an innovative school-based program for urban children with moderate to
      severe persistent or difficult-to-control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma
      Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program enhances a school-based, primary care directed
      asthma program with specialist-supported care to ensure optimal guideline based treatment.
      This study is a full-scale randomized trial of TEAM-UP versus an enhanced care comparison
      group. Primary care physicians (PCP) of all enrolled children (n=360, 4-12 yrs.) will be
      prompted to initiate directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medication through
      school and to make a specialist referral. For children in the TEAM-UP group, the specialist
      visits will be facilitated via telemedicine at school. The telemedicine specialist visit will
      be scheduled after 4 weeks of initiating DOT, in order to allow for accurate guideline-based
      assessments of medication and care needs once adherence with a daily controller medication is
      established. There will also be 2 telemedicine follow-up specialist visits to assess the
      child's response to treatment and make needed adjustments. The study will use the existing
      community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine and DOT in school, and maintaining
      collaboration with PCPs. Blinded follow-ups will occur at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months after
      baseline, and the primary outcome is the comparison of symptom-free days (SFD) at each
      follow-up time point.

    <description>Children randomly assigned to TEAM-UP will have a telemedicine assisted specialist visit scheduled after 4 weeks of initiating DOT at school, as well as 2 subsequent follow-up visits. The visits will be performed by a specialist in pediatric asthma, to implement guideline-based care. Prescriptions for asthma medications will be prescribed to be delivered as directly observed therapy in school.</description>

    <description>Similar to the TEAM-UP group, children in the Enhanced Care group will receive a symptom assessment and asthma education materials at baseline, and we will contact the PCP by facsimile or email and will recommend DOT of preventive asthma medication through school as well as a referral to specialist. However specialist visits will not be facilitated via telemedicine.</description>
