  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients will develop metastases in the course of
      their disease. Cytotoxic therapy is a standard treatment in this setting but yields average
      tumor response rates of 25% at first line and ≤10% at later lines. It is also limited in the
      number of lines and courses by tolerance issues. Trials include poly/oligometastases
      indistinctively and suggest that consolidation ablation is used in ~20% of patients with
      residual oligometastases refractory to chemotherapy. Oligometastases represent a stage of
      disease between completely absent and widely metastatic, and which might be cured if the
      limited numbers of metastatic sites are eradicated. Ablative strategies to treat patients
      with oligometastases from sarcomas yield prolonged survival times and stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with excellent tolerance. Surgery may be offered in
      selected metastatic cases. Alternatively and increasingly, SBRT yields high control rates at
      treated sites (≥ 80%). The so-called radioresistance of sarcomas is overcome by the high
      doses per fraction made possible owing to the high precision achieved with SBRT. SBRT is an
      accepted treatment strategy provided that tumor burden remains limited in the number and size
      of metastases. Systemic treatment can be combined with SBRT. SBRT may produce abscopal
      effects where tumors outside the irradiation area also demonstrate tumor shrinkage in some
      occurrences. SBRT produces systemic antitumoral immune response in certain conditions and
      enhances radiation-induced tumor cell death compared to conventional lower dose irradiation.
      Abscopal effects have been potentialized with SBRT/immunotherapy in several tumor models.
      Sarcomas are a privileged target tumor given their high metastatic propensity.

      Several potent immunomodulators that skew the tumor immune microenvironment toward a
      proimmunity context are being investigated in STS either alone or in combination with
      chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The PD-1 receptor is present within the tumor
      microenvironment, and limits the activity of infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus
      blocking effective immune responses. The action of PD-1 is triggered upon binding to its
      ligands. PD-1 can stimulate the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells. Moreover,
      blockade of PD-1 can stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. Significant responses have been
      obtained in several sarcomas with acceptable tolerance. Preliminary clinical experience
      suggests that immunotherapy can be efficient in refractory leiomyosarcomas. Several drugs
      targeting the PD-1/PD-L1/2 axis are ongoing either as single agents or in combination with
      ipilimumab, kinase inhibitors, or chemotherapy in STS subtypes. Combination of radiotherapy
      with immunotherapy is included as a means of increasing tumor antigen release in metastatic
      STS. Immunomodulated SBRT is a particularly attractive strategy, given the potential of
      radiation to induce cytotoxicity in tumors and induce abscopal effects. A phase II radiation
      trial showed increased apoptosis-, intra-tumoral dendritic cells and accumulation of
      intratumoral T cells in STS with correlation with tumor-specific immune responses.

      We here propose a randomized phase II study to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) with
      the combination of SBRT/immunotherapy in oligometastatic STS patients.

      SBRT is well-tolerated with hardly any severe toxicity (fewer than 5% acute and late grade 3
      toxicities). It is performed in an ambulatory setting in only a few treatment fractions.
      Associations between irradiation and immunomodulatory agents appear to be synergistic and
      show favorable tolerance profiles. Immunomodulatory agents have a more favorable toxicity
      profile than cytotoxic agents with about 65% overall acute toxicities. Immunotherapy
      selectively binds to PD-L1 and competitively blocks its interaction with PD-1.

      Compared with anti-PD-1 antibodies that target T-cells, immunotherapy targets tumor cells,
      and is therefore may induce fewer side effects, including a lower risk of autoimmune-related
      safety issues, as blockade of PD-L1 leaves the PD-L2 - PD-1 pathway intact to promote
      peripheral self-tolerance.

      Stereotactic irradiation is associated with an excellent tolerance with rates of grade 3 or
      more toxicities below 5%.

      Preliminary data of toxicity with the association of stereotactic irradiation and
      immunotherapy show no cumulative toxicity in association with immunotherapy. However, their
      incidence and characteristics are no different from that observed with stereotactic
      irradiation alone. Moreover, intracranial metastases are exceptional in sarcomas.

      The toxicity of the association for extracranial stereotactic irradiation does not seem to be
      increased either.

      Open label, Phase II, prospective, multicentric, randomized study 2:1, 2 arm study designed
      to evaluate the efficacy of a Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy treatment associated with
      immunotherapy versus a Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy treatment only.

      Primary objective The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy, in term of
      progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months, of immunomodulated stereotactic irradiation
      in oligometastatic sarcoma patients.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  PFS by immune response criteria.

        -  ratio PFS after radiotherapy/PFS during the previous line of treatment

        -  Objective response rate.

        -  Rate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months by line of treatment and histology.

        -  Evaluation of the toxicity of the treatment.

        -  Overall survival.

        -  Evaluation of the quality of life of patient treated by the combination of radio- and
           immunotherapy or radiotherapy only.

        -  Evaluation of the cost of treatment.

        -  Rate of PET-CT at inclusion

        -  Correlative study: Impact of biomarkers on clinical endpoints.

        -  Developing a mathematical models for STS treatment by SBRT + immunotherapy predictive of
           oligo versus poly metastatic evolution

      The treatment to be used in this study is the Atezolizumab concomitant with High Dose
      Radiation (SBRT) or the SBRT Alone Atezolizumab Subjects randomized in the experimental arm
      will receive Atezolizumab 1200 mg in combination with SBRT, Q3W (6 cycles) for 4 months until
      progression/completion. The Atezolizumab will be provided by the Sponsor (Centre Antoine
      Lacassagne).

      Chemotherapy will be discontinued in case of progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of patient consent to receive study treatment.

      Radiation therapy SBRT can be performed with different equipments (CyberKnife, Truebeam,
      etc.). Adequate tumor tracking and patient setup/repositioning as well as online IGRT
      (image-guided radiation therapy) must be performed at each fraction. The maximal cumulative
      tumor diameter is 6 cm to maintain an advantageous risk-benefit ratio with SBRT. Two types of
      fractionation are proposed to account for tumor size and proximity of the tumor to sensitive
      organs at risk. Three fractions are proposed in favorable cases, 5 in more delicate cases.
      Fractions can be performed on consecutive days. Depending on cases, they may be delivered
      every other day; the whole SBRT duration should not exceed 3 weeks.
