    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies whether it is feasible to conduct a detailed molecular
      profile of triple negative breast cancer as part of a treatment strategy that asks whether or
      not we can lower the chance of breast cancer growing or spreading, by treating with a
      combination of PARP inhibitor how well (olaparib) and immune therapy (durvalumab). Olaparib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving olaparib and durvalumab may work better in treating participants with
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the feasibility of completing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)
      analytics on pre-treatment biopsy within a planned 4-week window for enrolled participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety and tolerability of the proposed therapy. II. Assess response to treatment.
      III. Determine the time to disease progression following study therapy. IV. Determine
      survival of participants enrolled on the study.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine response rates depending on tumor characteristics. II. Identify predictive
      biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy. III. Identify emerging mechanism of resistance to
      therapy tumor markers of emergence.

      IV. Determine changes in tumor cells induced by PARP inhibitors. V. Identify tumor markers
      suggestive of combinatorial therapy that could r overcome resistance to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive olaparib orally (PO) twice a day (BID) for 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants then receive olaparib PO BID on
      days 1-28 and durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Participants may continue on therapy beyond disease progression at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for 1 year.
