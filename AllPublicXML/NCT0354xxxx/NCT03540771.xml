  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative effectiveness study of two pragmatic models aiming to introduce
      palliative care for end stage liver disease patients. The 2 comparators are:

      Model 1: Consultative Palliative Care (i.e. direct access to Palliative Care provider), Model
      2: Trained Hepatologist- led PC intervention (i.e. a hepatologist will receive formal
      training to deliver Palliative Care services)

      Primary Outcome: The change in quality of life from baseline to 3 months post enrollment as
      assessed by FACT-Hep (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Hepatobiliary).

      14 Clinical Centers across US are recruited to participate in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two armed multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), to assess the
      effectiveness of two pragmatic PC models for patients with ESLD (Consultative PC vs. Trained
      hepatologist led PC). To prevent bias at the level of providers, randomization will take
      place at the level of clinical centers; however patients will be the unit of inference.
      Parallel to this cluster-RCT, a qualitative study will be undertaken to evaluate the
      patient/caregiver experiences in the two PC models, using semi structured interviews.

      To execute this project, we have identified 14 clinical centers to participate; 7 Veterans
      Health Administration (VHA) systems and 7 non-VHA, Academic Medical Centers.

      Comparative Approaches:

        1. Consultative PC led approach (Model 1): The PC model will include: 1) routine PC
           consults, using a standardized checklist , 2) in-person visits at initial, 1, 2 and 3
           months. .

        2. Trained hepatologist led PC (Model 2): The Hepatologist Led PC model will comprise: 1)
           Hepatologist training (through E Learning modules), and 2) in person visits utilizing
           the same PC checklist as utilized in Model 1. The in-person visits will occur at
           initial, 1, 2 and 3 months i.e. similar to Model 1 and follow the same visit specified
           agenda.

      Adult patients 18 years of age or older will be enrolled. With 14 clinical centers in
      different geographic locations and diversity in race/ ethnicity, 1260 patient/ caregiver
      dyads will be enrolled.

    <description>Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) will evaluate 11 symptoms (pain, fatigue, myalgia, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, sleep disturbance, appetite, well-being, dyspnea, pruritus and ability to think clearly) on a 10-point scale, where 0 is no symptom and 10 is the maximum severity of symptom.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in PHQ-9 scores from baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 (Personal Health Questionnaire) is one of the very commonly used tools to assess severity of depression in different settings, and has 9 questions. Each question is rated on a 4 point scale, with total score ranging from 0 to 27. Higher scores reflects greater severity of depression. Scores from 0-4 equates to no depression, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 mod severe and &gt;20 reflects severe depression.</description>

    <description>Zarit Burden Interview-12 (ZBI-12) a short, validated instrument is extensively used for palliative care research in diverse populations. It has high internal consistency, reliability and convergent validity to assess caregiver burden. It has high correlation [Rho (95% CI) 0.95 (0.92- 0.96)] with the long form, and is less burdensome. The sensitivity and specificity is 92% and 94% with a cutoff score of 12.</description>

    <description>FAMCARE-P13 (Family Satisfaction with Cancer Care- Patient scale) is a brief validated instrument used to assess patient satisfaction with outpatient palliative care interventions. It measures the availability of care, symptom management, psychosocial care and information sharing including support for decision making. It consists of 13 questions, with Likert scale response options with high reliability. Higher scores imply better satisfaction from the care received.</description>
