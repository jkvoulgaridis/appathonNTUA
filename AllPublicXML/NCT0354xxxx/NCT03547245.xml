             potential impact and/or risks linked to vaccination and participation in the trial;
             written informed consent will be obtained from the volunteer before any study-related

          5. Willing to undergo HIV testing, risk reduction counseling and receive HIV test result;

          6. All heterosexually active female volunteers must commit to use an effective method of

          7. All female volunteers must be willing to undergo urine pregnancy tests at time points
             indicated in the Schedule of Procedures and must test negative prior to each study
             vaccination;

          8. All sexually active males (unless anatomically sterile or in a monogamous relationship
             with a female partner who uses a documented non-barrier method of birth control) must
             be willing to use an effective method of contraception (such as consistent condom use)
             from the day of first vaccination until at least 4 months after the last vaccination ;

          9. Willing to forgo donations of blood, or any other tissues during the study and, for
             those who test HIV-positive due to vaccine-induced antibodies, until the anti-HIV
             antibody titers become undetectable;

         10. Women, who are not heterosexually active at screening, must agree to utilize an
             effective method of contraception if they become hetero-sexually active, as outlined
             above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection; any clinically relevant abnormality on history or
             examination including history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease; use of
             systemic corticosteroids (the use of topical, nasal or inhaled steroids is permitted),
             immunosuppressive, anticancer, anti-tuberculosis or other medications considered
             significant by the investigator within the previous 6 months;

          2. The following exceptions are permitted and will not exclude study participation: use
             of corticosteroid nasal spray for rhinitis, topical corticosteroids for an acute
             uncomplicated dermatitis; or a short course (duration of 10 days or less, or a single
             injection) of corticosteroid for a non-chronic condition (based on investigator
             clinical judgment) at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment in this study;

          3. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition that is considered
             progressive or in the opinion of the investigator makes the volunteer unsuitable for
             participation in the study;

          4. Reported risky behavior for HIV infection within 12 months prior to vaccination

          5. If female, pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the period of enrollment until 4
             months after the last study vaccination; or lactating;

          6. Bleeding disorder that was diagnosed by a physician (e.g., clotting factor deficiency,
             coagulopathy or platelet disorder that requires special precautions) (Note: A
             volunteer who states that he or she has easy bruising or bleeding, but does not have a
             formal diagnosis and has had IM vaccine administrations and blood draws without any
             adverse experience, is eligible);

          7. Infectious disease: chronic hepatitis B infection (HbsAg-positive), current hepatitis
             C infection (HCV Ab positive and HCV RNA positive) treatment for chronic hepatitis C
             infection in the past year, or active syphilis (positive RPR confirmed by TPHA);

          8. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within the previous 30 days or planned receipt
             within 30 days after vaccination with Investigational Product; or receipt of other
             vaccine within the previous 14 days or planned receipt within 14 days after
             vaccination with Investigational Product. (Exception is live attenuated influenza
             vaccine within 14 days);

          9. History of splenectomy;

         10. Receipt of blood transfusion or blood-derived products within the previous 3 months;

             within the previous 3 months or expected participation during this study (Concurrent
             participation in an observational trial not requiring any blood or tissue sample
             collection is not an exclusion);

         13. Prior receipt of another investigational HIV vaccine candidate (Note: receipt of
             placebo in a previous HIV vaccine trial will not exclude a volunteer from
             participation if documentation is available and the Medical Monitor gives approval);

         14. History of severe local or systemic reactogenicity to vaccines (e.g., anaphylaxis,
             respiratory difficulties, angioedema, injection site necrosis or ulceration);

         15. Psychiatric condition that compromises safety of the volunteer and precludes
             compliance with the protocol. Specifically excluded are persons with psychoses within
             the past 3 years (prior to screening), ongoing risk for suicide, or history of suicide
             attempt or gesture within the past 3 years;

         16. Seizure disorder: A volunteer who has had a seizure in the last 3 years (prior to
             screening) is excluded. (Not excluded: a volunteer with a history of seizures who has
             neither required medications nor had a seizure for 3 years);

         17. A history of malignancy in the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy
             (A history of a completely excised malignancy that is considered cured is not an
             exclusion);

         18. Active, serious infections requiring parenteral antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal
             therapy within 30 days prior to enrollment;

         19. Body mass index ≥35 ;

         20. Body weight &lt;110 pounds (55 kg);

         21. If, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, it is not in the best interest of
             the volunteer to participate in the trial.
