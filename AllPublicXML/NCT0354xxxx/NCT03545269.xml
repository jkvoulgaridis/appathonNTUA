  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of implanting bead-type
      autologous chondrocyte (CartiLife®) obtained by culturing expanded costal chondrocytes of the
      patient with a chondral defect in the knee. The patients will be assessed clinically using
      MRI, clinical, biochemical and International Knee Documentation Committee(IKDC) outcomes
      preoperatively as well as 8, 24 and 48 weeks postoperatively to assess the relief of symptoms
      and joint function.

    <intervention_model_description>Biological: CartiLife® Procedure: CartiLife® is beads (1.0 to 1.5 mm in diameter) in suspension, developed from autologous chondrocytes. The beads are implanted in a volume of 1 cm3 per the capacity of the syringe to the affected area through injection along with a fibrin adhesive through minimal arthrotomy.
Active comparator: Microfracture The surgery is performed by arthroscopy, after the joint is cleaned of calcified cartilage. Through use of an awl, the surgeon creates tiny fractures in the subchondral bone plate.</intervention_model_description>
