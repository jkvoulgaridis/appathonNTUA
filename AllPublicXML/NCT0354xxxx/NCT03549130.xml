  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study assessed subjective
      measures of nasal airway breathing immediately after application in the morning upon
      awakening after use of breathe right nasal strips (BRNS). Participants who met the entrance
      criteria, were currently suffering from nasal congestion, reported trouble with their sleep
      and had baseline nasal openness scores at bedtime during the qualification phase of ≤ 70 on a
      100-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on at least four of seven qualification nights were
      randomized to one of two treatments for use at home. Participants returned to the study site
      after 7 and 14 days of nightly nasal strip use, respectively. At the two return visits, a
      validated subjective questionnaire, the Nocturnal Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (NRQLQ), measured response.

      The study had a screening phase, a one-week baseline qualification and a two-week treatment
      phase. Participants who met the entrance criteria, who were currently suffering from nasal
      congestion every night or almost every night, reported trouble with their sleep and had
      baseline nasal openness scores at bedtime during the qualification phase of ≤ 70 on a
      100-point VAS on at least four of seven qualification nights were randomized to one of two
      treatments for use at home. During the two-week in-home treatment phase, daily diaries
      measuring the perception of nasal breathing and nasal congestion using a VAS were completed.
      Participants returned to the study site after 7 and 14 days of nightly nasal strip use,
      respectively. At the two return visits, a validated subjective questionnaire, the NRQLQ,
      measured response.

             places the Participant at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study
             or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study or who in the judgement of
             the principal investigator would not be suitable for entry into this study.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Average Score of Nocturnal Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (NRQLQ) for Each Domain Problems (Sleep, Sleep Time, Symptoms on Waking in the Morning, and Practical Problems) at Day 7</title>
        <description>Participants scored all the domains of NRQLQ using same 7 points scales where 0=Not troubled and 6=extremely troubled. Domains: Sleep problems (difficulty getting sleep, unable to get a good night sleep or wake up during the night, restless [tossing and turning] and having to get up because stuffy nose or to blow nose using the score, scores range: Min-Max [0-24]); Sleep time problems (Nasal congestion or stuffy nose, sinus pressure or pain, runny nose, post-nasal drip [drainage down back of nose/throat], and headache, scores range: 0- 30); Symptoms on waking in the morning (Feel tired and unrefreshed, nasal congestion or stuffy nose, congestion in sinuses, takes time to clear nighttime drainage after waking up, scores range:0-24); practical problems (have to avoid symptom triggers (such as dust, cigarette smoke, strong smells and perfumes), need to rub nose or eyes, and have to take medication, scores range: 0-18). Lower scores indicate improvement in the rhinitis symptoms.</description>

        <description>Participants scored all the domains of NRQLQ using same 7 points scales where 0=Not troubled and 6=extremely troubled. Domains: Sleep problems (difficulty getting sleep, unable to get a good night sleep or wake up during the night, restless [tossing and turning] and having to get up because stuffy nose or to blow nose using the score, scores range: Min-Max [0-24]); Sleep time problems (Nasal congestion or stuffy nose, sinus pressure or pain, runny nose, post-nasal drip [drainage down back of nose/throat], and headache, scores range: 0- 30); Symptoms on waking in the morning (Feel tired and unrefreshed, nasal congestion or stuffy nose, congestion in sinuses, takes time to clear nighttime drainage after waking up, scores range:0-24); practical problems (have to avoid symptom triggers (such as dust, cigarette smoke, strong smells and perfumes), need to rub nose or eyes, and have to take medication, scores range: 0-18). Lower scores indicate improvement in the rhinitis symptoms.</description>
