    <textblock>
      The study was a 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Berberine (300
      mg，three times a day), as an adjuvant therapy has been used on the basis of the
      Second-generation antipsychotics（SGAs） monotherapy. All participants were randomly divided
      into two groups.Any SGA + berberine (BBR) or any SGA +placebo.Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale (PANSS) has been used for psychiatric symptoms.The treatment Emergent Symptom
      Scale(TESS) has been used for evaluate adverse effects.Glucose and lipid profile,
      inflammatory factors，adiponectin，leptin were obtained at 0, 4,8 weeks.

    <description>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale（PANSS）has been used to assess symptom severity in schizophrenia.Of the items included in PANSS ,seven constitute a Positive scale,seven form a Negative scale and sixteen constitute a General Psychopathology scale.7-point rating instrument was conceived.A total Score is computed three subscales.Minimum scores is 30 and maximum scores is 210.The higher score are considered the psychiatric symptoms more serious.</description>
