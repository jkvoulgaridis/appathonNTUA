      Patients who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia and who were between the
      ages of 18 and 75 and who had ASA score I-II-III would be included in the study. Patients'
      mallampati scores, thyromental distances, mouth openings will be recorded.

      Patients will be divided into two groups according to supraglottic airway insertion method.

      Both groups will record the insertion time of i-gel, number of trials, operative time,
      placement complications.

      Recorded complications (blood, laryngospasm, etc.) during insertion and removal of
      supraglottic airway devices will be assessed.

      Patients' postoperative sore throat will be questioned and recorded.
