      This study determines the effect of olive oil and bran oil on antioxidant levels, and
      glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)

      Intervention: Patient type 2 DM will receive olive oil and bran oil with cross over study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become one of the global public health problems. The chronic
      complications of type 2 DM can be macrovascular and microvascular complications that can
      decrease the quality of life of the patient. The main goal of sustainable DM nutrition
      therapy is to keep glucose in the blood close to normal levels to stop hyperglycemic and
      hyperlipidemic events that may inhibit further complications

      This study was a clinical trial with cross over study design, random allocation, and double
      blindness to compare changes in antioxidant, glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels
      supplemented with 15 ml / day of olive oil (KZ) with supplementation of 15 ml / day of bran
      oil (KB). Provision of oil for 4 weeks in a row. During the 2-week interval not being treated
      (wash out). After the wash out period cross-over by exchanging olive oil supplementation to
      rice bran and vice versa for 4 consecutive weeks. The research will be conducted at Family
      Clinic Clinic FKUI Kayu Putih, Jakarta.
