    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study on the effect of Gingest (ginger
      root extract) on symptoms of dyspepsia in 150 participants with mild to moderate dyspepsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a chronic disorder of sensation and movement (peristalsis) in
      the upper digestive tract. A diagnosis of functional dyspepsia is determined when there is no
      evidence of structural disease and there have been at least three months of one or more of
      the following (with onset at least six months earlier). Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is
      traditionally used to treat a number of medical conditions, including those affecting the
      digestive tract, such as dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea and abdominal pain. Recent human
      clinical studies have found beneficial effects of ginger extract in patients with dyspepsia
      and gastric emptying in healthy populations.

      The aim of the present study is therefore to investigate if two different doses of Gingest
      (100mg and 200 mg) reduces intensity of functional dyspepsia (based on a symptom severity
      questionnaire) compared to placebo (maltodextrin) in 150 subjects with mild to moderate
      dyspepsia (as determined through the Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire).
