  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distraction osteogenesis is a powerful technique for creating new bone during significant
      lengthening of the mandible without the need for bone grafting and associated donor site
      morbidity.

      The idea of distraction osteogenesis was largely abandoned by many until the 1950s. Ilizarov
      minimized complications by performing a corticotomy with minimal disruption of the
      surrounding blood supply and using a system of tension ring fixators to control the
      distraction in multiple planes. Through a series of experimental studies and clinical
      applications, Ilizarov established the foundation of distraction osteogenesis and its role in
      orthopedic management.

      Applications in craniofacial surgery were first seen in 1973, when Synder et al applied the
      approach to mandibular lengthening in a canine animal model. Almost another 20 years passed
      before McCarthy and colleagues published, in 1992, the first report of mandibular lengthening
      in 4 children with congenital mandibular deficiency, 3 with hemifacial microsomia, and 1 with
      Nager syndrome. Thereafter, its role rapidly expanded to the midface and nearly all classic
      approaches to craniofacial reconstruction.

      In general, mandibular distraction can be performed in the ramus for ramus lengthening, in
      the mandibular angle for downward and forward advancement, or in the mandibular body. Ramus
      or gonial angle distraction are mainly used to treat facial asymmetries as in hemifacial
      macrosomia.

      Severe mandibular retrognathia can be classified as congenital or acquired. Congenital
      abnormalities that are associated with severe mandibular retrognathia or micrognathia include
      craniofacial syndromes such as hemifacial microsomia, Pierre-Robin syndrome, Treacher-Collins
      syndrome, and Nager syndrome. Adult patients with craniofacial syndromes may have undergone
      previous surgery at an earlier age, but unfavorable postsurgical growth or skeletal relapse
      may have occurred.

      Severe mandibular retrognathia also can develop following maxillofacial trauma and mandibular
      fractures, which may have occurred in an adult or as a child Condylar fractures occurring at
      an early age can result in subsequent bony and/or fibrous temporomandibular joint ankylosis
      and/or deficient mandibular growth, also adult patients with complications from previous
      mandibular tumor resection and reconstruction can also present with acquired severe
      mandibular retrognathia that may require distraction osteogenesis as well.

      Despite the advantages of extra-oral distraction devices in the hands of clinicians
      (application for very small children, simplicity of attachment, ease of manipulation,
      bidirectional and multidirectional dis- traction), patients are apprehensive about wearing
      bulky external appliances because of the social inconvenience and the potential of permanent
      facial scars, these disadvantages and limitations were the primary force driving the
      evolution of mandibular lengthening and widening toward the development of intra-oral
      devices.

      However nowadays both internal and external distractors are used in a variety of indications
      in these cases each of the two types of distractor devices has its own advantages and
      disadvantages.

      Aim of the work:

      The aim of this study is to compare external and internal distraction devices for mandibular
      lengthening in terms of bone lengthening, patient comfort, and complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on 30 patients who are suffering mandibular problems either
      congenital acquired or post tumor mandibular resection that requires lengthening of the
      mandible, attending the outpatient clinic of Plastic Surgery Department in Ain Shams
      University Hospital &amp; Assiut University Hospital.

      Preoperative assessment:

        -  Informed consent will be obtained from all patients before their inclusion in the study.

        -  Photographs will be taken for the patient in lateral, antro-posterior and oblique
           positions preoperative.

        -  Lateral cephalometric radiographs or computed tomography (CT) or cone beam CT scans will
           be done for each patient pre-operatively.

        -  The decision to perform internal or external device will be based on preoperative and
           intraoperative considerations, such as anatomical bony characteristics affecting the
           possibility to place internal devices and patient cooperation.

      Principles of the operation:

        -  anaesthesia: general anesthesia.

        -  Intraoperative consideration of internal versus external distractor is decided depending
           on the availability of bone stock.

        -  Osteotomy will be done according to each case individually making sure that it suits the
           vector of distraction required for each case.

        -  The approach for the external devices will be intraoral between the mental nerve
           anteriorly and gonial area posteriorly on both sides of the mandible.

        -  The approach for internal devices will be intraoral. While preserving the mandibular
           branch of the facial nerve.

        -  After 3-5 days of latency period for callus organization, gradual lengthening of the
           mandible will be performed at a rate of 0.5 mm twice a day for a total of 1 mm per day
           until achieving desired length.

      Postoperative management and assessment:

        -  The patient will take broad spectrum and anaerobic antibiotics, anti-edematous,
           analgesic in addition to supportive treatment.

        -  After 3-5 days of latency period for callus organization according to patient age and
           condition, gradual lengthening of the mandible was performed at a rate of 0.5 mm twice a
           day for a total of 1 mm per day until achieving desired length.

        -  Following distraction phase there will be consolidation phase that will not be less than
           8 weeks.

        -  Removing of internal or external distractor device and start retention phase if required
           with assistance of orthodontic appliances to avoid relapse.

        -  The patients will be evaluated with lateral cephalograms and head CT to assess the
           changes and amount of new bone formation following distraction.
