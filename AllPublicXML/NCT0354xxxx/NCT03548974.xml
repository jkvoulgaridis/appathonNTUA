  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an RCT, the effect of the MOTOmed movement trainer (Reck, Germany) on spasticity and
      physical function in pwMS with EDSS score between 4,5 and 7 is investigated. All subjects
      exercise at home and are supervised and supported by an exercise therapist via an online
      platform.

      We compare the effect of a 12 week passive, motor-driven movement therapy (VG1) to an
      intermittent active and passive training (VG2). After 12 weeks, VG1 continues with an active
      training including strengthening exercises for another 12 weeks. VG2 does not receive any
      intervention in the second study phase.

    <time_frame>Assessments took place at baseline, at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire contains 88 items, which represent the impairment by the spasticity in various subscales. The total score ranges from 88 to a maximum of 352 points (maximum impairment).</description>

    <measure>Change in sSpasticity: Modified Tardieu scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments took place at baseline, at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is measuring spasticity as response to passive movement at both slow and fast speed; scored 0 - 4. (0=no resistance; 4= inexhaustible clonus)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in function: 5-Chair-Rise</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments took place at baseline, at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The main task in this test is to get up and sit down 5 times as fast as possible without use of the arms. The goal is the global assessment of the strength of the lower limb.</description>

    <measure>Change in function: 25foot-walk-test</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments took place at baseline, at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The task is to walk a 25foot distance as fast as possible. This test measures the functionality of the lower extremity and the walking speed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in function: 2min-walk</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments took place at baseline, at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subject is asked to walk with the fastest, possible speed to cover the greatest possible distance in 2min.</description>

    <description>The ms-intakt/MOTOmed-intervention is a home-based program using the MOTOmed movement trainer: 12 week passive, motor-driven movement therapy followed by 12 weeks of intermittent active and passive training after the 3month assessment. Training intensity was regulated by the participant's subjective, perceived exertion, which was rated between 6 and 20 on the BORG Scale. Therapists aimed at eliciting a BORG Feedback of between 10 (fairly light) and 15 (hard). The exercise training was home-based and supervised via the internet.</description>
