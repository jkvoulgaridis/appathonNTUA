  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compression stockings have beneficial effects on the development of venous thromboembolic
      complications and oedema during long- haul flights. A randomized controlled trial
      investigating the effect of compression stockings during short-haul flights with a duration
      less than fur ours is lacking. Deep vein thrombosis is very rare on flights shorter than four
      hours, but compression stocking could have beneficial effects on other outcomes. The aim of
      this study is to assess if compression stockings used during a 3-3.5-hour flight will
      decrease leg edema and discomfort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be adults who will undergo a 3-3.5 hours flight. Participants have
      received oral and written information about the trial. All compression stockings have a class
      two compression level (corresponding to 23-32 mmHg compression). Participants will be
      randomized to wear a compression stocking on one leg, while the other side acts as control.
      Within an hour preflight, the patient will measure ankle and calf circumference at marked
      circumferential areas on the leg and answer questionnaires regarding leg pain and subjective
      discomfort, whereafter the stocking will be put on, on the randomized side. Within one hour
      after the flight the stocking will be removed and patients will once again measure the ankle
      and calf circumference at the marked circumference and fill out the questionnaire.

      Sample size: Mean difference in ankle circumference set to -0.19 cm. Standard deviation of
      the mean difference set to 0.3, 5% alfa and 80% power. Sample size with a paired design = at
      least 18 participants. However, for practical reasons we will include up to approximately 50
      adults in the trial.

      Withdrawal and dropout criteria: All participants can withdraw their consent at any point
      during the trial, without the need for explaining any reasons for withdrawal. Since
      compression stockings do not cause side effects, except for patients with severe arterial
      insufficiency in the legs, we do not expect the trial to be stopped due to complications. All
      withdrawals will be accounted for in the scientific publication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult participants ≥ 18 years of both sexes. Otherwise no restriction, since each
             participant acts as their own control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition requiring compression stockings during short-haul flights. Severe
             arterial insufficiency in the lower extremities.
