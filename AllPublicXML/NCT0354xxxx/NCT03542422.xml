      An Exploratory study of Amapinib for patients with advanced esophagus cancer .

      Eligible are patients with advanced esophagus cancer. Apatinib (500mg) is given daily as
      follows:

      Metastasis after primary treatment : Apatinib + yew + platinum. Local recurrence after
      previous surgery/radiotherapy: Apatinib alone or in combination with platinum-based
      chemotherapy One therapy cycle has 28 days. Tumor response is evaluated every 2 cycles.
