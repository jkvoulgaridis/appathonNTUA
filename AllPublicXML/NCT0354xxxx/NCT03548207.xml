      The purpose of the study is to characterize safety of JNJ-68284528 and establish the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) (Phase 1b) and to evaluate the efficacy of JNJ-68284528
      (Phase 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of JNJ-68284528. The study will include two
      phases. In Phase1b the study will enroll adults with multiple myeloma with interval
      assessments for potential dose escalation or de-escalation in subsequent participants. The
      dose selected at the completion of phase 1b will be used in Phase 2. Following consent,
      enrolled participants will undergo an apheresis procedure to collect cells for manufacture of
      investigational drug product (JNJ-68284528). Following manufacture of the drug product,
      participants will undergo lymphodepletion prior to infusion of JNJ-68284528. Participants
      will be followed for at least 2 years after study drug infusion, with long-term 15 year
      follow-up on a separate study. The study will evaluate safety, biomarkers,
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluations and efficacy.
