  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV is a major health problem worldwide especially in low-to middle-income countries
      including Thailand. Fortunately, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has been
      observed due to the use of combination antiretroviral therapy. As the natural history of the
      disease is modified, non-communicable diseases are becoming recognized complications of HIV
      infection, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of
      type 2 diabetes in HIV-infected patients is significantly higher than in the general
      population, likely contributed by antiretroviral regimen and an ongoing, usually subclinical,
      inflammation. People with prediabetes, a condition which blood sugars are elevated but not
      yet meeting the criteria for diabetes, represent a high risk group for future diabetes
      development. Lifestyle interventions, including diet and exercise, are effective in reducing
      the future diabetes risk by as much as 58%, including in Thailand. The knowledge whether
      these interventions are effective in HIV-infected patients, given their unique
      characteristics, is not available at this time but urgently needed. Moreover, the program
      tailored to each country's local values, culture and socioeconomic status is essential as
      participants' acceptability is one of the keys to program's success. This current proposal
      will adapt a 6-month intensive lifestyle intervention program and evaluate its feasibility
      and acceptability in HIV-infected individuals with prediabetes in Thailand. The knowledge
      gained will be highly relevant for Thailand and for other low-to-middle-income countries.
      Furthermore, gut microbiota and insufficient sleep are novel factors shown to affect
      individual's metabolic health. Insufficient sleep is recognized as a risk factor for incident
      diabetes. Gut microbiota composition differs between those with and without diabetes. The
      current proposal will examine how gut microbiota and sleep duration differ between
      HIV-infected individuals with and without prediabetes, and now there change or modulate the
      metabolic response to the 6-month intensive lifestyle interventions. Lastly, HIV and diabetes
      are global epidemics, research capacity building among countries is essential to battle these
      health problems. This proposal will aim to build research capacities among three
      international institutions: University of Illinois at Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.; Faculty of
      Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand, one of the top medical schools
      in Thailand; and a newly formed medical school, Navamindradhiraj University, Vajira Hospital,
      Bangkok, Thailand. Through close collaboration, networking, in-person training and workshops,
      the proposed study will enhance research capacity and improve lives of those living with HIV.
