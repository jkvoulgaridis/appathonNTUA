Radiotherapy will consist of 50 Gy in 2 Gy per fraction to the breast or chest wall with or without regional nodes plus a 10 Gy boost to the lumpectomy cavity, to a total dose of 60 Gy. A 10 Gy boost to the post-mastectomy scar is allowed at the discretion of the treating physician.</description>

             &lt;1%, her-2-neu 0-1+ by IHC or FISH-negative or as per MD discretion).

          -  Definitive surgical treatment with breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy and
             axillary lymph node evaluation.

          -  Residual disease in the breast or lymph nodes at the time of definitive surgical
             treatment.

          -  Willingness to discontinue any cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy and
             biologic therapy at least 2 weeks prior to the start of RT.

          -  Adequate organ function (assessed within 30 days prior to initiation of protocol
             treatment, unless otherwise indicated) as follows: Hematology

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1500/mm^3

               -  Platelet Count ≥100,000/mm^3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL (after transfusion if required) Renal Function

               -  Creatinine Serum ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or Creatinine Clearance ≥ 45 mL/min^a Hepatic
                  Function

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

               -  Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN^b

               -  Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ULN = upper normal limit of
                  institution's normal range

                    1. If calculated creatinine clearance is &lt; 45mL/min, a 24-hour urine collection
                       for creatinine clearance may be performed

                    2. Subjects with documented Gilbert's disease may have bilirubin up to 2.5
                       mg/dL

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to study treatment if a woman has
             child-bearing potential. Subjects of child bearing potential are those who have not
             been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medications.

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant while participating on
             study, she should inform the treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Gross residual tumor or positive margins after surgery that is un-excised, as
             radiation dose in the study will be limited to 60 Gy.

          -  Complete pathologic response to NAC.

          -  Receipt of PARP inhibitor prior to RT.

          -  Pregnant or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of the trial, starting
             with screening visit through 180 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Prior history of radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast and/or regional nodes is
             not allowed (prior RT to other sites is permitted).

          -  Patients with breast augmentation implants are excluded.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to rucaparib.

          -  Concomitant anti-neoplastic treatment is not allowed during protocol treatment and
             should be completed at least 2 weeks prior to commencement of protocol treatment, with
             resolution of associated acute toxicities. Bisphosphonates are permitted without
             restriction even during protocol treatment.

          -  Significant comorbidity: Patients with clinically significant and uncontrolled major
             disease or disorder that could exacerbate potential toxicities, confound safety
             assessments, require excluded therapy for management, or limit study compliance.

          -  Ongoing therapy with other investigational agents. Patients may not be receiving any
             other investigational agents.

          -  Unresolved toxicity from other agents. Patients with unresolved CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 or
             greater toxicity from prior administration of another investigational drug and/or
             anti-cancer treatment are not eligible.
