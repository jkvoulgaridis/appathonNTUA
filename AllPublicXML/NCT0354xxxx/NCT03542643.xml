    <textblock>
      N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(N-3 PUFAs) is important in balancing the immune function and
      crucial for the developing brain. Deficiency in n-3 PUFAs might be linked to the poor
      cognitive performances resulting in inattention and hyperactivity in youth with attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). N-3 PUFAs appears to be a promising treatment that is
      safe, beneficial to youth with ADHD. In this proposal, investigators aim the test the
      hypothesis that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids will be more effective than placebo in
      improving cognitive function in youth with ADHD after 12 weeks of intervention.

    <textblock>
      This is a 1-year study and a randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled Clinical the
      study. investigators plan to enrol 100 subjects from Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
      Outpatient Clinic of China Medical University Hospital.Participants will be randomized into
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or placebo group.The intervention period is 12 weeks.
      Evaluation of the cognitive function ( using Continuous Performance Test 3rd Edition ) of the
      subjects who are enrolled into the study will take place at baseline and after the 12th week.
      The symptom severity of ADHD will be measured with Swanson, Nolan, Pelham Questionnaire
      (SNAP-IV) at baseline, 2,4,8, and 12 weeks. The plasma level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids, blood and salivary inflammatory markers will also be measured at the beginning and at
      the end of the study.

    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Correct Detection: This indicates the number of times the client responded to the target stimulus. Higher rates of correct detections indicate better attentional capacity.
Reaction times: This measures the amount of time between the presentation of the stimulus and the client's response.
Omission errors: This indicates the number of times the target was presented, but the client did not respond/click the mouse. High omission rates indicate that the subject is either not paying attention (distractibility) to stimuli or has a sluggish response.
Commission errors: This score indicates the number of times the client responded but no target was presented. A fast reaction time and high commission error rate points to difficulties with impulsivity. A slow reaction time with high commission and omission errors, indicates inattention in general.</description>
