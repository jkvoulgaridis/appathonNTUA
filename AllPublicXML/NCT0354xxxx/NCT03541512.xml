  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to learn more about the use of an online remote education and
      mindfulness practice program for the pain and anxiety associated with provoked localized
      vulvodynia.

      The purpose of study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a remotely delivered mindfulness
      intervention combined with education for the treatment of the pain and distress associated
      with Provoked Localized Vulvodynia (PLV). Women with PLV will be randomized to either an app-
      based mindfulness program (Headspace®) with online education or online education only. Pain
      and sexual distress with be evaluated through a number of measures. The primary outcome of
      the study will be the change in distress relating to sexual activity over the 8-week
      intervention period, which will be measured by a change (reduction) in the Female Sexual
      Distress Scale (FSDS). Participants will additionally perform a weekly Tampon Test and fill
      out a weekly survey regarding their perceived pain as well as the frequency of use and
      completion of the weekly education materials

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in distress relating to sexual activity, measured by a change in the FSDS from baseline (study enrollment) survey. Participants will complete a Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) survey to rate their feelings associated with sexual activities. Survey questions are on a number scale of 0 (Never) to 4 (Always). The FSDS surveys will be completed at baseline and 8 weeks after study enrollment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tampon Test Pain Scores at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in tampon test pain scores (a validated tool that measures introital pain). The tampon test is a validated tool used to measure (vulva) vestibular skin pain by having participants insert and remove a tampon. Participants will be asked to rate their pain along a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale on a scale of 0 (No pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). This test will occur at baseline and 8 weeks after enrollment.</description>
