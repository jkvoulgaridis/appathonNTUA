  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of treatment with radiation therapy is to deliver as high of a dose as possible to
      the target (tumor), while minimizing the dose to the normal tissues where late-side effects
      can drastically affect patient quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation will be delivered twice per week for 5 fractions (42.5 Gy cohort, low-risk) or
      daily for 16 fractions (58.08 Gy cohort, moderate-risk).

      Low-risk is defined by:

        -  Planning target volume (PTV) less than 10 cc, AND

        -  No reported smoking within 1 month from registration

      Moderate-risk is defined by:

        -  Planning target volume (PTV) greater than or equal to 10 cc, OR

        -  Smoking within 1 month from registration (no more than 1 pack per day)

             carcinoma or squamous cell variants (sarcomatoid, verrucous, basaloid, and papillary
             subtypes) involving the glottic larynx.

          2. Clinical stage I-II (American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC, 7th edition) with direct
             laryngoscopy showing no evidence of greater than stage II true glottic larynx cancer
             and PET/CT or CT neck showing no evidence of regional disease.

          3. Age â‰¥ 18 years.

          4. ECOG Performance Status 0-2

             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

             5.1 A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual
             orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who
             meets the following criteria:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          6. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks before registration for women of
             childbearing potential.

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. AJCC stage III or stage IV larynx cancer

          3. Previous treatment (e.g. cold knife excision, laser treatment) of the proposed
             radiation treatment volume, where the intent of treatment was specifically for
             therapeutic purpose, rather than for biopsy/ tissue diagnosis.

          4. Prior chemotherapy for treatment of the targeted larynx lesion

          5. Synchronous primaries in the head and neck

          6. Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of
             radiation fields.

          7. Subjects smoking in excess of 1 pack of cigarettes per day.

          8. Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

         10. Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.
