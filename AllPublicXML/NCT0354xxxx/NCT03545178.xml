      This study retrospectively evaluates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and flash glucose
      monitoring (FGM) data and pursues two main objectives: First, the investigators analyze if
      glucose values are better controlled in the days directly before a consultation at our
      tertiary referral centre (so called &quot;white coat adherence&quot;). Second, the investigators use
      the collected CGM and FGM data to develop a hypoglycemia prediction model.

      Substudy A.) Presence of white coat adherence in diabetic patients:

      The investigators aim at evaluating the existence of a so called &quot;white coat adherence&quot; with
      regard to diabetes control, which means that blood-glucose is better controlled in the days
      immediately prior to a consultation at the diabetes clinic compared to the time-period
      further back. To analyse this phenomenon, the investigators use continuous glucose monitoring
      (CGM) and flash glucose monitoring (FGM) of diabetic patients and compare CGM-/FGM data of
      the last three days prior to the consultation with the CGM-/FGM data of the days 4-28 prior
      to the consultation, as well as the last seven days prior to the consultation with days 8-28
      prior to the consultation.

      Substudy B.) Retrospective data collection for the development and evaluation of a
      hypoglycemia prediction model:

      Scope of the study is to use retrospective data for training and evaluation of a deep
      recurrent neural network based system for predicting the onset of hypoglycemic event at least
      20 min ahead in time. The study aims to: I, assess the ability of deep learning algorithm to
      predict hypoglycemic events using the data collected during substudy 1. II, assess the
      ability of global model to be personalized using the data collected during sub-study 1. III,
      investigate the amount of &quot;history&quot; to be involved to achieve maximum performance in terms of
      prediction ability. IV, develop a global model, which can be easily further personalized to
      achieve optimum prediction performance per patient.
