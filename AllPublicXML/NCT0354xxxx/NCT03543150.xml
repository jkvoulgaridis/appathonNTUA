      This study is a drug use investigation program of BOTOX. The objective of this investigation
      is to collect and assess information on the safety and efficacy of BOTOX injections in
      subjects with a diagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia in daily clinical practice. All subjects
      treated with BOTOX for spasmodic dysphonia after obtaining approval for the indication of
      BOTOX for spasmodic dysphonia will be included in this study. Approximately 400 subjects will
      be included in the study. The observation period per subject will be up to 12 months from the
      date of the first administration of BOTOX. The total study duration will be will be

    <measure>Change from Baseline in voice handicap index (VHI)-10 scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The VHI is a 30-item questionnaire divided into 3 subsections including functional, physical, and emotional which measures the effect of voice problems on quality of life. Subjects will mark each item on this 30-item questionnaire on a scale ranging from 0-4 (0 being never and 4 being always). Points for each subscale are tallied and a total composite score is also given. A total score of 0-11 is considered normal, 12-28 is considered mild minimal handicap, 29-56 is considered moderate handicap, and 57-120 is considered severe handicap.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy rate based on global assessment of efficacy</measure>

    <description>The efficacy rate is the number of subjects assessed as &quot;effective&quot; based on the course of subjective symptoms and clinical symptoms during the observation period from the date of the first administration of BOTOX injections.</description>
