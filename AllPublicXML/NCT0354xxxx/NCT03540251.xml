      Patients and Methods A randomized controlled trial is conducted by comparing effectiveness of
      sticking and massaging auricular points relieving hot flashes in women with breast cancer
      versus placebo auricular points. A total of 92 women(still recuiting) with breast cancer, who
      were under hormonal therapy were randomly assigned and the allocation ratio was 1:1. Both
      groups received a booklet with information about self-care indications, auricular points and
      its management, and patients can record their hot flash score each day for 12 weeks in the
      booklets.In addition, both group received 8 treatment sessions of sticking and pressing
      predefined auricular points or placebo auricular points treatments.

      The primary outcome was hot flash score(HFS)at the end of treatment (week 12), calculated as
      the frequency multiplied by the average severity of hot flashes.The secondary outcomes were
      climacteric symptoms and quality of life, measured by the Greene Climacteric Scale(GCS)and
      Menopause Quality of Life scales(MenQoL)as well as serum estradiol(E2), follicle-stimulating
      hormone(FSH) and beta-endorphin(β-EP).Expectation and satisfaction of treatment effect and
      safety were also evaluated.
