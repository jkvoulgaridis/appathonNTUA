  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study
      designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with SEP-4199
      monotherapy given as 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day compared with placebo for the treatment of
      major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression).

    <measure>Change from baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated assessment of the subject's level of depression. The measure contains 10 items that measure apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep and appetite, difficulty concentrating, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. Each item is scored in a range of 0 to 6 points, with higher scores indicating increased depressive symptoms. The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) will be used for the administration of the MADRS assessment.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in global severity assessed by the Clinical Global Impressions - Severity: Bipolar Version (CGI-BP-S) score (depression) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-BP-S is a clinician-rated assessment of the subject's current illness state on a 7-point scale, where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity.</description>

             medications.

          -  Subject has knowledge of any kind of cardiovascular disorder/condition known to
