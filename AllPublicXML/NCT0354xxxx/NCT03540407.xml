  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral solution Oncoxin-Viusid in the
      reduction of acute toxicity of Radiotherapy (RTP) and Chemotherapy (QTP) in patients with
      histological diagnosis of cervical cancer and endometrial adenocarcinoma. This is a phase II,
      prospective, randomized and double blind clinical trial, which will include 66 patients
      assigned to 2 treatment arms: 33 patients will receive conventional treatment, plus a placebo
      of the nutritional supplement and another 33 patients will receive along with the
      conventional treatment the Oncoxin-Viusid nutritional supplement produced by the Catalysis
      Laboratories of Spain. Patients will receive oral treatment throughout the onco-specific
      treatment and up to 3 weeks after completion.

      Patients will be evaluated clinically and hematological at the beginning of the treatment,
      before each cycle of treatment with QTP / RTP, at month, two and three months after the end
      of the treatment with follow-up every three months for 1 year. The self-perceived quality of
      life related to health will be assessed by means of the EORTC questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and the
      specific questionnaire QLQ-CX24) at the beginning and a year after completing the treatment.
      The toxicity to the research product will be described according to Common Criteria of
      Terminology for the Report of Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4) and the tolerance to
      onco-specific treatment. It is expected that with the joint administration of the research
      product, the patients will have a better tolerance to the treatment of QTP / RTP with a
      decrease of the interruptions by toxicity in 25% and will preserve a better quality of life.

    <description>Patients diagnosed with cervical cancer and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium usually have varying degrees of malnutrition and immunodeficiencies; they are carriers of oncogenic virus infections, and present deterioration of their general state, depression-anxiety and socio-economic dysfunctions. Oncospecific treatment's toxicity is measured according to Common Criteria of Terminology for the Report of Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4).</description>
