    <textblock>
      Cluster-Randomized Clinical trial, which includes the development and activation of an
      intervention program among young adolescents and their parents. Study hypothesis is that the
      intervention program will yield improvement in adolescents whose parents participated in the
      program, in comparison with the adolescents whose parents weren't involved in the
      intervention. Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the
      participants before, after, and three months after the completion of the program. The
      questionnaire will include validated questionnaires with good psychometric qualities. The
      study protocol was approved by Tel Hai College institutional review board. Parents of all
      participants, in the intervention and in the control group, received information about the
      program and the study and were asked to provide informed consent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early adolescent (10-13 years) is characterized by hormonal changes and accelerated
      physiological growth. Significant risk factors for the physical and mental health of children
      and adolescents include, among other things, disordered eating patterns, overweight and
      reduced physical activity, low self-esteem and negative body image.

      &quot;In Favor of Myself&quot; is a preventive intervention program. The program's primary goal is to
      increase adolescents' self-esteem and to prevent negative self-image and body image, as well
      as to development media literacy. In this study, the investigators will focus on the &quot;Young
      In Favor of Myself &quot; program, designed for ages 10-12, grades 5 and 6, and its main core is
      the development of self-care. To increase the effect of &quot;Young In Favor of Myself &quot; program,
      on the adolescents, the investigators have developed a program that will be passed on to
      parents through a telephone application. The study will first assess the parents' influence
      on the program, and then evaluate the difference in adolescent outcomes from the program with
      or without this supplement.

      Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the participants
      (both parents and adolescents) before, after, and three months after the completion of the
      program. The questionnaire will include validated questionnaires with good psychometric
      qualities. The study protocol was approved by Tel Hai College institutional review board.
      Parents of all participants, in the intervention and in the control group, received
      information about the program and the study and were asked to provide informed consent.
