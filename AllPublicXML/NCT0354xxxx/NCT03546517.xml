    <textblock>
      Study hypothesis:

      The DNHS technique, performed via one session of deep dry needling of myofascial trigger
      points applied to the biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor
      digitorum profundus, triceps brachii, extensor digitorum and adductor pollicis muscle is
      effective for decreasing spasticity and muscle stiffness (both of which are components of
      hypertonia) as well as for improving the upper limb function of the previously described
      muscles in patients with chronic cerebral vascular accident (CVA), assessed both
      post-intervention and after 15 days.

      General aims

      To analyse the immediate therapeutic effect of the DNHS technique and the effect at 15 days
      follow-up, for the following variables:

        -  Spasticity

        -  Muscle stiffness

        -  Upper limb function

        -  Patient perceived quality of life

      Materials and methods Population: patients from the province of Zaragoza (Spain) diagnosed
      with a haemorrhagic or ischemic CVA by a neurologist.

      Recruitment strategy: recruitment will take place via the Stroke Association in Aragon (AIDA)
      [Aragon Stroke Association] in the province of Zaragoza, Spain, seeing as the greater
      proportion of patients who have suffered a stroke and are in the chronic stage of the illness
      go to this centre to receive treatment. Thus, this avoids patients having to travel elsewhere
      for the study. Furthermore, in the case of patients who wish to participate in the study
      after having received information via third persons or via other means and who are not
      members of the Association or do not attend the centre on a regular basis, the Association
      AIDA has offered to allow these people to attend for free, making its facilities available
      and supporting the development of this study.

    <description>Scale measuring Upper Limb Function in stroke patients. The motor and sensory assessments are scored on a three-point ordinal scale (0 -2) in which a higher score indicates superior results. The motor assessment measures voluntary limb movement and includes a subscale for the Upper Extremity (33 items; score range, 0-66). The sensory assessment measures limb sensation. Sensation is assessed as absent, impaired, or normal for light touch (two items each for Upper Extremity (UE) and Lower Extremity (LE); score range, 0-8) and proprioception (four items each for UE and LE; score range, 0-16) for a total sensory Fugl-Meyer (FM) score of 24. Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) has shown to have an excellent intra and interrater reliability (0.89-0.99). The estimated minimal clinical important difference (MCID) of the UE-FM scores ranged from 4.25 to 7.25 points .</description>

    <description>Quality of Life. This scale measures quality of life. Description: This is a measure of self-reported health outcomes. It consists of two parts: a descriptive system (Part I) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) (Part II). Part I of the scale consists of 5 single-item dimensions including: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has a 3 point response scale, ranging from worst imaginable health state to best imaginable health state. Scoring/Interpretation: Descriptive data from the 5 dimensions of Part I can be used to generate a health-related quality of life profile for the subject. Part II is scored from 0 (worst health state imaginable) to 100 (best health state imaginable).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have been diagnosed with a haemorrhagic or ischemic CVA by a neurologist.

          -  Cognitive level: minimental state examination (MMSE) ≥ 27 points. All patients must
             have a good cognitive level in order to ensure that they are able to communicate with
             the professionals involved in the study in order to understand the exercises and thus
             fulfil the objectives for participation.

          -  Presence of spasticity ≥1 according to the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS)
             score during the flexion-extension movement of the wrist and elbow in at least one of
             the muscles of the upper limb evaluated.

          -  Age: between 30 - 90 years. In this range of age CVA's are more common, according to
             data from the Spanish Statistical Office.

          -  Evolution: over 6 months must have passed since the CVA episode. Most of the studies
             reviewed involve patients who are in the chronic stage of illness. This will ensure
             that the changes found are due to our intervention and not related to plasticity
             mechanisms occurring after the injury (this will be considered objectively by
             performing an assessment at baseline, which will be repeated 1 week later, immediately
             before and after the dry needling intervention).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitance of degenerative illnesses which can alter the results.

          -  Presence of fixed contractures: 4 according to the MMAS score

          -  Suffering from epileptic fits that are not medically controlled.

          -  Fear of needles.

          -  No tolerance to pain caused by needling.

          -  Those unable to commit to attendance.

          -  Patients who have received treatment with Botulinum Toxin (BTX A) in the 6 months
             prior to their inclusion in this study, or those who received said medication or
             another during the study with the aim of decreasing spasticity.
