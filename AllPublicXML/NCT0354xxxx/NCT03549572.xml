  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CRS-R is a standardized and validated bedside assessment of conscious awareness. It is
      used routinely for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC)
      as well as in research settings. One limitation of the CRS-R is the lengthy administration
      time required to obtain a total score. Administration time can vary from approximately 15-30
      minutes, depending on the patient's level of responsiveness. For this reason, the CRS-R is
      rarely administered in the acute hospital setting. Less time-consuming scales and metrics are
      used to assess conscious awareness in the acute hospital/ICU setting, but they lack
      specificity and sensitivity and have not been validated, increasing the potential for
      misdiagnosis. In conjunction with the developers of the Neuroscore (an unpublished,
      abbreviated version of the CRS-R), we have developed the CRSR-FAST and aim to test its
      validity, inter- and intra- rater reliability. We anticipate that, compared with the CRS-R,
      the CRSR-FAST will be less time-consuming to administer and score, but will maintain a high
      level of sensitivity to detecting signs of consciousness in severely brain injured patients.

    <description>Diagnostic agreement between the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and the CRSR For Accelerated Standardized Testing (CRSR-FAST). The CRS-R is a standardized neurobehavioral rating scale used to monitor recovery of consciousness in persons with severe traumatic brain injury. Total scores on the CRS-R range from 0 to 23 with high scores generally indicating greater recovery. Six subscales on the CRS-R are summed to provide the total score: auditory function (0-4), visual function (0-5), motor function (0-6), oromotor/verbal function (0-3), communication (0-2) and arousal (0-3). Evidence of specific behaviors on these subscales provides a diagnosis of vegetative state, minimally conscious state, or emerged from minimally conscious state. The CRSR-FAST is an abbreviated version of the CRS-R that includes select items from the auditory, visual, motor, and oromotor subscales.</description>

    <description>Patients will be assessed using the CRS-R and the CRSR-FAST. The CRS-R is a standardized neurobehavioral rating scale that consists of 23 items organized into six subscales that address arousal, auditory, visual, motor, oromotor/verbal, and communication systems. Each subscale is organized hierarchically, with lower items representing reflexive behaviors and higher items indicative of cognitively-mediated behaviors. Reliability and validity have been demonstrated in multiple studies. The CRSR-FAST consists of 10 items organized into 4 subscales that address arousal, visual, motor and verbal/oromotor systems. Each subscale is organized hierarchically, with lower items representing reflexive behaviors and higher items indicative of cognitively-mediated behaviors.</description>
