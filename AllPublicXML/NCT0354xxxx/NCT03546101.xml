  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of several herpesviruses that cause disease in humans. EBV
      virus has an oncogenic potential, and it has been associated with the development of a wide
      range of cancers. Previous studies have shown a close association between EBV and
      Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in transplant recipients. As part of a
      preventive approach against PTLD, several transplantation units now monitor the occurrence of
      EBV-DNAemia after transplantation. However, there is little evidence to guide this strategy;
      nor is there consensus concerning either the best specimen to use for EBV analysis (whole
      blood or plasma).

      In this study investigators aim to optimise and validate a polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR)-test for EBV-DNA on, respectively, whole blood, plasma and a combination of plasma and
      lymphocytes.

      The investigators wish to determine which of the three tests best predicts current and future
      risk of development of EBV-related diseases such as mononucleosis and PTLD.

      EBV is one of several herpesviruses that cause disease in humans. Primary EBV infection
      usually occurs in early childhood and is generally asymptomatic, while later infection may
      cause mononucleosis. As with other herpesviruses, primary infection is followed by persistent
      (lifelong) infection. EBV virus has an oncogenic potential, and it has been associated with
      the development of a wide range of cancers. Previous studies have shown a close association
      between EBV and PTLD in transplant recipients. As part of a preventive approach against PTLD,
      several transplantation units now monitor the occurrence of EBV-DNAemia after
      transplantation. However, there is little evidence to guide this strategy; nor is there
      consensus concerning either the best specimen to use for EBV analysis (whole blood or plasma)
      or the appropriate clinical action to take if EBV-DNAemia is detected.

      In this study investigators aim to optimise and validate a polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR)-test for EBV-DNA on, respectively, whole blood and a combination of plasma and
      lymphocytes.

      Results obtained with the two new methods will be compared with those from the already
      established World Health Organization (WHO) standardised EBV-PCR test on
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma. The result of all three tests will be
      evaluated relative to EBV-related symptoms and other diseases.

      The investigators wish to determine which of the three tests best predicts current and future
      risk of development of EBV-related diseases such as mononucleosis and PTLD.
