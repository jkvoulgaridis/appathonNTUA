  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyse biomarkers in first-void urine for improved follow-up of
      women treated for high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total 100 women, diagnosed with CIN2/3 and scheduled for LLETZ (Large Loop Excision of the
      Transformation Zone), will be included in this trial. These women are asked to collect two FV
      urine samples with the Colli-Pee device (Novosanis, Wijnegem, Belgium) prior to their
      treatment (one at home and one at the hospital) and at five additional time points post
      treatment (1-3-6-12-24 months) at home. In addition, five self-collected vaginal swabs will
      be taken, two before treatment (1 at home and 1 at the hospital) and three (6-12-24 months)
      after treatment at home. Qvintip devices are used for vaginal self-sampling.

      During follow-up visits cervical samples and optional biopsies are collected by the physician
      and respectively send to the UZA anatomic pathology unit to determine the patient's HPV
      status, cytology and histology. For the study, one extra cervical sample will be taken by the
      physician just before treatment, that is not part of the normal standard procedure.

        The cohort involves 100 women, diagnosed with histologically confirmed high grade CIN
        lesions requested for LLETZ treatment. Before this treatment an extra cervical sample is
        collected by the clinician. In addition, these women are asked to collect first-void urine
        samples with the Colli-Pee device, vaginal samples with the Qvintip device and to fill in a
        questionnaire.
