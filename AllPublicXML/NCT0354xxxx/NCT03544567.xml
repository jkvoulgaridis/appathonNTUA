  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, multi-center, open-label, pilot study to evaluate the activity,
      safety, and tolerability of Oraxol in subjects with cutaneous angiosarcoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oraxol will be administered once daily for 3 consecutive days every week during the Treatment
      Period from Weeks 1 through 25.

      Subjects who do not have documented disease progression by the end of the Treatment Period
      will be eligible to receive therapy in the Treatment Extension Period; Oraxol may be
      administered from Week 26 onwards.

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST v.1.1

          -  Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:

             following surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or tubal
             ligation) confirmed by medical history or menopause (ie, no menstrual bleeding for
             more than 12 months in a women aged ≥45 years), OR woman of child-bearing potential
             who test negative for pregnancy at time of enrollment based on serum pregnancy test
             and agree to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control, 1 of which must be
             highly effective, during the study and for at least 30 days after stopping Oraxol

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months, in the opinion of the Investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with metastases outside of local lymph node involvement

          -  Concurrent treatment or participation on other therapeutic clinical trial for
             angiosarcoma.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

             &gt;50% of volume of pelvic bones or equivalent) or limited-field radiation for
             palliation ≤3 months prior to treatment administration. Angiosarcoma lesions in the
             radiation field are not evaluable unless they have developed progressive disease
             following radiation.

          -  History of brain involvement with cancer, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous
             meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Active bleeding or bleeding diathesis actively requiring transfusions; Note: subjects
             with cutaneous ulcers from angiosarcoma or who have skin lesions with bleeding are
             allowed to participate.

          -  Thrombolytic use (except to maintain IV catheters) within 10 days prior to treatment
             administration

          -  Active infection that requires systemic treatment

          -  Concurrent use of a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducer (eg, rifampin or St.
             John's Wort) or a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg, ketoconazole) within 14 days prior to
             treatment administration

          -  Concurrent use of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (eg, gemfibrozil) or inducer (eg,
             rifampin) within 14 days prior to treatment administration

          -  Concurrent use of an oral medication with a narrow therapeutic index known to be a
             P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate within 24 hours prior to treatment administration

          -  Concurrent use of a medication known to be a strong P-gp inhibitor or inducer within
             14 days prior to treatment administration

          -  History of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel, not attributed to a hypersensitivity-type
             reaction to Cremophor® or history of hypersensitivity-type reaction to polysorbate 80
             or other components of the formulation of Oraxol

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical (including bone marrow suppressive diseases) or
             psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated
             with study participation, impede the ability of the subject to complete all
             protocol-specified activities, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
             results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate
             for this study
