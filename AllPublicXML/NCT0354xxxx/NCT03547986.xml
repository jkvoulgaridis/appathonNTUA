  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both drug-coated balloon and stents have been used for a number of years to treat subjects
      with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and are recognized as very good treatment methods.
      However, due to a higher risk of blood clot formation, requiring a longer anticoagulant
      treatment, and the challenge of treating re growth of tissue extending through the metal mesh
      of the stent, the physicians try to reserve stent placement to situation where it's really
      needed, in case of flow-limiting vessel dissection or acute re-narrowing.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of several procedural diagnostic
      techniques in helping the physicians to better decide whether a stent is needed or not.

      The study will also estimate the safety and efficacy of Passeo-18 Lux drug-coated balloon
      associated to Pulsar 18 bare metal stent when and where needed to treat PAD
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The REACT treatment concept aims at minimizing the metal burden, combining Passeo-18 Lux
      Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) with Pulsar-18 thin struts bare metal stent, as low as reasonably
      achievable (ALARA), while benefiting from the antirestenotic properties of Paclitaxel.
      However, in order to optimally apply this selective stenting approach, it is needed to
      clearly identify when a stent is indicated. Angiographic images, even with additional
      projections, are sometimes insufficient to clearly determine if a dissection is flow-limiting
      and the subsequent stent requirement. There is currently no definition nor validated method
      to define flow-limiting dissection in the peripheral arteries. Even though it has been widely
      used, the classification developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to grade
      coronary artery dissection as A to F19, based on angiographic appearance cannot be
      extrapolated to peripheral arteries.

      Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the incremental value of several
      adjunctive procedural assessments to standard angiography to identify flow-limiting
      dissection and residual stenosis, and better inform the operator on the stent requirement. In
      addition, the study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the REACT algorithm.

    <description>The Euroquol Group 5 dimension quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D) is a descriptive system comprising 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The results in a 1-digit number expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes patient's health state.
The EQ Visual Analogue Scale records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement</description>
