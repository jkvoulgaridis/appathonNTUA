    <textblock>
      The Long QT syndrome is associated with potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias as
      ventricular tachycardia (Torsade de pointes) as well as ventricular fibrillation, and might
      lead to syncope as well as sudden cardiac death (1). Good results have been achieved by
      treating patient at risk with beta blockers and implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). It
      is therefore important to diagnose the condition as early as possible as the disease is
      treatable (2).

      Prolonged QT duration might also be induced by the intake of numerous pharmaceutical
      substances, as well as with electrolyte disturbances, which also increases the risk of
      life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Furthermore, congenital LQTS can arise from mutations
      in one of at least 13 different genes. Many of these genes encode proteins which are
      constituents of ion channels. The genetically defined long QT syndrome has autosomal dominant
      (Romano Ward Syndrome) or autosomal recessive (Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome)
      inheritance.

      In this study we are using the hospital ECG database obtained with the GE Marquette 12SL ECG
      Analysis Program® at Telemark Hospital Skien recorded between March 2004 and April 2014. This
      database stores approximately 200 000 ECG recordings from 60 000 unique patients.

      By using the search algorithm in the MUSE ECG database, 2398 recordings have been be
      identified from 1603 patients where the corrected QT time is longer than 500 ms, and QRS is
      less than 120 ms.

      ECG recordings with QT intervals longer than 500 ms represents less than 1% of the population
      (5). Individuals having these recordings are selected for extensive clinical follow up. The
      patients will be offered the opportunity to have genetic analysis performed in order to
      distinguish between inherited or acquired long QT syndrome. The appropriate treatment will be
      initiated according to guidelines for patients with inherited QT syndrome. For patients with
      aquired long QT syndrome substitution of unfavourable pharmacotherapy or correction of
      electrolytes shall be performed in order to reduce their risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

      A T wave morphology score gives independent prognostic information useful for risk
      stratification. The purpose of this substudy is to examine if the T wave morphology score
      applied on the 1531 patients ECGs with QTc &gt;500 ms, has independent prognostic value in this
      cohort.

      2. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

      The study has the intention to:

        -  Identify patients with inherited LQTS in order to give them optimal treatment.

        -  To identify patients with acquired QT prolongation in order to possibly correct
           electrolyte disorders and therapeutically prescriptions in order to minimize the chance
           of life-threatening arrhythmias.

        -  To analyse to what extend a specific reason for QT prolongation can be found in patients
           with heart rate adjusted QT prolongation, or to which extend the QT prolongation without
           syncope, or family history of sudden cardiac death, is an unspecific finding.

        -  To analyse time dependent risk of patients with QT prolongation related to underlying
           disease

        -  To analyse to what extend genetic variations might predispose for acquired QT
           prolongation.

        -  To compare life expectancy of patients with QT prolongation related to case control
           patients with out QT prolongation.

        -  To implement rapid reaction on newly diagnosed QT prolongation, and follow up of
           survival after implementation of improved care.

             -  To examine if the T wave morphology score applied on patients ECGs with QTc &gt;500
                ms, has independent prognostic value in this cohort.
