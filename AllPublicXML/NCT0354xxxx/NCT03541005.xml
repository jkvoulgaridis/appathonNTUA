  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Obesity is an important and growing worldwide

        -  Obesity is highly related to the development of metabolic syndrome, diabetes,
           cardiovascular diseases and cancer

        -  Diverse adverse events have been reported with the use of antiobesity drugs.

        -  Several articles describe the beneficial effect of several specific components of the
           Obex® supplement on weight loss, in the reduction of waist circumference, suppression of
           appetite, decrease fasting glucose levels, improvement of insulin sensitivity and β
           cells function.

        -  Therefore, the administration of Obex in overweight and obese patients could be an
           excellent strategy to induce weight loss and ameliorate the metabolic disturbances
           related to obesity and overweight.
