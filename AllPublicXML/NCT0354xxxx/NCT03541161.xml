      The purpose of the study is to find best post-operative rehabilitation protocol after total
      mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with tissue expander insertion. This study compared
      outcomes of two post-operative rehabilitation protocols ; &quot;conventional protocol&quot;, which
      immobilized shoulder and upper arm motion for a month and &quot;early rehabilitation protocol&quot;
      with short-term immobilization period and early mobilization.

      To prevent surgical site complications, surgeons use so-called &quot;conventional protocol&quot;, which
      immobilizes shoulder and upper arm motion for a month after total mastectmoy and immediate
      reconstruction with tissue expander insertion. To improve shoulder mobility and QOL of
      patients, the investigators introduced a new and early rehabilitation protocol with
      short-term immobilization in Jan 2017.

      The investigators retrospectively reviewed total 115 breast cancer patients who underwent
      reconstructive surgery from May 2016 to Aug 2017. Patients who did their reconstruction
      before Jan 2017 followed conventional protocol and immobilized their shoulder for more than 4
      weeks. Patients who did their reconstruction after Jan 2017 were educated to undergo a
      self-exercise program after short-term immobilization of 2 weeks. The investigators reviewed
      shoulder mobility, pain, QOL and complications at postoperative 1 month and 2 month in both
      group of patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The shoulder range of motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 month</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder ROM was measured in flexion, abduction, external rotation and internal rotation in the affected upper limb at post-operative 1 month and 2month. Measurements were conducted by a physiatrist using a goniometer with patients in seated position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical site complication</measure>
    <time_frame>2 month</time_frame>
    <description>A plastic surgeon reviewed the surgical site for hematoma, seroma, surgical site infection, implant rupture, extrusion of the implant, asymmetry/displacement of the implant and any other complications at post-operative 1 month and 2month.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand outcome measure questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 month</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH questionnaire was used to assess shoulder function at postoperative 1 month and 2 month. Scores were transformed to a 0 to 100 scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-form 36 health survey</measure>
    <time_frame>2 month</time_frame>
    <description>The SF36 was used to assess QOL at postoperative 1 month and 2 month. The SF36 contains 8 sections measuring 8 domains of QOL: physical functioning (PF), role limitations because of physical health problems (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health perception (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role limitations because of emotional problems (RE), and mental health (MH). The 8 sections are summarized into a two-component summary: the physical component summary (PCS; PF, RP, BP, GH and VT) and mental component summary (MCS; MH, RE, SF, VT and GH).</description>

    <measure>Pain numeric rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 month</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported pain intensitiy at postoperative 1 month and 2 month. It scored 0-10 (0 = no pain; 10= pain as bad as can be)</description>
