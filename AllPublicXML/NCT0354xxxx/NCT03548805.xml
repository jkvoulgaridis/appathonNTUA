  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To the best of Investigator knowledge, no studies to this date have compared the safety and
      efficacyof ologen® Collagen Matrix to MMC in exaggerated healing response among JOAG
      patients. Given that,filtration surgery is usually less successful in patients with juvenile
      glaucoma; the purpose of this study is to compare these two adjuvant therapies in exaggerated
      healing response among JOAG patients. Investigator hypothesis is that trabeculectomy with
      ologen® Collagen Matrix would be as effective as MMC in IOP control, with prominent bleb
      morphology as compared to MMC bleb.

      Standard trabeculectomy All trabeculectomy surgeries will be performed under peribulbar
      anesthesia.Under aseptic surgical technique, superior rectus suture will be placed using 4-0
      silk and a fornix-based conjunctival flap will be performed. Sub-Tenon dissection and
      hemostasis may be performed as required.A half-thickness 4 x 4mm rectangular/ triangular
      scleral flap will be dissected up to clear cornea, and a 2 × 2 mm deep scleral block will be
      excised and peripheral iridectomy will be performed. The scleral flap will be closed with one
      or two 10-0 nylon sutures and conjunctiva will be closed with 8-0 vicryl suture. Releasable
      sutures may be applied to the scleral flap if needed.

      ologen® Collagen Matrix ologen® Collagen Matrix approved by Indian health authority with
      registration numberof MD-1517 (valid till Mar-15-2018) will be provided by Aeon Ajanta India
      Pvt. Ltd. free of cost for this clinical research only.

      The following table summarizes the model number, shape and manufacturer of ologen® Collagen
      Matrix to be used in this clinical research.
