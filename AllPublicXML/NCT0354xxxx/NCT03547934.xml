    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective multi-center open-label single-arm study. The subjects will be
      enrolled and assigned into a single study group. Subjects will be required to complete four
      (4) treatment visits and four follow-up visits, 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months after the final
      treatment.

      At the baseline visit photographs of the abdomen will be taken. In addition, patient
      umbilical circumference will be measured and the subject's weight will be recorded. In
      addition, at the last therapy visit, subjects will receive Subject Satisfaction and Therapy
      Comfort Questionnaires to fill in.

      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE) including subject's
      experience of pain or discomfort after the procedure. Following each treatment administration
      and at the follow-up visits, subjects will be checked for immediate post-procedure adverse
      event assessment.

      Post-procedure evaluation (follow-up visits) will be conducted 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months
      after the final treatment. Umbilical circumference and weight measure will be conducted at
      every follow-up visit. Also, subject's satisfaction will be noted. During the first (1
      month), third (6 months) and last (12 months) follow-up visits, photographs of abdomen will
      be taken.

    <description>The 5-point Likert scale Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire will be used for an analysis of the subject's opinion of the therapy results. Subjects will be evaluating agreement with three different statements (concerning satisfaction with therapy results and appearance of abdominal area after therapy) by choosing an answer on a scale between 1 (Strongly disagree) and 5 (Strongly agree). Minimally 80% of the treated subjects should report the agreement with all three statements given in the questionnaire (answers &quot;Agree&quot; and &quot;Strongly agree&quot;) in order to claim subject's satisfaction with the therapy outcome.</description>

    <description>Therapy comfort will be noted at the last therapy visit. Subjects will be asked to evaluate the agreement with the statement concerning the conformity of the study treatment. Subjects will be evaluating the agreement by choosing an answer on a scale between 1 (Strongly disagree) and 5 (Strongly agree). Based on a given answers, the therapy comfort will be calculated.</description>
