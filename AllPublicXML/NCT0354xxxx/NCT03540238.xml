      Sedation and analgesia affects the quality of the procedure, patient co-operation and
      compliance as well as endoscopist's satisfaction. Despite the use of numerous sedation and
      analgesic techniques for GI endoscopy procedures, the best method is still controversial. A
      wide variety of procedures have been reported worldwide for anesthesia during
      gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults.The current survey was primarily designed to provide
      national data on current sedation and monitoring practices that was carried out during
      gastrointestinal endoscopy. Secondary objectives were to provide data on the endoscopic
      application of the turkish gastroenterologist.

      The questionnaire consisting of 20 questions about the anesthesia methods applied in the
      procedures in the endoscopy unit will be sent to 1000 gastroenterologists registered in the
      Turkish Gastroenterology Association by e-mail. The questionnaire is covered the demographic
      data, types of endoscopic procedures and anesthesia methods applied, anesthetic agents,
      monitoring methods, anesthesia team, preanesthetic evaluation and consent forms, recovery
