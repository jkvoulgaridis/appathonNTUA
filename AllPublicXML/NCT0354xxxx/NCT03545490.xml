  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The target population in the present study is Chinese patients with oral cancer who plan to
      receive radio(chemo)therapy after surgical resection in outpatient clinic department.
      Investigators hypothesize that enteral nutrition intervention, which is initiated 2 weeks
      before the start of post-operative radio(chemo)therapy treatment and ongoing 2 weeks after
      the completion of irradiation treatment, will improve patients' nutritional status,
      tolerability to radio(chemo)therapy, quality of life, and other clinical outcomes compared to
      commencement of enteral nutrition during the course of irradiation treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be conducted in a single center, prospective, and randomized manner.
      In this protocol, standard radio(chemo)therapy duration is 6 weeks. Early enteral nutrition
      intervention (EEN) refers to starting enteral nutrition intervention 2 weeks before
      post-operative radio(chemo)therapy begins and stopping this intervention 2 weeks after
      post-operative radio(chemo)therapy completes. Standard enteral nutrition intervention (SEN)
      refers to starting of enteral nutrition intervention 3 weeks after post-operative
      radio(chemo)therapy begins and stopping this intervention 2 weeks after post-operative
      radio(chemo)therapy completes. Nutritional supplementation periods for EEN and SEN groups are
      10 weeks and 5 weeks, respectively. Dietitians will design meal plans for both groups of
      subjects so that their normal diets will provide 25-30 kcal/d/kg body weight in additional to
      nutritional supplements.
