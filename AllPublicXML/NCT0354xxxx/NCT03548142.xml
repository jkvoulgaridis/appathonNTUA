      Palliative and hospice care in advanced dementia: experiences of care givers and benefit of a
      brochure serving as a decision-making aid

      Aims:

        1. Designing a brochure serving as an information tool and decision-making aid used to
           answer questions concerning palliative and hospice care for care-givers of persons with
           advanced dementia.

           The brochure shall demonstrate the possibilities and offerings of palliative and hospice
           care and shall serve to inform about the advanced stages of dementia, the legal basic
           principles in decision making and ethical problems, treatment options and (palliative)
           treatment goals.

        2. Survey of the palliative, palliative medical and hospice care of persons with advanced
           dementia in ambulatory settings, as well as in residential geriatric care and the
           experiences of the care-givers.

           By examining persons with dementia and inspecting the care documents and where
           applicable the medical files it is to be evaluated:

             -  which procedures of palliative and hospice care are practically implemented in
                ambulatory care and in residential geriatric care,

             -  which symptoms the persons with dementia suffer from and how those symptoms are (or
                are not) treated,

             -  to what extend caregivers are informed about relevant aspects

             -  how caregivers assess care and which problems, needs and requests exist.

        3. Piloting phase for the brochure. To test the comprehensibility and the acceptance of the
           brochure a study is planned. The caregivers are asked for their opinion whether the
           brochure is helpful. It is recorded if the reading of the brochure gets the caregivers
           to engage actively in the participative decision making process.

    <textblock>
      Two visits at home or in the residential geriatric care at intervals of eight to twelve weeks
      are scheduled.

      The following data is collected at enrollment:

        -  Informed consent of the caregiver and of the patient or rather the caregiver with powers
           of attorney

        -  Sociodemographic data (caregiver and person with dementia), e.g. age, sex, education,
           degree of relationship

        -  Interview of the caregiver using standardized

        -  Examination of the person with dementia, recording of the treatment and the care
           situation, cognitive status: Mini-Mental-Status-Test, severity of dementia: Clinical
           Dementia Rating Scale, performance in basic activities of daily living:
           Barthel-Index,communication competence, diagnosis, (palliative) medical and hospice care
           (including specialists in palliative care, specialists in hospice care, general
           practioners, domiciliary care services, Allgemeine Ambulante Palliativversorgung [AAPV],
           Spezielle Ambulante Palliativversorgung [SAPV], AAPV and SAPV both being a specific
           ambulatory palliative care of the statutory health insurance system in Germany,
           cognitive/neurological/physical symptoms, symptom Management including pharmacological
           and non-pharmacological treatment, interventions, existence and phrasing of advanced
           directives and durable power of attorney.

      After enrollment the brochure is handed and explained to the caregivers and they are
      encouraged to read it. It is pointed out that they are contacted after two to three months to
      answer questions concerning comprehensibility, acceptance, practical consequences and to give
      a personnel review.

      At study end after two to three months standardized interviews are conducted to gather
      information about comprehensibility and acceptance of the brochure, how it is reviewed by the
      caregivers and if the reading had direct consequences with regard to knowledge of the
      caregiver, communicating with nursing staff/physicians, decision making and implementing
      those decisions.
