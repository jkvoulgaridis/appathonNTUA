      This study aims to translate the original English version of Resilience Scale for Children
      (RS10) into traditional Chinese. It will then test the psychometric properties of the newly
      translated RS10.

      It has been well documented that cancer and its treatment may have adverse effects on the
      physical and psychological well-being of children with cancer. Such adverse effects may start
      from diagnosis and continue for months or even years after the completion of therapy. Cancer
      and its treatments may also have long-term effects on the psychological well-being of
      children with cancer, such as decreased self-esteem, increased anxiety and depression that
      can adversely affect their quality of life.

      Numerous studies indicated that resilience effectively prevents the development of mental
      health problems and is associated with positive mental health outcomes in children and
      adolescents, such as reduced levels of anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive symptoms.
      Assessing resilience in children with cancer is therefore crucial for a thorough
      understanding of their responses to stress and adversity, which is an essential prerequisite
      for the design of an appropriate psychological intervention to enhance their resilience and
      foster the development of their coping mechanisms and positive mental well-being.

      This study aims to translate the original English version of Resilience Scale for Children
      (RS10) into traditional Chinese. It will then test the psychometric properties of the newly
      translated RS10. In addition, the factorial structure of RS10 will be examined using
      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

    <description>The Resilience Scale for Children (RS10) was developed to measure a child's capacity to respond to the life changes. The RS10 measures the child's resilience capacity along five core elements: (1) Sense of purpose and meaning, (2) Authenticity, (3) Equanimity, (4) Self-Reliance, and (5) Perseverance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' depressive symptoms will be assessed using the Chinese version of the CES-DC. The CES-DC comprises 20 fully standardized items to evaluate depressive symptoms. All items are evaluated on a four-point self-report scale in relation to their incidence during the last week, which were scored from 0 to 3, with total possible scores ranging from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater symptomatology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Levels of self-esteem</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' self-esteem will be assessed using the Chinese version of the RSES. The RSES is designed to measure the global self-esteem of children and adolescents. The scale comprises 10 items, rated using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4, with total possible scores ranging from 10 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem.</description>
