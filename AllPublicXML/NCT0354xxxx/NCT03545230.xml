  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fracture of lateral humeral condyle in children is not uncommon.The nonunion means no healing
      of the fracture after 3 months from the injury.Delayed union means no healing from 6 weels to
      less than 3 months after injury.

      The treatment is difficult even surgery because of lack of blood supply of lateral
      condyle,unstability from muscle force and the articular fluid inhibition of union.

      The author try to improve the healing of the fracture after surgery by &quot;4 not techniques&quot;,

        1. the surgical approach should not enter posteriorly because the blood supply of lateral
           condyle enter posteriorly in order to avoid cut the vessels.

        2. The dissection should not too much especially the muscle around the condyle.

        3. It is not necessary to perfectly reduced the fracture after nonunion to avoid too much
           dissection the muscle and allow only healing of the fragment.

        4. Bone graft is not necessary. The author wants to know the results after perform &quot;4 not
           technique&quot; in delayed union and nonunion of lateral humeral condyle fracture

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All children with delayed union or nonunion fracture lateral humeral condyle fractures will
      be inclued in the study.

      The children who received the previous surgery of the same elbow will be excluded.

      After full explanation and discussion to the children and parents.The surgery in &quot;4 not
      technique&quot; will be performed.

        1. the lateral approach of the affected elbow and enter the fracture anteriorly. The
           approach should not enter posteriorly because the blood supply of lateral condyle enter
           posteriorly in order to avoid cut the vessels.

        2. The dissection should not too much especially the muscle around the condyle. The nonunon
           fragment will be cleaned,washed and made until the healthy bone surface of fracture
           appear in both side of fracture.

        3. It is not necessary to perfectly reduced the fracture after nonunion to avoid too much
           dissection the muscle and allow only healing of the fragment.The fixation by K-wires or
           screw in older children until the fragment is stable enough.

        4. Bone graft is not necessary but in valgus deformity the correctuve osteotomy should be
           performed to correct the valgus.

      The skin is closed,the long arm cast is put and change in 2 weeks interval until bone union.

      The measurement will be

        1. The union rate

        2. The carrying angle , Baumann angle,shaft condylar angle

        3. ROM

        4. Complication of surgery such as infection,AVN of troclear etc.
