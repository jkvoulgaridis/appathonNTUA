  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present there is no consensus for post-stroke imaging except for the realization of early
      cerebral CT at 24 hours post-thrombolysis. The use of cerebral perfusion scintigraphy would
      predict the course of a stroke. Indeed, it has been shown that a good perfusion is linked to
      a good evolution of the neurological deficit. This test is used routinely to evaluate
      cerebral perfusion in patients with stroke. This technique was also used to study the
      mechanisms of post-stroke aphasia and to highlight neuronal disconnections after stroke, a
      reflection of the functioning of neural networks.

      Neuropsychological tests are almost always done at 3 months. Fatigue is studied: PSF scale at
      3 months, 6 months and 2 years. Research needs to be continued in this area because the
      pathophysiology remains unknown and the symptoms are disabling for patients. Using cerebral
      perfusion imaging would bring elements of understanding of this mechanism and ultimately
      improve the management of patients.
