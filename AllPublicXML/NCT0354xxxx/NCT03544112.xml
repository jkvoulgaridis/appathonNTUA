  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what resources are needed to improve outcomes for
      patients with opioid use disorder. The study will look at how patients engage in treatment
      and the decisions that patients and providers make regarding treatment, specifically
      buprenorphine treatment, for opioid use disorder.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. To evaluate using mixed methods the feasibility and acceptability of OUD screening,
           ED-initiated BUP, and referral.

        2. Over the course of the study and as XR-BUP is added to hospital formularies, to estimate
           the percentage and confidence intervals of patients assessed, treated, and engaged in
           treatment at Day 30. This will be a three-site study employing a multi-faceted approach
           to facilitate clinical protocol implementation and to assess feasibility, acceptability,
           and impact. Investigators will develop, introduce and update site-specific ED clinical
           protocols and implementation plans for OUD screening, ED-initiated BUP, and referral for
           treatment. A participatory action research approach will be utilized along with mixed
           methods incorporating data derived from:

             -  Medical record and administrative data abstraction,

             -  Research assessments involving patients who are eligible for and willing to receive
                ED-initiated BUP (including both those who do, and do not, receive BUP); these
                assessments will document the index ED visit and the 30th day after the index ED
                visit,

             -  Qualitative interviews, focus groups, and quantitative assessments involving
                providers and staff, patients, and other stakeholders.

In partnership with multidisciplinary teams at each site, we will adapt clinical practices from other contexts and available information about SL-BUP and XR-BUP to site-specific clinical protocols and implementation strategies. The study implementation facilitators will assist local champions to identify potential treatment providers and draw on existing resources for training and ongoing support.</description>
