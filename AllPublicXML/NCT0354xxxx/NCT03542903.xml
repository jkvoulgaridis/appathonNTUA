  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of the ECT in schizophrenia ultra-resistant were studied in short times (4-6
      months in most studies with follow-up). The literature identified a high relapse rate of 32%
      in the weeks to months after ECT discontinuation. The use of the ECT in the prevention of the
      relapse is partially known. In an empirical way, experts recommend protocols of prevention of
      the relapse going from 6 to 12 months. Nevertheless, the profit of a long cure (12 months)
      compared with a short cure (6 months) was never determined. Therefore, the investigators
      decided to lead a prospective randomized controlled study in order to compare the response
      rates between the two strategies of clozapine and ECT combinations applied to URS patients.
      The treatment consisted either in a short therapy of six months or a longer course of therapy
      of twelve months. To the investigators' knowledge, it is the first study which compares two
      ECT strategies (both the short duration and the longer one) for the treatment of URS
      patients.

    <intervention_name>Electroconvulsive therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Electroconvulsive therapy is administered through electrodes positioned bilaterally (for quicker efficacy) on the frontotemporal region.
The stimulation dose is determined by titration method, during the first ECT session.
The dose for therapeutic stimulation will be twice the seizure threshold. This dose may be increased as the crisis does not meet the effectiveness criteria, as is recommended.
For patients undergoing ECT, an intravenous injection of etomidate (between 0.1 and 0.7 mg/kg) and suxamethonium chloride (0.8 and 1.2 mg/kg) is performed. The required doses are adapted according to each patient by the anaesthetist and they are documented in the patients' files. A mixture of etomidate and propofol can be used in second-line or just propofol in third-line (no more than 2mg/kg).</description>
