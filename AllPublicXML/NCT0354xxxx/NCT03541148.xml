  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant melanoma, responsible for 75% of deaths from skin cancer. Current therapeutic
      options have poor response, many adverse events and high costs. For this reason, a study with
      nutritional supplement Oncoxin-Viusid was carried out. According to previous studies, it has
      an antitumor, immunomodulatory effect and to potentiate the antiproliferative effect of
      standard chemotherapeutic agents in different locations and stages of cancer.
