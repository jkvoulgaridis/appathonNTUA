  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is prevalent, impairing, and costly in childhood. Evidence-based treatments for
      pediatric anxiety exist; however, as many as 40-60% of youth do not demonstrate optimal
      response. By identifying psychological factors that potentiate symptom severity and treatment
      response, it may be possible to strengthen these factors to treat, or even prevent the
      development of youth emotional disorders.

      This study aims to examine whether the combination of Exposure and Self-Distancing is a
      feasible, acceptable, and efficient intervention for increasing perseverance in the face of
      exposures. This will be measured by child and parent report of treatment acceptability,
      examination of attendance and dropout rates, as well as participant and therapist report of
      participant engagement during exposures.

    <measure>Acceptability of Self Distancing with exposure therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire version for the child and parent. Five Item scale (a score of 1 indicates that the care was not at all acceptable and a score of 7 would indicate a high level of acceptability). The treatment will be determined to have adequate acceptability and self-reported feasibility if parent and child report mean values greater than or equal to 5.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility of Self Distancing based on treatment completion rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Total number of sessions attended. Treatment will be determined to have adequate feasibility if participants attend, on average, greater than or equal to 70% of sessions, and high feasibility if participants attend, on average greater than or equal to 80% of sessions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence and engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Engagement and Adherence Rating Scale (TEARS) will be used to assess subject completion of assigned homework, and engagement in in session practice by the child completing and therapist rating of exposure difficulty (0-10) and patient engagement (0-10).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Screen for Childhood Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) is a 41-item parent and participant-completed tool used to measure symptoms of anxiety, including the most common symptoms of panic/somatic, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, and school phobia. Scores range from 0-82, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Both individual level changes and group mean differences will be examined.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impressions - Severity and improvement scale (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 2 question clinician-rated scale where the scale itself assesses overall disorder severity on a scale from 1 to 7 with 1 being &quot;not at all&quot; and 7 being &quot;among the most severe cases&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</time_frame>
    <description>Only the improvement item will be completed by the parent with a score of 1 to 7 with 1 being &quot;very much improved&quot; and 7 being &quot;very much worse&quot;.</description>
