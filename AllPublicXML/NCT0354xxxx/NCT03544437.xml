    <textblock>
      Extended pelvic lymph node dissection in bladder carcinoma provides staging and, in selected
      patients, a survival beneﬁt. Recent studies showed the therapeutic beneﬁt of retroperitoneal
      lymph node dissection (RPLND) in advanced stage of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).
      Also laparoscopic extended RPLND is still a technical challenge in urology, considering the
      high rate of severe complications and difﬁculties in manipulation. In Renji Hospital,
      laparoscopic extended RPLND at time of nephroureterectomy was performed via an
      extraperitoneal approach, avoiding interference with abdominal organs and achieving better
      exposure.The aim of the present study was to determine the safety and feasibility of
      performing an extraperitoneal laparoscopic extended RPLND at the time of radical
      nephroureterectomy (RNU) for UTUC in a prospectively collected cohort of patients.

      Similar to urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), UTUC can follow routes of metastases to
      involve regional lymph nodes. Nodal metastasis is an adverse prognostic indicator and results
      in poor outcome, irrespective of the use of systemic chemotherapy or radiation. The ' gold
      standard ' treatment for UUT-UC is RNU.

      Extended pelvic lymph node dissection in bladder carcinoma provides staging and, in selected
      patients, a survival beneﬁt. Recent studies showed the therapeutic beneﬁt of RPLND in
      advanced stage urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, but there is still a lack of
      prospective studies. Thus, the current guideline recommends lymph node dissection for
      invasive UCUT on the basis of insufﬁcient evidence. But no prospective studies have
      standardized the ideal extent of RPLND or the optimum number of total lymph nodes that should
      be removed in patients with UUT-UC. Also more and more interest has been paid to establish
      standardized node dissection templates.

      Also laparoscopic extended RPLND is still a technical challenge in urology, considering the
      high rate of severe complications and difﬁculties in manipulation. In Renji Hospital,
      laparoscopic extended RPLND at time of nephroureterectomy was performed via an
      extraperitoneal approach, avoiding interference with abdominal organs and achieving better
      exposure.

      The aim of the present study was to determine the safety and feasibility of performing an
      extraperitoneal laparoscopic extended RPLND at the time of RNU for UTUC in a prospectively
      collected cohort of patients.

    <description>All patients underwent extraperitoneal laparoscopic RNU with bladder cuff excision with concomitant extended RPLND performed by one of two urology surgeons at Renji Hospital.
The anatomical boundaries of the lymph node dissection were deﬁned by the ipsilateral side of UUT-UC. In patients with right-sided UUT-UC, the template of dissection consisted of (i) right perihilar lymph nodes, (ii) paracaval lymph nodes, (iii) interaortocaval lymph nodes and (iv) right pelvic lymph nodes (common, external and obturator lymph nodes).
In patients with left-sided UUT-UC, the template of dissection included (i) left perihilar lymph nodes, (ii) para-aortic lymph nodes, and (iii) left pelvic lymph nodes (common, external and obturator lymph nodes ). Lymph node specimens were sampled &quot;en bloc&quot; with surrounding adipose tissue, and were sent to pathological examination as individual packets with the surrounding adipose tissue.</description>

        The patients who are clinically diagnosed with upper tract urothelial carcinoma and
        expected to receive radical nephroureterectomy will be the candidates for this study. They
        will be informed about this study and told about the pros and cons of extraperitoneal
        laparoscopic extended RPLND. If they were willing to attend this study, chest CT scan and
        other imaging method would be used to exclude out the distant metastasis.
