  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumours continually shed DNA into the circulation, where it can be accessed. This circulating
      tumour DNA (ctDNA) directly reflects tumour burden and has great potential to be a sensitive
      biomarker for treatment recurrence. These &quot;liquid biopsies&quot; could give a more real-time
      picture of the genomic status and evolution of a tumour and can be easily assessed for
      measurement of different biomarkers. However, in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC) patients treated with primary curative radiotherapy, data regarding ctDNA kinetics
      and its correlation with outcome are scarce. A new or additional tool for response evaluation
      next to or instead of conventional imaging after treatment would be beneficial to detect
      recurrences in an earlier stage, thereby increasing the chances of success of salvage
      therapy. More importantly, an early response parameter during treatment could help to
      identify patients that have a good treatment response and might benefit from treatment
      adaptation. With this study, we aim to reveal ctDNA as an effective tool for future dose
      (de)-escalation trials in HNSCC.
