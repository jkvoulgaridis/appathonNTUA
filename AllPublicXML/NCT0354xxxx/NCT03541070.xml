      Investigators investigated that the effects of kinesilogy taping on balance in patients with
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-five patients from Level 1 and 2 according to the Brooke Lower Extremity Functional
      Classification were included in the study. Balance was assessed by Pediatric Berg Balance
      Test (PBBT), Timed and Go Test (TUGT), and standing on one leg test. Kinesiology taping (KT)
      with facilitation technique was applied on bilateral quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles
      and the assessments were repeated 1 hour after application. The comparison between before and
      after taping was analyzed.

    <measure>Balance Test-Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>About 15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Timed up and go test is a valid and practical objective measure for the pediatric population that measuring various components such as walking speed, postural control, functional mobility and balance. The children were asked to stand up from a chair, walk during 3 meters, turn, and walk back to chair and sit down. This time was recorded as second</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Berg Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Berg Balance Test is a modified version of the Berg Balance Scale that a valid and reliable test for the elderly population, for children in school age with mild to moderate motor impairment. The patients were asked to maintain their balance at the positions indicated in the test. The score of each item varies according to the parameters of the test. The score of this test is between 0-4 and the highest total score is 56.</description>

    <description>For tibialis anterior muscle taping, each children's feet were placed at plantar flexion and eversion position while knees were extended, and I-shaped band was applied over tibialis anterior from origin to insertion of muscle with approximately 25-50% tension of the original length of the band. No tension was applied to the first and last 5 cm section of the bands in both applications because it were used as anchor. The tapes were remained for 1 hour on skin of both quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles, and in this time the children were rested.</description>

    <description>Kinesiology taping (KT) was developed by Kenzo Kase in the 1970s. KT has similar thickness and flexibility to the skin. These tapes are used in orthopedic and sports injuries as well as neurological and rheumatic diseases, pediatric patients, lymph edema and painful conditions. These tapes are used for correcting muscle function, increasing circulation, increasing proprioception, reducing pain, and repositioning the sublease joint according to the usage method</description>
