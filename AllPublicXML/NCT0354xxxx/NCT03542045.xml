      The primary objective is to evaluate the implant survivorship of ATTUNE primary, cemented
      Knee system in Chinese patients using Kaplan Meier Survivorship at 2 yrs. The subject
      population is male and female subjects who are candidates for primary, total knee
      arthroplasty between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive, willing to consent with indications
      consistent with the Instructions for Use. A total of 120 subjects will be enrolled in this
      study.

             procedure and follow-ups judged by the investigator.

          5. The Subject has previous prosthetic knee replacement (any type including
             unicompartmental, total knee arthroplasty, patellofemoral arthroplasty or ipsilateral
             Upper Tibial Osteotomy (UTO)/ High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO)) of the affected knee or a
             previous patellectomy.

          6. Subject has significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease that may
             adversely affect gait or weight bearing (e.g. muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis,
