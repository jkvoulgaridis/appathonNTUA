    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare an intervention with a weighted metal chain blanket of 8
      kg with a control plastic chain blanket of 1,5 kg for patients with Major depressive
      disorder, bipolar disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and co-occurring insomnia. Patients are evaluated by a rater
      blind to treatment allocation with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Fatigue Symptom Inventory
      (FSI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and actigraphy before, during and at
      primary end-point after 4 weeks use of the blanket.

      Insomnia is a common and problematic symptom in many psychiatric disorders. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effect of weighted chain blankets on insomnia and other
      sleep-related symptoms for patients with Major depressive disorder, Bipolar disorder,
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or ADHD. Potential participants are asked to
      participate in a study comparing two different types of chain blankets, not mentioning the
      difference in weight. After signing a informed consent, participants were randomly assigned
      on a 50/50 basis to a weighted blanket containing metal chains weighing 8 kg or a control
      blanket containing plastic chains weighing 1,5 kg. Insomnia severity is assessed before and
      weekly until endpoint at four weeks use of the blanket by a rater blind to treatment
      allocation. Participants sleep will also be monitored by actigraphy. The controlled phase of
      the study is followed by a one year open follow up study where all participants are offered
      to use a weighted blanket of any type.
