  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-gen Exome Sequencing, 2 (NCGENES 2)&quot;
      study is part of a larger consortium project investigating the clinical utility, or net
      benefit of an intervention on patient and family well-being as well as diagnostic efficacy,
      management planning, and medical outcomes. A clinical trial will be implemented to compare
      (1) first-line exome sequencing to usual care and (2) participant pre-visit preparation to no
      pre-visit preparation. The study will use a randomized controlled design, with 2x2 factorial
      design, coupled with patient-reported outcomes and comprehensive clinical data collection
      addressing key outcomes, to determine the net impact of diagnostic results and secondary
      findings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NCGENES 2 study is part of the &quot;Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER2)&quot;
      - Clinical Sites with Enhanced Diversity (U01), and brings together interdisciplinary experts
      from across North Carolina to address questions critical to the translation of genomic
      medicine to the care of patients with suspected genetic disorders.

      In this renewal of the initial NCGENES study, NCGENES 2 will carry out a clinical trial of
      exome sequencing as a diagnostic test to answer the next set of questions vital to making
      genome-scale sequencing a routine clinical tool. The study population will be drawn from a
      state-wide network of Clinical Genetics and Pediatric Neurology clinics -- clinical domains
      in which patients are enriched for phenotypes caused by heterogeneous genetic conditions.
      Exome sequencing and genome sequencing (ES/GS) are efficient means of establishing a
      molecular diagnosis in these populations, with yields of positive or possible diagnostic
      results in at least 30% of patients examined based on findings from NCGENES and other work.
      Evidence will be generated regarding the clinical utility of ES/GS using a prospective
      randomized controlled trial that compares usual care plus exome sequencing to usual care.
      Patient-reported data, electronic health records data, and administrative claims data will be
      used to evaluate defined health outcomes, in collaboration with experts in health economics
      and health services research, to address pressing questions about the utility of exome
      sequencing. Furthermore, an examination of communication between patients and physicians, and
      between physicians and laboratories, and how these critical interactions affect the utility
      of genomic sequencing will be conducted. A second, nested randomized trial (crossed with
      exome sequencing in a full-factorial design) will be incorporated to test the hypothesis that
      a theory-based, multi-component pre-clinic preparation intervention for patients will improve
      patient-centered outcomes. An &quot;embedded Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI)&quot;
      component will provide feedback to providers regarding communication discrepancies to
      iteratively improve care. Finally, the challenges of integrating clinical data and genomic
      information across a state-wide network of sites and examining different models of
      interaction between genomic clinicians and molecular diagnostic laboratorians will be
      explored.

    <masking_description>The study coordinator will assign the first randomization to pre-visit preparation arm and care providers will not be told of the patient's pre-visit preparatory randomization arm prior to the first usual care visit. Randomization to exome sequencing will be performed after the first usual care visit by the study coordinator.
Investigators will receive de-identified coded data and thus will not be able to link a patient name to an intervention arm. Some analyses will require individual-level randomization arm status to allow for comparison of parent questionnaire responses or health outcomes by arm - a major focus of this study.
All interviewers and medical records staff conducting telephone surveys and/or medical records abstraction for clinical data will be blinded to the participants randomization status. Access to this information will be blocked in the electronic patient tracking status by study role.</masking_description>

    <description>The Peds QL Measurement Model for the Pediatric Quality of Inventory measures the core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization as well as role (school) functioning. The 23-item PedsQL Core Scales (Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning) are developmentally appropriate surveys (Ages 2-4, 5-7, 8-12, 13-18) designed for parent proxy report. The 23 items are grouped together on the questionnaire, and are answered on a scale of 0-4. Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), so that higher scores indicate better Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). This questionnaire will be self-administered at home.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to pre-visit prep will receive a study packet with educational materials and a question prompt list. These participants will be instructed to review the materials, discuss them with family members if desired, use the question prompt list to select questions they would like to ask at clinic visit 1, and bring the list to their clinic visit 1 appointment.
Participants will receive usual care and will be offered research exome sequencing.</description>

    <description>Patient and provider surveys will be used to measure the impact of pre-visit preparation on the primary outcomes of engagement of participants in the clinical interaction and their view of the interaction as patient-centered, in addition to secondary outcomes that may be affected by this intervention (described above). The study investigators will test the hypothesis that patients will benefit from pre-visit preparation by: (1) rating their clinical encounters as more patient-centered and (2) asking more questions during their clinical encounters.</description>

    <ipd_description>This study will comply with NIH mandates to share genetic data via submission of raw genotype calls from whole exome sequencing to the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). All data that is submitted to dbGaP, including individual participant data, is anonymous and includes demographic variables: age of onset, birthplace, sex, race, education level, age. Data is uploaded in batches to the dbGaP website.
Individual-level de-identified coded data will be available to investigators outside of the study team at the end of the study after publication of primary results. Investigators will apply for data by formal submission of a letter of intent that will be reviewed and approved by the study leadership. Investigators of approved projects will sign an inter-institution data sharing agreement (for investigators outside of the studies parent institution). The analytic data set will be shared with the investigator via a secure server restricted by password access.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Data will be shared following study completion and publication of primary study results.</ipd_time_frame>
