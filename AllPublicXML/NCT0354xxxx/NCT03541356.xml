      This is a Phase IIa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study to
      compare the safety, tolerability and PK/PDyn of intranasal L-dopa following administration of
      INP103 in the presence of L-dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI) during an OFF episode.

    <intervention_model_description>Thirty-Two (32) to Thirty-Six (36) subjects will be randomized to treatment or placebo. INP103 is a drug-device combination product containing a drug component, L-dopa, and device component, the I231 Precision Olfactory Delivery (POD) device. In Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, L-dopa will be administered intranasally in single doses of one (35 mg), two (70 mg) or four (140 mg) puffs of INP103, 60 minutes after oral benserazide hydrochloride 25 mg.
In Cohort 4 the INP103 formulation will contain L-dopa:carbidopa administered nasally. Dosing will take place once OFF episode is confirmed and will not include predosing with oral benserazide.</intervention_model_description>

             a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1.

          6. Willing to omit their (usual) PD drugs (e.g. usual regular anti-PD medication

          8. Females who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy or lactating

          9. Subjects with any underlying physical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would make it unlikely that the subject will comply with or be able to
             complete the study requirements

         10. Use of any medication likely to interact with benserazide, carbidopa or INP103 (see
             Appendix 5)

         11. Laboratory test abnormalities at Screening (Visit 1) deemed clinically significant by
             the Investigator.

         12. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the 2 years prior to INP103 or
             placebo dosing

         13. Administration of an investigational product in another trial within 30 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to INP103 or placebo dosing

         14. Significant nasal congestion, physical blockage in either nostril, or significantly
             deviated nasal septum as evaluated by the PI or other suitably trained healthcare
             professional

         15. Subjects who have previously shown hypersensitivity to L-dopa or benserazide (for
             Cohorts 1, 2 and 3), or L-dopa or carbidopa (for Cohort 4) or any of their excipients
