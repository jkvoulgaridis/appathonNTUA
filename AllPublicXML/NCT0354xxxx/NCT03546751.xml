  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a prospective observational approach and a clinical trial design comparing the
      effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure to diet and exercise, investigators plan
      to evaluate how obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leads to endothelial dysfunction in adolescents
      and young adults and whether treatment of OSA can improve endothelial dysfunction.
      Concurrently, investigators will measure miR 92a/miR 210 levels in all subjects at baseline
      and following therapy to determine whether miR 92a/miR 210 levels reliably predict
      endothelial dysfunction in patients and responses to therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will randomize 100 OSA patients (age 13-21) to receive either continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) plus baseline diet/exercise (n=50) or medical management
      (intensive diet and exercise; n=50). Only children in whom adenotonsillectomy is
      contraindicated (morbid obesity, history of adenotonsillectomy, lack of adenotonsillar
      hypertrophy) will be included. Investigators will conduct a randomized prospective
      comparative effectiveness study to assess the impact of treatment on OSA on endothelial
      function (peripheral arterial tonometry-EndoPAT). In addition to diagnostic polysomnography
      and EndoPAT at baseline, EV (extracellular vesicle) and non EV derived miR 92a/miR 210
      concentrations, inflammatory cytokines concentrations, and body anthropometry will be
      measured. Following 3 mos of therapy and after 6mos of therapy, investigators will
      re-evaluate EndoPAT, EV and non EV derived miR 92a/miR 210 concentrations, inflammatory
      cytokines, and body anthropometry.

      Throughout the study, investigators will maintain weekly telephone contact and monthly
      face-to-face visits as per standard of care in both groups to ensure ongoing success. In the
      medical management group (intensive diet and exercise), diet and exercise will be tracked by
      maintaining weekly telephone contact and monthly face-to-face visits with a registered
      dietician. For the CPAP group, investigators will also maintain weekly telephone contact and
      monthly face-to-face visits with a sleep technician to review mask fitting, and adherence
      reports, to optimize adherence to CPAP therapy.

      Following completion at six months, polysomnography will be repeated.
