  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no bedside imaging technique that can quantify dynamic bowel perfusion with high
      soft tissue contrast and sensitivity in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Our goal is to
      assess the feasibility of utilizing contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in bedside monitoring
      of bowel perfusion in NEC. Patients with suspected or diagnosed NEC will be recruited for the
      study. Following parental consent, the subject will undergo CEUS, performed separately from
      any clinically indicated conventional US, in the ICU. Subjects will be scanned with CEUS at
      two different time-points (at the time NEC is first suspected or diagnosed and at time of MRI
      scan). The CEUS scans will be interpreted by the sponsor-investigator.

      The study will be conducted at one site, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. It is
      expected that up to 50 subjects will be enrolled per year, for up to two years, for a total
      enrollment of up to 100 subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of ischemia and necrotic bowel which leads to perforation is vital in
      improving morbidity and mortality associated with NEC. Abdominal radiography, the standard
      imaging algorithm for monitoring of NEC, has a low sensitivity of 40% in the diagnosis of
      severe NEC with necrotic bowel. There is a dire need to introduce better imaging tools such
      as CEUS to the clinical setting that can detect NEC at an early stage and prompt therapeutic
      implementation. CEUS enables safe, serial monitoring of dynamic quantification of bowel
      perfusion at the bedside.

      Sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres (LumasonTM, Bracco Inc) is an FDA-approved
      ultrasound contrast agent. The study duration per subject will be approximately 15 minutes
      including the time to prepare LumasonTM contrast agent and perform the CEUS, as well as the
      60 minute monitoring period after the first and second injection of LumasonTM. CEUS will be
      performed at the time of suspected or diagnosed NEC, and at the time of surgery (for subjects
      undergoing surgery as part of clinical care) or at short-term follow-up of clinical condition
      (approximately 1 week after the first scan) for a total of two CEUS exams of 1 hour and
      15-minute duration each.

      Injection of LumasonTM contrast agent will be performed via the existing peripheral
      intravenous line or central line using the FDA-recommended dose of up to 0.03 mg/kg.
      Contrast-agent injection will be performed twice per CEUS scan to ensure image quality and
      test reproducibility. In the case of more stable patients without an IV line, a peripheral IV
      line will be started to conduct the investigational CEUS. Two bolus injections will performed
      to evaluate for dynamic bowel perfusion and several 2-minute cine clips as well as static
      images will be acquired during the exam.

      Qualitative analysis with visual assessment and quantitative analysis of the acquired CEUS
      scans will be performed and interpreted by the PI. The scans will be assessed for diagnostic
      quality of images, artifacts encountered, and the presence of additional contributory
      diagnostic information.

    <description>Intravenous administration of contrast agent Sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres before performing contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). In pediatric patients, after reconstitution 0.03 mL per kg is administered intravenously. The weight-based dose of 0.03 mL per kg will be repeated one time during a single examination. Following each injection, an intravenous flush of 0.9% Sodium Chloride is injected. The study duration per subject will be approximately 15 minutes including the time to prepare the contrast agent and perform the CEUS, as well as the 60 minute monitoring period after the first and second injection (if there are two injections of contrast) of the contrast agent.</description>
