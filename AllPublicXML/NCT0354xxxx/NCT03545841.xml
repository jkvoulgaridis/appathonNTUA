  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few people with type 1 diabetes achieve exercise guidelines and many programmes designed to
      increase physical activity have failed. High-intensity interval training (HIT) has been shown
      to be a time-efficient alternative to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training
      (MICT) in various groups without type 1 diabetes. A single bout of HIT does not increase the
      risk of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes. This study aimed to assess whether HIT
      a safe, effective and time-efficient training strategy to improve cardio-metabolic health and
      reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes.

      This study aimed to investigate whether 1) six weeks of high-intensity interval training
      (HIT) induces similar improvements in cardio-metabolic health markers as moderate-intensity
      continuous training (MICT) in people with type 1 diabetes, and 2) whether HIT abolishes acute
      reductions in plasma glucose observed following MICT sessions. Fourteen sedentary individuals
      with type 1 diabetes (n=7 per group) completed six weeks of HIT or MICT 3 times per week.
      Pre- and post-training measurements were made of 24h interstitial glucose profiles (using
      continuous glucose monitors (CGMS)) and cardio-metabolic health markers (V ̇O2peak, blood
      lipid profile and aortic pulse wave velocity; aPWV). Capillary blood glucose concentrations
      were assessed before and after exercise sessions throughout the training programme to
      investigate changes in blood glucose during exercise in the fed state.
