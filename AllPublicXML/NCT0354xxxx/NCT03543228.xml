      The Prefect Pilot Study evaluates the use of the EC approved MyoStrain SENC CMR Imaging
      System to detect cardiotoxicity from drugs used to treat cancer (e.g. Breast Cancer and
      Lymphomas).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, observational, single center, observational clinical study that
      will enroll up to 50 patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy with or without
      concomitant radiotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer or lymphoma. Enrolled subjects
      will be evaluated with the MyoStrain SENC CMR Imaging System that measures myocardial strain
      during standard Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging at baseline through 6 month follow-up.

      The MyoStrain SENC CMR Imaging System has been approved with an EC Certificate according to
      Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices, Annex II excluding Section 4 (CE 657862) in respect
      of: Design, development and manufacture of software for the quantification of cardiac MRI
      images. MyoStrain measures the contraction of heart muscle in one heartbeat per image plane.
      With 6 image planes (3 short axis &amp; 3 long axis), a complete measure of the health of the
      myocardium, both regionally and globally, can be obtained within a minute without requiring
      contrast injection or a breath-hold.

      Heart health will be monitored throughout cancer therapy to quantify the toxic effects of
      chemotherapy with or without a reduction in traditional measures such as ejection fraction,
      and the ability to reverse observed cardiotoxicity with standard heart failure therapy.

      The goal of the study is to determine the ability to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity before
      extensive damage causes the reduction in traditional measures, which are currently used to
      categorize heart failure and serve as the basis of treatment guidelines.

    <description>Ability to detect risk of developing cardiotoxicity by quantifying subclinical myocardial dysfunction in patients with segmental strain at baseline exceeding predefined thresholds. Higher risk patients will be defined as 2 or more segments &gt; -10% with MyoStrain measurements OR 9 or more segments &gt; -17%; Lower risk patients will be the remaining patients. The changes in strain for each patient category will be evaluated by changes in segmental strain during oncology therapy.</description>
