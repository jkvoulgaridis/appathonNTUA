  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the differences in PFS for participants who
      have been receiving brigatinib as ALK inhibitor therapy for ALK+NSCLC compared to those
      participants receiving alectinib, ceritinib, lorlatinib, or other ALK inhibitors that may
      become available during study treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective and non-interventional study of participants with ALK+NSCLC. The study
      will seek to determine the real-world differences in the PFS of participants taking
      brigatinib or any FDA approved ALK inhibitor other than crizotinib in routine clinical
      practice and will evaluate participant's quality of life, daily function, general condition,
      and treatment satisfaction.

      The study will enroll approximately 160 participants: 80 participants taking brigatinib, and
      80 participants taking FDA approved ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib. Participants will
      be enrolled in one of the 2 cohorts:

        -  Brigatinib

        -  Any FDA Approved ALK Inhibitor

      This trial will be conducted in the United States. Upon enrollment into the study,
      participants will complete a study-specific Baseline questionnaire and four validated
      instrument questionnaires. After that, participants will complete a study-specific monthly
      questionnaire and four validated instrument questionnaires, which will be made available to
      participants every 30 days. Participants will be sent automatic e-mail reminders every 30
      days when new surveys become available. All participants will receive a notice on completion
      of their participation in the study at approximately 36 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prescriber-confirmed PFS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first (approximately 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first administration of ALK inhibitor to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. PFS will be based on prescriber confirmed progression. Participants that withdraw, drop out, or are lost to follow-up before documentation of the events will be censored at the last date at which the participant was determined to be progression-free.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Status Using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire -Lung Cancer (EORTC QLQ-LC13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to treatment cessation or up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-LC13 contains 13 questions to assess for: dyspnea, and a series of single items including pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis. Score of each item will range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no symptoms and 100 indicates worst possible symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Function Status by M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Lung Cancer (MDASI-LC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to treatment cessation or up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MDASI-LC Module includes 22 questions to assess the severity of multiple lung cancer-related symptoms and the impact of these symptoms on daily functioning. Symptom assessments include: pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath, difficulty remembering, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, numbness/tingling, coughing, constipation, sore throat, general activity, mood, work, relations with others, walking, and enjoyment of life. Scores for each item range from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no symptoms and 10 indicates worst possible symptoms.</description>

    <measure>General Condition Status Using EuroQol Research Foundation EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to treatment cessation or up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized non-disease-specific instrument for use as a measure of generic health status. It has 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to treatment cessation or up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM-9 contains 9 items assessing the following 3 domains: effectiveness (3 items), convenience (3 items) and global satisfaction (3 items).</description>

    <measure>Participant-reported PFS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first (approximately 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first administration of ALK inhibitor to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be based on participant reported progression. Participants that withdraw, drop out, or are lost to follow-up before documentation of the events will be censored at the last date at which the participant was determined to be progression-free.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
