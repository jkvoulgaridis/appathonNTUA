  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      eMOM is a randomized, controlled trial to compare the effects of two different dietary
      interventions during pregnancy. The comparison is based on tissue glucose content (using
      continuous glucose monitoring system) in pregnant women and on neonate body composition. The
      recruited women (n=50) have early gestational diabetes mellitus (diagnosed before gestational
      weeks 13), are obese (BMI &gt;30 kg/m²) and of Caucasian origin. Of the study diets, one is
      moderately carbohydrate restricted and the other one is high on plant-based protein with an
      emphasis on healthy Nordic foods. The study has three two-week study periods that are carried
      out on approximately gestational weeks 13-14 (period I), 24-25 (period II) and 34-35 (period
      III). Continuous glucose monitoring and other measurements (accelerometer, 3-day food record,
      gut microbiota, serum lipids, metabolomics, epigenetics etc.) are done during these study
      periods. At the beginning of the study, before study period I, the participants are
      randomized to either one of the intervention diets. The first study period consists of a
      crossover phase in which the participants receive three days' worth of food according to one
      of the intervention diets (according to the randomization) after which there is a three-day
      wash-out period. After the wash-out period, the participants receive three days' worth of
      food according to the other diet. After the first study period, a nutritionist advises the
      lastly followed intervention diet to the participant and the diet is followed until delivery.
      To ensure the diet is followed, the participant gets at least five personal counselling
      sessions, mobile reminders, recipes and food items. After delivery, the infant's body
      composition, epigenetic markers of cord blood and placenta, gut microbiome and urine
      metabolomics are measured.

    The study protocol was changed because of too few eligible participants. A registration with
