  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of blood flow restriction (BFR) on exercise and hemodynamic responses will be
      studied. The use of BFR will be studied during yoga and low-intensity aerobic exercise in
      healthy subjects with no history of chronic illness ranging from 18-40 years of age. This
      study will evaluate several conditions related to cardiovascular physiology in order to
      determine the safety and efficacy of this type of exercise training. First, the effects of
      two distinct types of BFR cuffs (BStrong and Hokanson) will be studied during low-intensity
      aerobic exercise on vascular function. Second, the effect of yoga will be studied with and
      without the use of BStrong bands on vascular function. Outcome measures include acute effects
      on endothelial function i.e. flow-mediated dilation, arterial stiffness, beat-by-beat blood
      pressure, heart rate, RPE (rate of perceived exertion), and blood lactate. For this
      intervention, the BFR cuffs will be used during exercise to evaluate its safety and efficacy.
      Since BFR is becoming a widely popular method of exercise, it is important to study its
      safety and hemodynamic effects.

    <textblock>
      Participants will be tested a total of 5 times; twice for the yoga portion and thrice for the
      aerobic exercise (walking) portion. Outcome measures will be consistent across the five
      visits and will take approximately 2.5 hours to complete. The order of the five separate
      sessions will be randomized such that the participant cannot expect which condition they will
      be performing.

    <measure>Acute Change in Flow-mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be taken at Baseline (before Experimental Arm Participation), Immediately after Experimental Arm Participation, and 1 hour-post Experimental Arm Completion. Each measurement will take approximately 15min to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Using an ultrasound probe, FMD measures arterial compliance via percent dilation of the brachial and popliteal arteries, respectively. A period of five minutes of occlusion is followed by three minutes of measurement after which the data is analyzed and percent change in dilation before and after exercise is evaluated. FMD values indicate the health of the subject's arteries as well as their hemodynamic response to the intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute Change in Arterial Stiffness (CAVI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be taken at Baseline (before Experimental Arm Participation), Immediately after Experimental Arm Participation, and 1 hour-post Experimental Arm Completion. Each Measurement will take approximately 5min to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial stiffness is measured indirectly through blood-flow velocity from the brachial artery to the ankle. This value is extrapolated through CAVI to give a determination of the stiffness of the arteries. Arteries that are more stiff tend to indicate artery disease and overall vascular compliance and function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute changes in Beat-by-Beat Blood pressure (Portapres) including systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be taken at Baseline (before Experimental Arm Participation), Immediately after Experimental Arm Participation, and 1 hour-post Experimental Arm Completion. Each Measurement will take approximately 5min to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Using a finger transducer, this software is able to accurately measure blood pressure on a beat-by-beat basis, recording small changes in blood pressure throughout the intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute Change in Blood lactate (Lactate Pro)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be taken at Baseline (before Experimental Arm Participation), Immediately after Experimental Arm Participation, and 1 hour-post Experimental Arm Completion. Each Measurement will take approximately 5min to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Using a lancet to obtain a small amount of blood from the finger, circulating blood lactate can be measured. Lactate is produced during exercise and indicates the anaerobic intensity of the exercise.</description>
