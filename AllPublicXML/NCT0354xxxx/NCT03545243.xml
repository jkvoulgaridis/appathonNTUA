      Prospective interventional study of the effect of PPI on the duodenal microbiome in healthy
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PPIs are frequently (over-)prescribed with potential adverse events, especially in the long
      term. As C. difficile and CAP are important causes of morbidity, mortality and healthcare
      costs, it is important to study the underlying mechanisms of PPI-induced dysbiosis.

      In this prospective interventional study, study procedures will be performed at inclusion
      (1), after a baseline period of 4 weeks (2) and after treatment with Pantoprazole (Pantomed®)
      40mg once daily during 4 weeks (3) . The investigators aim to assess alterations of the
      duodenal (mucosa-associated and luminal) microbiome with PPI therapy and to correlate changes
      in the duodenal microbiota with oral and fecal microbiota, bile acids, intestinal
      permeability and histology and biochemical variables.

      The results from this study will help to unravel the onset and extent of dysbiosis and
      provide additional arguments not to prescribe or continue PPI without clear clinical
      indications, especially in cases where alternative regimens may be available or the benefits
      of PPI are uncertain.
