  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is claimed that SBO may be responsible for bladder dysfunction in patients without known
      neurological disease. Subsequently, it was reported that the frequency of SBO in NE cases was
      higher than normal children. However, in controlled trials, SBO frequency was not different
      in NE patients compared to the normal population. Conversely, the incidence of dysfunctional
      bladder in the presence of SBO in NE patients was found to be higher and the response to
      treatment was worse than in non-SBO patients.

      The present study aimed to determine whether the frequency of SBO in patients with NE was
      higher than in healthy subjects, the effect of SBO on the severity of LUTS and whether
      treatment response of primary NE patients changed in the presence of SBO.

        Patients aged 6 to 15 years who were admitted to an urology outpatient clinics with at
        least one night-time wetting weekly, were included in this prospective study.

        The control group consisted of patients who were admitted to the urology outpatient clinic
        with a complaint of abdominal or lateral pain, who had no NE and had a direct abdominal
        x-ray examination. The patients who were selected as the control group had night wetness
        questioned and the dysfunctional voiding symptom score (DVSS) form was completed. Those who
        had night wetting, neurological disease or diabetes mellitus were not included in the
        control group.
