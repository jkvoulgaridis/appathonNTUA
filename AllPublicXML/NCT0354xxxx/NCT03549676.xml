      The study evaluates safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the
      treatment of refractory graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of the gut. FMT might be a
      beneficial treatment in this clinical situation with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic
      options.

    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major complication after hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT). Gut is the most vulnerable target organ of acute GVHD. Patients who
      have a gastrointestinal acute GVHD received a first-line standard treatment of
      corticosteroids. For patients who do not respond or progress after an initial response have a
      high mortality. Therefore, the investigation of effective second line therapy for these
      patients are in need. The study evaluates safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of refractory GVHD of the gut. FMT might be a
      beneficial treatment in this clinical situation with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic
      options.

    <description>The overall safety of the study will be evaluated with the incidence of all Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) within 28 days following FMT. The relationship of any kind AEs and FMT will be seriously evaluated. Non-serious AEs include: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, inhalation without mechanical ventilation, etc. SAEs include: death, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, septic shock, etc.</description>

    <description>Patients will accept FilmArray Gastrointestinal (GI) panel test before pre-treatment of HSCT and 28±3 days post-HSCT. Patients will receive 50ml fecal microbiota from unrelated healthy donors through nasojejunal tube and monitored under gastroscopy. Patients receiving FMT treatment will be followed for at least 6 months. The ideal follow up time is 2 year. Stool and blood samples will be serially collected and tested (before pre-treatment, 1/3/6/12 months after FMT).</description>
