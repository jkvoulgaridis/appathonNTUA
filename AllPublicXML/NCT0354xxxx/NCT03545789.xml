      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate [18F]MNI-958 also known as APN-0000455 or
      PM-PBB3, a tau targeted radiopharmaceutical. The specific objectives are:

        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MNI- 958 in brain using positron
           emission tomography (PET) in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Progressive Supranuclear
           Palsy and healthy volunteers.

        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MNI-958 and perform kinetic modeling to assess its
           ability to measure tau protein in brain using the tracer plasma concentration or a
           reference region as indirect input.

        -  To obtain test/retest reliability of the tracer binding parameters in patients with
           Alzheimer's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and healthy volunteers.

        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MNI-958.
