  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium Sulphate is the drug of choice for prevention and treatment of seizures in
      preeclampsia and eclampsia. It is administered parenterally by intravenous (IV) and or
      intramuscular (IM) routes. The IM regimen requires repeated painful injections which may be a
      barrier to optimal utilization whereby, there is frequent omission of some doses or increased
      interval between maintenance doses and low patient acceptability of magnesium. The study
      plans to assess the acceptability and safety of Springfusor device in the administration of
      magnesium sulphate in preeclampsia and eclampsia.

      The IM regimen used in low resource settings, requires repeated painful injections which may
      be a barrier to optimal utilization whereby, there is frequent omission of some doses or
      increased interval between maintenance doses and low patient acceptability of magnesium. The
      study plans to assess the acceptability and safety of Springfusor device in the
      administration of magnesium sulphate in preeclampsia and eclampsia.

      It is open label clinical randomized trail conducted at Mulago national referral and teaching
      hospital, where, 482 women diagnosed with preeclampsia and eclampsia will be randomized in
      blocks to either Springfusor device or standard of care for the administration of magnesium
      sulphate.

      Women in the Springfusor group will have their loading dose (4 gm of 50% Magnesium sulphate
      in 10 ml syringe administered over 20 minutes) and maintenance therapy (4 gm of 50% Magnesium
      sulphate in 10 ml syringe administered over 4 hours. The 4 gm maintenance dose will be
      repeated every 4 hours for 24 hours) of Magnesium sulphate through an IV infusion
      administered using a Springfusor pump.

      The control group will have Magnesium sulphate administered according to the Pritchard
      regimen (standard hospital practice). The Pritchard regimen involves administration of
      loading dose of 4 gm of 20% Magnesium sulphate IV over 15-20 minutes, immediately followed by
      10 gm of 50% Magnesium sulphate IM (5gm on each buttock). The maintenance dose of 5 gm of 50%
      Magnesium sulphate IM every 4 hourly in alternate buttocks continued for 24 hours.

      The primary outcome is the acceptability of administration of Magnesium sulphate using
      Springfusor assessed using a Likert scale. The other outcomes are discontinuation and
      complications in the two arms. Analysis will be intention to treat.
