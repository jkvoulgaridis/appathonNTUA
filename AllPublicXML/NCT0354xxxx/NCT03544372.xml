  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perhaps no issue in sports medicine has attracted so much media attention and academic
      interest in recent years as the potential long-term neurodegenerative sequelae of
      sports-related concussion on athlete's brain health. Rugby has a high incidence of
      concussion. Recent research findings from a cohort of former professional players found that
      the number of concussions sustained during their professional careers was associated with the
      rate of diagnosed clinical depression and late-life cognitive impairment. A limitation of
      these studies is the use of a self-reported history of concussion. The reliability of
      professional rugby players to recall and self-report concussion history has never been
      quantified in the literature to date. Imperfect recall can generate bias in epidemiologic
      studies when the proportion of events recalled is associated with the health end points of
      interest. Associations observed may be spurious and due to recall bias if athletes differ in
      their knowledge and recognition of concussion symptomology in a manner that is associated
      with the health outcome of interest ie. under/overreporting of concussion. It is difficult to
      estimate the magnitude of the bias in the absence of any &quot;gold-standard&quot; measure of
      concussion history. Due to these concerns about the quality of self-reported concussion
      history, the investigators considered that it was important to evaluate the reliability of
      self-reported concussion history.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of self-reported concussion
      history in current rugby union players

      Objectives:

      The objectives will be to:

      Investigate player's self-report history of sports-related concussion (number and nature of
      concussions) in this elite rugby playing group.

      Correlate player self-report with established individual player medical data. Repeat this
      process approximately 6 months later on a sub sample of this cohort, in order to test the
      reliability of player's reported concussion.
