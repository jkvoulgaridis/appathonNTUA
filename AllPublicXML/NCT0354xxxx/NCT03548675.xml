  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA's) are the cornerstone of treatment for patients with severe
      Major Depressive Disorder (sMDD). Current dosing is guided by repeated measurements of blood
      levels. Compared to patients with a normal metabolization function, for those with increased
      CYP450 enzyme activity it takes longer to reach a therapeutic drug level. The consequent
      delay of drug efficacy is associated with a prolonged treatment period, increased risk of
      suicidal behaviour and eventually lower remission rates. For those with reduced CYP450
      activity higher rates of side effects are expected. An innovative TCA dosing strategy, taking
      the genetic variants of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 into account may help to reduce the above
      mentioned problems. Up till now, the current guidelines for CYP450 pharmacogenetics based TCA
      dosing have not been systematically evaluated for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in
      larger groups of patients. Such evaluation is necessary before broad implementation of these
      guidelines can be advocated. In the present study 200 patients with sMDD who are treated with
      nortriptyline, clomipramine or imipramine are randomized over two strategies: dosing based
      both on CYP450-genotype and blood level measurements and dosing as usual (standard doses plus
      blood levels). We hypothesize that genotype informed dosing results in faster attainment of
      therapeutic drug levels, lower rates of side effects, earlier symptom relief and lower levels
      of health- and working related costs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients are in- and outpatients, having a primary diagnosis of severe major depressive
        disorder (SCID-I diagnosis in agreement with DSM-5 criteria and a Hamilton Rating Scale for
        Depression score â‰¥ 19 (HAM-D-17-item version), aged 18-65 years, who, according to their
        physician, are eligible for treatment with a TCA (Nortriptyline (NOR), Clomipramine (CLOMI)
        or Imipramine (IMI)). The choice of the specific TCA is at the discretion of the physician
        in attendance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Psychotic depression

          2. Bipolar I or II disorder.

          3. Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorder.

          4. Drug or alcohol dependence in the past 3 months.

          5. Mental Retardation (IQ &lt; 80).

          6. For women: pregnancy or possibility for pregnancy without adequate contraceptive
             measures.

          7. Breastfeeding.

          8. Serious medical illness affecting the CNS, including but not restricted to M
             Parkinson, SLE, brain tumour, CVA.

          9. Relevant medical illness as contra-indication for TCA use, such as recent myocardial
             infarction.

         10. Other drugs influencing the pharmacokinetics of the TCAs as based on a list of
             interacting drugs. In case of psychotropic co-medication only a benzodiazepine in a
             dose equivalent up to 4 mg lorazepam will be allowed.
