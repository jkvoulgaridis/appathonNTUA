  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic insufficiency (IA) is defined as an abnormal regurgitation of blood from the aorta to
      the left ventricle in diastole, due to a lack of tightness of the aortic valves. It
      represents about 10% of valvular pathologies but the annual mortality of nonoperated patients
      can be as high as 10% to 20%. The quantification of AI is therefore important as it can
      remain perfectly asymptomatic for a long time.

      Doppler echocardiography is currently the key examination to confirm the presence of
      valvulopathy, to allow positive diagnosis of valve leakage regardless of location, to specify
      the etiology and mechanism of regurgitation. The quantification of IA requires, in
      transthoracic ultrasound, to take into account many parameters that individually have all
      certain limitations. The recommendations are therefore to have an integrative approach
      considering a combination of different parameters and an overall interpretation. This makes
      it possible to evaluate with greater precision the importance of the leak. Thus, there is the
      difficulty of quantifying moderate and severe AI for lack of a truly unique criterion. One of
      the evaluation criteria commonly used in transthoracic ultrasound is diastolic regurgitation
      in the aortic arch but this assessment is sometimes difficult. The left subclavian artery
      (SCG) is more accessible than the aortic arch in terms of the ultrasound window. The
      measurements will be easier to record since the vessel is more superficial and there are
      fewer air interpositions than for the aortic arch. The quantification of the AI based on this
      new element will be compared to the other previously validated ultrasound criteria. The
      investigators will use this study to describe the feasibility of collecting coronary flow in
      the artery (IVA), and they will compare systolic velocity, diastolic rate / systolic rate
      ratio compared to a control group without severe aortic insufficiency (grades 2 and 3). The
      flows recorded in the IVA will be compared to the importance of the aortic leakage according
      to its different modes of quantification (ultrasound and MRI). The aim of the study will be
      to show that diastolic reflux in the left subclavian artery is a marker of severe AI (grades
      2 and 3) by comparing this regurgitation with that measured at the level of the aortic arch
      and other validated ultrasound criteria and cardiac MRI.

    <description>The TransThoracic Echocardiography imaging data are collected exactly as for a standard examination. However, an additional measurement of the flow at the level of the left subclavian artery is performed, resulting in a 10-minute increase in the examination time. A Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging 4D Flow is programmed within a maximum of 10 (no change in treatment that could skew the comparison). The usual procedure for MRI is not modified. The examination allows the acquisition of conventional 2D sequences of flow measurements, regurgitant volume and regurgitation fraction obtained at the level of the descending aorta and the sino-tubular junction of the ascending aorta. An additional 4D sequence is acquired increasing the examination time by 10 minutes.</description>
