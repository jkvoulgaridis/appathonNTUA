      In the literature, the relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity has been
      assessed in a few studies without discrimination between women and men.In this study, it was
      aimed to evaluate the relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity in women with
      Behçet's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are only a few studies in the literature evaluating the association of fibromyalgia
      with disease activity and clinical findings in Behçet's disease. In the literature, the
      relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity has been assessed without
      discrimination between women and men. Behçet's disease is more active in men and fibromyalgia
      is more frequent in women. Evaluating the relationship between fibromyalgia and disease
      activity in Behçet's disease without gender discrimination may not be objective.There is not
      any study in literature evaluating relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity in
      women with Behçet's disease.In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between
      fibromyalgia and disease activity in women with Behçet's disease.

    <measure>Fibromyalgia 2013 criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fibromyalgia 2013 criteria were derived from the 10-item symptom score from the Symptom Impact Questionnaire (SIQR) symptoms and the 28-area pain location inventory (PLI). If the patients PLI score is above 17 (range 0-28) and an SIQR symptom score is above 21 (range 0-50), the participant will be diagnosed with fibromyalgia</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behcet's disease current activity form</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve items on the Behcet's disease current activity form, a potential unidimensional scale, will be used for the analysis as well as the two questions which assess disease activity from the patient's and clinician's perspective. These items are: a Likert scale, represented by 'smiley' faces ranging from very bad to very good, to indicate how the patient or the clinician felt the disease had been over the past 4 weeks, and the presence or absence (over the last 4 weeks prior to the clinic visit) of arthralgia, arthritis, diarrhoea, erythema nodosum, eye inflammation, genital ulcers, headaches, mouth ulcers, nausea/vomiting, new central nervous system involvement, new major vessel inflammation, and pustules.</description>
