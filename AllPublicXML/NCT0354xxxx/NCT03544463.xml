      A Prospective, Self-controlled, First-night Order Cross-over and Evaluator-blind Pivotal
      Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of iNAP® Sleep Therapy System in Adults with
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) impacts sleep quality of patients, which contributes
      significantly to hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction and other health problems.
      Intraoral devices, such as tongue retaining devices, palatal lifting devices and mandibular
      repositioning devices designed to increase the patency of the airway and to decrease airway
      obstruction, are used to treat OSA. To this end, the investigators are conducting a
      prospective, self-controlled, first-night order cross-over and evaluator-blind pivotal study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iNAP® Sleep Therapy System (iNAP®), a tongue and soft
      palate retaining intraoral device, in adults with OSA.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>iNAP®-treated response rate over the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)*</measure>
    <time_frame>first treatment night</time_frame>
    <description>*AHI is the number of apnea/hypopnea events divided by total sleep time (TST), i.e., the number of hours of sleep. The reduction rate of AHI is calculated by dividing the AHI reduction on the Tx PSG Study when compared to the Baseline PSG Study with individual baseline AHI. An AHI reduction rate of 50% is considered responsive, namely, responder. Therefore, an overall ratio of responder to the primary endpoint cohort is the response rate.</description>

    <description>The iNAP® provides a pressure gradient within the oral cavity, which pulls the tongue toward the upper palate and pulls the soft palate forward in a way that enhances the patency of the upper airway near the pharynx so that upper airway patency can be maintained to prevent sleep-disordered breathing.</description>
