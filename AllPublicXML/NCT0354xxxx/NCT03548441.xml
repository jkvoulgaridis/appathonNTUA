  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of low back and leg pain in elderly
      impacting physical activity and quality of life. Initial treatments are non-surgical options.
      If unsuccessful, surgery is advocated. The literature is not clear as to the outcome of
      surgery when compared to non-surgical treatment, and the optimal time for surgery is not
      explicit.

      Materials and analysis: This observational study is designed to investigate the course of
      treatment, compare effectiveness of surgical and non-surgical treatment in patients with
      lumbar spinal stenosis, and identify prognostic factors for outcome in the context of current
      clinical practice. Prospectively registered data on treatment, outcome and patient
      characteristics are collected from nationwide registers on health and social issues, a
      clinical registry of people with chronic back pain and hospital medical records. Primary
      outcome is change in physical function measured by the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire.
      Secondary outcomes are changes in symptom severity, pain-related function, health-related
      quality of life, and general self-efficacy. All outcomes are measured at baseline, 6 months
      and 12 months follow up. Comparisons on these variables will be made between those who
      undergo surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis and those not receiving surgery at 12 months
      follow up according to different analysis populations. Prognostic factors include treatment
      allocation, back and leg pain intensity, comorbidity, duration of symptoms, pre-treatment
      function, self-rated health, income, general self-efficacy and magnetic resonance imaging
      graded compression of central stenosis.

      Ethics and dissemination: The study has been evaluated by The Regional Committees on Health
      Research for Southern Denmark (S-20172000-200) and notified to the Danish Data Protection
      Agency (17/30636). All participants provide consent. Findings will be disseminated in
      peer-reviewed publications and presented at national and international conferences following
      the guidance from the STROBE and PROGRESS statement. Potential sources of bias will be
      addressed using ROBINS-I.

    <description>Change in physical function score in the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).
The ZCQ is a condition-specific self-reported measure of symptom severity, physical function and satisfaction with treatment in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
The questionnaire is composed of three domains (subscales) with a Likert-type scale.
The physical function subscale includes 6 items addressing walking distance and walking ability. All but one item have Likert response scales with 4 categories.
The physical function subscale score is calculated from the unweighted mean of all answered items.
The possible range of the score is 1 to 4.
Lower scores indicate less disability.</description>

    <description>Change in symptom severity score in the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).
The ZCQ is a condition-specific self-reported measure of symptom severity, physical function and satisfaction with treatment in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
The questionnaire is composed of three domains (subscales) with a Likert-type scale.
The symptom severity subscale includes 7 items addressing pain, numbness, weakness and balance disturbances. All but one item have Likert response scales with 5 categories.
The possible range of the score is 1 to 5.
Lower scores express less symptom severity.</description>

    <description>Change in Oswestry Disability Index collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).
The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a region-specific questionnaire for assessing self-reported levels of disability for patients with spinal disorders.
The questionnaire contains 10 pain related sections (items) with 6 response options (statements). Each section of six response options is scored from 0 (no pain) to 5 (most severe pain).
For each section of six statements the total score is 5; if the first statement is marked, the score equals 0; if the last (6th) statement is marked, the score equals 5. If more than one box is marked in each section, the highest score is used.
The section scores are summarised to a total score, ranging from 0-100. Scores are expressed as a percentage of total points.
Lower scores indicate less disability.</description>

    <description>Change in health related quality of life measured by EQ-5D-3L collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).
The EQ-5D-3L is a generic self-reported instrument for measuring health-related quality of life consisting of a descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), each with 3 response options.
These are converted into a single summary index by applying preference weights obtained from the general population with a total score ranging from -0.6 to 1, where 1 corresponds to perfect health and 0 to death.
Higher scores indicate better health related quality of life,
The EQ VAS is a vertical, visual analogue scale scoring patients self-rated health ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).
Higher scores indicate better self-perceived health.</description>

    <description>Change in general self-efficacy score obtained by the General Self Efficacy Scale collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).
The General Self efficacy scale is a self-reported unidimensional measure of general sense of perceived self-efficacy designed for the general adult population and used in patients with chronic pain.
The questionnaire comprises of 10 items (statements) with 4 response options. Responses are scored on a 4-point Likert-scale from 1 (not true at all) to 4 (exactly true).
Responses of all 10 items are summarised to yield the final composite score with a range from 10 - 40 points.
Higher scores express greater perceived self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Charlson comorbidity index as potential prognostic factor / confounder collected from nationwide registers.
The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorising comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes found in administrative data, such as a national patient registry.
Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the relative risk of 1-year mortality. The sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient.
An index score of 0 indicates that no comorbidities were found.
A higher index score indicates a higher risk of death within 1 year.</description>

    <description>Potential prognostic factor / confounder collected from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) descriptions in hospital medical records.
MRI graded compression is estimated using a classification ranging from mild to moderate or severe stenosis.
Mild stenosis is defined as narrowing of one-third of the normal area or less, moderate stenosis as narrowing of between one- and two-thirds, and severe stenosis as narrowing of more than two-thirds of the area.</description>
