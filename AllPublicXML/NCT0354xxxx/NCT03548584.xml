    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      fixed-dose trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole
      compared with placebo. The trial consists of a 12-week double-blind treatment period with a
      30 day follow-up. The trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and
      90 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are
      residing either in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where
      the subject is not living alone. This trial will analyze data gathered from 225 subjects at
      multiple countries. Subjects may also be eligible to enter an active extension trial,
      following completion of this trial.

    <measure>Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to Week 12; assesses frequency of agitated behaviors in elderly persons. The scale consists of 29 agitated behaviors that are further categorized into distinct agitation syndromes, also known as CMAI factors of agitation. Each of the agitated behaviors are scored 1 (never) to 7 (several times an hours), with the total scale score ranging from 29 to 203. The higher the value, the more frequent an agitated behavior has occurred.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 12, as related to agitation. CGI-S will be used to rate the severity of agitation. Score ranges from 0 (not assessed) to 7 (among the most extremely ill subjects). The higher the value, the more severe the agitation.</description>
