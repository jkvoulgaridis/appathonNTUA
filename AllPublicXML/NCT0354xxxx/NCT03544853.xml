      The overall goal of this study is to further develop and clinically assess a computational
      and data-driven design and manufacturing framework for mechanical interfaces that
      quantitatively produces transtibial prosthetic sockets in a faster and more cost-effective
      way than conventional processes. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that a socket,
      designed using the novel computational design framework, is equivalent to, or better than, a
      conventional socket (designed by a prosthetist) in terms of: 1) skin contact pressures, 2)
      gait symmetry, 3) walking metabolic cost, 4) skin irritation levels as assessed by the
      dermatologist, and 5) comfort as evaluated from a questionnaire.

      Title: Computational Design, Fabrication, and Evaluation of Optimized Patient-Specific
      Transtibial Prosthetic Sockets

      Principle investigator: Dr. Hugh Herr

      Background: The overall goal of this application is to further develop and clinically assess
      a computational and data-driven design and manufacturing framework for mechanical interfaces
      that quantitatively produces transtibial prosthetic sockets in a faster and more
      cost-effective way than conventional processes. Traditionally, prosthetic socket production
      has been a craft activity, based primarily on the experience of the prosthetist. Even with
      advances in computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), the design
      process remains manual. The manual nature of the process means it is non-repeatable and
      currently largely non-data-driven, and quantitative data is either not obtained or
      insufficiently employed. Furthermore, discomfort, skin problems and pressure ulcer formation
      remain prevalent. Through the proposed computational modeling framework, a repeatable,
      data-driven and patient-specific design process is made available which is based on
      scientific rationale.

      Objective/hypothesis: The main hypothesis of this proposal is that a socket, designed using
      the novel computational design framework, is equivalent to, or better than, a conventional
      socket (designed by a prosthetist) in terms of: 1) skin contact pressures, 2) gait symmetry,
      3) walking metabolic cost, 4) skin irritation levels as assessed by the dermatologist, and 5)
      comfort as evaluated from a questionnaire. Our hypothesis is supported by the presented pilot
      data which shows reduced or equivalent skin contact pressures and subject reported comfort
      levels for several critical anatomical regions.

      Specific Aims: 1) Subject-specific biomechanical modeling for N=18 subjects, 2) Computational
      design and fabrication of sockets for N=18 subjects, and 3) Clinical evaluation of novel
      sockets for N=18 subjects.

      Study Design: A cohort of 18 subjects will be recruited for this study. MRI data will be
      recorded for all subjects. Through image segmentation geometrically accurate 3D finite
      element analysis (FEA) models will be constructed. Further, non-invasive indentation testing
      will be performed which, through combination with inverse FEA, provides accurate
      subject-specific mechanical properties for all subjects. The resulting predictive FEA models
      will then be used in a novel, data-driven, and automated computational design framework for
      prosthetic sockets, to design prosthetic sockets for all subjects. The framework optimizes
      the socket designs, as assessed by skin contact pressures and internal tissue strain, through
      iterative adjustment of the virtual tests sockets. Final designs are subsequently 3D printed.
      To evaluate the prosthetic sockets with each of the subjects each subject will do a standing
      and walking exercise using their conventional sockets or the novel sockets. Meanwhile skin
      contact forces, walking metabolic cost, and gait symmetry are recorded. After the exercises,
      skin irritation will be assessed by a dermatologist, and socket comfort is assessed using a
      questionnaire. Together this data provides a quantitative and qualitative evaluation and
      comparison of the novel and conventional sockets.

    <description>Local skin contact pressures (in Newton per square meter) are assessed using pressure sensors positioned on the skin surface. Local pressures relate to comfort which is the topic of investigation. These measurements are performed during the (clinical) socket comfort evaluation phase which is typically 3 months after the initial data acquisition phase for each subject. Measurements take place once and in a single session. As such only a single time point is investigated (the time point of the experiment is not a relevant or investigated parameter). The data is compared across subjects and socket types.</description>

    <measure>Metabolic energy consumption while walking with a socket</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed once during (clinical) socket comfort evaluation phase (typically 3 months after subject enrollment). Measurements are for standing and walking exercises for the conventional and novel socket.</time_frame>
    <description>Socket fit (and discomfort) influences musculoskeletal behavior and therefore metabolic cost (energy consumption levels). For metabolic cost analysis subjects are equipped with a breath-by-breath portable telemetric system (Model K4b2, COSMED, Rome, Italy). These measurements are performed during the (clinical) socket comfort evaluation phase which is typically 3 months after the initial data acquisition phase for each subject. Measurements take place once and in a single session. As such only a single time point is investigated (the time point of the experiment is not a relevant or investigated parameter). The data is compared across subjects and socket types.</description>

    <measure>Gait parameter asymmetry</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed once during (clinical) socket comfort evaluation phase (typically 3 months after subject enrollment). Measurements are for standing and walking exercises for the conventional and novel socket.</time_frame>
    <description>Socket fit (and discomfort) influences musculoskeletal behavior and may alter gait patterns. Subjects are equipped with markers tracked (units of mm) using a motion capture system (T40s, Vicon Motion Systems Ltd, Oxford, UK). Ground reaction forces (units Newton) are also recorded. From these measurements gait symmetry indices for: joint angles, positions, torques, and ground reaction forces, are computed. These measurements are performed during the (clinical) socket comfort evaluation phase which is typically 3 months after the initial data acquisition phase for each subject. Measurements take place once and in a single session. As such only a single time point is investigated (the time point of the experiment is not a relevant or investigated parameter). The data is compared across subjects and socket types.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Socket evaluation questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed once during (clinical) socket comfort evaluation phase (typically 3 months after subject enrollment). The questionaire is filled out after the standing and walking experiments are completed.</time_frame>
    <description>Socket fit and discomfort is also assessed using a questionnaire (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.61310). Subjects fill out their answers by freely drawing a mark on a horizontal line at a desired level for each of the questions (eg left=0 right=100). This method allows for post-processing based conversion of the input to numerical data (i.e. 0-100 %) and lacks biases associated with constrained integer number input. These measurements are performed during the (clinical) socket comfort evaluation phase which is typically 3 months after the initial data acquisition phase for each subject. Measurements take place once and in a single session. As such only a single time point is investigated (the time point of the experiment is not a relevant or investigated parameter). The data is compared across subjects and socket types.</description>
