  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition has long been linked to postoperative complications and adverse outcomes in a
      variety of surgical fields , such as increased susceptibility to infection, delayed wound
      healing, and increased frequency of decubitus ulcers. In particular, it is a modifiable risk
      factor, as evident by studies that have associated optimization of preoperative nutrition
      with improved surgical outcomes. Therefore, it is important to identify these patients who
      are at risk so that appropriate nutritional support can be implemented.

      A range of options for nutritional status assessment have been proposed; a comprehensive
      assessment may include measurements of dietary intake, clinical assessment, anthropometric
      measurements, and biochemical measurements of serum protein, micronutrients and metabolic
      parameters . Many of the signs of malnutrition, however, only manifest in extreme cases. Thus
      it is crucial to identify sensitive markers that can be utilized to screen for clinical as
      well as subclinical malnutrition patients.

      In orthopaedic patients, the prevalence of clinical and subclinical malnutrition has been
      reported to be up to 42.4%. Common markers of malnutrition that have been studied include low
      serum albumin as a marker of protein status, low total lymphocyte count (TLC), and
      excessively high or low body mass index (BMI). They have been compared against various
      adverse surgical outcomes, including surgical site infections (SSI), delayed wound healing,
      unplanned intubation and ICU admission , postoperative anemia and cardiac complications , and
      length of hospital stay. However, conflicting results have been reported; for example, while
      hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin &lt;3.5mg/dL) have been associated with increased risk of SSI and
      longer than average hospital stay, its effect on wound healing is less clear - Marin et al.
      reported no significant predictive value of hypoalbuminemia on wound healing, yet Greene et
      al. reported a 5-time increase in frequency of major wound complication.

      The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to identify biomarkers of malnutrition in
      patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that are predictive of adverse
      in-hospital postoperative complications, which would facilitate the identification of at risk
      patients for nutritional optimization before surgery.

      Six-hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent elective TKA between 2013 and 2017 in the
      Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong were reviewed; the preoperative serum albumin, TLC, and
      BMI were compared against in-hospital postoperative complications.
