      This is a phase II clinical trial that seeks to use Cabozantinib to treat those with
      Metastatic Colorectal Cancer who have not previously responded to treatment. This study is a
      two stage study that will first measure (up to) 16 patients' progression free survival (PFS).
      Stage two will, again, measure PFS, but in a population (up to) 28 patients.
