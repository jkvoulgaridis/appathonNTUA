  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint is to evaluate the sensitivities and specificities for diagnosis of
      sleep apnoea of a wearable sleep diagnosis technology vs. existing gold standard.

  <detailed_description>

      The clinical investigation will be performed at the Royal Free London Hospital. Physiological
      signals will be pseudo-anonymized and only viewed by the research team.

      The Study will involve patients who will have been referred for diagnosis of sleep apnoea,
      will aim to determine AcuPebble's positive and negative predictive ratios, sensitivities as
      specificities. Likelihood ratios for diagnosis of sleep apnoea. Clinical experts will
      determine patients' diagnostic information using the current diagnostic standards. AcuPebble
      will also generate diagnostic results independently and automatically. Both set of results
      will be subsequently compared and the relevant performance metrics listed above will be
      determined.

      Consecutive patients referred for sleep study will be recruited to the study. Patients that
      are willing to participate will be consented on the day of their sleep study and sent home
      with both - the Trusts usual multichannel polygraphy and the Acupebble.
