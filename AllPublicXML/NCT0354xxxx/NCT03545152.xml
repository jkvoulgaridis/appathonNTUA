      This project is proposed to be a three-year project. The purposes of this project are to
      develop and examine physical activity program, cognitive rehabilitation training, and new
      life-style (combination of exercise and cognitive) interventions on primary outcomes
      (cognitive function), and secondary outcomes (physical fitness, QOL and depression) among
      community-dwelling elderly adults with MCI.

      Aim. develop and examine physical activity program, cognitive rehabilitation training, and
      new life-style (combination of exercise and cognitive) interventions on primary outcomes
      (cognitive function), and secondary outcomes (physical fitness, QOL and depression) among
      community-dwelling elderly adults with MCI.

      Background. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common clinical syndrome that identifies
      people at high risk of developing dementia, and the prevalence range from 7.7 to 51.7%.
      Although treatments for MCI are currently unavailable, preliminary evidence has identified
      potential neuro-protective effects of exercise program and cognitive rehabilitation, which
      may lead to improved outcomes. However, the design and delivery of an appropriate program for
      people with MCI is challenging for having physical, psychological, cognitive, and social
      barriers.

      Design. A prospective randomized control trial. We developed a Physical activity
      stage-matched intervention (SMI) (1st year), cognitive rehabilitation (2nd year) and New
      lifestyle program

    <measure>Taiwan version of Prospectiv and Retrospective Memory Questionaire (PRMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>5min</time_frame>
    <description>There are 11 items and include general memory and prospective memory sections for analysis the type and frequency of memory problem in elders' daily live. Items are posed in likert scale ranges from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The total score may range from 11-55. A higher score indicates a higher level of memory impaired.</description>

    <measure>Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>10min</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) is a balance tool that was originally developed for use in the institutionalized, older adult population and contains both a balance and a gait component (Tinetti, 1986). The test comprises 16 items (9 balance-related items and 7 gait-related items), with the highest achievable score being 28 points</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3min</time_frame>
    <description>A short-form Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) that consisted of 15 questions was the primary outcome measure (Sheikh and Yesavage, 1986). Scores of 0-4 are considered normal; 5-8 indicates mild depression; 9-11 indicates moderate depression; and 12-15 indicates severe depression. The Chinese version of the GDS-15 demonstrates high reliability (Liao et al., 2005); in this study, the Cronbach's Î± is .91.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8min</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure quality of life. This 36-item questionnaire assesses health-related functions for eight distinct domains, which can be divided into physical component and mental component scales. Subsequent to summing the Likert-scaled items in the SF-36 survey, scores in each scale are standardized so that they each range from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>The exercise program will include instructions on how to read the program, complete the activities, record their sessions, and exercise safely at first day. To promote incorporating exercising in their daily life routine during the 24-week period, we provided 2 group-based (5-8 participants with 2 instructors at community centers, 60' each) and one home-based (with the exercise program VCD and manual to bring home, 30') exercise program.</description>
