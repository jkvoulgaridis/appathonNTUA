      What Comes After Fulvestrant? A Real World Multicenter Retrospective Study-Treatment After
      Progression of Fulvestrant Among Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no evidence of treatment after progression of Ful. We retrospectively evaluated HR+,
      HER2- MBC patients failed on Ful 500mg as first line or second line therapy from 2014 to 2017
      in 6 institutions. Treatment pattern, PFS, OS and safety were analyzed to figure out the
      situation and efficacy of treatment after Fulvestrant.
