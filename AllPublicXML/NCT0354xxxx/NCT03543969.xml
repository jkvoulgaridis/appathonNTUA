  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of using adaptive intermittent dosing of
      vemurafenib and cobimetinib in BRAF mutant patients with elevated baseline lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH).

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intermittent adaptive dosing of
      vemurafenib and cobimetinib may be superior to standard, continuous dosing with these study
      drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vemurafenib and cobimetinib are already U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for
      the treatment of BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma; however, melanoma often develops resistance
      to these drugs over time, and the tumors start to re-grow. Investigators will use the
      participant's LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels obtained from routine blood work, along with
      CT scans to decide when to hold or resume their study treatment. Investigators hypothesize
      that this type of dosing schedule with vemurafenib and cobimetinib may potentially delay the
      time to progression and re-growth of their melanoma.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have cytologically or histologically-confirmed unresectable melanoma that harbors
             a BRAF V600 mutation determined by pyrosequencing assay or equivalent genotyping assay
             in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory, meeting
             one of the following American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging
             criteria: a.) AJCC stage IV (Tany, Nany, M1a(1), M1b(1), M1c(1) or M1d(1)); b.) AJCC
             stage IIIC (at least N2b) or IIID with unresectable nodal/locoregional involvement.

          -  Must have serum LDH &gt; institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) at time of study
             enrollment.

          -  Must have adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function. There are no specific
             minimum criteria for enrollment; this will at the discretion of the treating
