  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer (TC), the most common malignancy of the endocrine system, is currently the
      fifth most common malignancy diagnosed in women (1). The incidence of TC in the United States
      has increased by an average of 3% per year over the past 4 decades. Much progress has been
      made in exploring the etiology and pathogenesis of thyroid cancer, while the exact etiology
      remains unknown, TC is thought to arise from interactions between genetic susceptibility
      factors, epigenetic effects, and various environmental factors. Besides the improvement of
      diagnosis, TC increasing incidence emphasize that other important factors such as the
      environment play an important role in disease pathogenesis. While microbiota as an
      environment factor to some cancers accept widespread attention, if microbiota also as a risk
      factor for TC, it is worthy to be considered.

      Thyroid cancer (TC), the most common malignancy of the endocrine system, is currently the
      fifth most common malignancy diagnosed in women (1). The incidence of TC in the United States
      has increased by an average of 3% per year over the past 4 decades. According to the China
      National Cancer Registry data in 2015 (3), there were estimated 90,000 new TC cases in China,
      and its incidence has risen sharply. Much progress has been made in exploring the etiology
      and pathogenesis of thyroid cancer, while the exact etiology remains unknown, TC is thought
      to arise from interactions between genetic susceptibility factors, epigenetic effects, and
      various environmental factors. Besides the improvement of diagnosis, TC increasing incidence
