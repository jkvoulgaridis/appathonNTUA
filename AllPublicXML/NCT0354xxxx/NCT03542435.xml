  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study
      conducted at one study center in the United States. Safety and tolerability will be assessed
      throughout the study and serial blood samples and urine samples will be collected for the
      safety and pharmacokinetic assessment of SXC-2023.
