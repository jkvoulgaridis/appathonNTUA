  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional Phase II/III, single center, single arm clinical trial to assess
      the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and tolerance of daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir in
      treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic adolescents with chronic HCV GT-4 infection.

      A single-arm evaluation of daclatasvir/sofosbuvir will focus on the pharmacokinetics,
      efficacy and safety

      All enrolled patients will receive daclatasvir 60 mg orally once daily plus sofosbuvir at a
      dose of 400 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks.

      This is an interventional Phase II/III, single center, single arm clinical trial to assess
      the pharmacokinetics efficacy, safety, and tolerance of daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir in
      treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic adolescents with chronic HCV GT-4 infection.

      A single-arm evaluation of daclatasvir/sofosbuvir will focus on the efficacy, safety and
      pharmacokinetics, confirm the favorable pharmacological profile.

      All enrolled patients will receive daclatasvir 60 mg orally once daily plus sofosbuvir at a
      dose of 400 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks.

      Patients will be followed closely for disease progression and any hypersensitivity or adverse
      reactions due to therapy. Laboratory values to be monitored at baseline: Serum creatinine,
      bilirubin, AST, ALT, HCV viral load (VL).

      Fifty patients will be included; the first twenty patients will be candidates for
      pharmacokinetic assessment. All patients (50), will be candidates for safety and efficacy
      assessment after verifying the PK results ''phase II''. Patients will be recruited at Ain
      Shams University hospitals, Egypt. The study will be conducted after approval of the
      corresponding research ethical committee and obtaining an informed consent from the
      parents/guardians and an assent from the patients.

      Patients will be requested to come for 2 screening visits, at the first day of therapy,
      weekly during the first four weeks, at the end of week 8 and week 12. Patients who will
      complete their treatment schedule will be scheduled for a visit after 12 weeks from end of
      therapy for assessment of sustained virological response (SVR). The total number of visits
      are 9. Duration of follow up will be 24 weeks from treatment initiation in addition to the
      screening period (2-4 weeks).

    <description>Blood samples (3 mL) will be collected to measure dactalasvir concentrations from pediatric patients using a nine-point plasma schedule (pre-dose, 0.5,1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h post-dose) on day 8 of therapy.
(This will be a total of 27 mL/patient, which is well below the maximum allowed internationally recognized value of blood loss is 2.4mL/kg in a 4 month period. Any deviations from nominal sampling times should be recorded.

    <description>Daclatasvir is a DAAs that can inhibit the HCV non-structural (NS) 5A protein when used in combination with other HCV-therapies. It has a linear, non-time-dependent pharmacokinetic profile and nanomolar potency in vitro against HCV genotypes 1-6. It is excreted primarily via faeces, about 88% in an unchanged form while renal excretion accounts for approximately 7% of its elimination.
DOSE OF SOFOSBUVIR: 400 mg tablet orally once daily with food (in the morning) for 12 weeks for adolescents with liver fibrosis Metavir score F0-F2.
DOSE OF DACLTASVIR: 60 mg tablet orally once daily with food (in the morning) for 12 weeks for adolescents with liver fibrosis Metavir score F0-F2.</description>
