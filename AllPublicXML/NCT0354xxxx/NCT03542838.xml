      This study is to evaluate the safety of resiniferatoxin administered intra-articularly to
      subjects with moderate to severe knee pain due to osteoarthritis (OA). It is also to assess
      the preliminary efficacy of resiniferatoxin to relieve knee pain when walking.

    <masking_description>Except for the sentinel subject, the treatment assigned to each subject in the dose-escalation cohorts is blinded to the subject, investigators, and sponsor study team. The sentinel subject, the first subject in each dose-escalation cohort, is dosed with resiniferatoxin in an open-label fashion. Subjects in the dose-escalation cohorts who received placebo may receive resiniferatoxin in an open-label fashion after unblinding. All subjects in the dose-expansion cohorts are dosed with resiniferatoxin in an open-label fashion.</masking_description>
