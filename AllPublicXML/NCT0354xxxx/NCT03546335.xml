      This is a single center exploratory imaging study investigating the initial application of
      89Zr-DFO-CZP PET in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with active symptoms of RA
      or signs on physical exam will be invited to participate for PET imaging. Study 1 is a dose
      finding study that will involve a single 89Zr-DFO-CZP PET scan acquired ~24 hours following a
      single administration of the radiopharmaceutical. The first 2 patients will receive 1 mCi of
      89Zr-DFO-CZP. Subsequent groups of two patients will receive 0.5 mCi decrease or increase
      dose (up to 2 mCi) to determine the acceptable optimal imaging dose. After receiving the
      dose, participants will undergo 4 serial whole body PET scans between 2 hours and 120 hours
      after dose administration. Several blood samples will also be collected over this time
      period, for dosimetry analysis.
