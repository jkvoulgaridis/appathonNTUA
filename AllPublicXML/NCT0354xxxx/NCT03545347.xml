  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial investigates the preliminary effect and safety of a 12 week multi-modal
      intervention initiated during admission in the acute ward after hip fracture surgery. The
      intervention under investigation is a combination therapy consisting of physiotherapy,
      protein-rich nutritional supplement and nandrolone decanoate (Deca-Durabolin) supplement. The
      investigators expect the combination therapy to be a preliminary effective and safe treatment
      in elderly patients with hip fracture and that this combination therapy intervention program
      is more efficacious in improving muscle strength, and physical function 14 weeks after hip
      fracture surgery, compared to physiotherapy, protein-rich nutritional supplement plus
      placebo.
