  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to investigate the functional, biochemical, and gene
      expression effects of Interferon-gamma 1-b (IFN-γ) on the neutrophils of patients with
      Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). The investigators hypothesize that the clinical effects
      demonstrated in patients with CGD treated with IFN-γ (decreased number and severity of
      infections) are the result of biochemical processes and upregulation of specific genes, which
      lead to enhanced functionality of this immune cell population.

        The Investigators plan to enroll children and adults, aged 5-60 years with CGD defined by
        functional and biochemical or genetic testing. Enrollment will be stratified by the four
        main variants: X-linked, gp91phox deficient patients, and autosomal recessive CGD (p47phox
        deficient, p67phox deficient, and p22phox deficient patients).
