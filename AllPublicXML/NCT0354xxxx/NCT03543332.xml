      The Target Temperature Management trial 2 (TTM2) is an international multi-center study, that
      randomize patients with OHCA of a presumed cardiac or unknown cause to target temperature
      management at 33°C or normothermia but avoiding fever (37.8°C) for the first 24 hours after
      the OHCA. The TTM2 study (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT02908308) includes a detailed
      follow-up of functional outcome, health-related quality of life and neurocognitive function
      at 6 and 24 months post-arrest. This protocol describes a sub-study within the TTM2 trial
      that specifically focus on physical activity among the OHCA survivors.

      At this follow-up physical activity will be evaluated by self-reported questions based on the
      recommended levels from American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart
      Association for physical activity and physical training for secondary prevention after
      myocardial infarction The first aim of this sub-study is to investigate the validity of two
      self-reported questions on physical activity. The second aim is to explore kinesiophobia
      among OHCA-survivors.

        Surviving patients in the TTM2-trial are invited to a structured face-to-face follow-up
        visit at 180 days (+/- 2 weeks). Survivors at selected sites will be invited to an extended
        study on physical activity at their follow-up visit.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The TTM2 main trial includes adult, unconscious patients with sustained return of
             spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest of a presumed cardiac origin. The aim is
             to include 100-150 OHCA-survivors to the sub-study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An exclusion criterion for the TTM2 main trial is an unwitnessed cardiac arrest with
             initial rhythm asystole, temperature at admission &lt;30°C, on extracorporeal membrane
             oxygenation (ECMO) prior to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), obvious or
             suspected pregnancy, intracranial bleeding and/or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease (COPD) on home oxygen.

        An additional exclusion criterion for the sub-study is the inability to speak the local
        language well enough to complete the test without an interpreter. Patients with major
        cognitive impairment, patients sitting in a wheel chair, Clinical Frailty Score 8 or 9
        (very severely frail or terminally ill), active drug abuse and when a face-to face
        follow-up is not possible will also be excluded.
