      A randomized controlled clinical and RSA study, comparing 2 knee implants:

        1. NexGen CR cemented total knee arthroplasty

        2. Persona CR cemented total knee arthroplasty

      3 hospitals will participate in the study:

        -  Helse Bergen HF, Kysthospitalet i Hagavik (KIH)

        -  Helse Førde HF, Lærdal sykehus

        -  Helse Bergen HF, Haukeland universitetssykehus (HUS) 1-3 surgeons in each hospital will
           perform the operations. There will be 80 patients in the 2 groups; a total of 160 study
           patients will be included. 30 in each group will be included for RSA. Radiostereometric
           analysis (RSA) will be used to measure migration and subsidence of components in
           addition to regular radiographs.

           3 different knee scoring systems will be used to evaluate satisfaction and function. An
           activity monitor will be used to assess real-life physical behavior and walking speed to
           assess objectively measured mobility.

      Data from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register will be used to investigate the risk of
      revision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple factors may affect the outcome of total knee arthroplasty (1-5), and the patient
      satisfaction has been reported up to 90% (6). Also the physical behavior of a person may
      affect how much strain that is put on the prosthesis after surgery. Whether more strain is
      caused by a more physically active profile or by a more sedentary profile is uncertain.
      Obtaining real-life information about physical behavior is therefore important, and is made
      possible by using activity monitors measuring physical behavior continuously over longer
      time-periods.

      The National Arthroplasty Registers worldwide has extensive data on knee and hip implants
      used over several years. Some are documented over 20 years, whereas newer implants appear
      with shorter follow-up. The Norwegian Arthroplasty Register has a registration completeness
      of 96% in the 2015 annual report (7).

      NexGen is a total knee arthroplasty implant that has been used at great numbers in numerous
      countries and is well documented in several registries (Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register,
      Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry).

      Persona is a new implant from the same company that produces NexGen, with several changes and
      modernizations regarding instrumentation and surgical technique. There are a wider range of
      sizes available, both on the tibia and femur, as well as the menisceal insert. This should
      allow optimized component fit and less compromise on soft tissue balancing. The tibia is
      anatomical, with a more medialized keel stem, which should allow for a more accurate fit
      securing less risk of malrotation and better fixation.

      The tibial component in the new Persona design, is anatomical, to achieve a better fit than
      in the old design. Additionally it facilitates proper rotation of the tibia. When a larger
      surface of bone is covered, it is expected a lesser risk of subsidence and early loosening of
      the implant. The new Persona also has a Vitamin E Highly Crosslinked polyethylene insert
      option for lower wear and improved strength than the regular polyethylene. However, the
      advent of newer highly crosslinked polyethylene has shown improved wear rates in hip
      arthroplasty, but not to the same degree in knee arthroplasty (8, 9). The investigators
      therefore will use conventional polyethylene in this study.

      In theory, the new design will lessen the compromises experienced today with the older
      designs. There have been no independent studies published yet to prove this possible
      improvement.

      Most countries with well-functioning joint registers are cautious in implementing new designs
      without studies comparing the new implant to older established implants. There have been
      several examples of unsuccessful joint replacements introduced to the market without thorough
      clinical investigation and trials, the hip resurfacing surgery being an example of this (10,
      11). In Norway, the regional tender process usually demands either 10 years follow-up in
      clinical or registry studies or alternatively 2 or 5 years RSA studies.

      Examples of previous randomized controlled clinical and RSA study where members of our study
      group have participated and been project leader (12-16).

      AIMS OF THE STUDY

        1. To compare the clinical outcome scores in the 4 study groups o KSS (Knee Society Score)

             -  KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score)

             -  EQ 5D

             -  FJS12 (Forgotten Joint Score 12)

             -  Walking speed (4-m static walking speed test)

             -  Objective monitoring of free-living physical behaviour (ActivPAL activity monitor)

             -  Anchor questions

        2. To assess the migration patterns of the components with main focus on the tibia using
           RSA. Our hypothesis is that early stability of the new Persona is improved with better
           coverage of the bone plateau. Early stability corresponds to clinical performance at
           medium term (17, 18).

        3. To evaluate revision rates using the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register

      DOCUMENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS

      The NexGen CR implant has been well documented, as mentioned, in the last decades as
      excellent total knee implants (7, 19, 20).

      The Persona knee has just recently been introduced to the market as a more personalized
      implant. The improvements with comprehensive sizing and side-specific kinematics have not yet
      been investigated independently in studies to our knowledge.

      160 patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups with 80 in each group, and 30 of the 80
      in each group will be randomized for RSA.

      CLINICAL EVALUATION

      Clinical evaluation will be performed by independent physiotherapists preoperatively, using
      EQ5D, Knee Society Score (KSS) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The
      scoring will be performed by a physiotherapist who is blinded with respect to the assigned
      study group, and by the patients themselves. An orthopaedic surgeon is consulted in the case
      of specific clinical problems.

      The patients will be examined again at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years with EQ5D, KSS, KOOS, Forgotten
      Joint Score 12 (FJS12) and Anchor questions.

      Preferred walking speed will be measured by timing a 4-meter walk with a stopwatch.
      Instructions will be given to &quot;walk in your preferred speed&quot; Preferred walking speed has been
      found valid, reliable, sensitive and specific, and correlates with functional ability and
      balance confidence (21). Walking speed has also been found to be a consistent predictor of
      adverse outcomes in different populations (22). Walking speed will be measured at pre-op, 3
      months post-op and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post-op.

      The ActivPAL3TM (AP) (PAL technologies Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland) will be used to record
      free-living physical behavior. The AP is a small, light-weight, three axis accelerometer that
      will be attached to the anterior aspect of the participants thigh with a hydrogel adhesive
      (PALStickiesTM, PAL technologies Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland) and covered by waterproof band aid
      to allow for showering. The AP will be worn continuously 24 h/day to provide seven
      uninterrupted free-living days of physical behavior data. The participant will be asked to go
      about their usual activities. A proprietary software-package (PAL Professional) will be used
      to process acceleration data, and classify the free-living physical activity in sedentary
      (sitting and lying) and upright (standing and walking) postures, number of transitions from
      sitting to standing, and number of steps during walking. It has been found that the AP has
      good accuracy for detecting postures and counting steps during walking in non-impaired people
      (23-25) and community-dwelling non-impaired elderly (26). It has been found that the AP also
      was a highly valid measure of postures and transitions in elderly with walking impairments
      including patients post-stroke. Step counting however, was less accurate for this sample
      underestimating steps at very slow walking speeds &lt;0.47 m/s (27). The AP monitor will be
      given to the participant at pre-op, 3 months post-op and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post-op. After
      one week recording the participants will be asked to send the monitor back to the research
      team in a pre-paid envelope.

      RADIOGRAPHY

      • Standard x-rays

        -  Preoperatively and at all followup consultations, x-rays will be taken as
           Anteroposterior (AP) and Mediolateral (ML) views. In addition long axis view (HKA) and
           patella 45° skyview will be evaluated preoperatively and at 1 year followup. Later these
           values will be evaluated together with migration- and wear values.

           • Radiostereometric analysis (RSA)

        -  RSA is a highly accurate and precise method of evaluating implant migration and
           polyethylene wear (17, 28-31). The precision usually is about 0.1mm (translational
           migration) and 0.1 degrees (rotation). The radiation dose is low compared to plain
           x-rays (10-20%). During surgery, tiny spheres of Tantalum are implanted in
           periprosthetic bone. On day 5-10 postoperatively, two simultaneous exposures of the knee
           and a co-ordinate system are taken. These films allow three-dimensional definition of
           the implant and bone relative to the co-ordinate system. Implant migration and rotation
           are measured on repeat examinations over time. The high precision allows us to detect
           small differences between groups, and also means that the number of subjects in each
           group can be restricted. The precision (repeatability) of the measurements in this study
           will be evaluated by double examinations at the 1-year RSA-visit. Limits for significant
           differences are calculated as the 99% confidence intervals of the absolute mean values
           of the double examinations. RSA will be done at day 5-10 post-operatively, at 3months,
           and at 1,2 and 5 years postoperatively.

             -  The tibia will have 9 tantulum beads of 1.0 mm spread from the cut tibia proximal
                to distal and anteroposterioly.

             -  The insert will have 6 beads; 3 x 1.0mm beads placed anteromedially,
                posterolaterally and anteriorly. 3 x 0.8mm beads placed posteomedially,
                anterolaterally and anteriorly.

             -  The holes are then covered with bonewax.

                160 patients are included after oral and written information. Included patients
                give their written consent to participation in the study. 80 patients are included
                in each group by drawing envelopes assigning the patients randomly to one of the 2
                groups. Block randomisation is arranged so that each participating surgeon operates
                an equal number of TKA in each group. The randomization is done by the statistician
                using a computer-generated randomization. The randomization protocol is kept at the
                registry office.

      The study is singled-blinded; the patients will not receive information on implant specifics
      until the end of the study. Each patient receives a patient number (1 through 160) on
      inclusion. 30 patients in each of the 2 groups will be included for the RSA study.

      FOLLOWUP

        -  Preop: KSS, KOOS, walking speed, ActivPAL activity monitor, standard x-rays,

        -  Postop: RSA, standard x-rays

        -  6 weeks pain and function assessment

        -  3 months: RSA, walking speed, ActivPAL activity monitor,

        -  1, 2 and 5 years: RSA, standard x-rays, KSS, KOOS and FJS12, walking speed, ActivPAL
           activity monitor, 10 years: RSA, standard x-rays, KSS, KOOS, walking speed, ActivPAL
           activity monitor, All RSA examinations will be anonymised and done at the biomaterial
           laboratory at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital. The
           results of the RSA-examinations and clinical outcome measures will be collected in
           electronic files under the respective patient numbers. Data obtained on previous
           occasions will not be accessible when examining the patient.

      Patient list A list will be made coupling patient name and personal identification number to
      a number on the patient list (1 through 160). The project leader is responsible for the safe
      handling of the list. Other forms with patient information are labelled with the patient
      number only for identification. The sponsors of the study will have access to the anonymised
      data. Application to Ethical committee (REK-Vest) has been accepted. The registry study is
      covered by the concession of the Norwegian Arthroplasty Registers concession from 2015.

      Analysis of variance on repeated measurements (ANOVA) will be used on the RSA- and on the
      clinical data if the data are normally distributed. In our earlier RSA studies, the data have
      displayed normal distribution. If however, the data are not normally distributed, the
      investigators will use non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon matched-pairs
      test). A power analysis for the student t-test for independent samples showed that group
      sizes of 24 would give a power of 80 % to detect a 0.1 mm difference in subsidence of the
      tibial component with a two-sided significance level of 0.0125 and an assumed SD of 0.1 mm.
      The investigators anticipate exclusion of some patients and, therefore, include 30 patients
      in each group.

      A difference of ten units in an aggregated and averaged subscale of KOOS was chosen as a
      minimum important change, as suggested by the developers of KOOS. With a standard deviation
      (SD) of 20, a sample size of 64 patients per group was necessary to achieve a power of 80%
      and a 5% level of significance. With possible exclusion of patients, the investigators will
      include 80 in each group.

      Power=80% gives N=80 in each group. Type I error rate, alpha=5%. Kaplan-Meier survival
      percentages will be reported at 5 and 10 years. Cox regression model will be used to
      calculate risk ratios (RR).

      Separate randomization lists will be created for each of the surgeons. Block randomization
      for each participating surgeon with randomly varying block sizes will be generated to achieve
      equal numbers in the treatment groups at all times. A central randomization office will
      perform the computer-generated allocation to the trial groups.

      Adverse effects, side effects, and unfortunate effects of the surgery will immediately be
      reported to the project leader and to the sponsors. Abortion or abruption of the study will
      be considered in the case of unexpected complications.

      The study will end 10 years after inclusion of all patients.
