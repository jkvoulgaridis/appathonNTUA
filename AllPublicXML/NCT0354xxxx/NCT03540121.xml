  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the effectiveness of an electronic-based video intervention and
      behavioral contract on improving medication adherence among kidney transplant recipients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-adherence to immunosuppressive medications is a major problem after kidney
      transplantation, leading to increased rejections, hospitalizations and health care
      expenditures. Effective educational opportunities may positively influence adherence,
      especially when combined with a behavior intervention. However, increasing education and
      support to transplant recipients demands greater use of care providers' time and resources in
      a health care system that is already stretched.

      A patient-oriented video series has been developed according to best practices for transplant
      education, featuring an animated character embarking on a transplant journey. Animated
      segments illustrate difficult concepts for patients with poor health literacy, and patient
      narratives provide support and encouragement. A multicenter randomized controlled trial will
      be conducted with 4 sites across North America. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to either
      the intervention (i.e., home-based video education + adherence contract plus usual care) or
      usual care alone. Patients will be enrolled in the study prior to hospital discharge and will
      be provided with access to the video intervention and contract electronically. The primary
      outcome will be adherence at 12 months post-transplant, as measured by self-report (BAASIS),
      and variability in immunosuppressant levels. Secondary outcomes include the change in
      knowledge score between the intervention and control in groups (measured by the Kidney
      Transplant Understanding Tool); differences in self-efficacy (Generalized Self-efficacy
      Scale), beliefs about medicines (Beliefs of Medicine Questionnaire), and quality of life
      (SF-12). Individualized viewing statistics will be analyzed to determine patient uptake, and
      satisfaction about the educational experience will be captured on a self-reported survey.

    <description>The Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive medications (BAASIS) will be sent electronically by self-reported survey. An answer of 'yes' to any of the questions (pertaining to missing doses, drug holidays, timing, and dose reduction) will constitute non-adherence as a binary outcome. â€¢ A continuous measure of adherence will also be determined in each individual using a visual analogue scale.</description>

    <description>Immunosuppressant levels (tacrolimus, cyclosporine or sirolimus) will be collected as per routine practice, and will be standardized to the patient specific target. Intra-patient coefficients of variation (CV) will be used as a measure of trough level variability, and percentage of sub-therapeutic levels will be determined for each patient.</description>

    <description>Measured by the Kidney Transplant Understanding Tool (K-TUT) via self-reported electronic survey. The K-TUT consists of 9 true/false and 13 multiple-choice questions, and scores are based on the number correct answers [YES/ NO format] of 69 items.</description>

    <description>Measured by the Short Form 12 (SF-12) via self-reported electronic survey. The SF-12 is a 12-item psychometric scale that measures functional health and well-being. Responses are indicated on a likert scale and aggregated into two sub scales; the mental component summary (MCS) and the physical component summary (PCS). The scores are converted to adjusted norm-based values of a healthy individual with a midpoint score of 50 indicating average health comparable to norm values.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months and 12 months after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) via self-reported electronic survey. The GSE measures an individual's self-beliefs in their ability to cope with various demands in life. It is a 10-item psychometric scale with a score for each item ranging from 1 to 4. The scores are summed and a higher score indicates stronger patient beliefs in self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Measured by the Beliefs of Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ) via self-reported electronic survey. The BMQ is an 18-item psychometric questionnaire which consists of two subscales. The BMQ-Specific assesses perceptions of medication prescribed for personal use, while the BMQ-General assesses beliefs about medications in general. The BMQ-General can be further classified into domain of General-Harm and General-Overuse. Items are scored on a 5-point likert scale, with higher score indicating stronger beliefs in each subscale.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive standard education along with the home-based video education plus an adherence contract. Following the baseline assessment, access to videos will be provided electronically so that the patient can watch them at home. The videos will be initially viewed in the following order: Video 1: Introduction, Video 2: Medications, Video 3: Your New Life. Approximately one month after transplant, after the video series has been viewed in its entirety, participants will receive an email link inviting participants to reflect on their goals about transplantation and pledging to taking their medications as directed. The contract will be non-enforceable, but it will provide patients with the opportunity to formally commit to a goal of taking the medications as prescribed. At 3 months, and 12 months, the participant will have the opportunity to reflect and modify adherence goals as desired.</description>
