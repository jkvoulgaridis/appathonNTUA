  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When difficult airway/intubation occurs in the OR the anesthesiologist needs rescue
      techniques and equipment. The algorithms about management of the difficult airway don't
      provide adequate data. In current study researchers aim to determine most preferred rescue
      techniques and success rate of the chosen technique.

    <textblock>
      In anesthesia setting Failed tracheal intubation, leading mortality and morbidity is very
      important. In operation room when a Difficult intubation occured with concurrent difficult
      mask ventilation rapid manipulation and quick decision are lifesaving. The Presence of
      assistant medical personnel or rescue equipment and crisis management of physician is
      crucial. In anesthesia practice when difficult airway occured rescue techniques are used to
      facilitate the intubation but difficult airway algorithms do not provide adequate information
      which rescue technique should be used in a state of emergency in OR thereby current trial was
      designed to determine which rescue techniques are used in everyday practice to manage
      difficult intubation, success and complication rates of chosen techniques.

      Aim of the study

        1. Most preferred rescue technique of the anesthesiologist When a difficult airway or
           difficult intubation ventilation occured

        2. success rate of the chosen technique

        3. Incidence of possible complications

        4. Most preferred rescue technique of the anesthesiologist on presence of the difficult
           mask ventilation
