  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, pilot study investigating the safety and feasibility of
      infusion-enhanced, MRI-guided DBS electrode placement. The investigators intend to enroll
      patients with Parkinson's disease and medically-refractory motor symptoms, who are already
      planned for MRI-guided DBS electrodes under general anesthesia. The hypothesis of the study
      is that a convective micro-infusion of autologous CSF will enhance the T2-weighted MRI
      visualization of the targeted nucleus during image-guided DBS surgery for Parkinson's
      disease. The investigators will record standard clinical measures of PD at baseline and 6
      months following DBS surgery. The study will recruit patients at a rate of approximately one
      a month and will take less than two years to complete.

    <time_frame>6 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of infusion-related side effects and complications from the first treatment day visit through the 6-month post-treatment time point. All AEs will be reported and categorized by investigators as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated to the CSF infusion, and/or Parkinson's disease progression. Safety will be assessed by incidence and severity of AEs, including changes in physical examinations and neurological examinations, and the number of discontinuations due to AEs.</description>

    <description>The volume of distribution (Vd) will be determined immediately following the infusion (Vi) with intraoperative 1.5T MRI, T2-weighted sequences. The distribution of the infusion by convective properties in a deep brain human nucleus (GPi or STN) will be determined by calculating the Vd/Vi ratio.</description>

    <description>All subjects will receive the intracerebral infusion of autologous cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) during their deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The DBS surgery will be performed on the targeted nucleus either bilaterally or unilaterally, as previously determined by a multidisciplinary team of neurology, neurosurgery, and neuropsychology. During unilateral DBS surgery, the targeted nucleus will be infused using convection enhanced delivery (CED). The nondominant side will be infused during a bilateral DBS procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women, age 30 years and older

          2. Subjects with advanced PD who are scheduled for MRI-guided DBS surgery under general
             anesthesia

          3. Subjects who are able and willing to give informed consent and able to attend clinic
             visits through 6 months

          4. The target nucleus, GPi or STN, is visible on MRI so that it can be targeted for the
             study infusion and then for MRI-guided DBS

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. DBS surgery planned in the awake condition with microelectrode recordings and clinical
             testing

          2. Spinal pathology not amenable to lumbar puncture

          3. Subjects who have had deep brain stimulation or a prior stereotactic ablation of the
             basal ganglia

          4. Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity as determined by the neuropsychologist

          5. Are participating or have participated in another clinical trial in the last 30 days

          6. Any illness that in the investigator's opinion preclude participation in this study.
