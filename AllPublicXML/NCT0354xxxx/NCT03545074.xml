    <textblock>
      This study explores the differential efficacy of Spanish or English versions of a mindfulness
      intervention on Depression levels, using a pre test post test design and an active control
      condition (health education).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an experimental condition (MAPs
      Mindfulness intervention) and an active control group (Health Education), using a pretest and
      immediate posttest research design. Both conditions are comprised of a 6-week group
      intervention, which will be administered at the UCLA Westwood Medical Campus. The sample
      (N=80) will be drawn from a population of adults (18-65 years old), residing within a 10mile
      radius of the UCLA Westwood Medical Campus. To determine initial eligibility, potential
      participants will self-select based on perceived high levels of stress. Participants will
      respond self-report questionnaires to assess for psychological symptoms and will be drawn
      blood samples (180ml total) to assess levels of pro inflammatory cytokines before and after
      the interventions. Participants will attend a total of 8 visits.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item self-reporting questionnaire for evaluating the severity of depression in normal and psychiatric populations</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is based on a factor analytic study of five independently developed mindfulness questionnaires. The analysis yielded five factors that appear to represent elements of mindfulness as it is currently conceptualized. The five facets are observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Higher scores represent overall higher levels of perceived stress. Scores range from 0 to 40 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Compassion Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Compassion Scale is a psychometrically sound and theoretically valid measure of self-compassion. Scores range from 26 to 130, with higher scores representing higher levels of self-compassion. All subscales (Self-Kindness, Self-Judgment, Common Humanity, Isolation, Mindfulness and Over-identified) are combined to compute a total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>he Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales to measure both positive and negative affect. Scores range from 10 to 50 points, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive or negative affect.</description>

    <description>The MAPs program was developed at UCLA (Winston &amp; Smalley, 2010 and Lopez-Maya, 2016) and provides experiential training in mindfulness-based practices, including mindfulness meditation. UCLA-certified instructors delivered the interventions. Active program components include sitting and walking meditations, body scan and loving-kindness meditation. Participants were provided with audio CDs or digital downloads to complete their daily meditation assignments. Sessions were held once per week for 2 hours per session over a period of six consecutive weeks. Home practice assignments consist of daily mindfulness exercises starting with 5 minutes daily, progressing to 20 minutes daily by the end of the program.</description>

    <description>The health education condition is a weekly 2-hour, 6 session course aimed at knowledge acquisition in subjects related to health care in general. Similar interventions have been described elsewhere (Black, et al., 2014; Irwin, et al., 2014). A trained health educator provided videos and didactic presentations on topics such as: stress, sleep hygiene, diet &amp; nutrition, sexuality, mental health and substance abuse. The health education condition resembled the MAPs intervention in terms of duration, group format and support, attention and participant expectancy regarding health benefits.</description>
