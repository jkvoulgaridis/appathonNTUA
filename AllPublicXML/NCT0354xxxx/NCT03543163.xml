  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled single blinded parallel clinical trial is held to monitor if the
      use of the non pedicled buccal fat pad graft will result in post operative pain as a primary
      outcome compared to that occurs with the use of the sub epithelial connective tissue graft in
      treating Miller Class I and Class II gingival recession

    <description>Evaluation of the gingival thickness by trans-gingival piercing using an anesthetic needle with a silicon stopper inserted perpendicular to the mucosal surface with light pressure until touching a hard surface and the silicon disk in a tight contact with soft tissue surface. This measurement should be taken 1.5 mm apical from the gingival margin. Then the correct position of the disk is fixed with a drop of cyanoacrylic adhesive after careful removal of the needle. The penetration depth is measured by an accurate caliper</description>

    <description>A horizontal incision of 1.5cm in long will be made at the bottom of the vestibule with the #15 blade in the region of maxillary first and second molars, depending on side of the recipient site. A curved hemostat will be used in the blunt dissection through the buccinators muscle to temporarily reposition and loose the surrounding fascia which will allow the buccal fat pad to be exposed in the oral cavity. A portion of adipose tissue equals to the required graft size will be excised with the microsurgical scissors. The grafting material will be placed on a saline-soaked gauze until its transfer to the recipient site. Finally, the patient's check will be compressed, in order to promote the closure of the wound edges then immediately close the donor site with simple 5.0 silk thread interrupted sutures</description>
