  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conflict and unrest over three decades has resulted in significant economic decline in Khyber
      Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan and these now
      rank among the poorest regions in the country. The 2009-10 insurgency and subsequent security
      operations affected both regions and displaced an estimated 2 million people. The severe
      damage to infrastructure and livelihoods negatively impacted the social and economic fabric
      of the entire region. As peace has returned to the area, the Economic Revitalization of KP
      and FATA (ERKF) project, established in 2012 and supported by the World Bank, is working for
      the rehabilitation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), with the aim of creation and
      restoration of jobs. This support is in the form of grants given to individuals who use the
      funds to establish and run a business in their locality.

      Epidemiological studies from the area have shown high rates of common mental disorder (eg.,
      depression, anxiety) in the general population (Husain et al, 2006, Khan et al 2016). Such
      conditions have a serious impact on the well-being, functioning and productivity of affected
      individuals (World Health Organization, 2000). For example, in the USA, Depressive Disorders
      have been estimated to cost the economy over US$210 billion per annum, largely due to reduced
      productivity (Greenberg et al, 2015). The economic rehabilitation of a population exposed to
      a humanitarian crisis, and therefore at greater risk of depression, must include
      interventions to reduce mental morbidity so the individuals are able to function better and
      potentially improve their long-term productivity.

      The Human Development Research Foundation, in collaboration with the World Bank, has adapted
      a 5-session group intervention from WHO Problem Management Plus program, tailored to the
      needs of small and medium enterprise owners affected by the prolonged conflict in KP and FATA
      areas of Pakistan. This intervention (Problem Management Plus adapted for entrepreneurs) is
      based on established cognitive behavioral strategies previously tested in Pakistan (Rahman et
      al, 2016). The goal of the intervention is to improve psychological capital,reduce
      psychosocial distress leading to, increased productivity in the long-term. The intervention
      will be evaluated using a two arm, single blind randomized controlled trial.

    <description>The primary outcome is change in the prevalence of psychological distress as measured by PHQ-9 in the intervention arm as compared to the control arm. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other key major depressive symptoms (Kroenke et al, 2001). Participants rate their responses on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from not at all to nearly every day. The PHQ-9 total severity score ranges from 0 to 27. The PHQ-9 has been validated in the Urdu language, showing adequate sensitivity and specificity (Husain et al 2006) and has been used in recent studies in KP (Rahman et al, 2016).</description>

    <description>Well-being will be measured by WHO 5 Well-being index (Topp, et al, 2015). WHO-5 is a short and generic global rating scale measuring subjective well-being, the respondent is asked to rate how well each of the 5 statements applies to him or her when considering the last 14 days. The instrument will be administered to study participants at 3 months post intervention to rate their subjective well being in last 14 days. Each of the 5 items is scored from 5 (all of the time) to 0 (none of the time). The raw score ranges from 0 (absence of well-being) to 25 (maximal well-being). Scores are then converted to a percentage scale from 0 (absent) to 100 (maximal).</description>

    <description>GAD-7 will be used to measure anxiety (Spitzer et al, 2006) in the study sample. GAD-7 is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version IV (DSM IV) diagnostic criteria for generalised anxiety disorder, and has 7 items. Each item is scored on a likert scale from 0 to 3, generating a maximum score of 21</description>

    <measure>Psychological Capital Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The secondary outcome data will be collected at 1 week post intervention and at 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological capital will be measured using the Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ) 12 items version (Avey et al, 2007). The PCQ-12 measures psychological capital across four domains (hope-4 items, optimism-2 items, resilience -3 items and self-efficacy-3 items).</description>

    <description>Social support will be measured using Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), adapted for use with this population. MSPSS measure perceived social support in three domains: family, friends and significant others (4 items each). Each item is rated on a seven-point Likert-scale (1 = very strongly disagree; 7 = very strongly agree). A total score is calculated by summing the results for all items (Akhtar et al, 2010; Zimet et al, 1988).</description>

    <description>Individual entrepreneurial behaviours will be measured using an adapted individual entrepreneurial orientation scale (Lee &amp; Lim, 2009).
