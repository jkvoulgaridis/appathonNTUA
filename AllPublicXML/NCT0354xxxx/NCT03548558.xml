  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to experimentally test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of competing
      models of delivery of an Early Childhood Development (ECD) intervention in rural Kenya to
      determine how to maximize their reach to improve child cognitive, language and relevant
      psychosocial outcomes. The study will also include a longer-term evaluation of sustained
      impacts; an examination of the pathways of change leading to intervention impacts to inform
      policy; and examination of the role of paternal involvement on child development. Findings
      will provide policy makers with rigorous evidence of how best to expand ECD interventions in
      low-resource rural settings to improve child developmental outcomes for both the short-and
      longer-term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent neurobiological and psychological research has established that vital development
      occurs in language, cognitive, motor and socio-emotional development during the first few
      years of life, and early life outcomes are key determinants of adult outcomes such as
      educational achievement, labor market outcomes, and health. Yet more than 200 million
      children under age five in low and middle income countries (LMICs) will fail to reach their
      developmental potential as adults, predominantly due to poverty, poor health and nutrition,
      and inadequate cognitive and psychosocial stimulation. Early childhood development (ECD)
      interventions that integrate nutrition and child stimulation activities have been proposed as
      a powerful policy tool for the remediation of early disadvantages in poor settings, and
      numerous field studies have shown they can be effective in improving children's developmental
      and health outcomes, at least in the short-term. Key questions remain on what models of
      delivery are the most effective and cost-effective that can be potentially scalable in LMICs,
      as well as how to sustain parental behavioral changes over time, which can lead to long-term
      improvements in child development and the possibility of positive spillovers to benefit
      younger siblings. Having a better understanding of the underlying behavioral pathways leading
      from intervention, to parental behavior changes, to child impacts, is also key to inform
      policy about the optimal design of interventions to maximize their scalability and
      sustainability. This study will conduct a multi-arm clustered randomized controlled trial
      across 60 villages and 1200 households in rural Western Kenya that tests different
      potentially cost-effective delivery models for an ECD intervention with a curriculum that
      integrates child psychosocial stimulation and nutrition education. Selected households will
      undergo baseline and follow-up surveys to measure short-term impacts in parental behaviors
      and children's developmental outcomes, and the study will collect data on potential mediators
      of parental behavioral change to uncover the pathways leading to impacts. Two follow-up
      surveys, one immediately after the end of the planned intervention and a second two years
      later, will enable testing of the short term and midterm sustainability of impacts, as well
      as the presence of any spillovers onto younger siblings. In collaboration with a local NGO,
      the Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP), community health volunteers (CHVs) will be trained to
      implement the intervention by introducing the ECD curriculum in their villages.

      The goal of this study is to provide policymakers with rigorous evidence of how best to
      expand ECD interventions in low-resource rural settings.

    <intervention_model_description>The evaluation design consists of a clustered Randomized Control Trial (cRCT) in which 60 CHVs and their associated villages will be randomly assigned to one of three equally-sized treatment arms: group meetings only (Arm 1), group meetings with a limited number of individual home visits and booster sessions (Arm 2), and a control group (Arm 3). Within half of the villages assigned to Arms 1 and 2 (the intervention arms), fathers will also be invited to the group sessions (a 2x2 factorial design among the 40 villages assigned to receive the intervention). All households, including the control group (Arm 3), will receive basic information about child feeding during a baseline survey.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study will have separate teams for collection of surveys and program implementation. Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants and delivery agents will not be blinded to their study allocation as part of the program implementation team. Data collectors of surveys for the research team will, however, be blinded to the intervention allocation status of participants and villages. (Baseline surveys will be collected prior to randomization.) Likewise, data analysis will be blinded to the intervention status of participants and villages.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, the study will use the Family Care Indicators, a self-reported measure of parenting practices which measures the quality time spent with children in learning and playing activities for young children at home.
The items are grouped into the following theoretical subgroups: 'Varieties of play materials' (including picture books for young children) (7 items), which classified toys by their use; 'Sources of play materials' (4 items), which identified where the play materials came from; and 'Play activities' (6 items), which identified specific types of activities done by any adult in the home with the child in the previous three days. All these items were scored: yes=1 and no=0 (presence or absence of play material or activity). Higher values are considered to better.</description>

    <time_frame>10-12 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>At follow-up surveys, the study will collect the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME)- Short Form (SF) inventory. The HOME-SF includes items grouped into two sub-scales: emotional support and cognitive stimulation. It has four parts: one for children under age three; a second for children between the ages of three and five; a third for children ages six through nine; and a fourth version for children ten and over. At several survey points, as mentioned, the set of questions in the HOME sections of the survey was expanded, but these added items are not part of the total HOME score or subscores. Response options for the interview portion are in multiple-choice format, but are converted to binary variables for scoring. The total raw score for the HOME-SF is a simple summation of the recorded individual item scores and it varies by age group, as the number of individual items varies according to the age of the child.</description>

    <description>Food security will be measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). This scale measures food insecurity. The questionnaire consists of nine questions that represent a generally increasing level of severity of food insecurity (access). Each HFIAS question consists of the stem (timeframe for recall), the body of the question (refers to a specific behavior or attitude), and four response options (0 to 3) that represent a range of frequencies (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often). The HFIAS score is a continuous measure of the degree of food insecurity (access) in the household (in the past 30 days). The maximum score for a household is 27 (the household response to all 9 questions was &quot;often&quot;, coded with response code of 3); the minimum score is 0. The higher the score, the more food insecurity (access) the household experienced. The lower the score, the less food insecurity (access) a household experienced.</description>

    <measure>Changes in maternal depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10-12, and 22-24 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The study will measure maternal psychological well-being using the widely used Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) with proven psychometric properties. The 20-item scale examines how individuals have felt in the previous week. The options include: 0= Rarely (0-1 days); 1= Some or a little of the time (at least 1-2 days); 2= Most of the days (3 or more days). Scoring is done as follows: zero for answers in the first option, 1 for answers in the second option, 2 for answers in the third option. The scoring of positive items is reversed. Possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.</description>

    <description>The study will adapt and measure the scale to elicit beliefs developed by Cunha et al. (2013)with the target of eliciting parental beliefs regarding the benefits of providing children better cognitive and non-cognitive stimulation. The instrument asks parents about developmental milestones in language and socio-emotional development under different home scenarios, which are constructed using data from the Family Care Indicators.</description>

    <description>The Self-Efficacy for Parenting Tasks Index-Toddler Scale or SEPTI-TS is a 26-item questionnaire to assess parental self-efficacy in parents of toddlers. The Short Form of the SEPTI-TS showed a strong factor structure with four subscales of domain-specific parental self-efficacy (Nurturance, Discipline, Play, and Routine) that showed high reliability. Scores are rates from strongly disagree to strongly agree, and higher scores indicate stronger parental self-efficacy</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Kenyan mothers or equivalent female primary caretakers aged 15 and over with children
             aged 6-24 months (classified as mature minors)

          -  Kenyan fathers aged 18 and older with children aged 6-24 months with a mother present

        The unit of observation for the study is the household or family, within which the primary
        focus is mother-child dyads and household eligibility hinges on the age of the child. For
        those households with a father present, the study will additionally include him in some
        analyses and surveys.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Households without children

          -  Households with children that are outside the age range of 6-24 months at baseline

          -  Households with a mother younger than 15 or one aged 15-18 still living with her
             parents

          -  Single fathers

        Selection criteria for fathers are based on the mother-child eligibility criteria. Fathers
        will be included if and when appropriate per the details surrounding the mother-child
        dyads.
