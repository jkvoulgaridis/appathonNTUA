  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Revascularization surgery has been the standard treatment to prevent ischemic stroke in
      pediatric Moyamoya disease (MMD) patients with ischemic symptoms. However, perioperative
      complications, such as hyperperfusion syndrome, new infarct on imaging, or ischemic stroke,
      are inevitable. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a noninvasive and easy‑to‑use
      neuroprotective strategy, and it has potential effects on preventing hyperperfusion syndrome
      and ischemic infarction.

      This study will provide insights into the preliminary proof of principle, safety, and
      efficacy of RIC in pediatric MMD patients undergoing revascularization surgery therapy, and
      this data will provide parameters for future larger scale clinical trials if efficacious.

    <description>National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is considered as a standardized assessment of neurological functions in the acute phase of stroke, and it is generally used to quantify patient's neurological impairments on 15 items in 11 fields of different neurological status.The score of the scale ranges from 0 to 42.And higher score indicates worse neurological function.</description>

    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS) is the most comprehensive and most widely used primary outcome measurement to assess the neurological functional disability in contemporary acute stroke trials. The mRS is an ordinal, graded interval scale that assigns patients among 7 global disability levels, which ranges from 0 (no symptom) to 5 (severe disability) and 6 (death). We will use mRS to evaluate the degree of disability or dependence during daily activities. The mRS will be assessed by certified study investigator, who is blinded to the treatment assignment, at 90 days postoperation. The distribution of mRS will be compared between groups</description>
