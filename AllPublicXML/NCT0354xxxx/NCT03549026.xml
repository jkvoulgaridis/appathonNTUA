  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor primarily used for treatment of
      major depression and anxiety. Duloxetine also has been used in the treatment of chronic pain
      conditions, such as osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal pain. There are few studies examining
      its effect for acute pain. The objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of
      duloxetine for patients undergoing lumbar discectomy.

    <description>Patients will receive single oral dose of duloxetine capsule, 60 mg, 2 hours before operation and will be anesthetized with general anesthesia that includes, Induction of anesthesia will be done by intravenous fentanyl, 2 µg / kg and propofol 1 - 2 mg / kg. Endotracheal intubation will be achieved by cis-atracurium, 0.15 mg / kg. Maintenance of anesthesia will be done by isoflurane and cis-atracurium, 0.03 mg / kg on demand. Additional intraoperative analgesia will be consisted of administration of intravenous boluses of fentanyl, 50 µg according to the attending anesthesiologist's decision. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed using neostigmine 0.05 mg / kg and atropine 0.01 mg / kg.</description>
