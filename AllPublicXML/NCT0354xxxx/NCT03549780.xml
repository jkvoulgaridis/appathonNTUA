    <textblock>
      This investigation constitutes an initial evaluation of the stoma occlusion device in humans
      with a mature permanent Brooke ileostomy. The overall objective of this study is to assess
      feasibility and initial operating characteristics of a novel stoma occlusion device. The
      study will recruit 20 patients for placement of the device into the mature Brooke ileostomy
      and subsequent 2 hour observation period. The device will remain in the ileostomy for up to 2
      hours.

    <textblock>
      An ostomy is a protrusion of part of the intestines extending through the abdominal wall for
      the purpose of elimination of wastes and may be temporary or permanent depending on the
      purpose of the initial surgery. The most common reasons for permanent bowel diversion are
      cancer and ulcerative colitis. Appliances have improved greatly over the last 50 years, but
      patients continue to experience appliance leakage and skin infections and struggle with the
      emotional and social impact of an external pouch. This study seeks to answer the opportunity
      to significantly improve quality of life to a large segment of the global population through
      optimization of a technology for a stoma occlusion device in patients with permanent stomas.
      Four pre-clinical animal studies have been conducted. All the animals that completed the
      study tolerated the device well and had no adverse reactions to device materials. This
      project will allow a prototype of an artificial stomal occlusion device to be tested in
      humans.

    <description>Device is able to be inserted adequately (function) and without any significant patient discomfort or adverse events (safety). The function (continence) of the stoma occlusion device: After the device has been inserted, a 4 x 4 inch gauze will be placed at the stoma site and secured in place. The gauze functions to document any moisture or leakage of the occlusion device. Consistency and volume of moisture or leakage on the gauze pad will be documented.</description>
