      This study aimed to use a multi-disciplinary approach to evaluate a home-based high-intensity
      interval training (Home-HIT) intervention in people with type 1 diabetes.

      Eleven individuals with type 1 diabetes (4 men/7 women; age 30±3 years; BMI 27.1±1.2 kg·m-2;
      V ̇O2peak 32.4±2.1 ml∙kg∙min-1; duration of type 1 diabetes 10±2 years) completed six weeks
      of Home-HIT. The effect of Home-HIT on V ̇O2peak, blood pressure, insulin dose and glycaemic
      profile was assessed pre and post-training. Adherence and ability to meet target heart rate
      (HR) thresholds (compliance) were monitored using a HR monitor and mobile phone application.
      Change in glycaemia was measured pre, post and 1h post exercise sessions throughout the
      six-week period. A qualitative online survey was completed post-training.

      This is the first study to combine physiological outcomes with a qualitative evaluation of a
      training intervention in people with type 1 diabetes. Home-HIT resulted in high adherence
      alongside increased V ̇O2peak and decreased insulin dose. Because Home-HIT is time-efficient
      and removes barriers to exercise including fear of hypoglycaemia, it may represent an
      effective strategy to increase exercise participation in people with type 1 diabetes.
