  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly believed that a link exists between BMI and taste perception. One group of
      researchers observed that women who are obese experience reduced taste sensitivity when
      compared to normal-weight controls. Others have compared taste sensitivity between lean and
      obese subjects and found no significant differences. The inconsistencies in these studies
      demonstrate how much variation in taste sensitivity is possible when different factors are
      applied in research. Throughout several studies, one element remains constant - bariatric
      surgery causes appetite aversions. These changes in appetite and food preference likely have
      a large influence on the overall magnitude of post-surgical weight loss. Although many
      studies have investigated the changes in taste preference after bariatric surgery, few, if
      any, have focused on changes in sweet taste perception.

      The overall goal of the present project is to determine how future bariatric surgery will
      affect the taste for sweet liquids. Taste perception will be assessed before surgery
      (pre-operative, pre-op) and after bariatric surgery, at approximately 1 month. Taste studies
      will be conducted with solutions prepared freshly before each test using sucrose dissolved in
      distilled water. Six concentrations of sucrose (table sugar) will be tasted in random order,
      with the most concentrated solution being roughly the sweetness of soda. The subject is
      blinded to the concentrations. It is hypothesized that there will be no significant
      difference in taste perception when pre-op and post-op values are compared. However, the
      investigators hypothesize that taste preference will identify solutions with lower
      concentrations post-op.

    <description>Taste perception will be assessed by the subjects' responses to varying sucrose solutions. The interval scale begins with &quot;barely detectable&quot; at zero and goes up to &quot;strongest imaginable&quot; at 10. Subjects will be asked to draw an &quot;X&quot; at the location on the graph corresponding to their perception.</description>

      Before bariatric surgery, the subject will lightly scrape the inside of their cheek to
      harvest cells. These cell will be frozen for future DNA extraction and detection of taste
      receptor genes, T1R2 and T1R3.
