      The goal of this study is to investigate long-term modulation of pain pathways leading to a
      suppression of pain symptoms in Gulf War Illness patients by applying transcranial direct
      current stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gulf War Illness is a chronic and multisymptomatic disorder affecting returning military
      veterans of the 1990-1991 Gulf war. Pain is a major complaint of Gulf War Illness patients
      and is a leading cause of disability in veterans diagnosed with musculoskeletal ailments
      including joint and muscle pain, muscle fatigue, difficulty with lifting objects, and
      extremity paresthesia's. As a result, the target of the present study is the treatment of the
      pain symptoms, as this is detectable across all Gulf War Illness case classification systems.

      Transcranial Direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and painless electrical
      stimulation technique that has already demonstrated to improve pain symptoms in other patient
      populations, e.g. fibromyalgia patients. To investigate whether we can improve pain symptoms
      in GWI patients with pain complaints, we will compare behavioral (questionnaires) and
      electrophysiological (Electroencephalography) measures before and immediately after 10
      sessions of tDCS and on several follow up sessions after the last tDCS from 2 groups.
