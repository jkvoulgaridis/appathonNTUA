    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate and compare the treatment efficacy and safety of ESWT
      vs sham treatment for CP/CPPS patients.This is a triple-blind, randomized, parallel group
      sham-controlled clinical study.

    <description>CP/CPPS-related complaints will be assessed by the the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). The questionnaire designed to provide symptom scores for patients with chronic prostatitis. The index provides scores on pain (items 1-4), urinary symptoms (items 5-6), and quality of life (items 7-9).Total score ranges from 0 to 35 (higher values represent worse outcome).The index provides a special pain domain (items 1-4) and the score for this domain ranges from 0 to 21.</description>

    <measure>The difference between the LiST and sham group in the the Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by the pain VAS, right after each LIST session. Pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity . It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100-mm scale]. To avoid clustering of scores around a preferred numeric value, numbers or verbal descriptors at intermediate points are not recommended. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm)</description>
