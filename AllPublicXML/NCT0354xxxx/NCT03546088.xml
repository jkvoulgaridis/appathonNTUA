  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficiency of awake naso-tracheal intubation and patient
      satisfaction when using a small diameter flexible nasolaryngoscope together with topical
      anaesthesia and light sedation with a combination of benzodiazepine and fentanyl. The
      selected patients will have difficult airway access because of obstructing oro- and
      hypo-pharynx tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Awake naso-tracheal fiberoptic intubation is an established method of securing a difficult
      airway. The patient's comfort and optimum intubation conditions are paramount for success.
      The study proposes to analyse a series of patients with obstructive pharyngo-laryngeal
      pathology, following the degree of satisfaction, reliability of the procedure and any
      incidents or complications.

      Awake intubation could be the safest way to control difficult airway as the patient maintains
      spontaneous respiration and intact reflexes. Main concerns for the success of this procedure
      should be a good technique, a calm and cooperative patient and good preparation with careful
      topical anaesthesia and appropriate sedation. The tool used in this study will be a flexible
      nasolaryngoscope of 2.9 mm diameter and 300 mm working length which might offer an advantage
      over lengthier fiberscopes in matter of manoeuvrability and patient comfort. Prior intubation
      the patients will have an upper airway fiberscopic exam from nostrils to tracheae with the
      same tool.

    <description>The subjects will complete a satisfaction questionnaire, in the form of a visual analogue scale. The scale will have the form of a 10 cm line marked with five grades of their discomfort during the procedure: none, mild, moderate, very bad and unbearable. Above this written words there is a 1 to 10 scale on which the patient will note there satisfaction score- 1 is the corespondent of no discomfort and 10 is for unbearable. The patient will fill in the scale the day after surgery. An average of the score of all patients will be computed.</description>

    <description>The patients with obstructive oro and hypo-pharynx tumours will have their airway secured through awake fiberoptic naso-tracheal intubation with light sedation and topical anaesthesia with lidocaine. The sedation will be provided in small boluses until the desired level will be achieved not exceeding 0.05 mg/kg of midazolam and 3 mcg/kg fentanyl. The dose of lidocaine will be to a maximum of 7 mg/kg. The reinforced intubating tube will be lubricated with lidocaine gel.</description>
