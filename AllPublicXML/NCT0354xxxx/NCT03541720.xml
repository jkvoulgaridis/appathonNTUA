  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET (positron emission tomography) scans combined with a radioactive tracer will be used to
      identify and analyze tumors. Currently, the most common tracer used to analyze neuroblastoma
      tumors is called 123I-mIBG. However, the picture it provides is not always clear enough to
      see the very small areas of the disease.

      18F-DA (18F-fluorodopamine) has been shown to be safe and more effective than 123I-mIBG in
      analyzing the tumor pheochromocytoma, which is closely related to neuroblastoma.

      With this research study, the investigators plan to meet the following goals:

        -  Investigate to see if 18F-DA is safe to administer to pediatric patients with known or
           suspected neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma

        -  Examine where in the body 18F-DA goes.

        -  Obtain information comparing 18F-DA to 123I-mIBG to see if 18F-DA could replace
           123I-mIBG in the future.

      About 20 people, with known or suspected neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma, will take part in
      this Pilot study at St. Jude.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial malignant tumor of childhood. Nuclear imaging
      with 123I-mIBG is the standard test to follow and manage these patients. Because of the
      inherent imaging characteristics of I-123, there is suboptimal resolution within the images,
      causing them to appear somewhat blurry, which reduces our ability to find small areas of
      disease. A chemical that uses positron emission tomography should allow much better
      resolution of the images, which could improve patient care by allowing us to find small areas
      of disease that, if untreated, could result in tumor relapse. We have developed
      18F-fluorodopamine (18F-DA) for PET imaging in our patients with neuroblastoma.

      The primary objective is to explore the safety of 18F-DA in patients with known or suspected
      neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      biodistribution of 18F-DA in patients with neuroblastoma and compare the biodistribution of
      18F-DA with the biodistribution of 123I-mIBG.

      Patients receive an intravenous injection of a small (tracer) dose of 18F-DA. Approximately 1
      hour later, patients undergo PET scanning of the entire body to evaluate the localization of
      the tracer.

    <description>The adverse events will be recorded and monitored up to two days after the injection of radiotracer 18F-DA. The 95% CI for the adverse event rate will be calculated and reported. If one adverse event grade 2 or above, attributable to study drug, the study will be stopped until completion of IRB review and a decision about whether the study should be modified or closed.</description>

    <description>The localization of 18F-DA throughout the whole body will be described descriptively in different organs such as salivary glands, heart, liver, kidneys, bladder, and bowel. The frequency of the localization of 18F-DA in those regions will be listed. Unexpected sites of uptake, such as bone or focally within soft tissue, are not normal and will be considered abnormal and documented descriptively as well.</description>

    <description>Standardized uptake values of soft tissue and tumor (SUV) will be generated by drawing regions of interest on the images scaled to SUV. Descriptive statistics of SUV values, such as max SUV, from 18F-DA and 123I-mIBG PET will be provided.</description>

    <description>The Curie scoring of 18F-DA and 123I-mIBG imaging will be scored for each participant. The difference of the Curie scoring between the two imaging will be calculated for each patient. Summary statistics of the difference such as mean and standard deviation would be calculated. One sample t test or signed rank test may be used to test whether the difference is equal to 0 depending on whether the distribution of the difference is normal or not.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma are eligible. 18F-DA
        PET/CT scanning will not be the initial imaging study in a newly diagnosed patient.

        Patients with positive findings on prior imaging within the past 4 weeks are eligible.

        Prior therapy is allowed.

        Patients &gt; 1 year of age, under the care of a SJCRH physician.

        Patients of both genders, and all ethnic groups, under the care of a SJCRH physician.

        Female participants of childbearing age must not be lactating due to theoretical potential
        harm to the infant from exposure to radiation.

        Informed consent signed by participant, parent, or guardian according to the guidelines of
        the institutional review board.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Inability or unwillingness of patient, parent, or guardian to consent.

        Pregnancy or lactation. Future plans for pregnancy do not exclude patient participation.
        Patient should not become pregnant within one month of completion of 18F-DA PET scan.

        Use of medications known to interfere with 123I-mIBG uptake (principal considerations are
        phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine containing compounds which need to be discontinued for 48
        hours, and labetalol which needs to be discontinued for 6 weeks).

        Patients less than 3 years of age who require a total length of anesthesia time greater
        than 3 hours (for the FLOPET scan in conjunction with another clinical procedure requiring
        sedation) will be excluded from the study.
