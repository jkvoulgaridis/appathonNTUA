    <description>AMNIOEXCEL Plus is a human placental-based tissue consisting of dehydrated, tri-layer Placental (Amnion/Chorion/Amnion) Allograft Membrane (T-PAM) layers. T-PAM is a minimally manipulated placental membrane product made from tissues donated by pre-screened mothers during planned C-sections and is intended for use as a wound covering. This product is an allograft tissue intended for homologous use for the repair, reconstruction and replacement of skin at the direction of a physician. AMNIOEXCEL Plus contains Human Cellular and Tissue Based Products (HCT/P) as defined by US FDA 21 CFR Part 1271. All donor recoveries are performed by BioDlogics, LLC, and adhere to the regulations regarding HCT/P recovery and the screening and testing of the tissue donor as verified through supplier audits.</description>

    <description>bi-layered skin substitute: the epidermal layer is formed by human keratinocytes and has a well-differentiated stratum corneum; the dermal layer is composed of human fibroblasts in a bovine Type I collagen lattice. It is indicated for use with standard therapeutic compression for the treatment of non-infected partial and full-thickness skin ulcers due to venous insufficiency of greater than 1-month duration and which have not adequately responded to conventional ulcer therapy. This product is also indicated for use with standard DFU care for the treatment of full-thickness neuropathic DFUs of greater than three weeks' duration which have not adequately responded to conventional ulcer therapy and which extend through the dermis but without tendon, muscle, capsule or bone exposure.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject was previously randomized and treated under this clinical study protocol.

          2. The study ulcer has features that necessitates surgical operating-room debridement
             and/or penetrates to capsule/tendon/bone.

          3. The subject is unable to safely ambulate with the use of a study required offloading
             boot.

          4. The subject has suspected or confirmed gangrene or wound infection of the study ulcer.

          5. The subject has suspected or confirmed osteomyelitis.

          6. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject has received or is scheduled to
             receive during study participation, a medication or treatment which is known to
             interfere with or affect the rate and quality of wound healing

          7. The subject has a history of bone cancer or metastatic disease of the affected limb,
             radiation therapy to the foot, or has had chemotherapy prior to signing the Informed
             Consent Form for trial participation.

          8. The subject is currently pregnant or is actively trying to conceive.

          9. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is unable to comply with the treatment

         10. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject has a history of, or is currently
             diagnosed with, any illness or condition, other than diabetes, that could interfere
             with wound healing.

         11. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject has a condition that could inhibit
             wound healing.

         12. The subject has ulcers secondary to a disease other than diabetes.

          <description>A Marketed Comparator: bi-layered skin substitute: the epidermal layer is formed by human keratinocytes and has a well-differentiated stratum corneum; the dermal layer is composed of human fibroblasts in a bovine Type I collagen lattice. It is indicated for use with standard therapeutic compression for the treatment of non-infected partial and full-thickness skin ulcers due to venous insufficiency of greater than 1-month duration and which have not adequately responded to conventional ulcer therapy. This product is also indicated for use with standard DFU care for the treatment of full-thickness neuropathic DFUs of greater than three weeks’ duration which have not adequately responded to conventional ulcer therapy and which extend through the dermis but without tendon, muscle, capsule or bone exposure.</description>
