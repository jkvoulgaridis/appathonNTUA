  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to see how people's diets, other aspects of their lifestyles
      affect their chances of getting gallbladder carcinoma. This survey will enroll several
      hundred patients who have had gallbladder carcinoma，as well as hospital controls with
      gallstones and community controls from study site. The investigators will compare these three
      groups of subjects to see what factors may lead to gallbladder carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will conduct a case-control study in 11 hospitals from China. Cases will be
      the patients with newly-diagnosed gallbladder carcinoma. The hospital controls will be
      matched （1：1）by sex，race and age which will be selected from the patients receiving
      cholecystectomy due to gallstones from the same hospital with the cases. The community
      controls will be matched（1：1） by sex，race and age which will be selected from the same
      community with the cases.

      There will be 200 cases with gallbladder carcinoma, 200 hospital controls and 200 community
      controls. The investigators will interview participants about known and potential risk
      factors for gallbladder carcinoma and obtain information on diet. The investigators will
      obtain the blood and urine samples for further analysis of metabolomics studies. The
      investigators will use logistic regression to determine odds ratios for disease with various
      exposures.
