  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests that children and adolescents with cancer are at heightened risk
      of late effects that can occur months or years after cancer treatment, yet little is known
      about programs that increase their return for follow-up cancer care and late effects
      surveillance. This study will evaluate the impact of an electronic personal health record and
      education system, SurvivorLink, for pediatric cancer survivors and their caregivers. The
      researchers will develop a standardized intervention and training for the SurvivorLink trial,
      followed by conducting a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation, clustered randomized,
      waitlist control trial to evaluate the impact of SurvivorLink on pediatric cancer patients'
      one year follow-up visits and completion of screening tests. The study will also assess the
      impact of SurvivorLink on caregiver's patient activation, survivor's and caregiver's quality
      of life, and self-efficacy to manage a chronic condition. This study will provide the
      evidence base about the effects of the system to improve follow-up care for children and
      adolescents with cancer and best practices for implementation for pediatric cancer centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions for caregivers and pediatric cancer survivors are needed to improve
      patient-centered care, minimize late effects and promote overall well-being. The purpose of
      this research is to assess the impact of the SurvivorLink system on implementation and
      adherence to cancer care and late effects visits/screening. This research projects proposes
      to develop a standardized process by which to implement SurvivorLink, a personal electronic
      health record and education system, designed to promote survivor care, within pediatric
      cancer clinics. This study will use a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation, clustered
      randomized, waitlist control design to evaluate the impact of SurvivorLink on patient health
      behavior and quality of life outcomes and understand its delivery among 20 pediatric cancer
      survivor clinics. The researchers will test the effectiveness of SurvivorLink on 1 year
      follow-up and completed screenings through a clustered randomized waitlist-control trial: ten
      clinics will administer the intervention to study participants and the other ten clinics will
      be a wait-list control group where study participants receive usual care.

      The study will evaluate the impact of SurvivorLink on patient survivor care visit attendance
      and risk-based surveillance tests, caregiver's patient activation, survivor's and caregiver's
      quality of life and self-efficacy to manage a chronic condition. This study is the first
      comprehensive, effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the impact of an electronic
      personal health record (with care plan) and education system for pediatric cancer survivors
      and their caregivers.

    <intervention_model_description>20 pediatric cancer survivor clinics will be pair matched based on patient population size, level of current suvivorship care, and location (urban/rural). The pairs will be randomized to receive the intervention immediately or after 12 months. Selection and randomization of clinics will occur in 2019. Participants (survivors aged 18-22, or caretakers of survivors under age 18) will be recruited from the participating centers.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Activation Measure (PAM) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a 10-item survey assessing the patient's or caretaker's knowledge, confidence, and willingness to act concerning their own or their child's health. Respondents indicate how much the agree with health related statements on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Raw scores range from 10 to 40 and higher scores indicate increased confidence with managing health.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver quality of life will be assessed with the 10-item Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), Global Health Short Form. This survey is used to evaluate parents' and caregivers' report of their own physical and mental health quality of life. The scoring system allows each of the individual items to be examined separately to gain information about perceptions of physical, mental, and social health, and general perceptions of health. Respondents rate their level of a variety of aspects of health on a scale of 1 to 5 and rate their level of pain between 0 and 10. Responses to some questions are re-coded so that higher scores reflect better functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change in intention to seek cancer-related follow-up care</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants and caregivers will be asked how likely it is that they (or their child) will go to a cancer follow-up visit in the next year. Possible responses include 1 = not sure, 2 =not likely, 3 = likely or 4 = very likely.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with oncology care will be assessed with the 25-item Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Health Care Satisfaction Hematology/Oncology Module. The module will be used to capture parent's general satisfaction, satisfaction with staff communication and interaction style, satisfaction with information amount and timeliness, and satisfaction with the staff's emotional support for both the patient and parent. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = very dissatisfied and 5 = very satisfied. Total raw scores range from 25 to 125 and higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Change in Readiness for Transition Questionnaire (RTQ), Adolescent Behavior score</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The survivor's readiness for care transition will be assessed with the Readiness for Transition Questionnaire (RTQ). Adolescent behavior is assessed with 10-items asking participants to rate the level of responsibility that the cancer survivor has for their own care on a scale of 1 (not responsible at all) to 4 (almost always responsible). Total scores for this section range from 10 to 40 with higher scores indicating increased responsibility taken.</description>

Parental involvement is assessed with 10-items rating the level of involvement by parents for the health care of the cancer survivor on a scale of 1 (not involved at all) to 4 (almost always involved). Total scores for this section range from 10 to 40 with higher scores indicating increased parental involvement.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS -Global Health scale consists of 10 items assessing general domains of health and functioning. The scoring system allows each of the individual items to be examined separately to gain information about perceptions of physical, mental, and social health, and general perceptions of health. Respondents rate their level of a variety of aspects of health on a scale of 1 to 5 and rate their level of pain between 0 and 10.

    <description>The Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease is a 6-item Scale that measures activities related to daily self care in living with a chronic disease. Respondents rate their level of confidence in performing these activities on a scale of 1=not at all to 10=totally confident. Total scores range from 6 to 60 and higher scores indicate increased feelings of self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>SurvivorLink (www.cancersurvivorlink.org) was developed in 2010 as a HIPAA compliant web-based communication tool to enable survivors to learn about survivorship care, store their SHP and other important health documents, and share their SHP and other health documents with their various healthcare providers. Once the registrant creates their health record, they can upload and store their important health documents and electronically share their health record with their providers. Other key features include a provider directory for patients to find physicians knowledgeable of survivor care, additional patient/parent material available in English/Spanish, and additional continuing medical education (CME) modules for providers to learn about survivor care.</description>
