  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if there is a difference between the development of the
      brain (neurodevelopment) in children who have been treated for retinoblastoma with multiple
      anesthetic exposures, compared with brain development in children who have never had
      anesthesia.

    <description>The primary outcome is based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 5th edition (WISC-V) measured at follow up. The 5 primary index scores on the WISC-V (Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed) are based on 10 subtests and represent intellectual functioning in different cognitive areas. Similar to the FSIQ, the primary index scores are on a standard score metric with a mean of 100 (SD=15). The WISC-V consists of 16 subtests; each subtest is based on a scaled score metric with a mean of 10 and standard deviation (SD) of 3. Performance on these domain-specific subtests will be summarized and analyzed similarly to the FSIQ.</description>

    <description>the WISC-V assessment produces a Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) used for primary power consideration in this study. The FSIQ is the most comprehensive global ability score on the WISC-V, and it has been conventionally reported and interpreted as an estimation of overall intellectual ability</description>
