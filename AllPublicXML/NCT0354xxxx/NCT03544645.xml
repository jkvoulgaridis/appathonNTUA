      fixed believes and knowledge that either not precise or overestimated, and compare with
      classic educational method such as Brochure. As many researches indicates the difficulties to
      initiate insulin therapy for type 2 diabetic patients due to overestimated barriers such as
      needle anxiety, feelings of guilt and failure, concerns about hypoglycemia, sense of loss of
      control over one's life and reduced quality of life. This research will introduce different
      educational tools to evaluate their effectiveness in breaking psychological insulin barriers.

      Methodology It's a randomized controlled trial. Validated questionnaire (ITAS) was used to
      evaluate the psychological insulin barriers, video and Brochures were devolved as educational
      materials contain same contents and validated. Study conducted in King Abdulaziz city housing
      with total sample size of 126. They were divided into intervention group (video group) and
      controlled group (Brochure group). Both group filled the same questionnaire before the

      filled the same questionnaire to measure the long-term effects.
