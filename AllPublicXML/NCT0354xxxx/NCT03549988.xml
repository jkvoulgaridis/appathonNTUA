  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:

      Pro-active home fecal calprotectin testing in patients with Ulcerative Colitis will allow
      early detection and treatment of inflammation to prevent symptomatic flares. This will result
      in less steroid use, fewer hospitalizations and a reduced risk of surgery, as well as
      improved quality of life and adherence to medication.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that fecal calprotectin (FC) may be useful to predict relapse of
      inflammatory bowel disease and response to treatment. Current methods for measurement of FC
      require bringing stool samples to the laboratory or physician's office. The test is either
      not readily available or is expensive for patients. Some patients also find it inconvenient
      to collect, transport and travel to return the sample.

      A prior study in our institution showed that only 77% of patients returned samples for
      processing. Therefore, a home-based kit may offer greater uptake by patients as samples do
      not need to be returned to a lab or physician's office. Regular monitoring of patients at
      home may allow the detection and prediction of flares before the appearance of symptoms. With
      earlier treatment, the risk of complications may be minimized and the quality of life for
      people living with this disease may be improved.

    <measure>The time to a symptomatic flare, defined as an increase in partial Mayo score &gt; 2 points from baseline or a rectal bleeding score &gt; 1</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients in both control and intervention group will be contacted every 6 months until end of study. Partial Mayo and rectal bleeding score will be obtained and if there is an increase in partial Mayo score &gt; 2 points from baseline or a rectal bleeding score &gt; 1, this is considered as flare. Endoscopy will be performed wherever possible.</description>

    <measure>Hospitalization, surgery, steroid or biologic use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Medical adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medical adherence is measured by completing the on-line Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) questionnaire and patient report number of missed medication doses. Scale consist of 8 questions answerable by yes/no. Single point score is assigned to each question answered &quot;no&quot; to questions 1-3 and 6-7. A point is given in question 5 for an answer of &quot;yes.&quot; Question 8 has a five- point Likert response scale. Total scores range from 0 to 8, with scores of 8 reflecting high adherence, 7 or 6 reflecting medium adherence, and &lt;6 reflecting low adherence.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life measured by SIBDQ questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured by Short Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SIBDQ) questionnaire. Both control and intervention group will be asked to complete these questionnaires on-line during baseline, month 6, 12 and month 18.
The SIBDQ provide a measure of subjective health status or quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It consists of four domains, bowel symptoms, emotional health, systemic systems and social function. The total score ranges from 10 (worst health) to 70 (best health).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life measured by EQ-5D 5L questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured by EQ-5D 5L health questionnaire. Both control and intervention group will be asked to complete these questionnaires on-line during baseline, month 6, 12 and month 18.
The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status. It comprises of 5 dimensions like mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state. This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of fecal calprotectin with endoscopic activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic disease activity is measured by Mayo score. The Mayo Endoscopic Score is classified into the following four categories: 0, normal mucosa or inactive disease; 1, mild disease with erythema, decreased vascular patterns and mild friability; 2, moderate disease with marked erythema, absence of vascular patterns, friability and erosions; 3, severe disease with spontaneous bleeding and ulceration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of fecal calprotectin with histologic disease activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A histologic scoring index is a system used to assess the patient's disease severity using tissue sample. In this study, the Robarts Histology Index (RHI) is used. The RHI can be calculated as 1 x chronic inflammatory infiltrate (4 levels) plus 2 x lamina propria neutrophils (4 levels) plus 3 x neutrophils in epithelium (4 levels) plus 5 x erosion or ulceration (4 levels after combining Geboes 5:1 and 5:2).
Score takes into consideration histologic variables like crypt abscesses, presence of granulation tissue or aggregates of inflammatory elements in the superficial part of the mucosa, indicative of erosions or ulcers, neutrophils in the lamina propria.</description>

    <description>The group will receive current standard of care as the usual practice of the attending physician. Basic research data will be collected and participants in this group will be asked to complete the on-line questionnaires (MMAS-8, SIBDQ and EQ-5D 5L) on the baseline visit and month 6, 12 and month 18.
When endoscopy is performed biopsies should be taken and the endoscopic and histologic assessment will be recorded. If a fecal calprotectin is measured, every effort should be made to use the IBDoc with the result being sent to the central primary investigator via the IBDoc Web Portal. However, should a different fecal calprotectin measure be used, this will be recorded as part of the study documentation and will be included in the study data.</description>

    <description>Each IBDocTM kit measure one fecal calprotectin value. The IBDoc® is an in-vitro diagnostic immunoassay analyzed by a downloadable smartphone application (CalApp®). A patient is able to process their stool at home using a test cassette.
The IBDocTM test results are displayed in a light signal system as three titre categories; normal &lt;100 µg/g (green), 100-300 µg/g (yellow), &gt;300 µg/g (high). Patients' results will be sent directly to the central research coordinator through the IBDoc® Web Portal. If the FC is &gt;250 µg/g a second FC will be performed within 2 weeks. If this result is &lt;250 µg/g patients will continue to monitor their FC every 2 months. If the second result is &gt;250 µg/g, the attending physician will review the patient either by telephone or in the office within 7 days.</description>
