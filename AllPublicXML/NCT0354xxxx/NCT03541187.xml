  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific evidence has shown that, over the past two decades, the combination of cockroach
      allergy and cockroach exposure is one of the most important factors contributing to the
      dramatic increase in asthma morbidity seen in inner city children with asthma. Therefore, a
      major goal of the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) is to evaluate the efficacy of
      cockroach immunotherapy in inner city asthma.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine if asthma severity can be improved by
      cockroach subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1:1 randomized, double-masked (blind), placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with 2
      treatment arms:

        -  German Cockroach Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) + guideline-based standard asthma
           care, OR

        -  Placebo (for German Cockroach Subcutaneous Immunotherapy [SCIT]) + guideline-based
           standard asthma care

      The study will occur in two parts - Part A and Part B:

      - Part A will enroll 80 participants 8 to 17 years of age, who are sensitized to cockroach,
      have asthma, and a positive cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) before treatment
      randomization.

      An interim analysis will be conducted when all Part A participants have completed their
      12-month NAC. If an effect is seen for the Part A NAC analysis, the study will proceed to
      Part B.

      -Part B will enroll 220 participants 6 to 16 years of age, who are sensitized to cockroach
      and have asthma. A positive NAC will not be required for inclusion into Part B.

      The study will be based on a continuous treatment schedule with German cockroach allergenic
      extract or placebo, up to a maximum of 36 months.
