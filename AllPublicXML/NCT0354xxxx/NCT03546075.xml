  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Increased cerebral vaso-dilation during cognitive demand is hypothesised to
      improve cognitive performance due to an improved micronutrient status. Despite previous
      research demonstrating that oral resveratrol can modulate cerebral haemodynamics, this has
      not translated into expected improvements to cognitive performance in young, healthy
      populations. As the brain is the most metabolic organ in the body, even subtle changes to
      fuel utilization and overall energy expenditure are detectable during cognitive demand. The
      measurement of both overall energy expenditure and fuel utilization may provide further
      insight to the effects of resveratrol and whether oral supplementation of this polyphenol can
      provide clear, cognitive benefits in a young, healthy sample.

      Objectives: The current study investigated the metabolic consequences of resveratrol on whole
      body metabolism and fuel oxidisation during cognitive performance.

      Methods: This repeated measures, double blind, placebo controlled, balanced design required
      participants (N=24 for metabolic activity &amp; N=26 for cognitive outcomes) to complete a serial
      subtraction demand battery at baseline, 45 minutes, 2 and 3 hours following 500 mg, 250 mg
      trans-resveratrol or inert placebo, on three separate occasions whilst connected to an
      on-line gas analysis system.

    <description>Participants completed three Serial subtraction tasks (Serial 3, 7 &amp; 17). Outcomes measured from all three of these tasks were the number correct entries and number of errors. The addition of the two outcomes can also provide a 'total' number of responses entered.</description>
