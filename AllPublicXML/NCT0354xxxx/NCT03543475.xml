  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Worldwide, about
      15 million babies are born too soon every year, causing 1.1 million deaths, as well as short-
      and long-term disability in countless survivors.

      Different strategies have been studied for prevention of spontaneous PTB (SPTB) in randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), including progesterone, cerclage, cervical pessary, as well as
      lifestyle modification, such as smoking cessation, diet, aerobic exercise, and nutritional
      supplements. Most successful effort to reduce the incidence of SPTB have focused on
      asympatomatic women with risk factors, such as prior SPTB or short cervix. However, most SPTB
      occur in symptomatic women, i.e. women with preterm labor (PTL). Women with arrested PTL are
      at increased risk of SPTB.

      The cervical pessary is a silicone device that has been used to prevent SPTB. The leading
      hypotheses for its mechanisms are two: that the pessary helps to keep the cervix closed, and
      that the pessary changes the inclination of the cervical canal so that the pregnancy weight
      is not directly above the internal os.

      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of pessary in reducing preterm birth in women
      with arrested preterm labor
