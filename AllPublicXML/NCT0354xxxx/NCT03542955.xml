  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ActiPatch is an FDA cleared pain therapy device that uses pulsed shortwaves to interrupt
      pain signals at the nerve. 200 patients will be randomized and divided into an ActiPatch
      treatment group and comparison analgesic drug therapy group . Subjects will be assessed with
      the Neck Disability Index (NDI) at baseline and at four weeks and VAS scores will be recorded
      in order to determine the efficacy of the ActiPatch device compared to Etoricoxib. Cervical
      osteoarthritis causes chronic neck pain which could potentially be alleviated by the
      ActiPatch without the use of medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical Osteoarthritis causes chronic pain in the neck due to the discs of the spine
      breaking down, losing fluid, and becoming stiffer over time. As obesity and age increase, the
      likelihood of cervical osteoarthritis increases as well. When the pain caused by the broken
      down discs becomes severe, it may result in a loss of mobility in the neck region. Chronic
      neck pain has a serious impact on not only quality of life, but can also negatively affect a
      persons ability to lead a healthy active lifestyle. Standard analgesic therapy it limited in
      efficacy and can result in serious adverse effects specially with long term use.

    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation. The NDI has sufficient support and usefulness to retain its current status as the most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain.
The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. Al the points can be summed to a total score. The test can be interpretated as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage. A higher score indicates more patient-rated disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale [VAS] is a measure of pain intensity. It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (called horizontal visual analogue scale) or,vertical called vertical visual analog scale usually 10 cm or 100 mm length [both the gradations are used]. It is anchored by two verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme.
There could be variation in verbal descriptor anchors depending on intended use of the scale.
For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [on 100-mm scale]</description>
