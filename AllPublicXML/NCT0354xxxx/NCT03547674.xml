  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) in children and adolescents is frequently accompanied by gait
      abnormalities. Ankle-foot orthoses (AFO) have been suggested to improve the gait pattern.
      Compared to conventional AFO, modular AFO offer the opportunity to tune its response to the
      patient's gait characteristics and/or functional maturity. However, the evidence level is
      still small and AFO tuning is not yet established in clinical routine. The study will
      investigate individual tuning of custom-built ankle-foot-orthoses (AFO) using gait analyses

    <measure>gait profile score (GPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at end of study, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>overall score calculated from all kinematic parameters (joint rotation angles) of the affected leg and expressed as the deviation from the normal gait cycle in degrees. The mean GPS was anticipated to be 9째 with standard deviation of 1.4째 [2]. A good (r = 0.5) correlation of GPS for the within-subjects comparison was assumed. The non-inferiority margin was set at the minimally clinically important difference of 1.6째.</description>

    <measure>Movement analysis profile (MAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>at end of study, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>calculated from kinematic parameters and expressed as the deviation from the normal gait cycle in degrees. The MAP consists of individual scores for each joint rotation angle (pelvic tilt, pelvic obliquity, pelvic rotation, hip flexion/extension, hip abduction/adduction, hip rotation, knee flexion/extension, ankle dorsiflexion/extension and foot progression) of the affected leg</description>

    <description>calculated from kinematic parameters and expressed as the deviation from the normal gait cycle in degrees,Spatio-temporal parameters are walking speed (m/s), cadence (steps/min x 100) and stride length (m) of the affected leg</description>

    <description>Gait analysis under 4 conditions (barefoot, shoes only, untuned AFO with shoes, tuned AFO with shoes) will be performed in a random order. AFO are walking aids to improve gait pathologies. They are custom-built using plaster casts. AFO for equinus and/or drop foot pathologies are specifically indicated to control excessive ankle plantar flexion. Push-up elements that return the energy from the stance-phase to support lifting the foot during the swing-phase (similar to a spring) are used.</description>

    <description>Gait analysis under 4 conditions (barefoot, shoes only, untuned AFO with shoes, tuned AFO with shoes) will be performed in a random order. Modular AFO tuning means that patients try different pushup elements with varying stiffness and design before the final design is determined.</description>
