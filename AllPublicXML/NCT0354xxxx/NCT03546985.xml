  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, single-use, active-controlled, two-stage open study of
      episil®. The purpose of this study is to assess the local analgesic effect of episil® in
      cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy- and/or radiation-induced oral mucositis, which
      will provide scientific and reliable clinical data in the product registration in China.
