      Rapid Action Insulin (RAI) absorption and action measured by time to reach maximum insulin
      concentration and glucose infusion rate.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that RAI absorption and action measured by time to reach
      maximum insulin concentration and glucose infusion rate during the clamp study will be
      significantly faster when insulin bolus is delivered using the &quot;Quick Bolus&quot; feature as
      compared to the &quot;Standard Bolus&quot;.

    <description>Examine if an alteration in speed of insulin delivery translates into a time to peak glucose infusion rate (amount of glucose given via dextrose infusion) to maintain euglycemia (80-120 mg/dl). The investigators will obtain a blood glucose every 5 minutes and adjust the dextrose infusion to maintain a blood glucose at around 90 - 100 mg/dL (normal blood glucose). So the goal will not be to lower blood glucose, but to deliver an amount of insulin at a normal blood glucose and then provide intravenous glucose at variable rates and determine how much glucose was needed to keep blood sugar steady.</description>
