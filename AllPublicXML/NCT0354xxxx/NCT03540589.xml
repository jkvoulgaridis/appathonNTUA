  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccine pain control is one of the actions suggested to support the delivery of vaccines that
      are on a vaccine schedule, since pain and anxiety associated with vaccines are among the main
      reasons why children and their parents fail to do them properly. Thus, it is very important
      to investigate which interventions can bring greater benefit in the control of pain.This is a
      randomized clinical trial aiming to assess the impact of video distraction and vibration
      device on pain during the vaccination of children between one and three years.

    <description>A video will be available as soon as the child is randomized to this group, thus enabling the child to become more involved with distraction. A tablet will be delivered to the parents in the reception room to be viewed by the child before entering the vaccine room. After entering the room, the parents will keep the child entertained with the videos. There will be several videos, and it may be optional for the parents to choose according to their preferences.</description>
