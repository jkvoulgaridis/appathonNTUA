  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mnesic function has not, at present, been evaluated in patients with Kabuki Syndrome. Some
      data from the neuroimagery suggest an impairment of memory function. The objective of our
      study is to assess the mnesic function of children with Kabuki Syndrom.

      Kabuki Syndrome (SK - OMIM 147920 and 300867 ORPHA: 2322) is a rare genetic disease with a
      prevalence of approximately 1/32 000 and responsible for a malformation syndrome with mild to
      moderate intellectual impairment. SK is due to mutations in the KMT2D and KDM6A genes. As
      part of a national PHRC (AOM 07-090, clinicaltrial NCT01314534, The investigators were able
      to perform psychometric tests type WISC4 and MRI type VBM). Disability in SK is characterized
      by a heterogeneous cognitive profile with strengths and weaknesses when calculating IQ. Brain
      MRI reveals small hippocampi compared to controls. These 2 data are partly contradictory
      because the strengths of the patients with SK are a working memory and a verbal comprehension
      index high compared to the other indices of the tests WISC-IV.

      The objective of the research is to better understand the mnesic function of children with
      SK.

      25 children aged 6 to 16 will be recruited. The diagnosis of SK will have been authenticated
      by the demonstration of a mutation in the KMT2D or KDM6A gene.

      The memory assessments will be conducted in one visit for each child, who will perform a
      memory assessment with a neuropsychologist, using the CMS scale.
