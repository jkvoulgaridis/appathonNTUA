  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study. Electronic chart review at respective centers will be the only
      database used. No patient contact or additional procedures will be conducted.

      The main objectives are:

      A) To evaluate the use of AXIOS in Endoscopic transmural drainage of Pancreatic fluid
      collections (PFC) in terms of clinical success and technical success.

      B) To assess the rates, management, need for re-intervention, need for surgery, etiology and
      characteristics of Pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) on the occurrence of AXIOS- related
      related adverse events(AE).

      This is a retrospective study. Electronic chart review at respective centers will be the only
      database used. No patient contact or additional procedures will be conducted.

      Data that will be recorded on review of electronic medical record database include:

      I. Demographics (age, gender) II. Indication for procedure III. Diagnosis and findings
      including radiologic findings IV. Prior endoscopy treatments V. Type and number of stents
      used VI. Pancreatic fluid collection location and measurements VII. Procedure time VIII.
      Technical success IX. Clinical success X. Adverse events XI. Management of adverse events
      XII. Recurrence of pancreatic fluid collections XIII. Follow-up time

      The above data will be collected and recorded in an excel sheet. The data collection will be
      completely de-identified and password protected. The file will be emailed using an
      institution email and encrypted. The password will be given in a separate email or by phone
      call.

      Inclusion:

      All patients undergoing endoscopic management of pancreatic fluid collections between January
      2011 to June 2017

      Exclusion:

      Age under 18

      We will enroll 100 record between January 2011 to June 2017.

      Time for collecting data:

      1 month for data collection and 3 weeks for data analysis.
