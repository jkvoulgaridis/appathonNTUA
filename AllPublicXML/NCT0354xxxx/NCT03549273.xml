    <textblock>
      Phase II clinical trial, monocentric, not controlled, in patients with high grade cervical
      intraepithelial lesions. A total of 62 patients with a diagnosis of CIN II, III or carcinoma
      in situ will be included. It is expected that with the combination of natural products
      Glizigen® and Ocoxin®-Viusid® at least 60% of patients with treated intraepithelial lesions
      (IEL) have a global response (complete or partial), with elimination of the human
      papillomavirus and the viral load.

      Main objective: To evaluate the effect of the combination of Glizigen® and Ocoxin®-Viusid® in
      the treatment of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions. Specific objectives: 1. To
      evaluate the overall response (colposcopic, histological and virological) in patients treated
      with the combination of the natural products Glizigen® and Ocoxin®-Viusid® in the treatment
      of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions. 2. Evaluate the colposcopic response in
      patients treated with the combination of natural products. 3. Evaluate the histological
      response in patients treated with the combination of natural products after conization. 4.
      Evaluate the virological response in patients treated with the combination of natural
      products. 5.Describe adverse events during treatment.
