  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction is known as a chronic relapsing brain disorder that has a high cost to patients,
      family and society. Its ranking in cause of death is 8th globally, and substance abuse
      contributes 5.4% of the total global burden of disease. Brain stimulation procedures such as
      repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and trans-cranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) are considered minimal risk interventions and are used for the treatment
      of depression, pain, and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. There is some evidence
      that rTMS applied to the left prefrontal cortex results in significantly lowered craving. To
      date, no studies have investigated the effects of a course of either rTMS or tDCS treatment
      on opioid craving, brain function, and relapse prevention in opioid addicts. Individuals with
      prescription opioid dependence experience high rates of desire and intense cravings to use
      opioids. The present study aims to examine the effects of a course of daily prefrontal rTMS
      and tDCS on brain function, desire and craving and help to relapse prevention in abstinence
      phase.

      The investigators plan to compare and contrast TMS and tDCS alone or in combination to treat
      opioid abuse. We will use a 4 cell randomised parallel controlled trial, consisting of active
      or sham TMS, and active or sham tDCS [a-tDCS, a-TMS; s-tDCS, a-TMS; a-tDCS, s-TMS; s-tDCS,
      s-TMS). The investigators hypothesise that each of the active interventions alone will be
      superior to pure sham in reducing craving and use. Moreover, The investigators hypothesise
      that COMBINING the two active treatments will be synergistic and will produce the largest
      reductions in craving and use.

    <description>Applying active tDCS AND active TMS will reduce cue induced craving and opioid use, more than sham TMS AND sham tDCS and also either active TMS OR active tDCS alone. We will apply 10 daily sessions of brain stimulation (1 hour total treatment time). This is composed of 20 minutes active tDCS (anode on F3 EEG positioning and cathode on contra shoulder), followed by 4000 pulses of real rTMS (10Hz over left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex(DLPFC) for 20 minutes at 120%MT). There will be 10 minutes rest between each module. We will test for cue-induced craving scores using VAS and urine drug screens for opioid abuse in comparison to the control group of sham TMS AND sham tDCS and the groups with only active tDCS OR active TMS.</description>

    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a minimally invasive brain stimulation method that stimulates the brain of an individual focally(George &amp; Belmaker, 2007). TMS pulses that are delivered repetitively and rhythmically are referred to as repetitive TMS (rTMS).
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is another form of non-invasive brain stimulation that is being investigated as an intervention for neurological and psychiatric disorders. A weak direct electrical current (0-2 mA) flows between two small electrodes via saline soaked sponges placed on the scalp (Nitsche MA et al, 2008).</description>
