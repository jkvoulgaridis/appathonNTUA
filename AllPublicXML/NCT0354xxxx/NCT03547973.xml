    <textblock>
      This is an international, multi-center, open-label, phase II study in patients with
      metastatic urothelial cancer after failure of platinum-based regimen or anti-PD-1 /PD-L1
      based immunotherapy.

      At least 201 patients are anticipated to be enrolled across approximately 40 sites from North
      America and Europe.

      This is an international, multi-center, open-label, phase II study in patients with
      metastatic urothelial cancer after failure of platinum-based regimen and/or anti-PD-1 / PD-L1
      based immunotherapy.

      The primary objective is Objective Response Rate (ORR) based on central review.

      The secondary objectives for Cohorts 1 and 2 are Duration of Response (DOR) and Progression
      Free Survival (PFS) both based on central review and Overall Survival (OS).

      The secondary objectives for Cohort 3 are Duration of Response (DOR),Clinical Benefit Rate
      (CBR), and Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on central review by Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria; Duration of Response (DOR),Clinical Benefit
      Rate (CBR), and Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on central review for Immune-based
      therapeutics (iRECIST) criteria, Overall Survival (OS), safety and tolerability of IMMU-132
      in combination with pembrolizumab.

      Subjects will receive IMMU-132 10 mg/kg administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a
      21-day cycle to be continued in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      In Cohort 3, all subjects will first receive IMMU-132 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle
      followed by pembrolizumab at the standard approved dose (200 mg) only on Day 1 of a 21-day
      cycle. After discontinuation of treatment, patients will have a 30-day safety follow-up after
      last dose and then will be followed every 12 weeks for survival for a maximum of 2 years.
