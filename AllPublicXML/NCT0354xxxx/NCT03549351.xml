      Objectives To demonstrate that measurable residual disease assessed by multiparameter flow
      cytometry during intensive treatment is a surrogate for overall survival and thus an early
      read-out for drug efficacy Study design Surrogate endpoint trial to establish that measurable
      residual disease assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry during intensive treatment is a
      surrogate for overall survival

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder with an
      incidence of 3 to 4 per 100 000 men and women per year and a median age at diagnosis of about
      70 years. Prognosis, especially in older patients, has remained very poor. In patients
      considered suitable for intensive chemotherapy, the combination of an anthracycline and
      cytarabine remains the standard of care. For patients achieving a complete remission (CR),
      postremission therapy (PRT) ranging from chemotherapy to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation is required; intensive PRT is still under debate in older patients. Beyond
      pre-treatment genetics-based risk stratification, measurable residual disease (MRD) during
      treatment and follow up emerges as an important prognostic factor in first CR. Furthermore,
      MRD may provide a tool for a read-out of therapeutic efficacy. In this diagnostic meta-study
      the investigators intend to measure MRD using multiparameter flow cytometry across up-front
      randomized clinical trials which in total will accrue more than 1000 patients. According to
      the leukemia-associated phenotype at diagnosis or the different-from-normal approach, MRD
      will be assessed early (after induction) and late (after consolidation) during treatment. The
      aim of the study is to show that levels of MRD measured early during treatment are closely
      related to overall survival and thus may serve as an early surrogate. There is a growing
      public demand that new, promising drugs are approved for therapy as rapidly as possible.
      Therefore, it is of great interest to obtain these approvals based on early biomarker
      endpoints such as MRD rather than on long-term survival endpoints.

    <description>MRD will be assessed using multiparameter flow cytometry early (after induction / salvage).
Survival will be assessed continuously. After 3 and 6 years correlation between MRD and survival will be analysed with respect to treatment effects to assess if MRD may serve as surrogate endpoint.
If levels of MRD measured early during treatment are closely related to overall survival and thus may serve as an early surrogate will be assessed yearly.</description>
