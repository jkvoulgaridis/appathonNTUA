  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-site randomized tral aims to test methods of increasing adoption and integration
      of blood glucose monitoring into electronic medical records, and to measure the impact of
      widescale adoption on health status of patients with diabetes. To investigate determinants of
      adoption, the research will combine and test doctor and patient focused approaches to
      encouraging patient use of blood glucose flow sheets through the online patient portal,
      MyChart. Adoption will be measured on both the extensive and intensive margin: the number of
      patients who enter data into the flowsheets at all during the study period, and the mean
      number of entries per patient during the study period. Conditional on statistically
      significant increases in adoption, the study will examine corresponding intent-to-treat
      effects on patient A1c, and consider other indicators of possible mechanisms through which
      A1c improves or does not improve.

    <description>In the other randomly selected half of primary care practices in the study sample at Inova Health Care Services, practices will be encouraged to batch order blood glucose flowsheets for all patients with diabetes with active MyChart accounts. The research team will contact physicians and practice managers with an explanation of the initiative and instructions for completing batch orders and viewing entries through the system. Additionally, providers will be given a template for a secure smart-text message to send to all patients receiving the flowsheets, instructing them to enter data for the study period. The secure message will also provide them with information on how to enter data, and on the benefits of tracking blood glucose. Of this group of practices, patients will be divided at the individual level into 4 reminder groups. Arm 2a will receive no additional reminder messaging to enter glucose measurements in the electronic flowsheets.</description>
