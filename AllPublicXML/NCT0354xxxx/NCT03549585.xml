  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to build a tool, adapted to the French geriatric
      population, that will predict the risk of death at three months after hospitalization in
      acute geriatric medicine. This tool will be built using selected items via a review of the
      literature published in 2015.

      The 8 items of the CriSTAL tool will be collected prospectively in all patients hospitalized
      successively in the 2 post-emergency geriatric services (PUG) of the University Hospital of
      Toulouse, over a period of 9 months, by a dedicated clinical research associate. Patient
      survival will be assessed by obtaining the vital status of the cohort via CÃ©piDC

      As the population ages, the prevalence of chronic diseases increases. Let's take the example
      of cardiovascular, respiratory or neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. These
      pathologies are at the origin of decompensations requiring sometimes multiple
      hospitalizations. It is clear that the goals of care (curative or palliative) are not always
      related to life expectancy. Decision making, especially in an acute context, is often tricky.
      The use of a tool with certain parameters of the patient could help to guide the reflection.
      The present study propose a tool proposed by an Australian team (CriSTAL), which lists items
      described in the literature as a risk factor for the death of elderly patients. This tool is
      currently being studied in several types of populations around the world (general population,
      cancer patients, hospitalized etc.).

      This is a prospective study aimed at evaluating routine, single-center care, conducted at
      Toulouse University Hospital.

      The successive inclusion of hospitalized patients in Post Emergencies Geriatric (PUG) unity
      will be carried out over a period of 9 months.

      The primary outcome will be the vital status (alive / deceased) at 3 months of
      hospitalization in acute geriatric medicine.

    <description>CriSTAL Tool (Criteria for Screening and Treatment of Appropriate Long-Term Care) is a multidimensional geriatric tool that lists 18 elements of the literature, under construction and validation by an Australian retrospective study. This tool is a practical questionnaire and easy to use in current care, with items adapted to the geriatric dimension. The investigators chose to target hospitalized geriatric patients through emergencies.</description>
