      The PROBE Phase-3 study will collect data on patient reported outcomes, burdens, and
      experiences in patients living with hemophilia. The investigators will perform comparisons
      among countries, within country over time, within country against national normative data.

      BACKGROUND

      The PROBE questionnaire is a tool for the assessment of patient-reported outcome, burdens and
      experiences. Until now, it has been used in persons living with hemophilia (PWH) and healthy
      controls. In phase 1 of the study, the investigators developed the questionnaire. In phase 2
      of the study, the investigators evaluated the reliability, reproducibility, responsiveness,
      and costs of PROBE. The tool has been tested across 21 countries and it has been shown that
      PROBE is a valid questionnaire for the evaluation of patient reported outcomes (PROs) in PWH
      and control populations. The questionnaire is available in 11 languages (with 20 localized
      versions worldwide), and another 17 languages and 45 more localizations are in the process of
      development.

      CURRENT STUDY and FUTURE DIRECTIONS

      Phase 3 is the natural prosecution of the project. In this phase, the investigators aim at
      maintaining the capacity to collect data on PROBE, and the infrastructure will also be
      modified in order to allow for longitudinal collection of PROBE data (in previous phases, the
      investigators only collected anonymized data).

      The objective of the study is to compare data on PROBE between countries, within-countries
      over time, and within-countries against national normative data. Reports will be produced
      every 2 years. Data collected during phase 2 of the study will also be used.

      At the same time, the research framework will have the potential for:

        -  Expanding country participation within existing and new regions.

        -  Integrating the PROBE questionnaire in clinical trials, longitudinal studies, health
           technology assessment studies, routine clinical care, and registries.

        -  Using PROBE in new countries

        -  Testing the performance of the PROBE questionnaire in new patient populations

        Moderate / Severe PWH (Age bands or limits may be utilized to narrow the study population).
        Patients will be recruited according to the final inclusion criteria. No randomization will
        be required. Two moderate to large test runs of the inventory will be conducted in each
        country three months apart to demonstrate reproducibility. PWH participating in each of the
        two test runs may, but would not necessarily be the same.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PWH will be recruited through national hemophilia patient organizations utilizing
             their existing membership rosters, social media outlets and meetings / events. The
             investigators are not proposing a pre-determined method of PWH recruitment. They will
             utilize the information acquired in the workshop and take-home project to inform best
             practice in recruitment methodology for the study. The investigators may consider
             requesting different countries test different PWH recruitment strategies to test
             reproducibility.

        In the future, the questionnaire might also be administered to patients with other chronic
        conditions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease severity and Age bands or age limits (e.g. â‰¥ Age 18) may be utilized to narrow
             the study population.
