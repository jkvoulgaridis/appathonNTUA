  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The type II diabetes is characterized by high levels of blood glucose followed by excessive
      insulin release so that the target cells become less sensitive and develop insulin
      resistance, maintaining hyperglycemic levels. The Whole body vibration session may improve
      the glucose metabolism in diabetic patients by reducing the peripheral blood sugar. Ten
      healthy elderly women and eight diabetic elderly women were allocated into two groups, and
      have made an acute whole body session.
