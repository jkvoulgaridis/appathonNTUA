  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To use a SMART design to evaluate which of four sequences of New Hope (NH), Elders
           Resilience (ER) and Case Management (CM) have the greater effects on immediate and
           longer-term suicidal ideation (primary outcome) and resilience (secondary outcome) among
           American Indian (AI) adolescents ages 10-24 identified at risk for suicide.

           Hypotheses:

           i. New Hope vs. CM alone will significantly reduce participant suicidal ideation.

           ii. Elders Resilience vs. CM alone will significantly improve participant resilience.

           iii. New Hope followed by Elders Resilience will have the strongest effects on suicidal
           ideation and resilience.

           iv. CM alone will have the weakest effects of all combinations.

           Secondary Aims:

        2. To examine mediators and moderators of treatment effectiveness and sequencing in order
           to determine which types and sequence of interventions is best suited for which youth.

        3. To assess the acceptability, feasibility and capacity for sustainability of the Hub's
           key intervention components (Surveillance/Case Management, New Hope and Elders'
           Resilience) from the perspective of multiple stakeholders as they are implemented across
           different tribes.

      The overall goal of the research component of the National Institute of Mental Health funded
      Southwest Hub for American Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Research is to identify effective,
      feasible and sustainable interventions to prevent suicide and promote resilience among
      American Indian (AI) youth. The proposed study will build on 20+ years of behavioral and
      mental health research and partnerships undertaken by the Center for American Indian Health
      (CAIH) at Johns Hopkins with the White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT).

      The investigators primary research aim, to be undertaken with the White Mountain Apache,
      includes: 1) identification and voluntary enrollment of youth 10-24 years old using the WMAT
      established surveillance and case-management (CM) system who recently had a validated suicide
      attempt, ideation, or binge substance use episode with recent suicidal ideation; and 2)
      implementation of a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to inform how to
      combine and tailor two brief interventions delivered by paraprofessional community mental
      health workers (CMHWs), with promising pilot data, to prevent further suicidal thoughts and
      behavior and promote resilience; and 3) evaluate what are the cost savings per study
      participant with the implementation of the Southwest Hub interventions: NH, ER, NH and ER. A
      secondary aim will be to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and sustainability of the
      two brief interventions with other Southwest Hub partners, including the Navajo, San Carlos
      Apache, Hualapai, and Cherokee nations, who will have support from the Administrative Core of
      the Southwest Hub to implement their own local tribal suicide surveillance systems for
      community-based identification of at-risk youth.

      The investigators will employ a SMART design to evaluate the effectiveness of New Hope (NH),
      Elders' Resilience intervention (ER), Case Management (CM) and the combination of these
      approaches on reducing suicidal thoughts and promoting resilience among AI youth ages 10-24
      who are confirmed by surveillance case managers to have experienced suicide ideation, attempt
      or a binge substance use and recent ideation in the past 30 days. Youth who assent will
      complete the baseline (case management visit 1 and will be referred to mental health careâ€”the
      standard protocol for the Apache system). During the same visit, youth will be randomized 1:1
      to either New Hope (NH) plus Case Management (CM), or CM alone, using a blocked randomized
      design, stratifying participants by age and event type. All youth will complete another study
      assessment after 30 days. The 30-day time frame will allow ample time to complete the NH
      intervention with participants and assess any changes in youth's mental health status for all
      study arms. Following another 30-day period, all participants will be re-assessed and
      re-randomized, using the same blocking and 1:1 ratio to either the Elders' Resilience (ER)
      intervention plus CM, or CM alone. To track long term outcomes, all youth will complete a
      final assessment 3 month later (6 months post-enrollment). This study will occur on the White
      Mountain Apache Tribe's Fort Apache reservation.

    <measure>The Children's Hope Scale (CHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Hope Scale (CHS) consists of 6 items and is based on a conceptualization of hope as consisting of two factors: agency and pathways. Agency is defined as the perception by the child that he or she is able to initiate and sustain action toward a goal. The pathways factor involves the child's capability of producing the means to achieve these goals. The CHS includes two subscales measuring agency (3 items) and pathways (3 items). Each item asks the respondent to choose how he/she thinks about himself/herself and how they do things in general on a 6-point scale ranging from &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot;. Scores range from 0 to 18 on each of the two subscales, higher level scores indicate higher levels of agency or pathways respectively. The two subscales are scored to produce an overall hope score for each participant, with higher scores indicating higher levels of overall hope as conceptualized by the CHS.</description>

    <measure>Applied Mental Health Research Group's Measures of Acceptability and Feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months - 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability and feasibility will be measured using 2 subscales from the Applied Mental Health Research Group's Implementation Science Research Measures. The acceptability scale has 13-items and the Feasibility scale has 20-item scales. Both scales were developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins to measure implementation of mental health programs in low resource settings. Items included in these scales are based on leading implementation science frameworks (Consolidated Framework for Implementation; Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance; and a conceptual model of evidence based implementation in public services sectors), and knowledge gathered from health systems, dissemination and implementation science experts. The scales have demonstrated good psychometric properties across a range of stakeholder groups in low income settings internationally (alpha=0.79, alpha=0.77). Each scale is scored on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 &quot;a lot.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months - 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSAT was developed based on the Public Health Program Capacity for Sustainability framework. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have adapted this for use in low resource settings related to mental health programming. Adaptations included simplification of language, additions of items, inclusion of a leadership domain, and reductions in number of response categories. The adapted version of the PSAT has been validated in a sample of community-based mental health providers, using a novel vignette based testing approach. Results from the validation study indicated high internal consistency reliability across all subscales (0.93-0.97) and strong correlations of each subscale to overall ratings of program sustainability.</description>

    <description>New Hope will be implemented over 1 visit (2-4 hours) in a youth-preferred setting after Emergency Department (ED) discharge for a suicide attempt, and in the past few years has been updated to also target suicide ideation and binge behavior. NH emphasizes the seriousness of a suicide attempt; teaches coping skills to reduce risk, including emotion regulation, cognitive restructuring, social support, and safety planning; and helps participants overcome barriers to treatment motivation, initiation, and adherence. A center-piece of the intervention is a 20-minute video produced by with Native actors, vignettes specific to this community, and Elders speaking in Apache (with sub-titles) about the seriousness of suicide, its impact on the community, their concern for the adolescent, and beliefs about the communal importance of each individual's life.Youth will be encouraged to choose a support person from his/her family to take part in the intervention.</description>

    <description>Elders' Resiliency is a monthly manualized curriculum taught by Elders in the community intended to bolster Apache youths' resilience to suicide ideation, attempts and substance abuse by promoting Apache cultural identity and values, youth's self-worth and role in the community, and fostering connectedness to society and community, with an emphasis on extended family as a nexus of strength. Each lesson introduces youth to cultural knowledge, stories, and songs with an emphasis on respect and the sacredness of each life. Our community-based Apache staff will select Elders who both express an interest in the current project and have demonstrated affinity and skill for teaching the current curriculum in the schools. After this group of Elders is recruited and agree to participate, they will be paired with our paraprofessional Apache study staff.</description>

    <description>Research Program Assistants, who are trained Surveillance System Staff, will conduct the monitoring and case management visits in participants' homes or other private settings at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-enrollment. The CM visit includes rapport-building, use of the Suicide Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) to assess imminent risk, and if youth report not yet having connected to services, referral to Apache Behavioral Health Services (ABHS), the local community mental health center. At CM visits, the Research Program Assistants will also monitor participants' completion of the study battery, which will be self-administered using tablets. In addition, Research Program Assistants will score the SIQ before leaving the youth. If the SIQ reveals the participant is at imminent risk, Research Program Assistants will employ a protocol for rescue services, which involves triaging youth immediately to the ED for further assessment and care.</description>
