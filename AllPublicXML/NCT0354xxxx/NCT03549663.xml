  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a random, open, control and monocentric trial. Mainly to assess the urine
      protein remission rate of tacrolimus (TAC) monotherapy for idiopathic membranous nephropathy
      (IMN). Assuming that the urine protein remission rate of 48-week TAC for monotherapy of IMN
      is not lower than that in treatment group of TAC combined with glucocorticoid, attempt on
      de-hormonal therapy in the future IMN therapy can be attempted on the basis of the trial
      results.

Start to administer on the randomized grouping day (D0) with an initial dose by weight: initial dose of 0.05-0.075mg/kg/d (bid) following a strict administration interval of 12 hours or fasting or 2 hours after meal. Adjust TAC dose according to 24-hour urine protein, plasma concentration and eGFR changes. It is recommended that plasma trough concentration should be remained at 5-8ng/ml and TAC dose during the whole therapy stage should not be lower than 0.5mg/d. Drugs should be stopped if the 6-month therapy is ineffective. After 6-month therapy, for those whose urine protein achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), TAC dose should be reduced gradually with a total therapy duration of 48 weeks.</description>
