  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pneumonia is one of the most common complications after lung cancer surgery and
      associated with a morbidity and mortality. Postoperative lymphopenia has been recently
      identified as one of risk factors for postoperative pneumonia. According to recent studies in
      polytrauma, cancer or septic shock, T cells dysfunction may be related to high expression of
      inhibitory receptors on lymphocytes.

      This study will investigate prospectively TIM-3, PD-1 and CTLA4 expression on lymphocytes T
      cells before and after lung cancer surgery. Patients ≥ 18 years with no history of
      immunosuppressive state will be included.
