  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may represent a portion of the
      population experiencing early sings of cognitive decline. Systolic hypertension is a major
      contributor to cognitive impairment. High-intensity aerobic interval training (HIT) yields
      greater fitness and vascular health improvements compared to moderate-intensity aerobic
      continuous training (MCT). No randomized controlled trials, however, have investigated the
      effects HIT or MCT on cognition in older adults with hypertension and SCD. Much less is known
      regarding whether combining HIT or MCT with mind-motor training would culminate additive
      benefits to cognition. Therefore, the overarching goal of our research is to deliver a
      group-based exercise program combining mind-motor training with HIT or MCT to older adults
      with hypertension and SCD. Participants will be randomized into two groups. Participants in
      both groups will receive 15 minutes of square stepping exercise (SSE) followed by either 45
      minutes of HIT (N=70) or 45 minutes of MCT (N=70). In total, both groups will exercise 60
      min/day, 3 days/week for 6 months. The effects of both interventions will be evaluated on
      systolic and diastolic office/ambulatory blood pressure and global and domain-specific
      cognitive functioning.

    <time_frame>0 to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite measure derived from the Cambridge Brain Sciences cognitive battery (Hampshire, Highfield, Parkin, &amp; Owen, 2012). The composite score is derived from 4 cognitive tasks: Monkey Ladder (visuospatial working memory), Spatial Span (short-term memory), Digit Span (verbal working memory), and Paired Associates (visuospatial learning). For each of the cognitive tasks, higher scores indicate better outcomes. The scores from each task are standardized and averaged to generate a standardized composite measure of memory, i.e., z scores with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The standardized scores can range from negative infinity to positive infinity.</description>

    <description>Composite measure from the Cambridge Brain Sciences cognitive battery. The composite score is derived from 3 cognitive tasks: Grammatical Reasoning (verbal reasoning), Double Trouble (modified Stroop task), and Odd One Out (deductive reasoning). For each of the cognitive tasks, higher scores indicate better outcomes. The scores from each task are standardized and averaged to generate a standardized composite measure of reasoning, i.e., z scores with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The standardized scores can range from negative infinity to positive infinity.</description>

The composite score is derived from 2 cognitive tasks: Spatial Planning (planning and executive function) and Token Search (working memory and strategy). For each of the cognitive tasks, higher scores indicate better outcomes. The scores from each task are standardized and averaged to generate a standardized composite measure, i.e., z scores with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The standardized scores can range from negative infinity to positive infinity.</description>

    <description>Following the mind-motor training component, participants in the experimental group will then continue in the 45-minute HIT intervention, which will be composed by a 10-minute warm-up, a 25-minute core activity, and a 10-minute cool down. The 25-minute core activity will be carried out based on a 4 x 4 minutes aerobic interval training model. The intensity in each cycle will be prescribed at an individual level, and training heart rates will be determined via a sub-maximal excise testing at baseline and monitored during exercise using a wrist-based heart rate monitor (Suunto). In order to ensure progression in aerobic training over the 6-month intervention, training heart rates will be recalculated at the intervention midpoint (i.e., 3 months), where a new sub-maximal exercise test will be performed. Participants will exercise 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week for 6 months.</description>
