    <textblock>
      The purpose of this long-term, extension study is to provide ongoing safety and efficacy
      follow-up of subjects who participated in a rovalpituzumab tesirine study that has completed
      the primary analysis and that is closing.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either a reasonable possibility or no reasonable possibility. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject had enrolled, participated in, and received at least 1 dose of rovalpituzumab
             tesirine in a parent study.

          -  Additional eligibility criterion for Arm A: subjects who discontinued the study drug
             in the parent study have completed the treatment emergent adverse event reporting
             window.

        For subjects who elect optional retreatment in Arm A, must meet additional criteria before
        receiving rovalpituzumab tesirine retreatment including:

          -  Tolerated their initial 2 doses of rovalpituzumab tesirine.

          -  Achieved clinical benefit as defined by stable disease or better, and is determined
             that the subject would potentially benefit from additional treatment.

          -  Experienced radiographic disease progression at least 12 weeks after the second dose
             of rovalpituzumab tesirine.

          -  Received no other systemic anti-cancer therapy after rovalpituzumab tesirine
             treatment.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Adequate hematologic, kidney, and liver function, per protocol.

          -  In subjects with central nervous system (CNS) metastases, documentation of stable or
             improved status as described in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects not previously enrolled in a rovalpituzumab tesirine study.
