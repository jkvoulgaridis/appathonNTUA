      This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label, phase II trial to examine the efficacy of
      pembrolizumab for prolonging the one-year disease free survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
      patients with solely detectable EBV DNA after curative chemoradiation. Sixty-three patients
      will be enrolled in the trial.

      This phase II study is aimed to prove the efficacy of adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab for
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with detectable plasma EBV DNA after curative
      chemoradiation.

      Nasopharyngeal cancer was a malignancy related to Epstein-Barr virus infection. It was a
      malignancy endemic in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and China [1, 2]. The primary treatment was
      chemoradiation. The three-year disease free survival was around 50-60% for locally-advanced
      (stage IVA, IVB) NPC[1, 3-5]. Adjuvant chemotherapy after curative chemoradiation is a
      strategy to improve disease control rate for advanced NPC. However, two phase III trials in
      Taiwan (TCOG 1394) and China failed to prove its efficacy on improving disease control and
      overall survival [6, 7]. How to identify patients who are truly at risk is an important
      question for the therapy of advanced NPC.

      Plasma EBV DNA copy number is a biomarker predicting the recurrent risk of nasopharyngeal
      cancer. A higher level of plasma EBV DNA before chemoradiation is related to a poorer
      prognosis [5]. A detectable EBV DNA after chemoradiation, which is a hint for occult residual
      or metastatic disease, is a strong predictor for early recurrence [5, 8-12]. The relapse free
      survival at two years for patients with detectable plasma EBV DNA (&gt; 0 copies/mL) was around
      20%. The results of other similar trials are summarized on table 1.

      Cancer cells escaped from the immune surveillance by several mechanisms. One of them is
      activating immune inhibitory pathway by &quot;immune checkpoints&quot; [13]. Programmed Death 1 (PD-1)
      and Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is one immune checkpoint axis to regulate immune
      response against cancer. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), an anti-PD-1 antibody, had a good activity
      against melanoma [14] and other types of cancers [15, 16]. The toxicity profiles were
      tolerable. In the Keynote-028 phase Ib trial, pembrolizumab showed good clinical activity
      against recurrent or metastatic NPC [17]. The overall response rate is 22%, and the disease
      control rate is 77.8%. This data is encouraging for further clinical trials of pembrolizumab
      for NPC.

      PD-1/PD-L1 axis has an important role for the resistance of chemoradiation[18]. In patients
      refractory to chemoradiation, the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 increased in the tumor. In
      animal model, sequential administration of anti-PD-1 after radiation significantly improved
      the progression free survival in mice with tumors [19]. This concept supports the
      investigator's sequential design for high-risk NPC patients.
