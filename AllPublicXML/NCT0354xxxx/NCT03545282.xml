  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latina immigrant women are particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the
      social and economic stressors they face, including high levels of poverty, low levels of
      education, family obligations, exposure to violence, and limited access to community
      resources. ALMA aims to prevent and reduce depression and anxiety among Latina immigrant
      women. Women attend 8 weekly sessions in a group format to teach and encourage women to use
      coping strategies to reduce depression and anxiety. The intervention aims to increase
      participants' social ties and the social support they receive from other Latina immigrant
      women. The program also helps decrease the stigma associated with mental health and connects
      women to mental health services when needed.

      The proposed study aims to test the efficacy of the Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA)
      intervention in a randomized control trial. ALMA is an 8-week program offered in a group
      format to teach women new coping strategies and enhance their social ties and social support
      to prevent and reduce their depression and anxiety. Aim 1 of the proposed study is to refine
      the ALMA intervention and study procedures, using information learned from focus groups and
      cognitive interviews with Mexican immigrant women. Aim 2 is to determine the efficacy of the
      ALMA intervention to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms using a randomized control study
      design. We will recruit women from community-based organizations serving Latino immigrants to
      participate in the program, which will be offered in community settings. We will assess
      process outcomes of recruitment, retention, fidelity, and participant satisfaction through
      observations and in-depth interviews with participants. We will assess the efficacy of the
      intervention by comparing changes in women's depressive and anxiety symptoms in the
      intervention and attention control groups at four time points (pre-intervention,
      post-intervention, 3 months, 6 months). Aim 3 is to assess the potential impact of the
      intervention on both individual (stigma, stress, coping strategies) and interpersonal (social
      support, social ties) factors, and whether the impact of the intervention is mediated by
      these factors. The research team includes investigators in psychology, medicine, social work
      and public health, as well as community-based organizations serving Latina immigrants. The
      study uses rigorous methods to test an innovative program that integrates both culturally
      relevant and evidenced-based strategies to address significant mental health disparities in a
      high-risk and underserved population. Findings will help inform future research and practice.
      Given the growth of the Latino population, identifying interventions that reduce mental
      health disparities among Mexican immigrant women can have a significant public health impact.

    <description>Frequency of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 in the last two weeks. The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. Scores range from 0 to 27. In general, a total of 10 or above is suggestive of the presence of depression. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.</description>

Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) is a self-reported questionnaire for screening and severity measuring of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Scores range from 0 to 21. Scores â‰¥10. Anxiety Severity: 1-4 minimal symptoms, 5-9 mild symptoms, 10-14 moderate symptoms, 15-21 severe symptoms</description>

Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>

    <description>In a series of 8 weekly sessions, the program uses a group format to teach and encourage women to use coping strategies to reduce depression and anxiety. Over the course of the eight ALMA sessions, 25 women are (1) engaged in activities to identify coping strategies they are currently using and encouraged to continue to use them; (2) introduced to new coping strategies (e.g. mindfulness techniques, increased social ties and social support); and, (3) provided resources for seeking additional help if needed.</description>
