  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The observation of actions and motor imagery has demonstrated the activation of certain
      mechanisms similar to those that occur during active movement, which could induce immediate
      changes in the amplitudes of movement and sensorimotor variables in observed and imagined
      movements. The main aim of the study was test the immediate effect of a protocol of observed
      actions and motor imagery on cervical range of motion and pain intensity in patients with
      non-specific chronic neck pain (NSCNP). Randomized double-blind clinical trial in patients
      with DCCI at a primary health care center in the Community of Madrid. A random distribution
      of study subjects was made into two groups: a) cervical motion videos were presented at full
      range of motion and b) the videos presented showed a range of motion limited to 40%. In both
      groups, visualization tasks of actions were alternated with internal kinesthetic motor
      imagery, in periods of 1min in 2 consecutive series and with a total of 12 minutes of
      intervention. Cervical range of motion was assessed with a cervical goniometer and pain
      intensity immediately following the intervention with an Analog Visual Scale.
