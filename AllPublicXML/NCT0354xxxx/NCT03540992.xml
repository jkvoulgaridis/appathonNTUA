  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a registry study to examine the clinical features, blood pressure control rate,
      and clinical prognosis of resistant hypertension in Koreans. This study will register
      patients with resistance hypertension in eight tertiary hospitals in Korea and follow up them
      for three years. The prognosis will be analysed according to etiologies, achieved blood
      pressure, and types of antihypertensive medication.

      This study will enroll hypertensive patients who are in treatment or those who are referred
      from primary clinic based on inclusion or exclusion criteria. Basic clinical information,
      compliance with antihypertensive medications, concomitant use of other medications will be
      investigated and all patients will perform 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure measurement.
      Screening for renal artery stenosis and primary aldosteronism will be conducted. Office blood
      pressure will be taken every 3-6 months. Home blood pressure measurement and 24-hr ambulatory
      blood pressure measurement will be performed every year. The primary outcome is the newly
      developed MACE during the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes are newly developed target
      organ damage (LVH confirmed by echocardiography or EKG, carotid femoral PWV≥ 12m/s,
      microalbuminuria (Urine albumin-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g)) and decline of renal function
      (doubling of serum creatinine, dialysis). The follow-up period is 3 years.
