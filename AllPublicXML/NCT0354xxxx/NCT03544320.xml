    <textblock>
      In this study, adults with pre-diabetes will be prospectively enrolled for data collection to
      design prediction models that integrate electronic health record data and patient-generated
      activity data. Patients will be randomized to receive either a waist-worn or wrist-worn
      wearable device for 6 months to capture patient-generated activity data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suboptimal glycemic control could be better managed if these higher risk
      patients could be identified and effective interventions were then targeted towards them.
      However, most practice settings perform infrequent laboratory testing every 3 to 6 months, if
      not at longer intervals. Current models to predict change in glycemic control perform poorly
      and do not take into account the behaviors that occur between these intervals. In this study,
      we will compare different methods to use data on daily health behaviors collected by wearable
      devices to enhance risk prediction models. Adults with pre-diabetes will complete a series of
      surveys and baseline assessments and then will be randomly assigned to use a waist-worn or
      wrist-worn wearable device for 6 months. Measures of HbA1c and LDL will be obtained at
      baseline and at 6 months.
