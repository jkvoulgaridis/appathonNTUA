  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is the commonest hospital-acquired infection globally, and
      prevalence is much higher in the low-income countries. Caesarean delivery carries a 5-20 fold
      risk for developing postpartum sepsis. SSIs cause significant morbidity, prolonged
      hospitalization and mortality. Simple and inexpensive interventions like preoperative bathing
      need to be studied, to assess their impact on surgical site infection rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean delivery is the single-most important risk factor for postpartum pregnancy
      associated infections carrying a 5 to 20-fold increase in the risk of developing sepsis.
      Research done in MRRH showed a post-surgery wound sepsis prevalence of 82% on all surgical
      wards in the hospital and the prevalence of post caesarean section wound infection at MRRH is
      15.5%. At MRRH, surgical site infections remain a substantial cause of morbidity, prolonged
      hospitalization and mortality. SSI is associated with a mortality rate of 3%, and 75% of SSI
      associated deaths are directly attributable to the SSIs. Universal practices like
      preoperative bathing of patients are currently not being practiced at MRRH and thus their
      impact on reducing the burden can only be speculated upon. The aim of this study was to
      assess the impact of preoperative bathing with chloroxylenol antiseptic on the incidence of
      post caesarean section surgical site infection.

    <intervention_model_description>The participants in the bathing arm were each given warm water and a tablet of soap containing chloroxylenol antiseptic and they were asked to bathe using it within at most two hours prior to the surgery. After bathing, the participants were given a clean theatre gown to put on, after which they were taken through the routine pre-operative preparation procedures according to the existing ward protocol.
The participants in the control arm were only taken through the routine preoperative preparation procedures according to the existing ward protocol</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Mothers scheduled to deliver by emergency Caesarean section were randomly assigned to either bathing or routine care arms in a ratio of 1:1. We did simple randomization to either bathing or routine care arm without any blocks. We generated patient group assignments using the computer algorithm (computer-generated list of random numbers). The research assistant who enrolled mothers into the study assigned the study arm by checking from the list of random numbers. The research assistant and the PI, who were on the outcomes assessment arm was not allowed to ask the study participant concerning the allocation arm. Single blinding of PI and one of the research assistants assessing outcomes was done to minimize bias.</masking_description>

    <description>Intervention was Preoperative bathing with antiseptic. Given warm water and a tablet soap containing chloroxylenol antiseptic. Asked to bathe under supervision for standardization. Given a clean theatre gown to put on. Taken through the routine pre-operative preparation procedures which involved; Putting an intravenous cannula; administering prophylactic antibiotics. Administering intravenous normal saline 1 liter. taking off a blood sample (3mls) for blood grouping and cross matching. Putting urethral catheter for drainage of urine, Getting an informed consent from the client for the procedure to be done. Informing the theatre team.</description>
