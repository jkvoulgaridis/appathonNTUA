  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-lung ventilation (OLV) is required for the most of thoracic surgery to facilitate
      surgical visualization by collapsing the lung. The double-lumen tube (DLT) is the commonly
      used device for OLV. The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of the distances
      between vocal cords to carina of trachea and formula base on patient's height as a guide for
      the intubation of a Left-sided Double-lumen tube

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous study, investigators found that the distances between vocal cords to carina of
      trachea was a useful predictive method for the intubation of a Left-sided Double-lumen tube.
      However in some hospitals preoperative chest CT scans not contain the vocal cords slice. So
      in this study investigators will compare the accuracy of the distances between the midpoint
      of the thyroid cartilage to suprasternal notch base on body surface measurement add the
      distance between suprasternal notch to carina of trachea according to chest CT and formula
      base on patient's height as a guide for the intubation of a Left-sided Double-lumen tube.
