  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study to better understand the relationships among insomnia,
      weight loss, and breast cancer. This study will assess the effectiveness of a sleep
      intervention prior to a web- and phone-based weight loss program.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are women with a diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (ESBC), a BMI ≥25, and
      insomnia. A total of 30 participants will be randomized to either cognitive behavioral
      therapy for insomnia and behavioral weight loss (CBT-I+BWL) or a sleep education program and
      behavioral weight loss (EDU+BWL). Measures will be collected at baseline, 8 weeks (after the
      CBT-I or EDU program) and at 3 and 6 months after starting BWL. The primary outcome will be %
      total weight loss. Additionally, eating behaviors, physical activity, and sleep parameters
      will be carefully assessed.

      The sleep intervention phase of the study includes 6 sessions over 8 weeks (2 in-person,
      followed by 4 phone or videoconferencing sessions), and the BWL intervention includes 15
      sessions over 6 months (1 in-person, 14 by phone or videoconference). Participants will be
      given physical activity trackers and will use a dietary app to record their food intake.
      There are 4 in-person assessment visits (baseline/randomization, 8-week follow up, 3-month
      follow up, 6-month follow up). These assessment visits are coordinated with in-person sleep
      and weight loss intervention visits. Some of the measures that will be recorded throughout
      the study include: height, weight, anthropometric measures (waist/hip measurements), sleep
      diaries, and self-report measures.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 30 participants will be randomized to either cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia with behavioral weight loss (CBT-I+BWL) or a sleep education control condition with behavioral weight loss (EDU+BWL). The EDU group will have study sessions spread out in a similar fashion to the CBT-I group, and clinical outcomes will be compared between groups at baseline, 8 weeks (after the CBT-I or EDU program) and at 3 and 6 months after starting BWL. The primary outcome will be % total weight loss. Additionally, eating behaviors, physical activity, and sleep parameters will be carefully assessed.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will not be blinded to the intervention assignment. However, data collection of anthropometric measurements (including height, weight, hip and waist circumference) will be done by a study member blinded to the randomization. Since participants will be aware of their intervention assignment, there are no anticipated circumstances for breaking the blinding or planned procedures for breaking the blinding.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Weight loss</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be percent (%) weight loss. All subjects who are randomized will be included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Weight will be measured according to standardized BMI and anthropometric procedures (hip/waist ratio). For the primary aim, comparing the effects of CBT-I+BWL and EDU+BWL on % weight loss at 3 and 6 months, we will model outcomes (at 3 months &amp; 6 mos.) as a function of baseline level, treatment assignment, time, and their interaction. The interaction term represents the between-group difference in change over time on the outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep continuity as measured by wake after sleep onset (WASO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>WASO will be measured in minutes. Sleep continuity will be measured using actigraphs and sleep diaries at baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. For this aim, evaluating the extent to which short-term sleep continuity improvements (8 wk and 3 mo) are associated with improvements in daily physical activity and dietary quality/quantity and determining their association with 3- and 6-month weight changes, we will model between-group differences in the short-term trajectory of change for the primary sleep continuity measures, actigraphy TST and WASO.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep continuity as measured by total sleep time (TST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>TST will be measured in minutes. Sleep continuity will be measured using actigraphs and sleep diaries at baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. For this aim, evaluating the extent to which short-term sleep continuity improvements (8 wk and 3 mo) are associated with improvements in daily physical activity and dietary quality/quantity and determining their association with 3- and 6-month weight changes, we will model between-group differences in the short-term trajectory of change for the primary sleep continuity measures, actigraphy TST and WASO.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep continuity as measured by sleep efficiency (SE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency is measured as the ratio of total sleep time (TST) compared to the total time spent in bed (TST / time in bed). This is measured in percent of total time spent in bed, asleep.
Sleep continuity will be measured using actigraphs and sleep diaries at baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep continuity as measured by sleep latency (SL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep latency is the time it takes to transition from full wakefulness to sleep. This is measured in minutes. Sleep continuity will be measured using actigraphs and sleep diaries at baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.</description>
