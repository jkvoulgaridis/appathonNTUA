    <textblock>
      While surgery remains the standard treatment for rectal cancer, some patients still firmly
      refuse surgery for various reasons. Here, we conducted this retrospective observation study
      to discuss the feasibility of high-dose radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy in treating
      rectal cancer We retrospectively collect data of rectal cancer patients who were treated with
      high-dose radiotherapy plus chemotherapy in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from April
      1st, 2006 to July 30th, 2017. Patients gave up surgery before any treatment would have
      received one course of high dose radiotherapy (GTV60-70Gy/30-35f). Patients with tumor
      residual after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy but insisted non-operative treatment would have
      received 2 courses of radiotherapy (1st: GTV 45-50Gy/25f, 2nd: GTV 30/15f). The chemotherapy
      regimens included Capox, FOLFOX, or capecitabine at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After treatment, patients were followed every 3 months for the first two years, at least
      every 6 months in the year thereafter. Recurrence, early and late toxicity were recorded.

      Analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Local
      recurrence and distant metastasis rate, progression free survival, and overall survival were
      calculated using the Kaplan Meier Method and were compared by log-rank test.
