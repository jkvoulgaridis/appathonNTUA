  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open and exploratory clinical study, with 50 cases
      planned for a period of 2 years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the consistency and
      accuracy of Patient-Derived Organoid Model of breast cancer to predict the clinical efficacy
      of the drug, as well as the possibility of guiding the neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      After obtaining informed consent, patients who met the eligibility criteria underwent biopsy
      of the primary lesion or metastatic lesion (such as lymph node).Under the premise of ensuring
      normal detection requirements, a certain volume of fresh tumor tissues will be retained and
      used for the cultivation of Patient-Derived Organoid Model.If the organoid cultivation is not
      successful, the corresponding follow-up observation will be stopped.If the organoid
      cultivation is successful, drug sensitivity verification or prediction by Patient-Derived
      Organoid Model will be completed (final report will be available in about one month). During
      this period, the patient was first treated with paclitaxel (PTX) chemotherapy 3 cycles (2
      weeks regimen) and Herceptin was treated in HER2 amplification patients. After 3 cycles, the
      efficacy was assessed according to the RECIST solid tumor evaluation standard (version 1.1),
      and the evaluation methods mainly included physical examination, ultrasound, CT and MRI.If
      the tumor continues to reduce in the first 3 cycles, continue paclitaxel chemotherapy for 3
      cycles (6 weeks) and Herceptin was treated in HER2 amplification patients.If the evaluation
      of the curative effect is SD or PD, according to the result of drug sensitivity of the class
      organ, combined with the clinical practice, the doctor chooses the most sensitive treatment
      plan, and continues the 2 cycle treatment (6 weeks).After the completion of the evaluation,
      combined with the clinical situation, the next step is decided.For those who meet the
      conditions of the operation, the modified radical mastectomy or breast conserving surgery was
      performed after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The pCR status of the primary breast cancer and
      the axillary lymph nodes were evaluated after the operation. The adjuvant radiotherapy and
      endocrine therapy were given after the operation, and the long-term survival was observed.

      Drug sensitivity tests include single drug and drug combination. The organs that are
      successfully cultured will be kept in liquid nitrogen for a specific time.
