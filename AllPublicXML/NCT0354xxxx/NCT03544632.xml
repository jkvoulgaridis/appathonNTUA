  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although other methods (e.g., autologous fat transfer, dermal-/collagen-based fillers) for
      soft tissue reconstruction exist, each has distinct disadvantages leaving room for
      improvement in this treatment area. Investigators in the Elisseeff Laboratory (Johns Hopkins
      University Department of Biomedical Engineering) have recently generated a novel
      tissue-derived material to create instructive matrices for soft tissue reconstruction called
      Acellular Adipose Tissue (AAT). This material takes advantage of the inherent bioactivity and
      unique mechanical properties of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Investigators' preclinical data
      suggest that AAT is safe for use in small and large animals; investigators' clinical (Phase
      I) data suggest that AAT is safe for use in humans. These data indicate that a Phase II,
      dose-escalation study of AAT's safety and efficacy in human subjects is warranted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue volume loss acquired through trauma, congenital malformation or comorbid
      conditions (i.e., HIV/AIDS) is a common and sometimes devastating problem. Traditional
      therapies include local tissue transfer, allograft placement, and complex scar revision
      techniques. Recently, autologous fat transfer has become one of the most commonly employed
      techniques for improving soft tissue contour deformity particularly for the correction of
      breast and body defects. While the results from this procedure continue to improve, it
      requires an additional procedure to harvest fat tissue from the abdomen, thigh or flank
      leading to donor site morbidity. Clinically, volume loss following autologous fat transfer
      has been reported to be between 40-60% and usually occurs within the first 4-6 months.
      Regrafting is often needed and implanted adipose tissue frequently leads to post-operative
      calcifications. For these reasons, a predictable, &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; material that retains the
      mechanical and biological properties of adipose tissue would be ideal for the reconstruction
      of smaller soft tissue defects and soft tissue augmentation.

      Investigators in the Elisseeff Laboratory (Johns Hopkins University Department of Biomedical
      Engineering) generated a novel tissue-derived material to create instructive matrices for
      soft tissue reconstruction [Acellular Adipose Tissue (AAT)]. In 2016, investigators conducted
      a Phase 1, open-label, clinical trial of AAT in healthy volunteers who planned to have
      elective surgery for the removal of redundant tissue (n=8). Overall, AAT demonstrated
      satisfactory safety results. No participants experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) or
      unanticipated adverse events (AEs) related to the study, or exited the study due to AEs. All
      AEs noted were expected and mild, including redness, bruising, textural changes,
      hyperpigmentation and tenderness at the injection site. Many other adverse events commonly
      associated with injections were not observed in any participant throughout the study (i.e.,
      scarring, ulceration, scabbing, purpura, oozing, crusting, blanching, blistering, edema or
      abrasions). These data indicate that conducting a phase II, dose-escalation, safety and
      efficacy study in humans is warranted. Based on investigators' experience, investigators
      hypothesize that AAT will be safe and maintain its volume up to 6 months when injected
      subcutaneously to restore 5-20cc defects in human soft tissue.

    <description>This open-label, phase II, dose-escalation study will be conducted in human subjects seeking repair of modest (approx. 5-30cc) soft tissue defects of the trunk (n=15). All participants will be treated via permanent injection of the study intervention (AAT injection) to restore the defect's contour. All study data will be collected in Case Report Forms (CRFs) and entered into a customized study database, created and maintained in HIPAA-compliant Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software (14).</description>

    <description>Participants (n=15) will be administered between 5cc and 20cc of AAT, depending on their assigned treatment group, via sterile subcutaneous injection into the target defect. The injection is intended to be permanent. After the 3-month study follow-up visit, participants will have the option to undergo additional AAT injection (up to 20cc per treatment) in order to fully correct the defect. Total injected AAT volume per patient will not exceed 40cc. Additional injection is dependent upon study- and patient-specific adverse / unanticipated events to date.
Each vial contains a 2 milliliter (mL) dose of the injectable AAT. This volume is similar to other commonly used injectable filler materials intended for soft tissue correction.</description>

             Chemistry.

        For Men and Women of reproductive potential: Willingness to use approved methods of birth
        control or abstain from sexual intercourse from screening until 6 months post-AAT
        injection.

          -  Definition of non-childbearing potential for Women: amenorrhea (previous 12 months) or
             surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Use of AAT in patients exhibiting autoimmune connective tissue disease is not recommended.
        When applied properly, AAT has been shown to support the migration of host cells from the
        surrounding tissue. Therefore, this study will exclude patients with conditions that could
        inhibit migration of host cells including, but not limited to, the following:

          -  Fever (oral temperature &gt;99º F at time of screening)

          -  Insulin dependent diabetes

          -  Local or Systemic Infection

          -  Mechanical Trauma

          -  Poor nutrition or general medical condition

          -  Dehiscence and/or necrosis due to poor revascularization
