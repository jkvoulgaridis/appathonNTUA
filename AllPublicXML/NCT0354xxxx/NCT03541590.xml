  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recently published meta-analysis (Sharaiha, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 2017), it is
      reported that percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is less clinical successful,
      causes more adverse events and needs more re-interventions than endoscopic ultrasound guided
      biliary drainage (EUBD) in patients with malignant, extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. The
      conclusion was, that EUBD should be prefered in this clinical setting in future.

      An improved technique of PTBD may provide better results for coming comparative studies.

      The investigators of this retrospective study therefore analyzed all PTBDs that were
      performed in a period of nine years in a tertiary referral hospital. In this cohort, the
      analysis focused on PTBDs with primary metal stent implantation by endoscopic luminal
      guidance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) is not successful or is not
      possible to be performed due to anatomical reasons (altered anatomy after abdominal surgery)
      in patients with malignant extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, an alternative method is
      necessary for biliary drainage. In a recently published meta-analysis (Sharaiha,
      Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 2017), it is reported that percutaneous transhepatic biliary
      drainage (PTBD) is less clinical successful, causes more adverse events and needs more
      re-interventions than endoscopic ultrasound guided biliary drainage (EUBD) in patients with
      malignant, extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. The conclusion was, that EUBD should be
      prefered in this clinical setting in future.

      An improved technique of PTBD may provide better results for coming comparative studies.

      The investigators of this retrospective study therefore analyzed all PTBDs that were
      performed in a period of nine years in a tertiary referral hospital. In this cohort, the
      analysis focused on PTBDs with primary metal stent implantation by endoscopic luminal
      guidance considering technical and clinical success, access route, procedure time,
      fluoroscopic time, radiation exposure, adverse events and survival probability in an
      observation time of six months.

    <description>When ERCPs failed or was not possible to be performed due to an altered anatomy in patients with malignant extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, PTBD was performed next in all patients. Percutaneous bile duct puncture was guided by Color Doppler ultrasound. The further procedure was guided by fluoroscopy. A self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) was inserted into the obstructed bile duct by endoscopic luminal guidance in the first session. After successful SEMS implantation, the percutaneous external catheter was removed at the end of the procedure.</description>
