    <textblock>

      support, substance use, and attitudes toward medication, affect treatment adherence in
      individuals with bipolar disorder.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar Disorder (BPD), also known as manic-depressive illness, is a disorder that causes
      frequent shifts in an individual's mood, energy, and ability to function. An individual with
      BPD may go through periods of mania, which are characterized by increased energy,
      irritability, and an excessively &quot;high&quot; euphoric mood. The manic periods are followed by
      periods of depression, which are characterized by decreased energy, feelings of hopelessness,
      and anxiety. BPD is a persistent and severe mental illness with a high suicide rate; it must
      be strictly managed through medication and therapy. Many BPD medications have been developed
      recently; however, there are still many individuals who do not respond well to medication
      treatment. Research has shown that the way individuals experience illness has an effect on
      their response to medication. The purpose of this study is to gain insight into how
      individuals with BPD perceive and respond to medication treatment. Factors such as gender,
      degree of social support, drug and alcohol usage, and attitudes towards medication will be
      evaluated to understand how they affect medication and treatment adherence.

      This 6-month study will consist of 3 interviews. Each interview will last approximately 2 and
      Â½ hours and will include numerous standardized psychological questionnaires. The
      questionnaires will assess participants' attitudes toward BPD treatment; psychiatric illness
      severity, including symptoms of mania and depression; level of addiction to alcohol and
      drugs; availability of social support resources; and medication adherence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes toward Mood Stabilizers Questionnaire (AMSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The AMSQ is a 19-item scale which is a modification of the Lithium Attitudes Questionnaire (LAQ) that evaluates an individual's attitude toward mood-stabilizing medication. The questions are in a yes/no format. The AMSQ has 7 subscales that represent key attitudinal domains with respect to adherence, as follows: 1. opposition to prophylaxis, 2. denial of therapeutic effectiveness, 3. fear of adverse effects, 4. difficulty with medication routines, 5. denial of illness severity, 6. negative attitude toward drugs in general, and 7. lack of information about mood stabilizers. Total scores range from 0 to 19. Higher scores on the total and each subscale represent more negative attitudes toward mood stabilizers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The BPRS measures levels of mania. There are 24 items, scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 to 6. Total scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating higher levels of mania.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Addiction Severity Index (ASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>A portion of the standardized instrument measuring level of addiction to alcohol and drugs. Items 1-14 of the Alcohol/Drug index were used. The ASI evaluated both lifetime and past-30 day use of a wide variety of commonly abused substances. Each question is divided by its maximum answer value and by the total number of questions in the composite. These individual results are then summed.
The six questions (A-F) that make up the alcohol composite score is determined by:
A/180 + B/180 + C/180 + D/24 + E/24 + log F/44.
The 13 questions (A-M) that make up the drug composite score is determined by:
A/390 + B/390 + C/390 + D/390 + E/390 + F/390 + G/390 + H/390 + I/390 + J/390 + K/390 + L/52 + M/52.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Interpersonal Suppose Evaluation List (ISEL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The ISEL is a 40-item self-report questionnaire that was developed to assess availability of social support resources. A total index is composed of four subscales: tangible assistance (material aid), appraisal (availability of someone to talk to about life's problems), self-esteem (positive appraisal of self from others and positive comparison when comparing one's self with others) and belonging (people with whom one can do things). Response for each item is coded on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from definitely false to definitely true. Total scores range from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating a higher availability of perceived social support.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The TRQ evaluates adherence to medications via a brief self-report instrument that has been validated in populations with bipolar disorder medication adherence. The TRQ identifies nonadherent individuals, defined as those who miss 30% or more of their medication in the last week or month. Total scores are represented as a percentage and range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater level of nonadherence (higher scores indicate worse adherence to medications).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D measures form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2. Total scores range from 0-52, with higher scores indicating worse depression. The categories are as follows: 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-16 suggest mild depression, 17-23 moderate depression and scores over 24 are indicative of severe depression; the maximum score is 52.</description>
