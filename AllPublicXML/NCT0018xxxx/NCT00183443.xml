      This study will determine the effectiveness of three different drug therapies in treating the
      symptoms of mania.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mania is a serious condition characterized by extreme excitement, mental and physical
      hyperactivity, insomnia, and disconnected thoughts. Symptoms of mania are common in patients
      with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. When associated with these conditions, mania reaches
      psychotic proportions and often includes hallucinations, paranoia, and feelings of
      omnipotence. Such symptoms may put individuals with mania and those around them at risk for
      physical harm. Drug therapies that can safely and effectively treat symptoms of mania are
      needed. This study will compare three drug combinations in their ability to treat symptoms of
      mania in people with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.

      This study will comprise a 12-week acute phase and a 14-week continuation phase. While the
      acute phase is the primary component of this study, the continuation phase will provide
      extended data on the characteristics and course of responders to the initial treatment
      combinations. Results from the continuation phase will be reported elsewhere. In the acute
      phase, participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments:
      divalproex-extended release (DV-ER) and lithium, DV-ER and quetiapine, or DV-ER and placebo.
      Participants will receive their intervention for 12 weeks. Participants will have weekly
      study visits for the first 4 weeks of the acute phase; biweekly study visits will occur for
      the following 8 weeks. After the acute phase, participants who have not responded to their
      drug regimen will complete their participation in the study.

      Participants whose symptoms of mania have decreased will be offered enrollment in the 14-week
      continuation phase, during which time participants will continue the drug regimen they began
      in the acute phase. Participants will have biweekly study visits in the continuation phase.
      During each study visit in both phases, participants will be interviewed about their mania
      symptoms. Mania, depression, quality of life, and overall functioning scales will assess
      participants at study entry, at the end of the acute phase, and at the end of the
      continuation phase. Participants over 50 years of age will have an electrocardiogram (EKG) at
      study entry to determine cardiac function.

    <measure>Symptoms of Mania, as Measured by Young Mania Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of mania, as measured by Young Mania Rating Scale. The scale is eleven-item multiple choice diagnostic questionnaire (range 0-60), which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of manic episodes in children and young adults. Typically, 20 is the minimum score required for mania. Higher scores represent increased severity of mania symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D,17)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression, and as a guide to evaluate recovery. The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of their depression by probing mood, feelings of guilt, suicide ideation, insomnia, agitation or retardation, anxiety, weight loss, and somatic symptoms. The 17-item Likert-type scale (range 0-50) includes eight questions with a 5-point scale (ranging from 0=not present to 4=severe) and nine items scored from 0 to 2. Higher scores indicate increased depression severity. The total sum of these 17 answers is used to arrive at the final score: normal (0-7), mild (8-13), moderate (14-18), severe (19-22), or very severe (&gt;=23).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scale was modified by Spearing and colleagues (1997) for use in bipolar disorder. CGI scales are measures of symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of patients with mental disorders. The revised CGI-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) is effective in rating severity of manic and depressive episodes and the degree of change from the immediately preceding phase and from the worst phase of illness. The CGI-BP is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score. Only severity of illness scores are reported. Increased scores represent increased illness severity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Assessment of Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of an individual, e.g., how well one is meeting various problems-in-living. Scores range from 100 (extremely high functioning) to 1 (severely impaired).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) provides a rating of global social and occupational function independent of clinical symptoms. SOFAS is provided in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) as an Axis V measure. The SOFAS is a global rating of current functioning, which is scored positively on a scale from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent higher levels of functioning. This instrument is a one-item rating of consumer functioning.</description>

        <title>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D,17)</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression, and as a guide to evaluate recovery. The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of their depression by probing mood, feelings of guilt, suicide ideation, insomnia, agitation or retardation, anxiety, weight loss, and somatic symptoms. The 17-item Likert-type scale (range 0-50) includes eight questions with a 5-point scale (ranging from 0=not present to 4=severe) and nine items scored from 0 to 2. Higher scores indicate increased depression severity. The total sum of these 17 answers is used to arrive at the final score: normal (0-7), mild (8-13), moderate (14-18), severe (19-22), or very severe (&gt;=23).</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BD)</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scale was modified by Spearing and colleagues (1997) for use in bipolar disorder. CGI scales are measures of symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of patients with mental disorders. The revised CGI-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) is effective in rating severity of manic and depressive episodes and the degree of change from the immediately preceding phase and from the worst phase of illness. The CGI-BP is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score. Only severity of illness scores are reported. Increased scores represent increased illness severity</description>

        <title>Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS)</title>
        <description>The Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) provides a rating of global social and occupational function independent of clinical symptoms. SOFAS is provided in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) as an Axis V measure. The SOFAS is a global rating of current functioning, which is scored positively on a scale from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent higher levels of functioning. This instrument is a one-item rating of consumer functioning.</description>
