      We are using anti-IgE to investigate the role of pulmonary mast cells in asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with mild allergic asthma are examined before, immediately after and 2 months after
      a course of treatment with anti-IgE. The following are examined: Allergen skin tests,
      allergen induced asthma, peripheral blood basophils, pulmonary bronchial mucosal mast cells.

          <description>This is not a drug study examining differences of therapeutic outcomes. This is an open label, non randomized single dose level study in which patients will be treated for 85 days with rhuMAB-E25 (Xolair) and followed for a total of 300 days. The dose of Xolair is determined by the patient's total serum IgE and body weight and is administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks. Outcome is serum anti-KLH antibody (immunoglobulin classes).</description>
