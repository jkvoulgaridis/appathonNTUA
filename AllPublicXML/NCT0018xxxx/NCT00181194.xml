  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to assess the impact of a culturally-sensitive,
      patient-focused asthma communication instrument (ACCI) designed to enhance provider-patient
      communication by prompting and guiding providers in assessments of disease severity and
      discussion of adherence behaviors with minority patients with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improving communication between health care providers and their patients is the critical
      first step in efforts designed to reduce asthma-related health disparities in urban areas.
      Improving communication will help providers tailor asthma therapies to their patients' needs,
      and help providers and patients to overcome barriers (e.g., concerns about adverse effects)
      to adherence with those asthma treatment plans.
