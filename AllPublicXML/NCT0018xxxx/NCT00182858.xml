  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need to obtain human tissue (blood, urine, saliva, sweat, pleural, pericardia, ascitic,
      synovial, cerebrospinal fluids) for methods development and disease correlation is frequent
      in Gerontology Research Center laboratories. This protocol is to create the opportunity to
      obtain such tissue samples that have been obtained during the course of usual clinical care
      and would be discarded, or alternatively, to obtain such samples during subject and patient
      screening for other studies (in this case only blood, urine, saliva, or sweat). Information
      derived from such studies is for research purposes only and is not provided to the
      patient/subject or their health care provider. When genetic analyses are performed, samples
      will have been coded and identifying information linking patient/subject to the sample will
      be destroyed. Any genetic information obtained will have no established clinical value and
      will not be provided to the subject/patient or their health care provider.

      Patients included will be those 18 years or older and who have been identified by the
      investigator to have a condition of interest for exploratory studies related to the patient's
      illness or other feature that offers the possibility of creating information that leads to
      scientifically useful and important studies. Patients will be excluded if obtaining the
      sample would be over and above usual clinical care, would result in excessive blood loss, or
      the individual is unable to provide informed consent.

      The expected outcome is to provide the investigator the opportunity to obtain tissues of
      interest for laboratory evaluation with the goal of either better understanding a disease or
      to design a scientific study to better understand or treat a disease.

      The need to obtain human tissue for methods development and disease correlation is frequent
      in Biomedical Research Center laboratories. This protocol is designed to create the
      opportunity to obtain such tissue samples including: blood, urine, saliva, sweat, feces, hair
      and nail clippings, muscle, fat and skin. It may also include samples taken during a surgical
      procedure, including: fluid from around the spinal column, heart, lungs and abdomen; fat,
      muscle, connective tissue and organs (liver, bladder, heart, kidney and skin).

      Information derived from such studies is for research purposes only and is not provided to
      the participants or their health care provider. Samples will be coded (no names) and
      identifying information linking the participant to the sample will be maintained in a secure
      location by the P.I. and Study Coordinator.

      Participants will be 18 years or older and have been identified by the investigator and/or
      physician to have a condition of interest for exploratory studies related to the participant
      s illness or other feature that offers the possibility of creating information that leads to
      scientifically useful and important studies. Participants could also be healthy volunteers,
      willing to provide their samples. These samples could be requested by an investigator to be
      used as age, gender, race and/or ethnicity-matched controls or to calibrate or compare and
      contrast across lab equipment. Participants will be excluded if obtaining the sample would be
      over and above usual clinical care, would result in excessive blood loss, or the individual
      is unable to provide informed consent.

      The expected outcome is to provide investigators with the opportunity to obtain tissues of
      interest for laboratory evaluation.
