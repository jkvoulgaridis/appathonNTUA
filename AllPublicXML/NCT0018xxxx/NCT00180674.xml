  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been treated for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have failed to
      respond to anti-viral treatment are often concerned about their ongoing liver disease and are
      therefore looking for alternative treatments which might prevent fibrosis progression. This
      view is endorsed by patient representative groups (including Charles Gore at the HepC Trust)
      who have welcomed this trial protocol.

      The trial will be a randomised cross over study with 15 patients in each group. Each patient
      will receive eight weeks of anticoagulation and eight weeks of observation.

      Background:

      Hepatitis C virus persistently infects over 200 million people worldwide. Persistent
      infection causes inflammation in the liver which leads to fibrosis or scarring. The fibrosis
      increases over periods of 10 - 50 years to become cirrhosis. Persistent infection leads to
      cirrhosis, chronic liver failure and liver cancer in up to a third of individuals. Treatment
      is available to eliminate hepatitis C virus infection but is only successful in approximately
      half of the patients. Treatment is expensive, unpleasant to take and associated with severe
      side effects. Therefore a simple cheap and effective means for reducing or preventing liver
      fibrosis is required for patients who cannot take anti-viral therapy or who have previously
      failed therapy.

      We and others have found that patients who are genetically predisposed to coagulate
      (thrombose) the blood more rapidly than normal are also more likely to develop rapid liver
      fibrosis if they are infected with the hepatitis C virus. We have also shown in a mouse model
      of liver fibrosis that mice who have a prothrombotic tendency develop liver fibrosis more
      rapidly than normal mice but if normal mice are anticoagulated then the rate of fibrosis is
      significantly reduced.

      Anticoagulation is widely used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism
      and stroke. We believe that anticoagulation may provide a simple and safe intervention to
      slow or prevent fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C virus infection and possibly other
      liver diseases. Eventually we will need to conduct long term studies to prove that
      anticoagulation prevents the development of cirrhosis and liver failure. However, in order to
      justify large scale, long term studies we first need to show that anticoagulation is having
      the desired effect in patients. This will be achieved by demonstrating that markers of liver
      fibrosis which can be measured in the blood respond appropriately to anticoagulation therapy.

      A couple of years ago we found that the pro-coagulant factor V Leiden mutation conferred
      susceptibility to rapid fibrosis in patients with HCV infection. This has subsequently been
      confirmed by other groups. We have recently demonstrated in mice that the factor V Leiden
      mutation causes accelerated fibrosis in response to carbon tetrachloride whereas
      anticoagulation ameliorates the fibrosis. Furthermore in these mice stellate-cell activation
      is reduced by anticoagulation. It is well established that thrombin acting through the PAR1
      receptor activates stellate cells. Hence we believe that many causes of liver injury promote
      liver fibrosis by activating the coagulation system, generating thrombin which activates the
      stellate cells. Our hypothesis is therefore that anticoagulation may decelerate fibrosis and
      therefore delay or prevent the development of end-stage liver disease.

      Aim:

      In a pilot study we wish to explore the feasibility of this approach. The aim would be to
      demonstrate improvements in surrogate markers of liver fibrosis over a relatively short
      period of anticoagulation which would provide data to support a trial grant application and
      justification for a longer term study.

      Trial Design:

      The design of the study will be as follows. Randomised cross over study with 15 patients in
      each group. Eight weeks of anticoagulation and Eight weeks of observation.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Age 18 - 70 (male and female)

        -  HCV infection PCR positive

        -  ALT &gt; 60

        -  Liver fibrosis score (within last 5 years) &gt; 2, &lt; 5

        -  Informed consent

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Clinical evidence of portal hypertension (USS or varices)

        -  Contra-indications for anticoagulation including (but not limited to):

             -  Recent peptic ulcer disease

             -  Thrombocytopaenia (&lt;120 x 10^9)

             -  Falls

             -  Haemorrhagic stroke

        -  Alcohol abuse (&gt; 40 u/week)

        -  Continuing injection drug use

        -  Already on anticoagulants

      Patients will have serum fibrosis markers, micro-bubble US and MRS performed at enrollment,
      after 8 weeks and after 16 weeks. Patients who consent (as part of the clinical management of
      HCV infection) will undergo a liver biopsy at the end of the first 8 week study period.

      Anticoagulation:

      Each patient will be anticoagulated with either warfarin (or Ximelagatran - if available) for
      an 8 week period. During the period of anticoagulation the blood clotting (INR value) will be
      checked regularly to ensure that it stays within a safe but effective range (INR 2.5 - 3.5).
      This will require patients to attend the department 2 - 3 times during the first two weeks of
      treatment but only once every two weeks once the blood clotting measurements are stable.

      Serum Markers:

      A panel of serum markers which will include bilirubin, hyaluronic acid and a2-macroglobulin,
      as used in the fibrotest, as well as procollagen III peptide will be measured. Deviation in
      marker values either individually (or as a composite - fibrotest - score) will be compared
      between the treatment period and the observation period.

      Microbubble and MRS Hepatic vein transit times and MRS values will be measured at enrollment,
      8 weeks and 16 weeks. Deviations in values during treatment periods will be compared to
      observation periods in each group.

      Liver Biopsy:

      Liver biopsy before and after an 8 week course of therapy cannot be justified ethically or
      clinically. However, many of the patients suitable for this study will be due for an interval
      liver biopsy as part of the monitoring of their HCV related liver disease. Consenting
      patients will be biopsied at the end of the first 8 week period. In order to minimise the
      delay between anticoagulation treatment and the liver biopsy vitamin K will be administered
      to normalise INR values. The proportion of activated stellate cells per high power field will
      be compared between patients in the initial treatment group and those in the initial
      observation group.
