  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm pilot study evaluating the antitumor activity and safety of
      niraparib as neoadjuvant therapy in participants with Human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2 (HER2)-negative and breast cancer susceptibility gene mutant (BRCAmut) localized breast
      cancer (primary tumor &gt;=1 centimeters [cm]). Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), breast
      ultrasound, and tumor core biopsy will be performed at the screening (Days -28 to -1).
      Participants will receive niraparib (200 milligrams [mg] orally [PO]) treatment daily for 28
      days (Cycle 1) and then will undergo breast ultrasound at the end of Cycle 1 on Day 28. Based
      on breast ultrasound reports, the participants will either discontinue the study (disease
      progression) or will continue niraparib treatment (complete response [CR], partial response
      [PR] or stable disease [SD]) for an additional cycle (Cycle 2). A breast MRI and breast
      ultrasound will be performed at the end of Cycle 2. Approximately 21 participants will be
      enrolled in this study and the study duration will be approximately 2 years.

             superior vena cava syndrome, uncontrolled hypertension, active uncontrolled
             coagulopathy, bleeding disorder, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining

          -  History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's

          -  Immunocompromised participants.

          -  Known active hepatic disease (Hepatitis B or C).

          -  Prior treatment with a known PARP inhibitor.
