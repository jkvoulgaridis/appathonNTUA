  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the analgesic effect of a combination treatment of exercise and
      mindfulness based meditation in patients with chronic back pain. Half of the participants
      will partake in a 4-week exercise and meditation intervention, while the other half will
      receive a placebo treatment. The investigators hypothesize that a combination treatment
      reduces disability and pain more than the control intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise and mindfulness based mediation can both produce analgesic effects in patients with
      chronic pain, but the mechanisms are not clear.

      Combining treatments could produce analgesic effects that are additive, synergistic, or
      counteractive to each other. Here, the investigators examine the effects of a 4-week
      intervention in patients with chronic low back pain. Patients are assigned to a
      meditation/exercise group or a control group. The investigators will measure pain and
      disability using a variety of tools including surveys (disability, anxiety, mindfulness, and
      pain), pain VAS scales, and quantitative sensory testing.

    <measure>Change in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire is designed to assess self-rated physical disability caused by low back pain. The patient is asked to tick a statement when it applies to him that specific day, this makes it possible to follow changes in time. The end score is the sum of the ticked boxes. The score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 24 (max. disability).</description>

    <description>Subjects will be examined using cutaneous sensory filaments on the forearm with data recorded in grams.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) is a questionnaire based on the Fear-Avoidance Model of Exaggerated Pain Perception, a model created in attempts to explain why some patients with acute painful conditions can recover while other patients develop chronic pain from such conditions. The FABQ measures patients' fear of pain and consequent avoidance of physical activity because of their fear. This questionnaire consists of 16 items, with each item scored from 0-6. Higher scores on the FABQ are indicative of greater fear and avoidance beliefs</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FMI is a 14-item questionnaire for measuring mindfulness. It is most suitable in generalized contexts, where knowledge of the Buddhist background of mindfulness cannot be expected. The 14 items cover all aspects of mindfulness. The purpose is to characterize the experience of mindfulness. The subject is asked to answer every statement as honestly and spontaneously as possible. Each statement is scored on a 1 to 4 scale and a composite score is calculated from all statements.</description>

    <measure>VAS back pain (intensity &amp; unpleasantness)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, daily (pre and post intervention), and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their current level of back pain intensity on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI is an introspective psychological inventory consisting of 40 self-report items pertaining to anxiety affect. It distinguishes between a person's state and trait anxiety levels. The A-Trait and A-State scales comprise 20 items each, scored on a 4-point Likert-type response scale. Higher STAI scores suggest higher levels of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change in Heat unpleasantness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be examined using a heat block with a determined temperature threshold. Subjects will report unpleasantness using a VAS scale.</description>
