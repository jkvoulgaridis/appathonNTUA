      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 T cell
      receptor (TCR) T cells in treating patients with acute leukemia that has come back or does
      not respond to treatment following donor stem cell transplant. T cell receptor is a special
      protein on T cells that helps them recognize proteins on other cells including leukemia. HA-1
      is a protein that is present on the surface of some peoples' blood cells, including leukemia.
      HA-1 T cell immunotherapy enables genes to be added to the donor cells to make them recognize
      HA-1 markers on leukemia cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of HA-1 T TCR T cell immunotherapy in approximately
      12 children and adolescents and 12 adults with recurrent acute leukemia after allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the in vivo persistence of transferred HA-1 TCR T cells in peripheral blood.

      II. To determine the ability of HA-1 TCR T cells to migrate to bone marrow.

      III. To evaluate the function of HA-1 TCR T cells before and, if possible, after adoptive T
      cell transfer.

      IV. To observe whether infusion of HA-1 TCR T cells is followed by a reduction of leukemia
      burden.

      V. To observe whether infusion of HA-1 TCR T cells is followed by a reduction of recipient
      hematopoietic chimerism.

      VI. To observe whether infusion of HA-1 TCR T cells is followed by the appearance or
      recurrence of signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells.

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate for 1-3 doses 3-14 days prior to HA-1 TCR T cell
      administration. Patients then receive CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells intravenously (IV) over
      1 hour.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up closely for 12 weeks and then
      every 6 months for years 1-5, and then every year for years 6-15.
