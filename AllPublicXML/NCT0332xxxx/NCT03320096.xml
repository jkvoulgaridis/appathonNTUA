    <measure>Number of Participants With Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) Score Reduction at Day 30 Post Second Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60 (30 days post second treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success was defined as a reduction on the HDSS score from a value of 3 or 4 at baseline to a 1 or 2 at 30-day post second treatment. The HDSS was a validated scale used for primary axillary/underarm hyperhidrosis participants. HDSS provides a qualitative measure of the severity of participant's condition based on how it affects their daily activities. It is a 4-point scale (1-4) with scores as: 1 (underarm sweating was never noticeable and never interferes with daily activities); 2 (underarm sweating was tolerable but sometimes interferes with daily activities); 3 (underarm sweating was barely tolerable and frequently interferes with daily activities); and 4 (underarm sweating was intolerable and always interferes with daily activities).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With HDSS Score Reduction at Day 90 Post Second Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 120 (90 days post second treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success was defined as an HDSS score reduction from a value of a 3 or 4 to a 1 or 2 at 90-day post second treatment. The HDSS was a validated scale used for primary axillary/underarm hyperhidrosis participants. HDSS provides a qualitative measure of the severity of participant's condition based on how it affects their daily activities. It is a 4-point scale (1-4) with scores as: 1 (underarm sweating was never noticeable and never interferes with daily activities); 2 (underarm sweating was tolerable but sometimes interferes with daily activities); 3 (underarm sweating was barely tolerable and frequently interferes with daily activities); and 4 (underarm sweating was intolerable and always interferes with daily activities).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Gravimetric Axillary Sweat Reduction by at Least 50 Percent (%) at Days 30 and 90 Post Second Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 60 (30 days post second treatment) and 120 (90 days post second treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success for gravimetric sweat production test was defined as a 50% or more reduction in spontaneous sweat production compared to baseline at 30 days and 90 days post second treatment. Gravimetric sweat production was measured using a pre-weighed filter paper placed into the axilla for a period of 5 minutes. The paper was removed and weighed and rate of sweat production was calculated in milligram per 5 minute (mg/5 min) based on the difference in end-weight and pre-weight.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Showed Improvement With the Starch Iodine Test at Days 30 and 90 Post Second Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 60 (30 days post second treatment) and 120 (90 days post second treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement for the starch iodine test was defined as a reduction in the dark blue starch iodine area, both the left and right axilla needed to show improvement for a participant to be classified as improved. The starch iodine test was used to assess the area involved in excessive sweating by visually identifying areas that were actively producing sweat. The test was performed by applying iodine solution to the axilla and allowing the solution to dry. After drying, starch was sprinkled on the area. The light-brown iodine color turns dark purple as iodine-starch complexes form in the liquid medium with the sweat rising to the surface of the affected area. Starch iodine test was captured with digital images.</description>

             measured gravimetrically at room temperature/humidity (20 - 25.6Â°C/20-80%) over a
             period of 5 minutes. (Patients should be at rest for at least 30 minutes after
             physical exercise including walking.)

          -  HDSS score of 3 or 4. An attempt will be made to approximate an equal number of scores
             3 and 4.

          -  Willingness to refrain from use of aspirin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen or any other NSAID,
             and Vitamin E in the 2 weeks prior to each study treatment .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dermal disorder including infection at anticipated treatment sites in either axilla.

          -  Previous botulinum toxin treatment of the axilla in the past year.

          -  Expected use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of any other disease during the
             study period.

          -  Known allergy to starch powder, iodine, lidocaine, or epinephrine.

          -  Secondary hyperhidrosis, for example, hyperhidrosis that is secondary to other
             underlying diseases including hyperthyroidism, lymphoma and malaria.

          -  Previous surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis including sympathectomy, surgical
             debulking of the sweat glands, subcutaneous tissue curettage and ultrasonic surgery.

        <title>Number of Participants With Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) Score Reduction at Day 30 Post Second Treatment</title>
        <description>Treatment success was defined as a reduction on the HDSS score from a value of 3 or 4 at baseline to a 1 or 2 at 30-day post second treatment. The HDSS was a validated scale used for primary axillary/underarm hyperhidrosis participants. HDSS provides a qualitative measure of the severity of participant's condition based on how it affects their daily activities. It is a 4-point scale (1-4) with scores as: 1 (underarm sweating was never noticeable and never interferes with daily activities); 2 (underarm sweating was tolerable but sometimes interferes with daily activities); 3 (underarm sweating was barely tolerable and frequently interferes with daily activities); and 4 (underarm sweating was intolerable and always interferes with daily activities).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Showed Improvement With the Starch Iodine Test at Days 30 and 90 Post Second Treatment</title>
        <description>Improvement for the starch iodine test was defined as a reduction in the dark blue starch iodine area, both the left and right axilla needed to show improvement for a participant to be classified as improved. The starch iodine test was used to assess the area involved in excessive sweating by visually identifying areas that were actively producing sweat. The test was performed by applying iodine solution to the axilla and allowing the solution to dry. After drying, starch was sprinkled on the area. The light-brown iodine color turns dark purple as iodine-starch complexes form in the liquid medium with the sweat rising to the surface of the affected area. Starch iodine test was captured with digital images.</description>
