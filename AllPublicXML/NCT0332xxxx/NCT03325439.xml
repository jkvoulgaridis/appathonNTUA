  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of brivaracetam (BRV) in
      neonates who have seizures that are not adequately controlled with previous antiepileptic
      drug (AED) treatment, and to identify the optimal BRV dose (Exploratory Cohort) for the
      treatment of subjects enrolled into the Confirmatory Cohorts of this study.

    <description>Exploratory Cohort:
Subjects will be dosed with BRV (0.5 mg/kg twice daily (bid)) according to the sites standard procedures. Treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) per standard of care (first-line, second-line, or subsequent treatment) will continue in parallel with BRV treatment.
Confirmatory Cohort:
For subjects who enter the Confirmatory Cohorts, the dosing of BRV will be determined based on the Pharmacokinetic findings of the Exploratory Cohort. Administration of BRV is proposed as approximately 15-minute intravenous (iv) infusions. Treatment with previous antiepileptic drugs is permitted to continue if the subject is on a stable dose from 1 hour prior to initiation of the BRV treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmation on video-electroencephalography (VEEG) of &gt;= 2 minutes of cumulative
             electroencephalographic neonatal seizures (ENS), or &gt;=3 identifiable ENS prior to
             entering the Evaluation Period, despite receiving previous antiepileptic drug
             treatment for the treatment of electroencephalographic seizures. The occurrence of ENS
             during an up to 1-hour period must be confirmed either by the local or central VEEG
             reader prior to drug administration. Preferably, the central VEEG reader should
             confirm the required ENS

          -  Subject is male or female and must be at least 34 weeks of corrected gestational age
             (CGA). In addition, term neonates up to 27 days of postnatal age (PNA) and preterm
             neonates up to 40 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA) and 27 days of PNA can be enrolled

          -  Subject weighs at least 2.3 kg at the time of enrollment

          -  Subjects with or without concomitant hypothermia treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are not permitted to be enrolled in the study if any of the following criteria are
        met:

          -  Subject receiving antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment other than phenobarbital,
             midazolam, phenytoin, levetiracetam (≤60 mg/kg/day), or lidocaine for the treatment of
             seizures prior to or at the time of enrollment (Confirmatory Cohorts only)

          -  Subject with seizures responding to previous AED treatment immediately prior to BRV
             treatment, pyridoxine treatment, or correction of metabolic disturbances
             (hypoglycemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypocalcemia)

          -  Subject requires extra corporeal membrane oxygenation

          -  Subject has seizures related to prenatal maternal drug use or drug withdrawal

          -  Subject has known severe disturbance of hemostasis, as assessed by the Investigator

          -  Subject has a poor prognosis for survival, as judged by the Investigator

             aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase
             (ALP), with the following exception: For subjects with perinatal asphyxia, elevation
             of AST, ALT or ALP &lt;5x ULN is acceptable, if initial and peak elevation of liver
             function tests (LFTs) occurs within 5 days after birth, and the time course of LFT
             elevation is compatible with hepatic injury due to perinatal asphyxia. The
             determination of ULN will be based on the subject's gestational age (GA) and the
             site's normal range values for the respective GA

          -  Subject has direct (conjugated) bilirubin levels &gt;2 mg/dL

             elevated bilirubin

          -  Subject with rapidly increasing bilirubin that may preclude the subject from inclusion
             in the study at the discretion of the Investigator
