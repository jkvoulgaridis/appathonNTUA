      A Phase I study to establish the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and efficacy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neihulizumab (AbGn-168H) is an immune checkpoint agonist antibody that regulates T cell
      homeostasis. The unique mechanism of action provides a natural regulation of T cell
      homeostasis that induces cell death preferentially in late-stage activated T cells without
      affecting resting T cells and early-activated T cells. Because pathogenic T cells underlying
      the inflammatory conditions are usually in late-stage activated state, eliminating this
      population of cells can potentially result in controlling autoimmune inflammation of T cell
      associated diseases, such as GvHD.

             unresolved hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, unstable hemodynamics, or evidence
             of current or previous clinically significant disease, medical condition or finding
             (including vital signs and ECG) that in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data.

         18. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to any systemically administered antibody agent
             or its excipients.
