    <textblock>
      Blunt pelvic trauma results in posterior urethral distraction defects (PUDDs) in ª10% of
      cases; such injury commonly involves the membranous urethra at the point of departure from
      the bulbospongiosum, at the prostatomembranous junction, or at any point between its
      departure and the apex of the prostate [1]. PUDDs are complex pathologically, involving
      displacement and misalignment of the severed urethral ends with intervening and surrounding
      ﬁbrosis. Detached bony fragments and callus formation add to the pathological complexity. For
      a successful repair of a PUDD it is necessary to identify the speciﬁc anatomy of the
      distraction defect before undertaking any treatment[2].

      Currently most PFUDDI are associated with trauma as an etiology. Posterior urethral
      disruption occurs in 4-14% of pelvic ring fractures and 80-90% of posterior urethral injuries
      are associated with pelvic fractures[4]. Sixty-five percent of post-traumatic posterior
      urethral injuries are complete[5]. Following trauma the ruptured urethra is usually replaced
      by fibrosis and in between there is no lumen. Anastomotic urethroplasty is a well established
      procedure to deal with posterior urethral strictures and gives very good long-term
      results[6,7].

      The success rate of repeat surgery for failed urethroplasty is reported to be less than that
      for primary urethroplasty. Jakse et al;reported a 71% failure rate following end-to-end
      urethroplasty with a history of prior urethroplasty[8].

      The success rate of end-to-end anastomosis varies from 77 to 95% as described by different
      series[9,10,11,12]There are very few reports regarding urethroplasty for previously failed
      PFUDDI[13,14],The most common causes of failure of urethroplasty are the inadequate excision
      of the strictured segment and surrounding fibrosis, improper case selection and ischemia[14].

      For a successful repair of a PFUDDI it is necessary to identify the specific anatomy of the
      distraction defect before undertaking any treatment, The classic approach for evaluating a
      PFUDDI is through Retrograde Urethrography [RUG] and Voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG),
      particularly while the patient is attempting to void. However, this study can often give a
      false interpretation of the exact anatomy of the distraction defect on many occasions[15].

      It often cannot provide an accurate determination of the defect length because of poor
      prostatic urethral filling and it provides little information on the extent of corpus
      spongiosal fibrosis or prostatic displacement[15].

      CTCUG was more informative than conventional radiology in several aspects; the location and
      the length of the distraction defect; the direction of alignment or misalignment; the bone
      anatomy (ectopic fragments, callus); and the presence of additional urinary pathology
      (ﬁstulae, false passages, diverticulae)[2].
