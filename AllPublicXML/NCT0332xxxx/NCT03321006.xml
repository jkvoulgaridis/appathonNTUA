  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the third most common health condition affecting older
      adults after heart disease and arthritis and is the fifth leading cause of years lived with
      disability worldwide. Many hearing-impaired older adults avoid or withdraw from social
      contexts in which background noise will make it difficult to communicate, resulting in social
      isolation and reduced communication with family and friends.Social isolation and loneliness
      have been linked to numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including dementia,
      depression, and mortality, and they may also lead to declining physical activity and the
      development of the syndrome of frailty. In this project it is hypothesized that untreated
      ARHL represents a distinct route to developing Late-life Depression (LLD) and that
      individuals with comorbid ARHL/LLD are unlikely to respond to treatments (i.e.,
      antidepressant medication) that do not treat the underlying hearing problem. Initial studies
      suggest remediation of hearing loss using hearing aids or cochlear implantation may decrease
      depressive symptoms acutely and over the course of 6 to 12 months follow-up. However, the
      clinical significance of these findings is obscured by lack of rigorous control groups,
      failure to objectively document hearing aid compliance, and enrollment of study populations
      lacking syndromal depression or even a threshold symptom score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct the first clinical trial possessing these design features.40
      individuals will be recruited who are aged ≥60 years, diagnosed with a clinically significant
      depressive disorder, and have moderate ARHL with impaired speech discrimination.
      Comprehensive baseline psychiatric, audiometric, neuropsychological, and functional
      assessment will be performed. Participants then will be randomized to receive antidepressant
      medication (AD) treatment plus full amplification hearing aids or antidepressant medication
      plus low amplification hearing aids over a 12-week prospective trial. Data from this study
      could suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for LLD and thereby mitigate its public health
      burden, while also contributing to the increased recognition and treatment of ARHL more
      generally.

    <measure>Hamilton Rating Score for Depression (HRSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is rated by a clinician among 24 dimensions with a score on a 3 or 5 point scale. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal. Scores of 20 or higher indicate moderate, severe, or very severe depression, and are usually required for entry into a clinical trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment: 0 normal, not at all ill to 7 Among the most extremely ill patients worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Adjustment Scale Self-Report (SAS-SR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS-SR contains 54 questions that measure instrumental and expressive role performance over the past 2 weeks. Each question is rated on a 5-point scale. The overall adjustment score is obtained by summing the scores of all the items and dividing by the number of items answered.
The SAS-R overall score ranges from 0-270, with higher questions indication more impairment.</description>
