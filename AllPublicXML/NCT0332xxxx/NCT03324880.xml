  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding an investigational medication called
      recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH[1-84]) to standard hypoparathyroidism therapy
      (oral calcium and active vitamin D tablets) may result in superior improvements in symptoms
      of hypoparathyroidism assessed by hypoparathyroidism symptom diary (HPT-SD) symptom scale
      compared with standard therapy.

    <description>The HPT-SD is a 13-item patient-reported outcomes instrument that consists of the following items: symptom subscale (items 1-7), anxiety (item 8), sadness and depression (item 9) and impact subscale (items 10-13). For items 1-9, the individual score ranges from None=0 to Very severe=4 and for items 10-13, it ranges from Not at all=0 to Very much=2. For symptom subscale score, the average score of the symptom items 1-7 will be calculated.</description>

          -  Has chronic hypoparathyroidism with onset 12 months or more before screening. The
             diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism is established based on hypocalcemia in the setting of
             inappropriately low serum PTH levels.

          -  During the Week -3 screening visit, the participant reports by history at least 2 of
             the following symptoms related to hypoparathyroidism occurring within the 2 weeks
             before Week -3 visit: muscle cramps, muscle spasms or twitching, tingling, numbness,
             heaviness in arms or legs, physical fatigue, or slowed or confused thinking (brain
             fog).

          -  The participant must have a Hypoparathyroidism Symptom Diary (HPT-SD) symptom subscale
             Sum Score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 10 during the 14-day period immediately
             prior to the baseline (Week 0) visit (Day -14 to Day -1). In addition, the participant
             must have at least 4 HPT-SD diaries completed in the first 7 day period and at least 4
             HPT-SD diaries completed in second 7 day period.

          -  Must be treated with active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) alone or in
             conjunction with calcium supplements for at least 4 months prior to the screening

             the normal range but not undetectable in participant treated with thyroid hormone may
             be allowed if there is no anticipated need for a change in thyroid hormone dose during
             the trial.

          -  Has serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &gt;=50 mmol/L (20 nanograms per milliliter [ng/mL])

             unless directed to remain on the supplements used prior to enrollment in the current
             study by the investigator after consultation with the medical monitor.

          -  With regard to female participants: women who are postmenopausal (12 consecutive
             months of spontaneous amenorrhea and age &gt;= 51 years) and women who are surgically
             sterilized can be enrolled. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test at randomization and be willing to comply with any applicable
             contraceptive requirements of the protocol and pregnancy testing for the duration of

          -  Use of prohibited medications, such as loop and thiazide diuretics, phosphate binders
             (other than calcium carbonate), digoxin, lithium, methotrexate, or systemic

          -  Participation in any other investigational study in which receipt of investigational
             drug or device occurred within 6 months before screening for this study. Prior
             treatment with PTH-like drugs (whether commercially available or through participation
             in an investigational study), including PTH(1-84), PTH(1-34), or other N-terminal
             fragments or analogs of PTH or PTH-related protein, within 3 months before screening.

          -  Use of other drugs known to influence calcium and bone metabolism, such as calcitonin,

          -  Any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may require
             treatment or make the participant unlikely to fully complete the study or any
             condition that presents undue risk from the investigational product or procedures. For
             example, illness that is anticipated to be chronic and not transient.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational product,
