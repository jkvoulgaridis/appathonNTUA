  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be designed as a prospective surveillance of the immune response to seasonal
      influenza vaccination in 240 healthy children and adults ages 9 and over. Study duration will
      be 5 years, with a participant duration of 6 months. Subjects will receive a quadrivalent
      inactivated influenza vaccine, at a dose of not less than 15 ug of hemagglutinin (HA), by
      intramuscular injection in open label fashion on day 0. Blood draws will occur at baseline,
      day 7, 28 and 90. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between
      first influenza A virus exposure (inferred by age), vaccine history, and baseline serum
      antibody and Memory B cell (MBC) specificity, and the magnitude and breadth of the subsequent
      B cell response to seasonal influenza vaccine in healthy adults and children.

      The study will be designed as a prospective surveillance of the immune response to seasonal
      influenza vaccination in 240 healthy children and adults ages 9 and over. Study duration will
      be 5 years, with a participant duration of 6 months. Subjects will receive a quadrivalent
      inactivated influenza vaccine, at a dose of not less than 15 ug of hemagglutinin (HA), by
      intramuscular injection in open label fashion on day 0. Blood draws will occur at baseline,
      day 7, 28 and 90. The primary hypothesis being tested in this study is that there will be
      differences in the specificity and magnitude of the HA-specific B cell response depending on
      the age, previous vaccine history and baseline B cell reactivity. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the relationship between first influenza A virus exposure (inferred
      by age), vaccine history, and baseline serum antibody and Memory B cell (MBC) specificity,
      and the magnitude and breadth of the subsequent B cell response to seasonal influenza vaccine
      in healthy adults and children. The secondary objective is to determine the durability of the
      antibody response and relationship between acute and durable antibody.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject report of known hypersensitivity to allergy to components of the study vaccine
             or other components of the study vaccine.

          2. Subject report of known latex allergy.

          3. Subject report of a history of severe reactions following previous immunization with

             breastfeeding or intends to become pregnant during the study period between enrollment
             and 90 days following receipt of vaccine. Pregnancy will be determined by subject
             interview. Pregnancy testing is not done in this study since there is no increased
             risk in pregnancy.

          6. The subject is immunosuppressed as a result of an underlying illness or treatment with
             immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs, or use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation
             therapy within the preceding 36 months.

          7. The subject has an active neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer or
             prostate cancer that is stable in the absence of therapy) or a history of any

             within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study or plans to receive another
             vaccine within the next 28 days after vaccination.

         11. The subject has an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would

             chronic medical disease or conditions defined as persisting for 3 months (defined as
             90 days) or longer, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury,
             render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere
             with the evaluation of responses of the subject's successful completion of the study.

             enrollment or vaccination. Subjects who had an acute illness that was treated symptoms
             resolved are eligible to enroll as long as treatment is completed and symptoms
             resolved &gt; 3 days prior to enrollment.

         13. The subject is currently participating or plans to participate in a study that
             involves an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or
             medication) or has received an experimental agent within 1 month prior to enrollment
             in this study, or expects to receive another experimental agent during participation
             in this study, or intends to donate blood during the study period.

         14. The subject has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator,
             place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to
             meet the requirements of the protocol.

         15. The subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the 5 years prior to enrollment.

         16. The subject has a known human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C
             infection.

         17. Subject weighs less than 50 lbs.

         18. Subject expects to have a medical procedure during the upcoming 8 weeks that estimates
             blood loss to exceed 400 cc for adults or for children would exceed 3 ml/kg.
