  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a frequent disease and a serious public health problem, of which suicide is the
      most severe complication. Its treatment is based on the introduction of antidepressant which
      not only proposes a significant delay in the relief of symptoms but also by the phenomenon of
      lifting of inhibition can increase the suicidal risk during the initiation phase. Therefore
      there is a major interest in proposing a monitoring of these dark and suicidal ideas,
      immediately after the implementation of such treatment as well as other symptoms of
      depression. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the mechanisms underlying this
      increase in dark and suicidal ideas in this context.

      The study propose to assess, with an ecological momentary assessment method, the evolution of
      black ideas over 30 days following the introduction or switch of an oral antidepressants.

      103 patients will be recruited suffering from a current major depressive disorder in the
      Montpellier University Hospital.

      Each patient will attend a total of 3 scheduled visits, which will be completed over a period
      of 1 month (inclusion, between 10-15 days, 1 month. During this month, the patient will have
      to complete daily assesments throught a smartphone application &quot;Depasse&quot;.

      This Servier application allows the daily monitoring of symptoms allowing a regular
      evaluation, in the form of smileys simulating a Likert type scale evaluation of 1 to 5.

      10 parameters are evaluated: moral, black thoughts, sleep, stress, concentration, social
      activities, energy, pleasure, motivation and libido. Note that when the patient expresses
      dark thoughts, he is then asked if he wants to hurt himself. If he answers yes, he is then
      asked to contact an emergency service.

      One of its originalities is the addition of positive psychology approaches with a positive
      reinforcement of this evaluation through reward by a smiley in a smiley box and obtaining a
      &quot;pleasant&quot; image for motivation and incentive.

      There is the possibility to have the graphical follow-up of the various parameters and to
      send them by mail to his treating psychiatrist.

      Advice adapted to the mood of the day is provided taking into account the &quot;dysfunctional&quot;
      parameters.

      Similarly, the emergency buoy tool provides access to emergency numbers and directs the
      patient to seek care.

      Intelligence of the weight and the treatments established. The app also has a notification
      setting to remind the patient to evaluate themselves daily.

    <description>Application DEPASSE in depressed patients. This application was developed by the laboratory SERVIER, by a scientific committee of psychologists and psychiatrists: Pr. Courtet, Dr Rimlinger and Pr. Swendsen.
Depasse is available for all on the App store and on Googleplay.
This application has several interests:
- The first is the daily monitoring of the symptoms allowing a regular evaluation throught smileys simulating a scale from 1 to 5. The 10 parameters evaluated are: mood, dark ideas, sleep, stress, concentration, social activities, energy, pleasure, motivation and libido.
There is the possibility to generate a graph representing the evolution of these parameters.
Tips adapted to the actual mood are provided related to the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; parameters.</description>
