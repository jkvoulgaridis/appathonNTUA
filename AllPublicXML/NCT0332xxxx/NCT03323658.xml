      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of topical bexarotene 1% (weight by weight
      [w/w]) gel for evaluation in healthy women. (Dose Escalation Group) II. Conduct an
      intervention of topical 1% bexarotene gel to an unaffected breast of healthy women at high
      risk for breast cancer for 4 weeks at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as determined during
      the dose escalation group phase to assess bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue.
      (Dose Expansion Group)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To detect bexarotene concentration in the serum at baseline and at 4 weeks of treatment.

      II. To detect bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue at 4 weeks of treatment in the
      dose escalation group.

      III. To investigate the effects of topical bexarotene on serum biomarkers. IV. To investigate
      the biologic effects of topical bexarotene 1% gel in the breast tissue, we will determine the
      change from baseline in i) lipid biomarkers (total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density
      lipoprotein [LDL], high density lipoprotein [HDL]), ii) thyroid function biomarkers (thyroid
      stimulating hormone [TSH], T4, T3), iii) calcium.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine changes in gene expression associated with retinoid action. (Dose Expansion
      Group)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Group 1 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 4 weeks;
      Group 2 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 1 week
      and then daily for 3 weeks after confirmation that toxicity is at an acceptable range; Group
      3 will apply 10mg bexarotene topically to one breast every other day (QOD) for 1 week, then
      daily for 1 week, and then 20mg daily for 2 weeks after confirmation that toxicity is at an
      acceptable range.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
