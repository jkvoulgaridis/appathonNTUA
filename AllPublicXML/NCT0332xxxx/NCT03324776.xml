      To examine the effects of adding prandial Afrezza inhaled insulin to patients with type 2
      diabetes who are not controlled after at least 6 months of other diabetes treatments
      including oral agents, basal insulin, or GLP-1 use.

    <textblock>
      Clinical inertia in intensifying treatment of type 2 diabetes patients occurs in the range of
      70% in numerous real world database assessments. The investigator proposes treating patients
      with Afrezza who have an index HbA1c between 7.5% and 11.5% despite being treated with
      diabetes medications for at least 6 months. The response to Afrezza will be assessed with
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMS) studies and initial and follow-up HbA1cs. The
      goal is to assess how the investigator can rapidly and safely initiate intensification in
      this patient population, where extensive delays in HbA1c improvement often occur.
