  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study in patients with resectable and borderline resectable
      pancreas cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive standard chemotherapy and chemoradiation for pancreatic cancer. The
      study intervention is an adaptive approach which modifies systemic therapy based on clinical
      assessments of treatment response. Treatment response will be assessed by imaging (CT scan),
      biomarker (serum CA19-9) and performance status assessment (SPPB and CES-D evaluations) at
      the first restaging assessment.

      Treatment response will be categorized as:

        1. response;

        2. stable disease;

        3. local disease progression;

        4. metastatic disease progression.

      After the first restaging evaluation, patients who demonstrate:

        1. a response will be maintained on the same chemotherapy;

        2. stable disease will be changed to a defined alternative chemotherapy or molecular
           profile-directed therapy;

        3. local progression will receive chemoradiation;

        4. metastatic disease will be removed from the trial.

      Patients who complete four months of chemotherapy, will be treated with chemoradiation
      (50.4Gy in 28 fractions). In the absence of local disease progression deemed inoperable, or
      metastatic disease progression, patients will be offered surgical resection. Patients who did
      not receive four months of systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant setting will be offered four
      months of adjuvant therapy at the discretion of their treating physicians.

    <description>After the first restaging evaluation, further treatment will be based on treatment response.

If, at the initial restaging, the patient has local disease progression amenable to surgical resection, he or she will receive chemoradiation, rather than continued chemotherapy, so the window of opportunity for surgical resection is not lost.</description>
