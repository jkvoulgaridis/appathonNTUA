  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if Acthar Gel is safe and effective to treat
      pulmonary sarcoidosis.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive a shot under their
      skin of Acthar Gel or a matching placebo gel that has no drug in it. They will receive their
      assigned shot twice a week for 24 weeks.

      All participants who complete the 24-week treatment period will be eligible to receive Acthar
      Gel for 24 more weeks, even if they were originally in the placebo group.

      07-Apr-2020: This trial is continuing for enrolled participants. Recruiting for new
      participants has stopped at all sites because of COVID-19. Overall Recruitment Status is
      &quot;Active, Not Recruiting&quot;. The Actual Number of Participants is still &quot;Anticipated&quot;. When it
      is safe, Overall Recruiting Status will change back to &quot;Recruiting&quot;. When that happens, look
      at Locations to see which sites have started recruiting again.

    <description>King's Sarcoidosis Questionnaire (General Health) is a 28-item questionnaire for participants to indicate the status of their sarcoidosis and treatment.

Improved (+1) based on a change of ≥ 4 points
Unchanged (0) based on a change of &gt;- 4 to &lt; 4 points

    <measure>Number of Participants Receiving each Dose of Prednisone</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Corticosteroids are typically the first-line when treatment of sarcoidosis is required. Concerns of significant corticosteroid toxicity results in efforts to taper as early as possible. Participants are evaluated at each visit following randomization, and an algorithm is used to taper them off prednisone using incremental doses of 40, 30, 20, 10, 7.5, 5, 2.5 and 0 mg.
When the clinical status is:
Improvement, they go down by one level
First stable visit without toxicity, they continue the same dose
Second stable visit without toxicity, the go down by one level
Stable visit with toxicity, their toxicity is treated and they may go down by one level
Worsening, they go up by one or two levels, but do not exceed 40 mg/day</description>

          -  Has been receiving a stable prednisone dose between 5 mg and 40 mg (or equivalent) for
             pulmonary sarcoidosis, for at least 4 weeks before screening, or a stable dose of

          -  Has lung function within protocol-defined parameters

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has at least a 10% change in forced vital capacity (FVC) on spirometry between Visits
