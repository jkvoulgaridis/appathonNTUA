  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the increase in comfort and comfortable contact lens (CL) wear time
      associated with application of TrueTear (active intranasal neurostimulation) compared with
      application of TrueTear sham control (intranasal application which is not electrically
      active) in symptomatic CL wearers.

    <measure>Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire (CLDEQ-8) Score in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The CLDEQ-8 is a validated questionnaire used to quantify symptoms experienced by the contact lenses (CLs) wearer. The participants were asked to respond to 8 questions about how their CLs performed over the preceding 2-week period. 4 questions (Eye discomfort, Eye dryness, Changeable blurry vision and Closing your eyes) answered on a scale of 0=Never to 4=Constantly; 3 questions about the end of wearing time (Discomfort, Dryness, Changeable blurry vision) answered on a scale of 0=Never have it to 5=Very Intense and 1 question (Removing your lenses) on a scale of 1=Never to 6=Several times a day for a total possible score of 1(best) to 37 (worst). The study eye was defined as the qualified eye with the greatest increase in tear production with stimulation by a cotton swab at the Screening Visit. If both eyes qualified, then the right eye was designated as the study eye.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort Rating Score in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>CL Insertion, After 2 hours and the End of Day on Day 24</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed contact lens comfort in the study eye using a 100 point scale where a score of 0=Extremely uncomfortable and a score of 100=Extremely comfortable. The study eye was defined as the qualified eye with the greatest increase in tear production with stimulation by a cotton swab at the Screening Visit. If both eyes qualified, then the right eye was designated as the study eye.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfortable Wear Time (CWT) in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 24</time_frame>
    <description>CWT was calculated by taking the difference between the time participants reported started to find their CLs getting uncomfortable and the reported insertion time for that day. The study eye was defined as the qualified eye with the greatest increase in tear production with stimulation by a cotton swab at the Screening Visit. If both eyes qualified, then the right eye was designated as the study eye.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Wear Time (Total WT) in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 24</time_frame>
    <description>Total WT was calculated by taking the difference between the time participants reported removing their CLs and the reported insertion time for that day. The study eye was defined as the qualified eye with the greatest increase in tear production with stimulation by a cotton swab at the Screening Visit. If both eyes qualified, then the right eye was designated as the study eye.</description>

          <title>Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire (CLDEQ-8) Score in the Study Eye</title>
          <description>The CLDEQ-8 is a validated questionnaire used to quantify symptoms experienced by the contact lenses (CLs) wearer. The participants were asked to respond to 8 questions about how their CLs performed over the preceding 2-week period. 4 questions (Eye discomfort, Eye dryness, Changeable blurry vision and Closing your eyes) answered on a scale of 0=Never to 4=Constantly; 3 questions about the end of wearing time (Discomfort, Dryness, Changeable blurry vision) answered on a scale of 0=Never have it to 5=Very Intense and 1 question (Removing your lenses) on a scale of 1=Never to 6=Several times a day for a total possible score of 1(best) to 37 (worst). The study eye was defined as the qualified eye with the greatest increase in tear production with stimulation by a cotton swab at the Screening Visit. If both eyes qualified, then the right eye was designated as the study eye.</description>

        <description>The participant assessed contact lens comfort in the study eye using a 100 point scale where a score of 0=Extremely uncomfortable and a score of 100=Extremely comfortable. The study eye was defined as the qualified eye with the greatest increase in tear production with stimulation by a cotton swab at the Screening Visit. If both eyes qualified, then the right eye was designated as the study eye.</description>
