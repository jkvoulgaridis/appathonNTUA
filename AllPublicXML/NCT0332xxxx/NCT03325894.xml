    <measure>Total Sleep Disturbance Score of Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ ) at Final On-Treatment Assessment (FoTA)</measure>
    <time_frame>FoTA (up to 330 days)</time_frame>
    <description>CSHQ was a tool designed to screen for the most common sleep problems in children and consisted of 33 items for scoring and several extra items intended to provide administrators with other potentially useful information about respondents. The instrument evaluates the 8 different subscales: bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness. A 3-point scale was used for rating: &quot;usually&quot; if the sleep behavior occurs 5 to 7 times per week, &quot;sometimes&quot; for 2 to 4 times per week, and &quot;rarely&quot; for once or not at all during the week. The TSD score, which is the sum of all responses, included all items of the 8 subscales, but consisted of only 33 items because two on the bedtime resistance and sleep anxiety subscales were identical (range: 0, 99). A negative value indicates less sleep disturbance.</description>

    <description>Clinician administered ADHD-RS-5, child, home version total score were analyzed. ADHD-RS-5 consists of 18 items designed to reflect current symptomatology of ADHD based on diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (reflecting no symptoms) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms) with total scores ranging from 0-54. The 18 items may be grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (9 items) and inattentiveness (9 items). Higher total scores indicated higher impairment and lower scores indicated no impairment. FoTA was defined as the last valid assessment obtained after Baseline and whilst on investigational product (on or before 2 days after the last dose date).</description>

        <description>PSQ was a 7-item questionnaire typically used to assess sleep quality with pharmacologic treatment. The questionnaire collects data on average time to sleep, sleep latency, frequency of interrupted sleep, duration of interrupted sleep, total sleep time and sleep quality over the last week. The assessment was done by the nature of the responses, not by a numbered scale. Participants analyzed for number of times woke up per night category were only the participants who responded as yes for the woke up during the night category in this outcome measure. FoTA was defined as the last valid assessment obtained after Baseline and whilst on investigational product (on or before 2 days after the last dose date). Group A baseline was the baseline of the antecedent studies. Group B baseline was the last value collected before the first dose of investigational product.</description>

        <title>Length of Time Awake Per Night and Length of Time to Fall Asleep Per Night Assessed by Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) at Final On-Treatment Assessment (FoTA)</title>
        <description>PSQ was a 7-item questionnaire typically used to assess sleep quality with pharmacologic treatment. The questionnaire collects data on average time to sleep, sleep latency, frequency of interrupted sleep, duration of interrupted sleep, total sleep time and sleep quality over the last week. FoTA was defined as the last valid assessment obtained after Baseline and whilst on investigational product (on or before 2 days after the last dose date). Group A baseline was the baseline of the antecedent studies. Group B baseline was the last value collected before the first dose of investigational product. Length of time awake per night and length of time to fall asleep per night was assessed at FoTA.</description>

        <title>Total Sleep Disturbance Score of Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ ) at Final On-Treatment Assessment (FoTA)</title>
        <description>CSHQ was a tool designed to screen for the most common sleep problems in children and consisted of 33 items for scoring and several extra items intended to provide administrators with other potentially useful information about respondents. The instrument evaluates the 8 different subscales: bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness. A 3-point scale was used for rating: &quot;usually&quot; if the sleep behavior occurs 5 to 7 times per week, &quot;sometimes&quot; for 2 to 4 times per week, and &quot;rarely&quot; for once or not at all during the week. The TSD score, which is the sum of all responses, included all items of the 8 subscales, but consisted of only 33 items because two on the bedtime resistance and sleep anxiety subscales were identical (range: 0, 99). A negative value indicates less sleep disturbance.</description>

        <description>Clinician administered ADHD-RS-5, child, home version total score were analyzed. ADHD-RS-5 consists of 18 items designed to reflect current symptomatology of ADHD based on diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (reflecting no symptoms) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms) with total scores ranging from 0-54. The 18 items may be grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (9 items) and inattentiveness (9 items). Higher total scores indicated higher impairment and lower scores indicated no impairment. FoTA was defined as the last valid assessment obtained after Baseline and whilst on investigational product (on or before 2 days after the last dose date).</description>
