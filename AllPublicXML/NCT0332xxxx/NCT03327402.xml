    <time_frame>FoTA (up to Day 30)</time_frame>
    <description>The CSHQ was a validated, retrospective, parent-reported sleep screening tool. The questionnaire consisted of 35 items that yield a TSD score, as well as 8 subscale scores, including bedtime resistance, sleep duration, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, night wakings, daytime sleepiness, sleep anxiety, and sleep onset delay. Each item receives a score from 1 (meaning the problem occurs rarely) to 3 (meaning the problem usually occurs); therefore, a higher score is the worse outcome. Scale ranges are as follows: Bedtime Resistance: 6 to 18, Sleep Onset Delay: 1 to 3, Sleep Duration: 3 to 9, Sleep Anxiety: 4 to 12, Night Wakings: 3 to 9, Parasomnias: 7 to 21, Disordered Breathing: 3 to 9, Daytime Sleepiness: 8 to 24, and Total Disturbance (items from all scales): 33 to 99. A negative value indicated less sleep disturbance.</description>

        <title>Total Sleep Disturbance Score of Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ ) at Final On-Treatment Assessment</title>
        <description>The CSHQ was a validated, retrospective, parent-reported sleep screening tool. The questionnaire consisted of 35 items that yield a TSD score, as well as 8 subscale scores, including bedtime resistance, sleep duration, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, night wakings, daytime sleepiness, sleep anxiety, and sleep onset delay. Each item receives a score from 1 (meaning the problem occurs rarely) to 3 (meaning the problem usually occurs); therefore, a higher score is the worse outcome. Scale ranges are as follows: Bedtime Resistance: 6 to 18, Sleep Onset Delay: 1 to 3, Sleep Duration: 3 to 9, Sleep Anxiety: 4 to 12, Night Wakings: 3 to 9, Parasomnias: 7 to 21, Disordered Breathing: 3 to 9, Daytime Sleepiness: 8 to 24, and Total Disturbance (items from all scales): 33 to 99. A negative value indicated less sleep disturbance.</description>
