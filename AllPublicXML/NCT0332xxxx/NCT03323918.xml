    <textblock>
      This randomised-controlled trial will assess the effect of an early intervention on the
      social-communicative abilities and brain activity of preschoolers with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD). The childrenÂ´s social-communicative abilities and the related brain activity
      will be evaluated at three time points: before the start of the intervention
      (pre-intervention), immediately after its conclusion (post-intervention) and several weeks
      after its conclusion (follow-up).

    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that parent-implemented interventions are effective in improving
      the social skills of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of the present
      project is to investigate the brain activity changes that are at the basis of the changes
      observed in the children's behaviour. More specifically, the investigators will assess the
      effect of Project ImPACT, a parent-implemented intervention, which teaches parents techniques
      to stimulate the social-communicative abilities of their children.

      The intervention is suitable for preschoolers with a diagnosis of ASD and consists of 18
      sessions of maximum 2 hours each, one session per week, delivered by trained therapists of
      the home guidance services in Flanders. Children with a diagnosis of ASD (or children who are
      suspected of ASD) between 1,5 and 4 years old and their parents will participate in the
      study. They will be randomly assigned to the ImPACT intervention or treatment as usual. The
      investigators will assess the effect of the intervention on the children's
      social-communicative abilities, and on the neural and biological correlates of these
      abilities.

      The families will be invited to come to the Faculty of Psychology and Pedagogical Sciences at
      three time points: before the start of the intervention, immediately after the end of the
      intervention (which is expected to last 18 weeks) and 12 weeks after the end of the
      intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the score of the Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>outcome at 18 weeks from start of intervention (post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>Structured observation of interaction with experimenter assessing joint attention. The measure includes continuous measurement of initiation of joint attention (IJA) and behavioural requests (IBR). The measurement of response to joint attention (RJA) is constrained by the numbered of joint attention bids offered by the administer, which is 14 in total. The IJA, IBR, and RJA subsections are considered separately, and the three scores are not combined. An increase in the IJA and RJA scores is interpreted as an improvement. A decrease in IBR, if combined with an increase of IJA, is generally also interpreted as a qualitative improvement of a child's social initiatives.</description>

    <time_frame>outcome at 18 weeks from start of intervention (post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured observation of interaction with parent and experimenter to assess social communication.
The test contains 9 items that are meant to capture the quality of a child's social interaction, for which the total scores ranges from 0 to 45, and 3 items describing restricted a repetitive behaviour, which is also part of the ASD symptomatology, the total score of which ranges from 0 to 15. Three additional items are coded to add information on symptoms that might be present although they are not specifically part of the ASD syndrome, and refer to activity level, disruptive behaviour, and anxious behaviours.
The BOSCC total score consists in the sum of the total score obtained in the first twelve items (ASD specific symptoms), and ranges from 0 to 60, with the three extra items added separately to integrate information.
In the total and subscale scores, higher scores correspond to more severe symptoms. A decrease in the total score is thus considered a positive outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the score of the Autism Diagnostic Observational Scale - 2 (ADOS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>follow-up at 30 weeks from beginning of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A standard measure internationally used to identify symptoms of autism. The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with a higher score corresponding to higher symptom severity. The total score results from the sum of two subscales: the Social Affect subscale (SA), with scores ranging from 0 to 22, and the Restricted and Repetitive Behavior one (RRB), with scores ranging from 0 to 8. The ADOS-2 total score is converted through an age-dependednt algorithm to a diagnostic ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 10 (with higher scores indicating higher symptom severity), based on which a diagnostic classification can be formulated (no ASD, ASD, autism).
A reduction in the total score, as well as in a subscale score, is considered a positive outcome, particularly if this leads to a decrease in the conversion score and/or to a milder diagnostic classification.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the score of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (M-SEL)</measure>
    <time_frame>follow-up at 30 weeks from beginning of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>An age-appropriate measure of cognitive development. It measures a child's IQ on a continuous scale from 49 to 130 points, with the average being 100 points. If the child's IQ is lower than 49 or higher than 130, a general indication of &lt;49 or &gt;130 is given. It also provides an indication of a child's mental age between 0 and 68 months. A growth in mental age over time is considered a neutral outcome. A high growth rate (= the change in months is higher than the number of months actually passed between baseline and follow-up) in a domain where a child initially showed a delay is considered a positive outcome.</description>

    <description>Parent report of language development (questionnaire). The questionnaire consists of two subsection: a) number of comprehended words (out of 112), b) number of actively used words (out of 112). The two subscales are kept separate, and no composite score is computed.
The section in use is the 2A section, which is meant for children between 16 and 30 months. Because a number of children in the study are older than 30 months, only the raw scores are taken into account.

    <time_frame>outcome at 18 weeks from start of intervention (post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire over Parenting stress index developed in Nijmegen. Scores range from 0 to 738, distributed over two main subscales: parent-related stress, maximum score 390, and child-related stress, maximum score 348. Each subscale is composed of subdomains. The parent-related stress is described by competence (0-78), role restriction (0-42), attachment (0-42), depression (0-72), health (0-36), social isolation (0-36), marital relationship (0-42). The child-related stress is described by adaptation (scores: 0-78), temperament (0-60), distractability (0-72), demandingness (0-60), positive reinforcement (0-48), acceptance (0-72). An algorithm converts the subscores and the total score to a descriptive classification of parental stress level (very low, low, below average, average, above average, high, very high). Special norms hold for clinical samples.
Higher values correspond to higher parental stress. A score reduction is a positive outcome.</description>

    <description>Project ImPACT will be provided in 18 weekly intervention sessions, during which parents will learn how to stimulate their children's social imitation, social engagement, language and play skills. First, parents are taught techniques that promote interaction with the child (one technique per session, through demonstration and coaching). In the second half of the intervention, parents are taught direct teaching techniques, e.g., to promote language or play, again by means of demonstration and coaching. After completion of the program, families will receive guidance every 2-3 weeks for an additional 12 weeks, during which the support will generally not focus on social-communicative abilities, although ImPACT follow-up sessions might be given if necessary.</description>
