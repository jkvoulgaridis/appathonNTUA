  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion trial is designed to evaluate the
      safety and preliminary efficacy of inhaled DV281 in combination with nivolumabfor the
      treatment of NSCLC and to select a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

  <detailed_description>

      Pre-clinical studies support the proposed dosing schema to be tested and a potential benefit
      of the combination of inhaled DV281 with nivolumab for subjects with advanced NSCLC. This
      study (DV9-NSC-01) is designed for establishing an immunologically optimal RP2D for inhaled
      DV281 in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor. This trial, studying the potential
      to enhance the efficacy of an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor in subjects with advanced NSCLC,
      addresses an unmet need for NSCLC patients having tumors that do not respond or do not
      respond adequately to anti-PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy.
