  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of the Neuro RX Gamma synchronous and asynchronous devices on
      the cognitive and behavioral functioning of subjects with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's
      Disease. The Neuro RX Gamma is non-invasive and delivers near-infrared energy to the brain in
      daily treatment sessions at home. An optional substudy will involve the use of the
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess the effect of the treatment devices on the electrical
      activity of the brain compared to sham.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neuro RX Gamma system is a headset which emits pulsed near-infrared energy synchronously
      or asynchronously through diodes placed on the scalp and inside a nostril.

      A potential participant will undergo screening procedures to confirm eligibility to
      participate in the study, followed by randomization procedure to one of the study groups -
      treatment synchronized, treatment asynchronized or sham (placebo). A dedicated caregiver will
      apply the device to the subject for 20 minute daily sessions at home, 6 days a week for a
      total of 12 weeks. The subject and caregiver will be required to return to the clinic for
      follow-up assessments after 3, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Participants will have the choice
      of opting into a substudy involving the collection of rest EEG recordings during the baseline
      and weeks 3, 6 and 12 visits.

      60 patients will be enrolled in 2 clinical sites in Ontario, Canada.
