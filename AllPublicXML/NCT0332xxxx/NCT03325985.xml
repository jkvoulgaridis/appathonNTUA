  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, multi-site randomized controlled trial of 1,350 older adults (50+ years)
      with either advanced cancer (defined as metastatic solid tumor) or end-stage organ failure
      (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV Heart Failure, End Stage Renal Disease
      defined as GFR &lt; 15 ml/min/m2; or Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
      (GOLD) Stage III or higher or oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      defined as FEV1 &lt; 50% or the mMRC dyspnea scale) who present to the Emergency Department
      (ED), along with 675 of their informal caregivers. Investigators will compare the
      effectiveness of two distinct palliative care models: a) nurse-led telephonic case
      management; and b) facilitated, outpatient specialty palliative care.
