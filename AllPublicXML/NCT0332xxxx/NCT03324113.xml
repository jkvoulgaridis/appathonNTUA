      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate tolerability and safety of SAR408701 when administered as a single agent
           according to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) related dose limiting
           toxicities (DLTs) to determine the recommended dose (RD) of SAR408701 in Japanese
           patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the overall safety profile of SAR408701 monotherapy.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR408701 and its metabolites.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PDy) effect of SAR408701 on levels of circulating
           carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) for main dose
           escalation part.

        -  To assess preliminary efficacy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor
           (RECIST) 1.1 criteria and other indicators of antitumor activity.

        -  To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR408701.

      The study duration per participant will include a period to assess eligibility (screening
      period) of up to approximately 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period and an End-of-Treatment
      (EOT) visit around 30 days after the last administration of IMP, and at least one follow-up
      (FU) visit after the EOT visit.

          -  Prior maytansinoid treatments (maytansinoid derivative 1 [DM1] or maytansinoid

             reduction cannot be considered.

          -  Medical conditions requiring concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitor,
             unless it can be discontinued at least 2 weeks before first administration of
