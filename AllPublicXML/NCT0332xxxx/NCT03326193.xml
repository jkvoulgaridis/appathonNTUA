  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niraparib is an oral inhibitor of poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 and
      PARP-2. This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of niraparib combined with bevacizumab
      as maintenance treatment in participants with advanced (stage IIIB-IV) ovarian cancer,
      fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer following front-line platinum-based
      chemotherapy with bevacizumab. Eligible participants who achieve complete response (CR),
      partial response (PR), or no evidence of disease (NED) following treatment with
      platinum-based chemotherapy in addition to bevacizumab will be enrolled in the study and will
      receive maintenance treatment with niraparib (for up to 3 years) combined with bevacizumab
      (for up to 10 months during the maintenance phase or up to a total of 15 months inclusive of
      the approximately 5 months of bevacizumab received with chemotherapy) or until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant withdrawal, Investigator's decision, or
      death, whichever comes first. Participants who have not progressed after 3 years of niraparib
      maintenance treatment may continue with niraparib beyond 3 years if they are benefiting from
      treatment, upon consultation with Sponsor.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI) - Patient Reported Outcome (PRO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and upto 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The FOSI is a validated 8-item measure of symptom response to treatment for ovarian cancer. Participants respond to their symptom experience over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale scored from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;very much&quot; (4). The average score will be calculated as an average of the 8 items. The total symptom index is calculated as the total of the 8 symptoms. PROs will be collected every 6 weeks (± 7 days) for 6 months, then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter while the participant is receiving study treatment. Once a participant discontinues treatment, PRO evaluations will be performed 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation, regardless of subsequent treatment.</description>

             must demonstrate &lt; 2 gram (g) of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).

          -  Participant has any known history or current diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome

             cancer less than 5 years prior to study enrollment. Participants with cervical
             carcinoma in situ, non melanomatous skin cancer, and ductal carcinoma in situ
             definitively treated are allowed.

          -  Participant has a QT interval prolongation &gt; 480 milliseconds (ms) at screening. If a
             participant has a prolonged QT interval and the prolongation is deemed to be due to a
             pacemaker upon Investigator evaluation (ie, the participant otherwise has no cardiac
             abnormalities), then the participant may be eligible to participate in the study
             following discussion with the Medical Monitor.

             receiving study drug or for 180 days after the last dose of study drug ; additionally,
             female participant should not breastfeed during treatment with niraparib and for 30
             days after receipt of the last dose due to the potential for serious adverse reactions
             from niraparib in breastfed infants
