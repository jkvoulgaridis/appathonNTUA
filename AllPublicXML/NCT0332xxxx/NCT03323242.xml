    <textblock>
      The surgical technique used in liver transplantation has undergone constant Evolution in an
      effort towards towards a safe, highly standardized procedure. Despite this, the initial step
      of the recipients' hepatectomy has not been in the focus of clinical research thus far. Due
      to usually advanced coagulopathy in liver transplantation recipients, this part of the
      operation still bares the risk of severe hemorrhage. This trial is designed to compare an
      electrothermic, bipolar vessel sealing device (LigaSureTM) and an ultrasound dissector
      (HARMONIC ACE®+7) to standard surgical techniques during the recipients' hepatectomy in liver
      transplantation. In a single center, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel three
      armed, confirmatory, open trial, LigaSureTM and HARMONIC ACE®+7 will be compared to standard
      surgical techniques which, utilize titanium clips and conventional knot tying ligations
      during the recipients' hepatectomy in liver transplantation. Intraoperative total blood loss
      is the primary endpoint of the trial. Secondary endpoints include blood loss during the
      hepatectomy, the duration of both the hepatectomy and the entire surgical procedure, as well
      as blood transfusion requirements of the procedure. To generate reliable data, intraoperative
      blood loss will be recorded with respect to all rinse fluids during surgery, ascites and by
      weighing used swabs to generate reliable data. At 80% power and an alpha of 0.025 for both
      either of the experimental groups, twenty-three subjects will be analysed per protocol in
      each study arm in order to detect a clinically relevant reduction of intraoperative blood
      loss. The intention to treat analysis will include sixty-nine patients. The follow up period
      for each patient will be 90 days for safety reasons, whereas all clinical outcomes will be
      measured within the first ten postoperative days. This is the first prospective, randomized
      trial comparing two innovative, technical methods of vessel sealing and dissection against
      standard techniques for recipient hepatectomy. This will be done to detect a relevant
      reduction of intraoperative blood loss during liver transplantation.The results of the trial
      are expected to improve patients' outcome and safety after liver transplantation and to
      increase the general safety of this procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is a well-established procedure for the treatment of end stage
      liver disease. Many improvements in the surgical technique rendered this operation relatively
      safe. Most important operative innovations after the initial introduction of LT in the
      clinical Routine undertaken by Starzl include the use of veno-venous bypass in LT, the
      piggy-back technique with preservation of the recipients' caval vein and it's modification
      which was introduced by Belghiti with side-to-side cavo-caval anastomosis. Nevertheless very
      few improvements have been introduced in the surgical technique with regards to tissue
      preparation and sealing the blood vessels during recipient hepatectomy. Due to end stage
      liver disease and both the recipients' general and coagulatory condition, the hepatectomy
      carries the risk of severe blood loss which can impair the outcome after LT. Usually the
      recipient hepatectomy is carried out as a combination of sharp dissection of the hepatic
      adhesions to the abdominal wall and the diaphragm and clip or suture ligature of small
      retrohepatic caval vein branches.

      With advances in surgical procedures and equipment, modern technologies have been introduced,
      which have shortened operation time and improved surgical outcomes. Exquisite equipment for
      liver parenchyma transection, such as Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator, ultrasonic
      dissector (USD), LigaSure (LS) and Tissue Link can also be used to reduce hemorrhage in liver
      resection. The ultrasonic scalpel (Ethicon) is a new USD that cuts and coagulates tissue
      using ultrasound at frequencies higher than those used by an ultrasonic aspirator. This
      device can also serve as a grasper and basically utilizes a blade which oscillates at 55 kHz,
      thus producing heat and enabling coagulation of vessels. Recently, its use and potential
      advantages in open liver resection have been demonstrated. The main technical advancement in
      this field relates to decreased intra-operative bleeding. Results of using USD (Harmonic
      Scalpel) during recipient hepatectomy showed that this method is safe compared with
      conventional knot tying ligation regarding intra- and postoperative bleeding rate. The
      electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing device LS is another alternative, which applies
      electrothermal bipolar coagulation and dissection in one step. The LS dissection device seals
      the tissue first before it is divided (both Tasks are performed with the same device). This
      may prevent severe bleeding. Furthermore, the sealing device is capable of coping with the
      small liver veins which can be sealed and divided safely without the need for sutures or
      clips. Especially the latter of which is known for interfering with sufficient &quot;tangential&quot;
      clamping of the inferior caval vein (IVC) for side to side cavo-cavostomy during piggy-back
      LT. It was reported that the use of LS devices for recipient hepatectomy in LT. It was
      concluded that, LS vessel sealing was an efficient method and that vessel sealing of the
      caval and Portal veins as well as other structures could be safely performed in the setting
      of end-stage liver disease.

      To our knowledge, no randomized clinical trial has been conducted to compare various
      innovative dissection methods against the standard techniques used for recipient hepatectomy.
      While LS and USD have been proven to be used safely in several major surgical procedures,
      including liver resection, their ability to reduce blood loss in liver transplant recipient
      hepatectomy has not yet been evaluated systematically.

    <masking_description>Blinding the surgical staff is impossible due to the use of different methods in the three groups under investigation. Since the primary endpoint &quot;total blood loss&quot; will be precisely recorded during surgery by independent staff and secondary endpoints are objective physiological findings, blinding the subjects is not needed. Therefore, the open design is not expected to cause any avoidable bias.</masking_description>

    <description>The suction container fluid volume (in 20 milliliters) will be added to the weight (in grams) of all surgical swabs at the end of skin closure procedures (A). The difference of the density of the rinse solution (isotonic Sodium Chloride solution) and blood is approximately 0.055 g/cm³. Regarding the accuracy of these measurements, this difference is clinically irrelevant.
The volume of the entire rinse fluid (in milliliters) that is used during the procedure and the amount of ascites (in milliliters) will be added to the known dry weight (in grams) of the respective number of surgical swabs that are used during the procedure and the known dry weight of the drip catching swab container (B).
The total blood loss is defined as &quot;A&quot; minus &quot;B&quot; in milliliters.</description>
