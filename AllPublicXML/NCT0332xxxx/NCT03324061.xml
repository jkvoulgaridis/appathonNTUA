      Clinical study designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of
      Fulvestrant for Injectable Suspension after a single IM dose of Fulvestrant for Injectable
      Suspension compared to the reference product, Faslodex in healthy female subjects.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel group study in healthy female subjects. The study is
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of
      Fulvestrant for Injectable Suspension vs. the reference drug, Faslodex, administered in the
      gluteal muscle.
