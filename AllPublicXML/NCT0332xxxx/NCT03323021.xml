  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After partial nephrectomy, kidney function decreases by about 10% overall and by about 20% in
      the operated kidney. This is primarily due to the loss of healthy parenchymal volume during
      resection of the tumor. In an effort to preserve and regenerate healthy parenchyma during the
      procedure and ultimately renal function after partial nephrectomy, the single center double
      arm single-blinded randomized screening clinical trial will evaluate the ability of human
      amnion/chorion allograft to facilitate the recovery of renal function following robotic
      partial nephrectomy.
