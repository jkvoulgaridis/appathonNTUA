      The objective of the study is to enable access to sibling or autologous umbilical cord blood
      (UCB) infusions for children with various brain disorders.

      The use of UCB in this fashion is based on safety and efficacy data from prior and ongoing
      clinical trials at Duke University Medical Center in over 700 patients with these diagnoses
      infused with autologous or sibling UCB over the past decade.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to enable access to sibling or autologous umbilical
      cord blood for children with various brain disorders. Children with cerebral palsy,
      hydrocephalus, hypoxic brain injury, stroke, apraxia, autism and other brain injuries will be
      eligible if they do not qualify for or are unable to participate in another active clinical
      trial at Duke. Children with qualifying partially or fully matched sibling or autologous cord
      blood units will be eligible. The family will be enrolled on the screening protocol, &quot;A
      Research Database and Screening Protocol for Children with Brain Injuries Potentially
      Undergoing Cellular Therapy or Other Clinical Trials,&quot; Pro00063563. Information may be
      obtained under this protocol including but not limited to: diagnostic information, genetic
      testing, videos and pictures of the child, cord blood report, etc. The PI or her designee
      will review this information to determine if the child might be eligible for a cord blood
      infusion(s) on this expanded access protocol.

      If eligible, the child must come to Duke with a parent or legal guardian for clinical
      evaluations and infusion of the umbilical cord blood unit. Parents will be required to
      participate in remote follow-up phone calls and be willing to complete questionnaires for
      safety follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a qualifying sibling or autologous cord blood unit

          2. Be &lt; 26 years of age at the time of consent.

             parent/legal guardian as applicable).

          4. Have baseline blood counts and basic chemistries within normal for age.

          5. Have a normal absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) for age on baseline blood count and
             differential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented HIV or Hepatitis or other disease transmittable through the blood.

          2. A cord blood unit that fails to meet specifications

          3. Refusal of consent

          4. Uncontrolled seizure disorder

          8. History of treatment with chemo or immunosuppressive therapy

          9. History of previous allogeneic cell therapy. If previously enrolled on another Duke
             cell therapy protocol the subject can still be considered for enrollment on this study
