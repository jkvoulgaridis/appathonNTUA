  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that participants with HPV positive and hypoxia
      negative T1-2, N1-2c (AJCC, 7th ed.) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma receiving a major
      de-escalated radiation therapy with 2 cycles of standard chemotherapy is not inferior to
      comparable subjects treated with the current standard chemoradiation.

      Given the restrictions of surgery during the COVID19 pandemic, we will start enrolling
      patients on Cohort B where surgery is not required. Once the COVI19 pandemic is over, we will
      resume and complete enrollment on Cohort A where surgery is required, prior to continuing
      enrolling patients on Cohort B.

      During the COVID-19 pandemic, the research MRIs are optional.

Cycle 2 (Week 4): After the three weeks of radiation at week 4 when the subject no longer is receiving radiation therapy, subjects will receive cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously.
