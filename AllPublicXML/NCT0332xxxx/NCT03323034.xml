      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pevonedistat when given together
      with irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide in treating patients with solid tumors,
      central nervous system (CNS) tumors, or lymphoma that have come back after a period of
      improvement (recurrent) or that do not respond to treatment (refractory). Pevonedistat and
      irinotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pevonedistat, irinotecan hydrochloride,
      and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with solid tumors, central nervous
      system (CNS) tumors, or lymphoma compared to irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      pevonedistat administered as an intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 10, and 12 of a 28-day
      cycle (cycle 1), and on days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21-day cycle (cycle 2 and beyond) in
      combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) (administered as an intravenous
      infusion on days 8-12 of cycle 1 and days 1-5 of cycles 2+) and temozolomide (administered
      orally on days 8-12 in cycle 1 and days 1-5 of cycles 2+) in children with recurrent or
      refractory solid tumors, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors and lymphoma.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of pevonedistat administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of pevonedistat in children with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of pevonedistat within the confines of a
      phase 1 study.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of pevonedistat.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of pevonedistat.

      Patients receive pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 10, and 12,
      temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 8-12, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes
      on days 8-12 of cycle 1. Beginning cycle 2, patients receive pevonedistat IV over 60 minutes
      on days 1, 3, and 5, temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over
      90 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for cycle 1 and 21 days for
      subsequent cycles for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
