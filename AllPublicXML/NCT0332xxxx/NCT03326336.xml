    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of
      a gene therapy called GS030-DP (injected study treatment) administered via a single
      intravitreal injection and repeated light stimulation using a medical device called GS030-MD
      (stimulating glasses) in subjects with documented diagnosis of non-syndromic Retinitis
      Pigmentosa

    <description>Assessment of the treatment effect on quality of life changes from baseline to Week 52 with the Short Form Survey 36 Version 2 (SF-36v2). The SF-36v2 is a subject-rated 36-item questionnaire assessing subject health. There are 8 scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0 to 100 scale. A lower score indicates more disability, and a higher score indicates less disability (a score of 0 is equivalent to maximum disability, and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability).</description>
