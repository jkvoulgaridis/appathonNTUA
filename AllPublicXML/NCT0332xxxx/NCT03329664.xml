  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of activated and expanded autologous
      cytokine-killer cells in controlling disease recurrence in colon cancer patients with liver
      metastasis. 20 patients with confirmed colon carcinoma who have had complete resection of
      primary lesions will be assigned into two groups. Patients in both groups will receive the
      same therapeutic regimen as usual. Patients in one group additionally will be treated with
      several infusions of autologous killer cells that had been previously prepared from
      peripheral blood.
