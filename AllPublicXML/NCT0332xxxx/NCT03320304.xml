  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess short, mid and long-term clinical outcomes
      in patients with difficult to treat depression (such as patients with treatment resistant
      depression) treated with Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) Therapy as adjunctive therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population under study comprises a real-world patient population with difficult to treat
      depression: patients diagnosed with unipolar or bipolar disorder with chronic or recurrent
      depression who fail to achieve an adequate response to standard psychiatric management.

      The diagnosis of depression and comorbid disorders will be determined based on the Mini
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

      A minimum of five hundred (500) patients will be implanted with a VNS Therapy System and up
      to eighty (80) sites may participate in this study.

      Enrollment will take maximum 5 years, based on competitive enrollment. For each subject a
      baseline visit will occur between 1 and 6 weeks before implant.

      Once implanted with the device, subjects will be followed-up for a minimum of 36 months and a
      maximum of 60 months.The study may stop when the last subject has reached the 36 months
      follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint of this study is response defined as reduction in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of at least 50% from baseline to 12 months post implant.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is a 10-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression.
A 'Responder' is a subject that achieved ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score at the M12 assessment. A 'Non-Responder' is any patient who did not achieve ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS score at the M12 assessment.
No formal hypothesis testing is presented; all the proposed statistical tests are descriptive in nature.
The Primary endpoint analysis as defined above will be done only on patients that are enrolled while in a major depressive episode (MDE); the cut off point for current MDE at time of implant will be a MADRS score of 20.
For the patients with a MADRS score below 20 at time of enrollment, only the continuous change in MADRS can be described (as the MADRS can only worsen or stay the same).</description>

    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) is a 16-item, subject-completed questionnaire of the symptoms of mood and depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 27. A higher QIDS-SR score indicates a more severe depression.</description>

The Altman Self-rating Mania Scale (ASRM) is a 5-item self-reported diagnostic scale which can be used to assess the presence and severity manic and hypomanic symptoms, most commonly in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The total score ranges from 0 to 20. A score of 6 or higher indicates a high probability of a manic or hypomanic condition.</description>

             drug, maintenance electroconvulsive therapy, or formal psychotherapy including
             supportive psychotherapy) or mood stabilizing treatment for bipolar patients (such as
             lithium, anticonvulsants, or atypical antipsychotics).

          -  Able and willing to comply with the frequency of (outpatient) clinic visits and to
             reliably complete all the evaluations as specified in the study protocol.Hence based
             on the nature of their disease, the following patients should not be included:

             judgment which, in the investigator's opinion, would significantly interfere with
             subject's participation in the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        There are no exclusion criteria; the investigator should refer to the (local applicable)
