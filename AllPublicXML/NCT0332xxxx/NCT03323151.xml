    <textblock>
      Patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that has relapsed (come back) or refractory
      (progressed on treatment) will receive ixazomib and ibrutinib.

      Ibrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment for
      patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy.

      Ixazomib is in a class of medications called proteasome inhibitors. Cancer cells depend on
      proteasome to provide this protein metabolism (turnover) function to regulate their growth
      and survival. Ixazomib disrupts a cancer cells' ability to survive by blocking the proteasome
      and disrupting protein metabolism. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may
      cause cancer cells to die.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether the addition of ixazomib to ibrutinib
      chemotherapy is effective in treating people who have relapsed or refractory MCL and to
      examine the side effects associated with ixazomib in combination with ibrutinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MCL is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is considered incurable with conventional
      therapy. For relapsed patients, Ibrutinib, lenalidomide, and bortezomib are all approved by
      the FDA but are not curative. Novel approaches are required to improve outcomes for patients
      with relapsed/refractory MCL.

      This is an open-label study that will be done in 2 phases. Phase I will test different doses
      of ixazomib and ibrutinib to determine the maximum safe and tolerated dose. In Phase I,
      patients who have already received ibrutinib, may participate if they meet certain criteria
      (i.e., have not received ibrutinib for at least 3 months).

      Phase I was completed November 25, 2019. Dose Level 2 (Ixazomib 4 mg and Ibrutinib 560 mg) is
      the recommended Phase II dose.

      Phase II will find out the effects, good and/or bad, of ixazomib in combination with
      ibrutinib. In Phase II, patients will be separated into 2 groups, patients who have never
      received a Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor and patients who have received a BTK
      inhibitor. This study is designed to examine the effectiveness of this drug in treating
      patients with MCL.

      Patients will be treated until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 3 months for the first year of
      treatment, then every 6 months until progression.

      Mandatory bone marrow and tumor tissue samples (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or
      biopsy) are required at baseline. Mandatory research blood samples will also be collected.

             current or prior tissue sample that is IHC positive for cyclin D 1 or that is positive
             by FISH or cytogenetics for t(11;14).

          -  Must have been refractory to and/or relapsed/progressed after at least 1 prior
             therapy.

          -  Prior autologous or allogeneic transplant are allowed. Patients may not have active
             grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or moderate/severe chronic GVHD by
             NIH criteria and may not require immunosuppressive medications and/or corticosteroids
             for the management of acute or chronic GVHD.

          -  Phase I: Prior proteasome inhibitor and/or Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors
             are allowed but patients may not have been exposed to the combination of proteasome
             inhibitor and BTK inhibitor. Patients who have progressed on ibrutinib that are felt
             to be at high risk for rapid progression on this study shall not be eligible for the
             phase I portion of the study. NOTE: Ibrutinib pre-treated patients must meet all
             eligibility criteria AND must have discontinued prior ibrutinib at least 3 months
             prior to starting study therapy. PHASE I COMPLETED NOVEMBER 25, 2019.

          -  Phase II: Prior proteasome inhibitor and/or Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors are
             allowed but patients may not have been exposed to the combination of proteasome
             inhibitor and BTK inhibitor. NOTE: Patients in the BTK-pretreated cohort must have
             tolerated prior ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitor (i.e., not discontinued therapy due
             to a toxicity that is still ongoing). Patients who discontinued a BTK inhibitor due to
             toxicity that has been treated and resolved and for which it is considered appropriate
             to re-challenge the patient with ibrutinib may be enrolled if the investigator
             provides documentation explaining why they feel re-challenging with ibrutinib is
             clinically appropriate. Such patients would only be enrolled after approval of the
             PrECOG Medical Monitor &amp; Study Chair.

          -  Patients must not have received systemic treatment for MCL for at least 14 days prior
             to enrollment, except for steroids which may be used to manage acute symptoms related
             to disease up to 48 hours prior to starting study therapy. Radiation therapy must be
             concluded at least 14 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding since we do not know the effects of
             ixazomib and ibrutinib on the fetus or breastfeeding child. All sexually active
             females of childbearing potential must have a blood test to rule out pregnancy within
             2 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Sexually active women of child-bearing potential with a non-sterilized male partner
             and sexually active men must agree to use 2 methods of adequate contraception
             (hormonal plus barrier or 2 barrier forms) OR abstinence prior to study entry, for the
             duration of study participation, and for 3 months following last dose of study drugs.

          -  Patients must have resolved all prior non-hematologic toxicities assessed as related
             to prior therapy to ≤ grade 1.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease (i.e., ≥ 1.5 cm in largest diameter) by

             have had no evidence of active CNS disease for at least 6 months).

          -  Patients may not have another malignancy that could interfere with the evaluation of
             safety or efficacy of this combination. Patients with a prior malignancy will be
             allowed without study chair approval in the following circumstances:

               -  Not currently active and diagnosed at least 3 years prior to the date of
                  enrollment.

               -  Localized disease in which chemotherapy would not be indicated (such as Stage I
                  colon, lung, prostate or breast cancer). Patients with other malignancies not
                  meeting these criteria must be discussed with PrECOG prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients requiring long-term anticoagulation must be managed on an anticoagulant
             besides warfarin. Patients who require warfarin are not eligible.

          -  Patients with a clinically significant bleeding episode as judged by the investigator
             within 3 months of registration are not eligible, except patients who suffer bleeding
             due to trauma.

          -  Patients may not have had major surgery within 14 days, or minor surgery within 3

          -  Patients may not have any active infection requiring oral or intravenous antimicrobial
             therapy at the time of therapy initiation. Patients with a recent self-limited
             infection that has clinically resolved may complete a prescribed course of
             antimicrobial therapy after study initiation as long as they are asymptomatic with no
             clinical evidence of infection for at least 7 days prior to treatment. Patients with a
             recent serious (grade ≥ 3) infection requiring hospitalization must have completed all
             antimicrobial therapy within 14 days of therapy initiation.

             heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or higher, unstable angina,
             or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Patients with a history of any
             significant cardiovascular disease that has been controlled for at least 14 days
             before registration are allowed (except for patients who have had a myocardial
             infarction within 6 months).

          -  No systemic treatment, within 14 days before the first dose of ibrutinib with moderate
             or strong inhibitors of CYP3A (Strong Inhibitors: ketoconazole, itraconazole,

             or C are not eligible.

          -  Patients with any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the
             investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of the treatment
             according to the protocol are not eligible.

          -  Patients with a known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or
             excipients in the various formulations of any agent are not eligible.
