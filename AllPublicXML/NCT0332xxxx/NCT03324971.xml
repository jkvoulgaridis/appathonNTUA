  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polypharmacy is an alarming health issue that is defined as prescription of multiple
      medications, of which some are redundant or unnecessary. Due to comorbidities, diabetic
      patients are often prescribed multiple medications. Over prescribing occurs either due to,
      prescribing medications that are not indicated, continuation of certain medications beyond
      the time of indication, or prescribing more than one medication with the same effect.
      Improving glycaemic control is the cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of the
      diabetic complications.

      Hypothesis In addition to the side effects and cost of the unnecessary medications, the
      investigators hypothesis is that poly-pharmacy will adversely affect patients' compliance
      with the necessary medications.The investigators propose that elimination of unnecessary
      medications might improve patients' compliance and consequently improve glycemic control
      diabetic patients.
