  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of daily subcutaneous injections of elamipretide in
      subjects with primary mitochondrial myopathy. This will be followed by an open-label
      treatment extension.

          -  Agrees to adhere to the trial requirements for the length of the trial, including the
             use of the elamipretide delivery system

          -  Subject is ≥ 16 and ≤ 80 years of age

          -  Diagnosed with PMM in the opinion of the investigator and confirmed by an Adjudication
             Committee

          -  Woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of birth
             control

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has myopathic signs and or/symptoms due to a neuropathic process or gait
             problem that would interfere with the 6MWT, in the opinion of the Investigator

          -  Female who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding/lactating

          -  At Screening, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2

          -  Subject has undergone an in-patient hospitalization within the 30 days prior to the
             Baseline Visit or has a planned hospitalization or a surgical procedure during the
             trial.

          -  Subject has clinically significant cardiac disease or prior interventional procedure
             and/or respiratory disease (medical history or current clinical findings) within 3
             months of the Baseline Visit, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Subject has QTc elongation (using the correction factor utilized at the clinical site)
             defined as a QTc &gt;450 msec in male subjects and &gt;480 msec in female subjects.

          -  ECG evidence of acute ischemia, atrial fibrillation, or active conduction system
             abnormalities with the exception of any of the following:

               1. First degree AV-block

               3. Right bundle branch block

          -  Subject has severe vision impairment that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             interfere with their ability to complete all trial requirements

             &lt; 2 years.

             clinical trial (except for SPIMM-300) at the Baseline Visit which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, may be potentially confounding with results of the current trial
             (e.g., exercise therapy trial).

          -  Subject has previously received elamipretide (MTP-131), for any reason.

          -  Subject has a history of active substance abuse during the year before the Baseline
             Visit, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Subject has any prior or current medical condition that, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would prevent the subject from safely participating in and/or completing

          -  Subjects must continue to be able and willing to adhere to the trial requirements.

             in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Subject has not had a serious adverse event (SAE)/serious adverse device effect (SADE)
             attributed to the elamipretide delivery system.

          -  Subject has not permanently discontinued the elamipretide delivery system.
