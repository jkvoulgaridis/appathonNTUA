    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pepinemab and to see how well
      it works in treating younger patients with solid tumors that have come back after treatment,
      or do not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pepinemab,
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of pepinemab
      (VX15/2503) administered as an intravenous infusion every 14 days to children with recurrent
      or refractory solid tumors. (Part A) II. To define and describe the toxicities of VX15/2503
      administered on this schedule. (Parts A-B) III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      VX15/2503 in children with recurrent or refractory cancer. (Parts A-B) IV. To preliminarily
      define the antitumor activity of VX15/2503 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory
      osteosarcoma. (Part B) V. To determine if VX15/2503 either improves the disease control rate
      at 4 months in patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma or produces an objective
      response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. (Part B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamics of VX15/2503 through VX15/2503 saturation of T-lymphocytes.

      II. To assess the immunogenicity of VX15/2503 in pediatric patients with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers of VX15/2503 sensitivity including SEMA4D, PlexinB1, and
      other markers of immune cell infiltration in archival tumor tissues.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive pepinemab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
