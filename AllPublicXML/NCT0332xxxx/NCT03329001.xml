  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two stage, open label, randomized-sequence, single-crossover Phase 1 study to
      evaluate the relative bioavailability (BA) and Bioequivalence (BE) of niraparib administered
      as a tablet formulation compared to the reference capsule formulation currently marketed in
      the United States. Specifically, a 300 mg niraparib tablet will be compared to 3 niraparib
      capsules (3 × 100 mg).The Extension Phase of this study is to enable patients enrolled in the
      study to continue to receive treatment with niraparib tablets if they are tolerating it and,
      in the Investigator's opinion, may receive benefit.
