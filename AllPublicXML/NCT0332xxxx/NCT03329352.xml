  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is designed to evaluate the comfort, ease of use and performance of a trial
      nasal mask for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in the home environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded study. Up to 45 OSA
      participants who currently use a full-face mask will be recruited.

      The study will involve a baseline (Visit 1) data gathering with the participant's PAP therapy
      and their usual mask. This will be followed by the participants being fitted with the trial
      full-face mask by a sleep technician for use in-home (Visit 2). The participant then will
      come in to return the mask (Visit 3) and give feedback on their experience using the mask in
      home in the form of a structured interview during Visit 3. If the participants prefer the
      trial full-face mask they will be asked if they would like to continue using the trial mask
      for a further six months in home. There will be a follow up phone call gain feedback or
      address any issues at months 2 and 4 of the six month extension period. At the end of the six
      month extension period, the participants will return the trial full-face mask to NTLSC and
      answer a few questions around their feedback on the mask after using it for six months.

      The mask and CPAP (if used from the loan research pool) will be returned to the institution
      at the conclusion of the trial and participant will return to their usual mask and therapy
      device for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

      Neither the investigators nor the participants will be blinded to the study.
