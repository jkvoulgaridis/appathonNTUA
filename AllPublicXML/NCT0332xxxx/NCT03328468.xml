  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the breathing intervention, participants completed two experimental sessions at least two
      weeks apart. The experimental sessions were randomized between the slow-breathing condition
      (6 breaths/min) or the control breathing condition (12 breaths/min). Breathing interventions
      were 15 minutes in length and completed with the assistance of the breathing app, Breathe
      Deep (Mineev, Bizi Apps LLC).

      The breathing intervention is currently completed.

      The reliability and validity study of AFAS is ongoing. This is a one-time visit for
      participants in which participants will undergo screening of sensation and movement as well
      as fill in some questionnaires.

      All participants had two visits for the breathing exercise. The only planned intervention was
      the breathing exercise, which is now concluded.

      The protocol for the breathing intervention was as follows: The breathing protocol lasted 15
      minutes. It was a guided breathing awareness session with a registered nurse (PhD student)
      who is also trained in integrative therapies and yoga instruction.

      In parallel, during one of the visits the reliability and validity of a new scale for stroke
      to measure quality of movement and body awareness is tested.

      This part is still ongoing and thus this becomes a one-time visit.
