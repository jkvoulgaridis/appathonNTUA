  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence is common in men following prostate cancer surgery.
      Rehabilitative interventions incorporate pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback,
      electrical stimulation, lifestyle changes, or a combination of these strategies. However,
      little is known about the physiological impact of whole-body vibration for stress urinary
      incontinence following radical prostatectomy. Participants: Sixty-one patients with mild
      Stress urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.

      Intervention: patients were randomly assigned into two groups: group 1 included 30 patients
      who received pelvic floor muscle training and whole-body vibration training with a frequency
      and amplitude of 20 Hz/ 2 mm for the first 2 sessions and 40 Hz/ 4 mm for the rest of
      intervention; while group 2 included 31 patients who performed only pelvic floor muscle
      training. The intervention in both groups was performed three times per week for 4 weeks.

      Participants were recruited from Cairo University Hospitals who suffered from mild SUI for at
      least 6 months after RP. The diagnosis was confirmed by the referred physician via 24-h pad
      test which supposed to be less than 100 grams gain of weight of the pad/s worn by the
      patient.

      The exclusion criteria were artificial pacemaker, body mass index (BMI)&gt; 35 kg/m2, urinary
      infection, bleeding from the urinary bladder or the digestive tract, polyuria, diabetes
      mellitus, detrusor over-activity, neuromuscular disorder, ear problems or any other medical
      condition that would affect participation in the training program. Main outcomes:
      Incontinence Visual Analogue Scale (I-VAS), the International Consultation on Incontinence
      Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) and 24-hour pad test.

    <masking_description>The study group included 30 patients participated in pelvic floor muscle training and whole-body vibrations, 3 times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks; the frequency and peak-to-peak displacement of vibration were 2 mm/20 Hz for the first week for 5 minutes, 3mm/25 Hz, 10 minutes for the second week and 4 mm/30 Hz, 15 minutes for the last two weeks. The control group included 31 patients received only pelvic floor training only. Pelvic floor exercises: Each patient was prepared and taught a program of pelvic floor exercises to be performed in daily sessions in lying, sitting, and standing positions consisting of 10 seconds of contractions followed by 10 seconds of relaxation and repeating the exercises 15 times each session.</masking_description>

    <measure>Incontinence Visual Analogue Scale (I-VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the I-VAS, patients were asked to depict their subjective burden of incontinence on a 100-mm VAS. The question above the VAS line was: 'How annoyed are you by incontinence currently?' The 100-mmVAS scale scores ranged from 0 ('not irritated') to 10 ('extremely disturbed'). A 100-mm line labelled from 0 to 10 was used, with patients asked to mark their answer on the line. The I-VAS is a valid, reproducible and responsive tool for UI treatment and improving the quality of life of patients after urogynaecologic surgery</description>
