  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and paroxetine IR tablets have
      been approved for the treatment of three anxiety indications in China. This bioequivalence
      study will evaluate Paroxetine IR tablets manufactured in GSKT (A) and Mississauga (B) sites
      in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting and fed conditions to support the quality
      consistency evaluation. This is a single dose, open-label, randomized, two-period crossover
      study and will include a screening period (up to 7 days), two open-label treatment periods
      (up to 16 days) and a follow-up phase (up to 14 days after last-dose). The whole study will
      be divided into two groups, one for fasting condition enrolling approximately 36 subjects and
      another for fed condition for which approximately 44 subjects will be enrolled. In both
      groups, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive single dose of Paroxetine IR tablets
      A or B in a cross-over manner.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day-7 to Day -1) and Day 16</time_frame>
    <description>Urine samples were collected to assess urine occult blood, urine glucose, urine ketones, urine protein and monitor urine potential of hydrogen (pH). The dipstick test gave results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters (except urine pH) were recorded as negative and positive, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. pH is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration and is used to determine the acidity or alkalinity of urine. Urine pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH of greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0). Dipstick test results for pH were presented as number of participants having pH value as 5, 6, 6.5, 7 or 8. Data has been presented treatment-wise.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Chemistry Laboratory Values Relative to Potential Clinical Importance (PCI) Criteria on Day 16 Under Fed Condition</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the clinical chemistry laboratory parameters; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),calcium,creatinine, glucose, potassium (Pot) and sodium. PCI ranges were ALT (high: &gt;=2 times upper limit of normal [ULN] units per liter [U/L]),albumin (low: &lt;30 grams per liter),ALP (low: &lt;20 international units per liter [IU/L] and high: &gt;200 IU/L), AST (high: &gt;=2 times ULN U/L),calcium (low: &lt;2 millimoles per liter [mmol/L] and high: &gt;2.75 mmol/L),creatinine (high: &gt;133 micromoles per liter), glucose (low: &lt;3 mmol/L and high: &gt;9 mmol/L), Pot (low: &lt;3 mmol/L and high: &gt;5.5 mmol/L) and sodium (low: &lt;130 mmol/L and high: &gt;150 mmol/L). Participants were counted in the category that their value changed to (low, normal or high). If values were unchanged (example: High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Data has been presented treatment-wise.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Chemistry Laboratory Values Relative to PCI Criteria on Day 16 Under Fasting Condition</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the clinical chemistry laboratory parameters; ALT, albumin, ALP, AST, calcium, creatinine, glucose, Pot and sodium. PCI ranges were ALT (high: &gt;=2 times ULN U/L), albumin (low: &lt;30 grams per liter), ALP (low: &lt;20 IU/L and high: &gt;200 IU/L), AST (high: &gt;=2 times ULN U/L), calcium (low: &lt;2 mmol/L and high: &gt;2.75 mmol/L), creatinine (high: &gt;133 micromoles per liter), glucose (low: &lt;3 mmol/L and high: &gt;9 mmol/L), Pot (low: &lt;3 mmol/L and high: &gt;5.5 mmol/L) and sodium (low: &lt;130 mmol/L and high: &gt;150 mmol/L). Participants were counted in the category that their value changed to (low, normal or high). If values were unchanged (example: High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Data has been presented treatment-wise.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Urinalysis Results by Dipstick Method Under Fed Condition</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess urine occult blood, urine glucose, urine ketones, urine protein and monitor urine potential of hydrogen (pH). The dipstick test gave results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters (except urine pH) were recorded as negative and positive, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. pH is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration and is used to determine the acidity or alkalinity of urine. Urine pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH of greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0). Dipstick test results for pH were presented as number of participants having pH value as 5, 6, 6.5, 7 or 8. Data has been presented treatment-wise.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Urinalysis Results by Dipstick Method Under Fasting Condition</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess urine occult blood, urine glucose, urine ketones, urine protein and monitor urine pH. The dipstick test gave results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters (except urine pH) were recorded as negative and positive, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. pH is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration and is used to determine the acidity or alkalinity of urine. Urine pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH of greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0). Dipstick test results for pH were presented as number of participants having pH value as 5, 6, 6.5, 7 or 8. Data has been presented treatment-wise.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Abnormal Findings for Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters Under Fed Condition</title>
        <description>A single 12-lead ECGs was obtained using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT and QT corrected (QTc) intervals. Clinically significant abnormal ranges were: heart rate: lower:&lt;50 beats per minute and upper: &gt;110 beats per minute; QT: Upper: &gt;400 milliseconds (msec); QTc: Upper: &gt;450 msec; PR: lower: &lt;110 msec and upper: &gt;220 msec; QRS: lower: &lt;60 msec and upper: &gt;120 msec. The number of participants with abnormal findings for ECG parameters have been presented. Data has been presented treatment-wise.</description>
