  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis greatly impacts the quality of life, mobility, independence,
      and even safety of the individuals who suffer from it. One of the most powerful tools for
      these patients can be education on self-care and self-management strategies that can be
      taught to a patient by a physician, physical or occupational therapist, or a nurse. These
      self-management strategies can help patients treat daily stiffness through exercise or manage
      flares of osteoarthritis. There is a lack of consensus on the best teaching methods to
      accomplish the goal of educating our patients. Feedback from both patients and providers
      regarding teaching methods is needed. This study will evaluate teaching methods on
      self-management strategies for patients who are undergoing hyaluronic acid injections for
      knee osteoarthritis.
