      Study Design

      A prospective observational, cross-sectional epidemiological study in U.S. site-based
      clinical practice settings.

      30 sites will enroll approximately 300 patients

      Participating patients - or their caregiver in the case of patients under the age of 18 -
      will be consented to participate.

      Physicians complete a retrospective chart review on each enrolled patient.

      Patients will complete a one-time study questionnaire.

      Study recruitment was stopped due to difficulty in enrolling the targeted number of patients
      on March 21, 2018. Subjects currently enrolled into the study have completed the study as per
      protocol. There were no safety concerns involved in the decision to stop enrollment.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>Pfizer has the right to review disclosures, requesting a delay of less than 60 days. Investigator will postpone single center publications until after disclosure of pooled data (all sites), less than 12 months from study completion/termination at all participating sites. Investigator may not disclose previously undisclosed confidential information other than study results.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Since study terminated early due to difficulty in enrolling targeted number of participants, so data was not collected and analyzed for any secondary endpoints, hence not reported in results. No safety concerns involved in decision to stop enrollment</limitations_and_caveats>
