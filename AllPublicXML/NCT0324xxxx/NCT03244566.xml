  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer around the world, with more than 450000
      new cases per year. Esophagectomy with radical lymphadenectomy (2-field lymphadenectomy) is
      the mainstay of treatment in many countries for patients with esophageal cancer. To improve
      the survival, 3-field lymphadenectomy combined with cervical lymphadenectomy was started in
      1980s. More potential positive lymph nodes were found during more extended lymphadenectomy,
      offering more accurate TNM staging, affecting consequent treatment.
      However，3-field-lymphadenectomy was associated with increased surgical morbidity and
      mortality. Positron emission tomography (PET) is used for detecting distant metastases and
      lymphatic involvement. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of PET in predicting
      cervical lymph metastases of patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and
      to determine if investigators can use PET to guide future cervical lymphadenectomy.

      From June, 2018, a total of 110 patients with thoracic esophageal carcinoma will be recruited
      in 4 hospital in China. Participants with resectable esophageal cancer will have PET/CT scan
      before three-field lymphadenectomy. Lymph nodes will be recored according to the anatomy
      site. Lymph nodes metastasis diagnosed by PET/CT and by postoperation pathological
      examination will be compared to evaluate the role of PET/CT in guiding the extent of
      lymphadenecomy and surgical approach.
