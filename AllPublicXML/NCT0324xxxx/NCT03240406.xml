      This is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to investigate whether the
      Multicultural Healthy Diet (MHD), an anti-Inflammatory diet tailored to a multi-cultural
      population, can improve cognitive functioning in a middle aged (40-65 yr) urban population in
      Bronx, New York compared to a usual diet.

    <textblock>
      The Multicultural Healthy Diet (MHD) is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial designed
      to test the effects of an 18 month intervention on cognitive function among 326 middle-aged
      individuals (40-65 yr). MHD is an anti-inflammatory diet tailored to a multicultural
      population. The emphasis of the intervention is on plant-based foods and limited animal and
      high saturated fat foods with focus on anti-inflammatory foods/food components specific to
      the cultural context of the participants. The trial will employ a parallel group design
      comparing the effects of the dietary intervention (MHD) on cognitive status to those of the
      control diet or usual diet plus modules on self-care matters such as dealing with aches and
      pains of aging, obtaining a health care proxy ,etc. To show that MHD can be adapted to this
      population serum biomarkers indicative of the MHD diet pattern such as fatty acid profile as
      well as other key nutrition biomarkers will be evaluated. Other aims include testing whether
      the MHD intervention can benefit cognitive function using real-time ambulatory assessments.
      The investigators will also assess plasma markers of oxidative stress and inflammation.
      Components of the MHD diet that are associated with stable or improved measures of cognition
      will also be evaluated. The clinical site for the proposed study is at the Albert Einstein
      College of Medicine; the ambulatory cognitive assessment reading center is at Pennsylvania
      State University, State College; the statistical core is at the University of Pennsylvania
      and the laboratory for biospecimen analysis is at the University of Minnesota.
