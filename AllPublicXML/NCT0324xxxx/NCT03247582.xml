      In order to understand the risks and benefits of edoxaban use in a real-world clinical
      setting in the NVAF indication, Daiichi-Sankyo Hong Kong proposed this non-interventional
      study (NIS) to gain insight into the safety of edoxaban use in non-preselected patients with
      NVAF.

      Edoxaban was approved by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board in Hong Kong (date: 31 May 2016) for
      the: Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial
      fibrillation (NVAF) with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure,
      hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack
      (TIA). Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of
      recurrent DVT and PE in adults.

      In order to understand the risks and benefits of edoxaban use in a real-world clinical
      setting in the NVAF indication, Daiichi-Sankyo proposed this non-interventional study (NIS)
      to gain insight into the safety of edoxaban use in non-preselected patients with NVAF.

      Real world evidence from routine clinical practice using edoxaban up to 2 years will be
      collected and evaluated in approximately 200 patients, treated by specialized as well as
      non-specialized physicians in hospital centers.

        Primary strategy is to include only patients with NVAF who are to be treated with edoxaban
        according to Package Information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)). To ensure
        that the physician's prescribing behaviour will not be influenced, patients may only be
        included after the treating physician has made the clinical decision to prescribe edoxaban.
        Patients must have provided written informed consent for participation in the study (ICF)
        and should not participate simultaneously in any interventional study.
