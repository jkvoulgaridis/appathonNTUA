      The purpose of this non-randomized, non-controlled, acute, single-arm research study is to
      evaluate the feasibility to obtain a stable position of a ring of stimulation electrodes on
      the interatrial septum. The possibility to terminate atrial arrythmias will also be
      evaluated.

      The evidence of treating AF by pacing is limited, although these algorithms are of interest,
      since they appear to be safe and usually add little additional cost.

      Using a computer model, a new dual-stage septal pacing has been developed.The proposed septal
      pacing algorithm could suppress AF reentries in a more robust way than classical single site
      rapid pacing. The feasibility of pacing both atria simultaneously from a single lead placed
      in the interatrial septum has been previously demonstrated clinically. The septal pacing
      concept has also been successfully tested in a computer model of AF and in a pig model .
      Experimental studies are now needed to determine whether similar termination mechanisms and
      efficacies can be observed in humans.

      The purpose of this non-randomized, non-controlled, acute, single-arm research study is to
      evaluate the feasibility to obtain a stable position of a ring of stimulation electrodes on
      the interatrial septum

    <intervention_model_description>Approximately 15 subjects with AF indicated for ablation of the pulmonary vein will be enrolled in the study. Participants will attend the Baseline visit and the Procedure visit. The baseline visit can be on the same day as the ablation procedure. Since it is an acute study, no follow-up visit will occur. The research procedure will be performed during an already scheduled ablation procedure. Subjects will be enrolled over a period of approximately 18 months</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To assess Pacing Site Stability, the number of interatrial septal pacing electrodes which are successfully placed in a stable position, will be counted. A stable position in this study is defined as a location where the pacing threshold will be &lt; 10 mA at a pacing pulse width of 1 msec. Stable pacing further requires that no ventricular capture will be induced during atrial stimulation at twice the atrial capture threshold.</description>

If the patient will not be in sinus rhythm, he/she will be externally cardioverted in order to determine pacing thresholds and impedances on all septal catheter electrodes. Next, atrial fibrillation will be induced by rapid atrial pacing.AF cycle length will be determined in the left atrial appendage, during 1 minute of atrial fibrillation using ablation catheter electrodes. Subsequently, a pacing scheme will be applied and capture on decapolar recording catheters will be assessed as well as AF termination.</description>

          <title>Number of Electrodes in a Stable Position</title>
          <description>To assess Pacing Site Stability, the number of interatrial septal pacing electrodes which are successfully placed in a stable position, will be counted. A stable position in this study is defined as a location where the pacing threshold will be &lt; 10 mA at a pacing pulse width of 1 msec. Stable pacing further requires that no ventricular capture will be induced during atrial stimulation at twice the atrial capture threshold.</description>
