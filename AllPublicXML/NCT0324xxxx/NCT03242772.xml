  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) have significantly worse outcomes than those with either ASD alone or ADHD
      alone. Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for
      young children with ASD+ADHD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled,
      phase 2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically
      addresses ADHD symptoms while providing an ASD-targeted behavioral intervention, and (2)
      identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved
      outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD ages 3-10 years. The primary aim of this
      study is to evaluate whether a stimulant treatment augments efficacy of an ASD specific form
      of parent child therapy based on the Early Start Denver Model called ESDM influenced Parent
      Coaching. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy of combined intervention in improving
      ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children
      with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine correlations between behavioral changes and
      state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to
      elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and
      to potentially identify new targets for intervention in children with ASD+ADHD. The study is
      about 8 months long and will involve screening, baseline assessment followed by 10- 11 weeks
      of study drug treatment (active or placebo) and 8 sessions of ESDM informed parent coaching
      beginning after 2 weeks of study drug treatment, primary endpoint assessments at ~11 weeks,
      AE follow-up by phone at ~week 13 and remote FU 24 weeks after baseline. Eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication or placebo, Between weeks 11
      to 24, it is expected that the parent will use the behavioral strategies they were coached in
      even though they will not receive parent coaching. Participants will be given the option to
      pursue ADHD medication outside of the research study after week 11 assessments.

    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2, single site, pilot study will evaluate the
      developmental impact of combined medication and behavioral treatment (COMB) versus placebo
      and behavioral treatment (BEH) in children with comorbid ASD +ADHD, who are between 36 and &lt;
      132 months of age. The active medication treatment will be an orally dissolvable, extended
      release amphetamine preparation (Adzenys-XR-ODT) administered from weeks 0-~11 and carefully
      titrated to the optimal dose using an algorithm that considers adverse events and improvement
      in attention symptoms with a flexible dose range of 1.55mg - 18.6mg/day. The target dose is
      12.4mg/day. A placebo, matched to the active medication, will be titrated and adjusted using
      the same algorithm in the BEH arm. The provided behavioral treatment will be eight ~ hour
      long parent child therapy sessions of ESDM influenced parent coaching.

      Approximately 48 participants will be randomly assigned to either the COMB or BEH treatment
      arms. To account for possible differences in attrition due to potential poor tolerability of
      Adzenys-XR-ODT, participants will be randomized in a 7 COMB to 6 BEH ratio. Treatment
      assignment will be provided by the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC)using computer
      generated algorithms.

      The primary analyses will compare changes in outcomes between weeks 0 and 11 weeks.
      Exploratory analyses will explore changes between weeks 0 and 24.

      The primary outcome measure is change in amount and quality of joint engagement between the
      child and the parent during a semi-structured, 6 minute parent child interaction task (PCIT),
      which reflects the core symptom domain targeted by P-ESDM: social communication.

      Our key secondary outcomes will be changes in 1) the mean of the interview version of the
      VABS-3 socialization subscale and communication subscale standard scores and 2) clinician
      ratings of ADHD symptoms using the preschool ADHD-RS.

      We will also assess the safety and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT compared to placebo.

    <description>Mean of standard scores for VABS-3 (socialization subscale and communication subscales) assess how the participant actually has been functioning over the preceding month with regard to communication and social behaviors. The VABS-3 comprehensive form will be administered as a semi-structured interview by a trained and research reliable staff member. The standard score is based on the participant's age and is normed from a large sample of typically developing children. The standard score has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores represent more adaptive functioning and lower scores represent less adaptive functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change in ADHD Symptoms using Preschool or School age ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 7,11, (week 0 = baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) will assess symptom frequency using data from clinician completed ADHD-RS and parent completed ADHD-RS (only parent-completed ADHD-RS is completed at week 24).
ADHD-RS includes 18 items, each rated on a 4 point scale (0-3);Total Score is the sum of all responses (0-54). An Inattention subscale and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale (each range 0-27) are calculated based on individual items assessing those symptoms. Higher values represent worse outcomes for the subscales and the total scale. Normative scores are available. Clinically significant scores in boy are 14 for inattention items and 17 for hyperactivity/impulsivity items. Clinically significant thresholds in girls are 12 and 14 respectively. A supportive exploratory analysis will examine change to a nonclinically significant score by week 24 (using clinician rating) and week 52 (using only parent ratings) . If subscales are used, they would be summed to compute the total score.</description>
