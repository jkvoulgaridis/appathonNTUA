      This study will measure the impact of two teledermatology apps to provide direct to patient
      teledermatology follow up care, Patient Viewer and My VA Images, with a trial on access to
      dermatology care. The overall hypothesis is that sites implementing Department of Veterans
      Affairs' (VA) teledermatology mobile apps will significantly augment the use of
      teledermatology and improve Veterans' access to skin care relative to control sites.
      Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that these apps will improve established
      patients' ability to follow-up with dermatology care remotely, reducing patient travel to
      dermatology clinics while opening up dermatology clinic space for other patients.

      Previously the study included a parallel trial to evaluate a teledermatolgoy mobile app, VA
      Telederm. This trial is no longer feasible within this study's funding timeline due to
      limitations imposed by OI&amp;T that are not under the control of the PI or the operational
      partner, OCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Access to healthcare is currently a key priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
      The current practice of teledermatology in VA is effective but has not been uniformly
      implemented. Once patients establish care in a dermatology clinic, they often need follow-up
      visits to evaluate responses to treatment and to adjust management, neither of which
      necessarily requires a face-to-face visit. To improve clinic access to in-person dermatology
      clinics, VA Office of Connected Care developed a mobile app, My VA Images to be used in
      conjunction with the Patient Viewer app, to allow established dermatology clinic patients to
      follow-up remotely. The mobile apps are planned for wide-spread implementation in the VA. The
      investigators are conducting one trial of database review to understand how these two apps
      affect features of dermatology care, specifically related to access to care.

      The apps will be made available over a 1 year period in a randomized, stepped-wedge design to
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. The direct-to-patient facing apps will be
      distributed to 28 facilities with dermatology clinics that currently have relatively high
      teledermatology activity and thus already have relatively mature teledermatology programs
      ready for advanced operations.

      By using a stop code unique to this process, the investigators will use the VA Corporate Data
      Warehouse (CDW) to measure the impact of the apps in one trial on outcomes reflecting
      dermatology access. At the end of the study period, the proposed research will result in a
      novel documentation of mobile teledermatology's effectiveness in enhancing Veteran's access
      to dermatology service. The results will be of significance to VA as it develops and
      implements other mobile telehealth programs, and more generally to other healthcare
      organizations planning for large-scale telehealth interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>The study uses a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT). Each facility, the participant in the study, represents a cluster of patients who receive care at the respective VA Medical Center and associated CBOCs. The trial is a cross-sectional SW-CRT, since facilities are not measured repeatedly over the course of the study. The investigators will retrospectively measure outcomes during the 6-month baseline period. The trial will be rolled out over a 12 month period. After each (randomly selected) set of facilities switches to the intervention at each step, a 3-month implementation phase occurs, during which outcomes will not be measured in the analysis. Every 3 months, a new group of clusters will implement the apps until all are using the apps. This leads to a total of 3 cross-over points over the whole rollout period.</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criterion for the trial with direct to patient facing apps was that a
             site had greater than or equal to 9% of all FY2018 dermatology encounters under
             secondary stop codes 695/696.

          -  This indicated considerable pre-existing experience with consultative teledermatology
             and the likely presence of dermatology reader and support personnel needed to
             implement direct to patient facing apps.

          -  The investigators identified 28 sites eligible for direct to patient facing apps.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  VA medical centers with no 695/696 stop code activity in FY2016 or with zero full-time
             equivalent dermatologists were excluded since these sites likely lack the expertise,
             support, and infrastructure to feasibly adopt teledermatology during the study period.

          -  The investigators also excluded sites outside the continental U.S., sites without a
             dermatology clinic, and the 3 sites where the formative evaluation of this study will
             be performed (i.e., Providence, RI; San Francisco, CA; and Denver, CO).
