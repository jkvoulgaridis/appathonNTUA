  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of a novel therapeutic approach to
      promote functional recovery and spasticity in chronic SCI. The tsDCS effect on
      neuro-physiological measures such as H reflex and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) wiil
      be evaluated in subjects with SCI. This incremental, design will allow the establishment of
      strong electrophysiological data prior to rapid clinical translation of the findings about
      this promising, early-stage technique.

      The central hypothesis is twofold: 1) active tsDCS will lead to a change in Hmax/M max ratio
      than sham tsDCS, in a polarity dependent manner; and 2) active tsDCS will lead to a change in
      SSEP amplitude and latency, in a polarity dependent manner.

    <measure>Percent Change in Hmax</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes before intervention, 10 minutes after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately before application of tsDCS and after application of tsDCS, Hmax will be obtained from soleus muscle by stimulation of tibial nerve. The H-reflex is a compound muscle action potential elicited by low-threshold electrical stimulation of afferent fibers in the mixed nerve with subsequent monosynaptic excitation of alpha motoneurons. Changes in the excitability of the reflex pathway are estimated by measuring the amplitude of the reflex.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SSEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 to 40 minutes before intervention, 30 to 40 minutes after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) is the electrical activity response measured at the skin's surface along ascending sensory pathway following controlled peripheral nerve stimulation by tsDCS. For recording posterior tibial nerve SSEPs, the nerve is stimulated at the ankle, with the cathode midway between the Achilles tendon and the medial malleolus and the anode 3 cm distal to the cathode. Nerve stimulation should consist of a 0.1-0.2 ms duration square wave pulse at 3-5 Hertz (Hz). These pulses will be delivered by constant voltage stimulator applied transcutaneously over the targeted nerve. The stimulation intensity would exceed the motor threshold for eliciting a muscle twitch. Electromyogram (EMG)/ Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) measuring system will be used to measure SSEPs.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Hmax</title>
        <description>Immediately before application of tsDCS and after application of tsDCS, Hmax will be obtained from soleus muscle by stimulation of tibial nerve. The H-reflex is a compound muscle action potential elicited by low-threshold electrical stimulation of afferent fibers in the mixed nerve with subsequent monosynaptic excitation of alpha motoneurons. Changes in the excitability of the reflex pathway are estimated by measuring the amplitude of the reflex.</description>

        <title>Change in Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SSEP)</title>
        <description>A somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) is the electrical activity response measured at the skin's surface along ascending sensory pathway following controlled peripheral nerve stimulation by tsDCS. For recording posterior tibial nerve SSEPs, the nerve is stimulated at the ankle, with the cathode midway between the Achilles tendon and the medial malleolus and the anode 3 cm distal to the cathode. Nerve stimulation should consist of a 0.1-0.2 ms duration square wave pulse at 3-5 Hertz (Hz). These pulses will be delivered by constant voltage stimulator applied transcutaneously over the targeted nerve. The stimulation intensity would exceed the motor threshold for eliciting a muscle twitch. Electromyogram (EMG)/ Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) measuring system will be used to measure SSEPs.</description>

Bruising was related to outcome measure collection (that is, related to preparation for measurement of h-reflex, which involves cleaning of the skin and placing electrodes) but unrelated to the intervention--this subject withdrew after randomization and completion of one session of sham stimulation.</desc>
