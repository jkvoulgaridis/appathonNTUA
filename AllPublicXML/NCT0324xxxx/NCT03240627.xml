      Double-blind, randomised, multi-centre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LH-8
      cutaneous solution versus placebo in children and adolescents with moderate to severe scalp
      alopecia areata.

      Phase 2/3 study performed in Germany, Bulgaria , Romania and France in 100 patients.

      Methods / trial design:

      Randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled multicentre trial in parallel groups.

      At screening (Visit 0), subjects will discontinue their previous treatment for alopecia
      areata, if any. Screening period will last up to 28 days. The 24-week treatment phase will
      include assessment Visits 1 to 3, which will take place at 12-week intervals. At assessment
      Visit 1, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive LH-8 cutaneous
      solution or vehicle (placebo) twice daily for a 24 week treatment period. During the
      treatment phase the subjects will complete daily their drug diaries. The post-treatment
      safety and efficacy follow-up phase will include Visit 4 and Visit 5, 12 and 24 weeks after
      end of treatment, respectively.

      Subjects (as applicable) and parents will be instructed to contact the investigator, if an
      event on scalp (intolerance) occurs during the treatment or post-treatment period. They may
      be asked to come to the site for an unscheduled visit, in order to perform additional
      examinations.
