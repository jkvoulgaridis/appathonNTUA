    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to show superiority in lung function of once daily (2
      inhalations) treatment with orally inhaled tiotropium+olodaterol fixed dose combination to
      twice daily (one inhalation) treatment with fluticasone propionate+salmeterol fixed dose
      combination over 12 weeks in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

      A Digital Health (DH) exploratory study has been integrated into the main study as a site
      specific study. The DH exploratory study will be performed at a single site; the site is also
      participating in the main study. The DH exploratory study site will enter (randomize)
      approximately 20 patients (subjects) (in addition to the patients to be enrolled in the main
      study at this site). The patients enrolled in the DH exploratory study are not considered to
      be part of the main study (i.e. data collected in the DH exploratory study will be analyzed
      separately from the data collected in the main study).

             related procedures including:

               -  Technically acceptable pulmonary function tests (spirometry)

               -  Completion of study questionnaires

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a significant disease other than Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
             (COPD); a significant disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the

             patient has a total blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3, source documentation is required
             to verify that the increased eosinophil count is related to a nonasthmatic condition.

        Patients with any of the following conditions:

          -  A diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis (due to the known class side effect profile of
             ß2-agonists).

             history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per the first
             exclusion criterion).

          -  Patients being treated with oral or patch β-adrenergics.

          -  Patients being treated with oral corticosteroid medication within 6 weeks prior to

          -  Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than one hour per day and
             in the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen therapy
             during clinic visits.

          -  Patients who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior

             rehabilitation program.

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month, six half-lives or

             component of the Respimat® inhalation solution. In addition, patients with known

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using a method of birth control classified at

             bilateral oophorectomy, or post-menopausal (defined as no menses for 12 months without
             an alternative medical cause). Tubal ligation is NOT a method of permanent
             sterilisation.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study compares treatment tiotropium+olodaterol (5μg/5μg) once daily FDC to Fluticasone propionate+Salmeterol (250μg/50μg) twice daily FDC over 12 weeks in patients with COPD. A Digital Health (DH)-study has been integrated a site specific study. The patients enrolled in the DH-study are not considered to be part of the main study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and non of the exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Area Under the Curve From 0 to 12 Hours (AUC0-12) Response (Change From Baseline) [L] After 12 Weeks of Treatment</title>
          <description>Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) Area under the Curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12) response (change from baseline) [L] after 12 weeks of treatment.
FEV1 AUC0-12 was calculated as the area under the FEV1-time curve from 0-12 hours post-dose using the trapezoidal rule, divided by the duration (12 hours) and reported in liters. FEV1 AUC0-12 response (change from baseline) was defined as FEV1 AUC0-12 minus baseline FEV1.</description>
