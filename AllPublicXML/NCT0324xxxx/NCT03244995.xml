    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a couple-based mind body program works in improving spiritual,
      psychosocial, and physical quality of life in patients with high or low grade glioma or
      tumors that have spread to the brain and their partners. A couple-based mind body program may
      help to improve spiritual well-being, sleep difficulties, depressive symptoms, and overall
      quality of life in patients with glioma or tumors that have spread to the brain and their
      partners.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the feasibility of the couple-based mind-body (CBMB) program in patients with high
      grade glioma (HGG) and their partners.

      II. Establish the initial efficacy of the CBMB program in patients and their partners
      regarding spiritual (primary), psychological and physical quality of life (QOL) (secondary)
      outcomes relative to a waitlist control (WLC) group.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore potential mediation (i.e., mindfulness, compassion, holding back, and intimacy)
      and moderation (e.g., baseline medical, demographic and psychosocial factors) effects of the
      intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (CBMB PROGRAM): Patients undergo CBMB program consisting of 4-5 deep-breathing and
      meditation exercise sessions over 60 minutes and 2 weekly telephone calls over 15 minutes for
      6 weeks. Patients also complete questionnaires regarding health, mood, sleeping habits,
      relationship, health care, work productivity, and quality of life.

      GROUP II (WAITLIST CONTROL): Patients complete questionnaires as in Group I. Patients may
      undergo CBMB program after completion of study.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.

    <measure>CBMB program efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will calculate effect sizes for pairwise between-group comparisons of intervention outcomes at T2. Will test for between-group differences in the change of scores between T1 and T2 using analysis of variance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>CBMB program efficacy on quality of life (QOL) outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months after completion of study</time_frame>
    <description>Will examine treatment mediators and moderators. Will examine if treatment efficacy on QOL outcomes measured at T3 is potentially achieved through improved mindfulness, self-compassion, holding back and intimacy measured at T2 using linear regression analysis in both a and b paths. Ninety percent bootstrap CIs will be constructed to assess the significance of the indirect effects defined using the product-of-coefficient approach. Linear regression analysis or multi-level modeling will be used to test for the interaction effects between treatment and baseline mindfulness, self-compassion, holding back and intimacy, as well as baseline medical and demographic factors (i.e., sex, age, and Karnofsky performance status), each at a two-sided significance level of 0.1.</description>
