      This study investigates the efficacy and mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine formula
      power product in the treatment of osteopenia in patients with pain. Half of participants will
      receive Chinese medicine formula power product, while the other half will receive a placebo.

      Osteoporosis is a major public health problem, resulting in potentially pain and increasing
      risk of fracture. Treatment of osteoporosis consists of pharmacotherapy, lifestyle measures,
      dietary changes, mineral supplementation. Traditional Chinese medicine is a major component
      of health care in Taiwan and provides one treatment alternative for osteoporosis.

      Investigators investigate the efficacy and mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine formula
      powder product in the treatment of osteopenia patients with pain.This trial is a 12 weeks'
      randomized, placebo-controlled study. The study was approved by the Wan Fang hospital, and
      signed informed consent was obtained from each participant. 80 Osteopenia participants with
      pain were enrolled in this study. There were 80 participants aged 50 years or older included.
      Before random assignment to treatment, participants were at least moderate pain during 2
      weeks as identified by visual analogue scale (VAS) for more than 4. Bone mineral density
      (BMD) of all participants was -2.5 or below without diabetes, hyperthyroidism,
      hypoparathyroidism, liver or kidney function disorder, ovariectomy, rheumatoid arthritis,
      bone cancer, ever used hormone agent within 6 months before assignment to treatment, ever
      used steroids more than 3 week before assignment to treatment, Primary outcome measures were
      the change of VAS scale, Oswestry Disability Index and WHOQOL-BREF Taiwan at week 1 and 12.
      Secondary outcome was the genetic loci associated with a susceptibility to osteoprosis
      treated by traditional Chinese medicine formula powder product.

      Result : To provide evidence of the efficacy and mechanisms of ZBP powder product in the
      treatment of osteoporosis patients with pain.
