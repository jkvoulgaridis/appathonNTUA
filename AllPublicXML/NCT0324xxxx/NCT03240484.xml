      The purpose of the study is to explore the long term functional status of people who have had
      both a spinal fusion procedure and a total hip replacement. Studies have found that those who
      have received spinal fusion may have worse outcomes following a total hip replacement than
      those who have not received a spinal fusion. The information obtained from this study will
      allow surgeons and researchers to better understand why some who've had a spine fusion have
      more complications post total hip replacement compared to those who did not have spinal
      fusion surgery.

    <description>Certain patients may be asked to participate in a motion analysis procedure at the Human Movement Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. This procedure takes approximately 1.5 hours and you will only be asked to participate in the motion analysis procedure once. Participants will change into a custom-designed tight body suit, which has reflective markers on its surface for infrared video capture. Participants will then have pairs of surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes placed on certain areas of the skin on the legs and on the back. Wearing the EMG electrodes and marker suit, participants will perform 5 trials of walking on a level walkway, walking up and down a 3-step staircase, sitting from a standing position, and standing from a seated position.</description>

        Approximately 70 patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) and spine fusion (SF)
        surgery will be called by the surgeon or research team and asked if they wish to
        participate in the study. A second group of approximately 45 patients who have only had a
        THA (and no SF) will serve as a comparison group. A third group of approximately 45
        patients who have only had an SF surgery (and no THA) will also be recruited.
