      Aim: This study evaluated the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) on the
      cytokine profile and the correlation to clinical parameters of patients undergoing
      chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      Materials and methods: 40 patients were allocated: periodontitis patients (P) (n=20) and
      breast cancer with periodontitis patients (CAN/P) (n=20). The clinical parameters: probing
      depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), Bleeding on probing (BOP) and
      levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β, IL-17, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) were evaluated at baseline, 45 and 180 days after therapy.

      The NSPT, which consisted of subgingival debridement - scaling and root planning (SRP) under
      local anesthesia. On average, the treatment of the entire oral cavity was completed within
      four sessions (sessions of 50 minutes). The SRP was performed by one experienced periodontist
      (KRVV) using Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy MFG. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), ultra-sonic devices
      (Bob-Cat, Dentsply/Cavitron, Long Island City, NY, USA) and, if necessary, with
      multilaminated drills.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients were diagnosed with periodontitis (P) The inclusion criteria were:Loss of
             clinical insertion (CAL) ≥ 5mm and PD probing depth ≥ 6mm in ≥ 30% of sites; ≥20
             teeth; radiographic bone loss that extends to the middle level of the root; presence
             of supragingival and subgingival calculus according to the severity of periodontal
             damage. Grade B was assessed indirectly, considering radiographic bone loss in the
             tooth most affected by dentition as a function of age (0.25 to 1.0).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) scaling and root planning or antibiotic treatment in the previous 6 months; 2)
             systemic diseases that could affect the progression of periodontitis (e.g., diabetes,
             hypertension, cardiovascular diseases); 3) extensive prosthetic involvement; 4)
             long-term administration of anti-inﬂammatory medication; 6) smokers and former
             smokers; 7) pregnancy or lactation; 8) orthodontic therapy; 9) use of mouth rinses
             containing antimicrobials in the preceding 2 months; 10) patients had previously
             received chemotherapy or radiotherapy; 11) patients with metastasis and/or patients
             with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
