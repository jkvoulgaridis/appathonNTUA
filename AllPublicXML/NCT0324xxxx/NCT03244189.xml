  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial to investigate the impact of increased fluid intake and increased
      urine output on the recurrence rate of urinary stone disease (USD) in adults and children.
      The primary aim of the trial is to determine whether a multi‐component program of behavioral
      interventions to increase fluid intake will result in reduced risk of stone disease
      progression over a 2‐year period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two arm randomized controlled trial that incorporates pragmatic features, an
      adaptable intervention, patient choice, and remote monitoring of fluid intake through a
      &quot;smart&quot; water bottle. The study period is 24 months and will enroll approximately 1642
      participants. Randomization will be stratified within a study site by age (adult vs.
      adolescent) and first time vs. recurrent stone former.

      Intervention and control arm study participants will receive a smart water bottle that
      records daily fluid consumption, usual care including guideline-based recommendations of
      adequate fluid intake to decrease kidney stone recurrence, and periodic 24 hour urine
      collections, imaging (low-dose CT scan or ultrasound) and follow-up questionnaires.
