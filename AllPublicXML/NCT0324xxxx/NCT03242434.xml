  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal, prospective study aims to establish the magnitude and time course of
      changes in intestinal permeability; establish the optimal method for assessment of intestinal
      permeability in thermally injured participants: describe the participant population most
      likely to benefit from a new medicinal product which could prevent changes in intestinal
      permeability; and improve our understanding of the links between intestinal damage, changes
      in the gut microbiome and microbial translocation to the systemic circulation following
      thermal injury. The key factors of interest in this study are to understand the impact of
      thermal injury on intestinal permeability in thermally injured participants compared to
      healthy participants; and to understand the changes in intestinal permeability over time.
      Approximately 15 eligible healthy participants and 25 thermally injury participants will be
      included. The sugar test material (STM) comprises of Lactulose, Mannitol and Sucralose and
      will be intermittently administered enterally to all the participants. The full duration of
      the study for healthy participants will be approximately two weeks and 6 months for thermally
      injured participants. In order to enter this study thermally injured participants will be
      required to co-enroll in this study and an allied study entitled: A Multi-center, Prospective
      Study to Examine the Relationship between Neutrophil Function and Sepsis in Adults and
      Children with Severe Thermal Injury (SIFTI-2). (reference number IRAS ID: 200366).

      <time_frame>Serious adverse events (SAE) and Non-SAE were collected from Day 1 up to 6 months for thermal injury participants and SAE and Non-SAE were collected from Day 1 up to Day 15 for healthy participants. Safety Population comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of STM and have at least one post-dose safety assessment.</time_frame>
      <desc>Death is typically associated with the disease under study and were not reported as SAEs but instead were recorded drug related events (DREs). In thermally injured participants DREs are common and can be serious/life threatening: Deterioration of condition; Death (may be expected in burns of a large surface area); Prolongation of hospital stay; Persistent or significant disability or incapacity.</desc>
