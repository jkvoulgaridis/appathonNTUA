  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that implementation of a shared decision making care plan for
      prophylactic treatment will help therapeutic adherence of bipolar patients. They also
      anticipate that patients treated according to a shared decision making plan will have an
      elevated satisfaction of their care, quality of life and functionment, as well as a lower
      number of relapses
