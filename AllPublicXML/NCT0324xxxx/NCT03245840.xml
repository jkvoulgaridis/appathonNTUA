    <textblock>
      This is a continuation study of Budesonide Oral Suspension (BOS) in adults and adolescents
      with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) who have completed participation in the SHP621-302

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject completed the SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) extension study and is considered by
             the investigator to potentially benefit from continued BOS investigational treatment.

          -  Subject is able to provide written informed consent (subject, parent or legal guardian
             and, as appropriate, subject assent) to participate in the study before completing any
             study-related procedures.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to continue acceptable birth control
             measures (example (eg): abstinence, surgically sterile male partner, stable oral
             contraceptives, or double-barrier methods) throughout study participation.

          -  Subject is willing and has an understanding and ability to fully comply with study
             procedures and restrictions as defined in protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has changes in medications or diet during the SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) study
             that could affect participation in this continuation study.

          -  Subject anticipates using swallowed topical corticosteroid for EoE or systemic
             corticosteroid for any condition during the treatment period; any temporary use (less
             than or equal to [â‰¤] 7 days) or initiation of new steroid treatment during the study
             should be documented and discussed with the medical monitor prospectively but should
             be avoided within 4 weeks of the scheduled esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDs).

          -  Subject anticipates use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole,
             grapefruit juice) during the continuation study.

          -  Subject has an appearance at the EGD at the final treatment evaluation visit of
             SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) (Visit 8) of an esophageal stricture (high grade), as defined
             by the presence of a lesion that does not allow passage of a diagnostic adult upper
             endoscope (eg, with an insertion tube diameter of greater than (&gt;) 9 millimeter [mm]).

          -  Subject has presence of esophageal varices at the EGD at the final treatment
             evaluation visit (Visit 8) of the SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) study.

          -  Subject has any current disease of the gastrointestinal tract, aside from EoE,
             including eosinophilic gastritis, enteritis, colitis, or proctitis, inflammatory bowel
             disease, or celiac disease.

          -  Subject has other diseases causing or associated with esophageal eosinophilia,
             including hypereosinophilic syndrome, collagen vascular disease, vasculitis,
             achalasia, or parasitic infection.

          -  Subject has oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis that failed to respond to previous
             treatment. Diagnosis with oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis at or since the
             final treatment evaluation visit (Visit 8) of the SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) study is
             not an exclusion as long as the subject is expected to respond to treatment.

          -  Subject has a potentially serious acute or chronic infection or immunodeficiency
             condition, including tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral/parasite infection, ocular
             herpes simplex, or chicken pox/measles.

          -  Subject has upper gastrointestinal bleeding identified at the EGD at the final
             treatment evaluation visit (Visit 8) of the SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) study.

          -  Subject has evidence of active infection with Helicobacter pylori.

          -  Subject has evidence of unstable asthma.

          -  Subject is female and pregnant or nursing.

          -  Subject has a history of intolerance, hypersensitivity, or idiosyncratic reaction to
             budesonide (or any other corticosteroids), or to any other ingredients of the study
             medication.

          -  Subject has a history or high risk of noncompliance with treatment or regular clinic
             visits
