  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 part of the study is conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of eribulin mesilate in combination with irinotecan
      hydrochloride in pediatric participants with relapsed/refractory solid tumors (excluding
      central nervous system [CNS] tumors).

      The Phase 2 part of the study is conducted to assess the objective response rate (ORR) and
      duration of response (DOR) of eribulin mesilate in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride
      in pediatric participants with relapsed/refractory rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS),
      non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) and ewing sarcoma (EWS).

    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event [AE] as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>
