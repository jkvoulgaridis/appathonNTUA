  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based in an embodied approach of cognition, several studies have highlighted a direct link
      between perception of an object or an emotion and the associated motor responses. This study
      investigated in patients suffering from bipolar affective disorders whether the perception of
      emotional words involves an automatic sensorimotor simulation of approach and avoidance
      behaviors, and whether the perception of an object involves an automatic sensorimotor
      simulation of object prehension (affordance). We hypothesize that, in this pathology, low
      level (sensorimotor) cognitive processes are preserved whereas high-level (attentional) are
      altered. 20 patients suffering from bipolar affective disorders and 20 healthy controls will
      be recruited. The main objective is the emergence of sensorimotor compatibility effects in
      approach-avoidance task with emotional stimuli (gain between compatible vs incompatible
      conditions).
