      This is a multicenter phase 2 open label study of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic
      castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with or without DNA damage repair defects.

      All subjects will receive pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study is objective response
      rate (ORR) according to immune-mediated response criteria (irRC).

    <measure>Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment with pembrolizumab to the date of documented radiographic tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Radiographic tumor progression is defined according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) guidelines. The point estimate of 6-month rPFS rate and its 95% confidence interval will be obtained for each group, and will be compared by two-sample binomial test. The median rPFS and its 95% confidence interval will be obtained for each study group by Kaplan Meier method. Log rank test will be used to compare rPFS between the two study groups</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment with pembrolizumab to the date of documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by irRC for irPFS and RECIST v1.1 for PFS. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. The point estimation and its 95% confidence interval of 20 weeks and 28 weeks irPFS rate and PFS rate will be obtained by study group and compared between the study groups by two-sample binomial test, separately. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to summarize PFS and irPFS; median irPFS and PFS will be estimated with 95% confidence interval in each study group. Log rank test will be used to compare the irPFS and PFS between the two groups, separately.</description>

    <description>For subjects who undergo taxane-based chemotherapy after progression on pembrolizumab followed by repeat pembrolizumab after chemotherapy, time from the first chemotherapy treatment to disease progression will be estimated in both study groups. Disease progression will be defined by confirmed PSA progression on two consecutive measurements at least 2 weeks apart, or radiographic progression by irRC.
