  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single and repeated
      intravitreal injections of GB-102 in subjects with neovascular (wet) age-related macular
      degeneration.

    <textblock>
      In this 2-part study, Part 1 is a multicenter, open-label, safety, tolerability, and systemic
      exposure evaluation to Sunitinib in escalating doses of a single IVT injection of GB-102,
      while Part 2 is a multicenter, double-masked, randomized (1:1:1), parallel‑group, safety, and
      efficacy evaluation of repeated IVT injections of 2 dose levels of GB‑102 compared with
      aflibercept.
