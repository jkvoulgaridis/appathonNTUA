          5. Weight of at least 20 kg.

          6. Free of medication for the treatment of ADHD for at least one week prior to

             examination, medical history, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and
             electrocardiogram.

          8. Written informed consent obtained from the subject's parent or legal representative
             and informed assent from the subject, if applicable.

          9. Females of childbearing potential (FOCP) must be either sexually inactive (abstinent)
             or, if sexually active, must agree to use one of the following acceptable birth
             control methods beginning 30 days prior to the first dose, throughout the study:

               1. simultaneous use of male condom and intra-uterine contraceptive device placed at

             and for the last six months.

          2. Current diagnosis of major neurological disorders. Subjects with seizures or a history
             of seizure disorder within the immediate family (siblings, parents), or a history of
             seizure-like events are excluded from the study.

          3. Current diagnosis of significant systemic disease.

          4. Evidence of suicidality (defined as either active suicidal plan/intent or active

             allowed for subjects receiving a stimulant ADHD medication at Screening; the subject
             will be required to discontinue the stimulant for the study, beginning at least one
             week prior to the Baseline Visit.
