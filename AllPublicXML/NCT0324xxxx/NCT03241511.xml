  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to assess repeated and ongoing oral care and the way it may
      affect inflammation and quality of life in hemodialysis patients. Two treatment groups will
      be compared:

        -  1) ongoing and repeated gum disease therapy including deep tooth cleaning followed by
           multiple appointments of maintenance

        -  2) single session of gum disease therapy with only one session of deep tooth cleaning
           Samples of blood will be obtained for study to examine the changes of inflammatory
           substances in the blood as a result of the two different gum disease treatments. Also, a
           14-question survey will be discussed with you to assess oral health related quality of
           life (OHIP-14) and the way it is affected by oral care.

      For this project, four dialysis centers will be randomly assigned to either of the treatment
      groups #1 or #2 prior to your enrollment. For this purpose, there are two distinct consent
      forms explaining the visits, procedures and risks of the two treatment groups #1 or #2. As a
      result, all participants in the same dialysis center will belong to the same treatment group
      (either #1 or #2) and presented with the corresponding consent form.

      This dialysis center has been randomized to treatment group # 1; therefore you will receive
      ongoing and repeated gum disease therapy including deep tooth cleaning followed by multiple
      appointments of maintenance.

    <description>Briefly, treatment sessions will include oral hygiene behavioral modification and scaling and root planning (removing the bacterial biofilm and calculus below the gum line) in order to eliminate etiologic factors and control periodontal inflammation. Once the treatment sessions are completed, the patients will enter the maintenance phase and will be followed for 6 months. In this phase, the patients will receive systematic and repeated supportive periodontal treatment (tooth cleanings above the gum line with re-enforcement of oral hygiene). Outcomes will be assessed at 2-, 4-, and 6-months. Throughout the course of the study, additional dental needs will be addressed with immediate referral to the subject's general dentist or clinics at the University of Connecticut.</description>
