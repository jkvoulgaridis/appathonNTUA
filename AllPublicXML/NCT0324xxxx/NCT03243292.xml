  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT) at 10 years
      follow-up or beyond in subjects previously enrolled in any of the following Boston
      Scientific-sponsored, controlled pre-approval studies: AIR, RISA and AIR2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compare rates of severe asthma exacerbations of subjects during the first and fifth year
      after BT treatment with the proportion of subjects who experience severe asthma exacerbations
      during the 12 months period prior to enrollment.

      Compare baseline HRCT scans from subjects from the AIR2 study that enroll in BT 10+ study to
      examine if there are any clinically significant post-treatment respiratory changes following
      BT defined as bronchiectasis or bronchial stenosis.
