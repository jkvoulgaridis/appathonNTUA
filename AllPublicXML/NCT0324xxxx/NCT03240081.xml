      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two low doses of estrogen cream
      applied to a new location for the treatment of moderate or severe pain during sexual
      intercourse in postmenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estrogen cream is FDA-approved for vaginal use for the treatment of sexual pain, but its use
      in a new location is experimental. Pain with sex is a common problem experienced by women
      after menopause and the relationship of pain to sexual difficulties is well established. The
      cause has been assumed to be atrophy and the location has been assumed to be the vagina.
      Recent focused studies have shown that the location of pain is the vulvar vestibule and
      usually not the vagina. This study will look at pain before and after therapy with estrogen
      when only the vulvar entryway area is treated. This will be a study focused on sexual
      dysfunction in postmenopausal women.

          6. More than 6 months of consistent insertional pain with intercourse (may have stopped
             having intercourse due to this consistent experience of pain).*

          7. Willingness to enter a study where she will receive low-dose local estrogen.*

          8. Willingness to enter a study that requires application of cream on a frequent schedule
             for 3 months. *

          9. Willingness to evaluate the progress of therapies by use of the Tampon Test as many as
             2 times per week, and willingness to attempt intercourse if the Tampon Test indicates

             tension causing pain (pelvic floor myalgia) or has been found on screening examination
             to have pelvic floor tenderness or bladder tenderness.

          5. Constant burning pain localized to the vulva.
