  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of
      multiple doses of intravenous (IV) and oral isavuconazonium sulfate administered daily in
      pediatric patients. The PK data will be utilized to establish a pediatric population PK model
      of isavuconazole, the active moiety of isavuconazonium sulfate.
