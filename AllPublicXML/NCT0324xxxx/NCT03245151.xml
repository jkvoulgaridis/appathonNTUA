  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of this study, utilizing a rolling 6 design, will be conducted to determine a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to describe the toxicities of
      lenvatinib administered in combination with everolimus once daily to pediatric participants
      with recurrent/refractory solid tumors. Phase 2, utilizing Simon's optimal 2-stage design,
      will be conducted to estimate the antitumor activity of lenvatinib in combination with
      everolimus in pediatric participants with selected recurrent/refractory solid tumors
      including Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET), rhabdomyosarcoma,
      and high grade glioma (HGG) using objective response rate (ORR) at Week 16 as the outcome
      measure.

    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event [AE] as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>
