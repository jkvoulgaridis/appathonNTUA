  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that two pelvic relaxation exercises will be feasible and safe
      to perform by subjects daily before radiation during the participant's treatment and will
      decrease variability of sacral slope measurements on daily port films. The investigators will
      observe trends in the daily variability and change in the sacral slope in each participant to
      determine if this could decrease variability. The investigators will compare these
      measurements to a retrospective cohort that did not have the exercises, but did demonstrate
      variability. Reducing set-up variability (which inadvertently occurs during radiation) is
      important to improve radiation targets and diminish potential adverse effects. The
      investigators will query participants for objective and subjective feedback on the exercises
      and record frequency and duration of the two exercises.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be &gt;21 yrs of age and will have an oncologic diagnosis that requires a
             course of pelvic radiation therapy for a minimum of 5 weeks.

          -  They will have an ECOG Performance Status (This scale, developed by the Eastern
             Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), now part of the ECOG-ACRIN (American College of
             Radiology Imaging Network) Cancer Research Group, describes a patient's level of
             functioning in terms of their ability to care for themselves, daily activity, and
             physical ability (walking, working, etc.)) of 1 or better as determined by patient
             history.

          -  They will be ambulatory without needing any ambulatory aids such as a cane or walker.

          -  Both men and women will be eligible as there is no significant anatomical difference
             in sacral slope measurement. Joint replacement patients will not be excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults unable to consent

          -  Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Prisoners

          -  Non-English speaking subjects
