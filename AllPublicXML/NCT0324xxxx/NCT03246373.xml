  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study observed the relationship between cerebral collateral circulation and the
      prognosis of leukoaraiosis in high-risk population. Cerebral collateral circulation and
      leukoaraiosis levels will be evaluated and followed up by magnetic resonance examination. The
      participants' clinical performance caused by leukoaraiosis will be assessed by a series of
      scales.

      1. Case collection information is sent daily to clinical trial supervisors.

        2. The clinical trial team meets once a week to monitor the quality of clinical trials.

        3. The severity of the leukoaraiosis will be evaluated by a scale. The patients whose score
           is more than 2 will take additional magnetic resonance examination including magnetic
           resonance angiography (MRA) and arterial spin labeling (ASL). And their cognitive
           ability will be evaluated by a series of scales including Mini-Mental State Examination
           (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and gait by the short physical
           performance battery (SPPB).

           The blood sample will be taken for biochemical detection and hair and nail samples for
           trace element detection.

        4. Data were analyzed by regression analysis.
