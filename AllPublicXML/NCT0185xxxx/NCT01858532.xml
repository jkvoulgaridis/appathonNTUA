  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective was to evaluate the effect of atrasentan compared with placebo on time to
      doubling of serum creatinine (DBSC) or the onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in
      participants with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy who were treated with the maximum tolerated
      labeled daily dose (MTLDD) of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor. In addition, the
      study assessed the effects of atrasentan compared with placebo on cardiovascular (CV)
      morbidity and mortality, urine albumin excretion, changes in estimated glomerular filtration
      rate (eGFR), as well as the impact on quality of life in participants with type 2 diabetes
      and nephropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, double-blind, enriched-population, placebo
      controlled, multicenter study in adult participants with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
      Participants who met the inclusion criteria for initial study entry and none of the exclusion
      criteria were eligible to proceed to the Run-In Period to optimize RAS inhibitor and diuretic
      doses. Following the Run-In Period, eligible participants entered the 6-week Enrichment
      Period in which all received atrasentan to determine their urinary albumin to creatinine
      ratio (UACR) response and to assess tolerability of atrasentan. Responders and nonresponders
      were then randomly assigned to receive atrasentan or placebo in the Double-Blind Treatment
      Period. The study was performed in 5 to 6 periods in the following sequence: Pre-Screening
      Period (optional); Screening Period (Visits S1 and S2); Run-In Period (up to 12 weeks; Visits
      R1 to R6); Enrichment Period (6 weeks; Visits E1 to E5); Double-Blind Treatment Period
      (randomization to final treatment visit); and Follow-Up Period (Final Treatment to F1 visit
      [45 days post treatment] and other post-treatment visits). The study was prematurely
      discontinued because of a lower than expected event rate for the renal composite endpoint,
      which was adjudicated by a blinded independent events adjudication committee (EAC).
