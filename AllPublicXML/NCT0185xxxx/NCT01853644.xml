  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tivozanib works in treating patients with recurrent
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Tivozanib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant,
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determining the potential survival advantage and characterizing the safety of single agent
      tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tivozanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

        <description>Overall Best Response as measured by physical exam findings, serum CA125 levels and/or measurement of index lesions via appropriate imaging studies using RECIST criteria defined as either:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
