  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major challenge for researchers in cancer care is to expedite the development of new
      therapeutics and the Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment (a collaboration of the Dept.
      of Medical Oncology from the University Medical Center Utrecht, Netherlands Cancer Center -
      Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital and the Erasmus Medical Center - Daniël den Hoed clinic) is
      an initiative to achieve this goal.

      The current and future generation anti-cancer drugs are developed to specifically activate or
      deactivate deregulated gene products or signaling pathways in cancer cells. The development
      of such &quot;targeted&quot; agents is an exciting new opportunity that promises to deliver more
      anti-cancer efficacy and less toxicity. Although targeted therapy has been a breakthrough in
      medical oncology leading to the development of a portfolio of potentially successful new
      drugs, it has not yet delivered the much needed relief for large patient populations. We
      believe that the development of these agents is mainly hampered by our lack of successful
      patient selection.

      The CPCT aims to select patients for clinical trial participation based on the results of
      Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) information obtained from tumor material. The advent of NGS
      platforms enables us to probe a significant proportion of the cancer genome and thus to
      develop a realistic view on the complex genetic changes in cancer cells. The CPCT aims to use
      NGS platforms to improve the selection of patients for targeted therapy trials.

      We will obtain tumor biopsies of a (preferably) metastatic or locally advanced lesion and
      peripheral blood sample from all patients included in the trial; the biopsies to obtain
      information on the tumor related genetic mutations (mutational profile) and the blood samples
      to assess each patient's germline DNA background variation. As patients will be asked to
      undergo an invasive procedure it is important to address the potential safety issues. Review
      of the literature shows that in general tumor biopsies can be performed with only minor
      complications and acceptable risks. We will recruit patients with metastatic or locally
      advanced (incurable) solid tumors and we aim to use the information obtained from DNA
      sequencing to stratify patients for inclusion in clinical trials. The final personalized
      treatment decision will be made dependent on the availability of trials and the expected
      predictive value of the mutational profile.

        Selection criteria, defined as inclusion criteria, are:

          1. Patients with the following locally advanced or metastatic cancer for whom a new line
             of therapy is indicated below starting within 3 months after biopsy:

               -  Metastatic castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Abiraterone

               -  Metastatic Bladder Cancer: Pembrolizumab

          2. Measurable metastatic or locally advanced lesion(s), according to RECIST 1.1
             criteria18. For prostate cancer patients with bone only disease, no measurable lesions
             need to be present. Patients need to have evaluable disease, bone metastases that can
             only be detected on bone scans without CT/MRI or serum tumor marker will be considered
             inevaluable. Guidelines for response evaluation are given in appendix A and C.

          3. Metastatic or locally advanced lesion(s) of which a histological biopsy can safely be
             obtained.

          4. Patients age &gt; 18 years, willing and able to comply with the protocol as judged by the
             investigator with a signed informed consent.

        Patients must meet selection criteria 3 not only prior to baseline biopsy, but also prior
        to the (optional) on-treatment and/or post-treatment biopsies.

        Exclusion criteria:

        * If one or more of the above mentioned inclusion criteria is not met
