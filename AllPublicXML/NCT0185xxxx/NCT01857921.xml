    <textblock>
      Trimetazidine is a metabolic agent without any negative inotropic or vasodilatory properties.
      In addition, previous reports showed that trimetazidine was effective in reducing
      intracoronary platelet aggregation and preventing platelet thrombogenesis. Therefore, for the
      evaluation of these combination effects of statin and trimetazidine on patients with aspirin
      monotherapy who had previously received CABG and were free of the major adverse cardiac
      events such as death, MI, TLR, or TVR for 12 months, the investigators hypothesize that
      atorvastatin 40mg/day would be more effective in the prevention of the further late adverse
      cardiac and cerebrovascular events than other statin. To test this hypothesis, the
      investigators will perform a multi-center, randomized, prospective trial aimed at
      demonstrating the superiority of combination of high dose atorvastatin therapy and
      trimetazidine to pravastatin in patients with aspirin monotherapy 12 months after CABG
      surgery in real world practice.
