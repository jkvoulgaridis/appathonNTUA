      The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of blocking aldosterone for improving
      the health and function of arteries in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
      disease (ADPKD). The study also will provide insight into how blocking aldosterone improves
      artery health by determining the physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved.
      Overall, the proposed research will provide important new scientific evidence upon which
      physicians can base recommendations to patients with ADPKD to decrease risk of developing
      cardiovascular diseases.

    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiovascular complications are currently the major causes of mortality among
      patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Therefore, testing valid
      interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality within this population is of high priority.
      It is well documented that endothelial dysfunction coupled with abnormalities in markers of
      oxidative stress and inflammation develops early in ADPKD even before there is a significant
      decline in kidney function. Aldosterone levels are increased in patients with ADPKD and may
      contribute to cardiovascular disease by impairing endothelial function, and reducing vascular
      compliance. Of note, aldosterone antagonists have been shown to improve endothelial
      dysfunction in a number of studies in other patient populations. However, there has been no
      clinical interventional studies specifically targeting endothelial dysfunction in ADPKD. Our
      main goal is to establish the efficacy of an aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone) for
      treating vascular endothelial dysfunction and large elastic artery stiffness in ADPKD
      patients with preserve kidney function. A key secondary goal is to determine the integrative
      physiological (i.e., whole limb/artery to molecular) mechanisms underlying the beneficial
      effects of spironolactone.

      Working Hypotheses:

        1. Six months of an aldosterone antagonist will increase endothelium-dependent dilation
           (EDD) and reduce large elastic artery stiffness in ADPKD patients with preserve kidney
           function.

        2. The improvements in EDD after aldosterone antagonist will be associated with reduced
           circulating and endothelial cell markers of oxidative stress and inflammation.

        3. The improvements in large elastic artery stiffness after aldosterone antagonist will be
           associated with reduced circulating and endothelial cell markers of oxidative stress and
           inflammation, and changes in markers of structural protein turnover.

      Impact on the Field: The expected results will provide the first insight into the:

        -  Efficacy of an aldosterone antagonist for the primary treatment of vascular dysfunction
           in ADPKD patients with preserve kidney function.

        -  Cellular and molecular physiological mechanisms by which these treatment benefits are
           conferred.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Vascular Stiffness at 6 Months.</title>
          <description>Aortic pulse wave velocity, a measure of large elastic arterial stiffness, and carotid compliance, a measure of large artery distensibility, will be determined. A transcutaneous custom tonometers (Noninvasive Hemodynamics Workstation, Cardiovascular Engineering Inc., Norwood, MA) will be positioned at the aorta and femoral artery to measure pulse wave velocity, and carotid artery compliance (and the β-stiffness index, a more blood pressure independent measure of local arterial stiffness) will be measured non-invasively using simultaneous high-resolution ultrasonography and applanation tonometry). Higher values correspond to greater stiffness.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A potential limitation to the study is a relatively small sample size; however, we were appropriately powered to detect an improvement in the primary endpoint given expected vascular endothelial function at the time the trial was designed.</limitations_and_caveats>
