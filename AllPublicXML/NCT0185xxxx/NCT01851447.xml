  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some kinds of muscular dystrophy affect the skeletal muscle membrane. In these conditions,
      the muscle membrane is more fragile. This affects how the muscles contract and relax, which
      causes movement problems. Researchers are looking at several muscle enzymes, or chemicals
      that affect how muscle cells function. By studying changes in these enzymes, they may be able
      to better understand how muscular dystrophy affects the cells. Researchers want to collect
      biomarkers (chemicals from blood samples) from people with fragile sarcolemmal muscular
      dystrophy. This information may provide better treatments for this condition.

      Objectives:

      - To study biomarkers that may affect the muscles of people with fragile sarcolemmal muscular
      dystrophy.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age with fragile sarcolemmal muscular dystrophy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.

        -  Participants will be asked to come for four visits to the National Institutes of Health
           Clinical Center. The visits will be at least 2 months apart. Each visit will require
           participants to stay for 5 days at the clinical center.

        -  During each visit, participants will provide frequent small blood samples. These samples
           will be collected while at rest and after physical exercise.

        -  Participants will also have a physical therapy assessment. They will perform standard
           motor function tests and imaging tests (MRI, MRS). These tests may take up to 1 hour
           each time.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      Objectives: the aim of this protocol is to identify biomarker and clinical correlates of
      changes in the barrier function of skeletal muscle membrane (i.e. cell membrane permeability)
      before and after routine motor function testing in patients with one of the Fragile
      Sarcolemmal Muscular Dystrophies (FSMD).

      Study population: patients with early adulthood or later onset of a FSMD (LGMD2B-F, I, L, MM,
      BMD, and MMD3).

      Design: pilot study.

      Outcome measures: increased change in baseline levels of proteins that are released into the
      blood from damaged skeletal muscle, such as creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase
      (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), troponins, and
      myoglobin in serum, changes in inflammation markers, circulating microRNAs and imaging
      studies to identify effective biomarkers for use in future clinical trials.

        11 patients, 18 years or older with early adulthood or later onset of a genetically
        diagnosed FSMD will be enrolled in this study. We estimate no more than 50 patients to be
