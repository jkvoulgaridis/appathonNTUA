  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous transplantation of
      hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+ cells) from the bone marrow (BM) of ADA-deficient SCID
      infants and children following human ADA cDNA transfer by the EFS-ADA lentiviral vector. The
      level of gene transfer in blood cells and immune function will be measured as endpoints.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is open to twenty (20) infants and children diagnosed with ADA-deficient SCID who
      did not have a medically eligible, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor for
      bone marrow transplantation. The EFS-ADA lentiviral vector with the human ADA cDNA will be
      used to transduce autologous CD34+ cells from the bone marrow of these subjects. The subjects
      will receive 4 mg/kg busulfan prior to re-infusion of their gene-modified cells. Safety is
      the primary endpoint. During the follow-up phase, the investigators aim to determine whether
      the cells could engraft and produce mature cells that contain and express the corrected ADA
      gene in the absence of pegademase bovine (PEG-ADA) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which
      will be withheld at Day +30 following transplant. Efficacy studies to evaluate the level of
      immune reconstitution, will be performed in the first and second years of the study.
