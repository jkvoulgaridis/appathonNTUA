    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA (botulinum
      toxin Type A; BOTOX®) for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to neurogenic detrusor
      overactivity in participants who successfully completed Study 191622-120 (NCT01852045).

    <measure>Change From Study Baseline in the Daily Normalized Daytime Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes in Treatment Cycle 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Baseline (Prior to Day 1 in Study 120) to 2 consecutive days in the week prior to Week 6 in Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary incontinence was defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded by the participant in a bladder diary during 2 consecutive days in the week prior to the study visit (normalized to a 12 hour daytime period). Daytime is defined as the time between waking up to start the day and going to bed to sleep for the night. The number of daily daytime incontinence episodes were averaged during the 2-day period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Data are summarized under the respective treatments that participants received in the corresponding treatment cycle.</description>

    <time_frame>First injection on Day 1 in Study 120 through completion of Study 121 (Up to 108 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to medicinal (investigational) product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that resulted in death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, life threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. A TEAE or STEAE is defined as any new AE or worsening of an existing condition after initiation of treatment. Data are summarized under the respective treatments that participants received in the corresponding treatment cycles.</description>

        <title>Change From Study Baseline in the Daily Normalized Daytime Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes in Treatment Cycle 1</title>
        <description>Urinary incontinence was defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded by the participant in a bladder diary during 2 consecutive days in the week prior to the study visit (normalized to a 12 hour daytime period). Daytime is defined as the time between waking up to start the day and going to bed to sleep for the night. The number of daily daytime incontinence episodes were averaged during the 2-day period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Data are summarized under the respective treatments that participants received in the corresponding treatment cycle.</description>

        <title>Change From Study Baseline in the Daily Normalized Daytime Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes in Treatment Cycle 3</title>
        <description>Urinary incontinence was defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded by the participant in a bladder diary during 2 consecutive days in the week prior to the study visit (normalized to a 12 hour daytime period). Daytime is defined as the time between waking up to start the day and going to bed to sleep for the night. The number of daily daytime incontinence episodes were averaged during the 2-day period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Data are summarized under the respective treatments that participants received in the corresponding treatment cycle.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to medicinal (investigational) product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that resulted in death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, life threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. A TEAE or STEAE is defined as any new AE or worsening of an existing condition after initiation of treatment. Data are summarized under the respective treatments that participants received in the corresponding treatment cycles.</description>

        <description>Urinary incontinence was defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded by the participant in a bladder diary during 2 consecutive days in the week prior to the study visit (normalized to a 12 hour daytime period). Daytime is defined as the time between waking up to start the day and going to bed to sleep for the night. The number of daily incontinence episodes were averaged during the 2-day period.

          <description>Urinary incontinence was defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded by the participant in a bladder diary during 2 consecutive days in the week prior to the study visit (normalized to a 12 hour daytime period). Daytime is defined as the time between waking up to start the day and going to bed to sleep for the night. The number of daily incontinence episodes were averaged during the 2-day period. Data are summarized under the respective treatments that participants received in the corresponding treatment cycle.</description>
          <population>BOTOX-treated Population included all participants enrolled into extension study who received at least 1 BOTOX treatment over the course of total evaluation period, starting from their first treatment in Study 120. Number analyzed is the number of participants with evaluable data for the specific category.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Night Time Urinary Incontinence in Treatment Cycle 1</title>
        <description>Urinary incontinence was defined as involuntary loss of urine. Night time urinary incontinence was recorded by the participant on the bladder diary as a presence or absence of urinary leakage upon waking, for 2 consecutive days in the week prior to the week 6 visit. Night time was defined as the time between going to bed to sleep for the night and waking up to start the day. The percentage of participants with night time urinary incontinence is presented in categories 0, 1, and 2 nights. Data are summarized under the respective treatments that participants received in the corresponding treatment cycle.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Night Time Urinary Incontinence in Treatment Cycle 3</title>
        <description>Urinary incontinence was defined as involuntary loss of urine. Night time urinary incontinence was recorded by the participant on the bladder diary as a presence or absence of urinary leakage upon waking, for 2 consecutive days in the week prior to the week 6 visit. Night time was defined as the time between going to bed to sleep for the night and waking up to start the day. The percentage of participants with night time urinary incontinence is presented in categories 0, 1, and 2 nights. Data are summarized under the respective treatments that participants received in the corresponding treatment cycle.</description>
