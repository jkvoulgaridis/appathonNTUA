    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to further investigate the safety of six different commercially
      used Gadolinium-containing contrast agents.

      The study has been developed to evaluate Gadolinium retention in patients with renal function
      ranging from stable to severely impaired renal function who had previously (i.e. before start
      of this study) received any of the six different contrast agents within a magnetic resonance
      contrast imaging procedure and who will now undergo an orthopaedic procedure that allows
      collection of bone and skin samples for analysis.

      The purpose of the study is to further investigate the safety of six different commercially
      used Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. In order to get a better view of internal organs
      such as the brain, joints and other body regions contrast agents containing Gadolinium are
      often administered during magnetic resonance imaging.

      Gadolinium-containing contrast agents were introduced in the 1980s, and presently many
      different products are in common use. Although these agents are well tolerated, in 2006 it
      was reported that some patients with severe renal failure undergoing magnetic resonance
      contrast imaging developed signs of a rare condition known as Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis
      (NSF). NSF is an extremely rare disease that has predominantly been reported in patients with
      severe kidney impairment, acute kidney insufficiency due to the hepatorenal syndrome (kidney
      failure in patients with advanced chronic liver disease) or in patients with acute kidney
      insufficiency, who have recently had or soon expect to have a liver transplantation.

      In order to collect additional clinical data on a global scale and across different agents in
      common use, this study was requested by the European Medicines Agency to further investigate
      whether Gadolinium in human bone and skin are retained for a long time after administration
      of Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. This study has been developed to evaluate
      Gadolinium retention in patients with renal function ranging from stable to severely impaired
      renal function who had previously received any of the six different contrast agents within a
      magnetic resonance contrast imaging procedure and who are scheduled for an orthopaedic
      procedure.

      For this study the patients will not be administered any research medication.

      Participating sites are located in Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, USA, Japan and
      Republic of Korea.
