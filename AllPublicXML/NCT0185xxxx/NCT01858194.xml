  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in the management of ventricular arrhythmias through the use of
      ICD therapy, AADs, and catheter-based ablation strategies, considerable challenges remain.
      The optimal method for the prevention of recurrent VT following catheter ablation remains
      unclear. RSDN may be an effective tool for preventing ventricular arrhythmias, and associated
      ICD therapies, by reducing central sympathetic tone, catecholamine levels, and the
      renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system and promoting ventricular remodeling. Although RSDN has
      been shown to reduce the recurrence of VT in a case report of 2 patients suffering from
      electrical storm, to date no large prospective randomized study has evaluated the impact of
      RSDN in the prevention of recurrent VT in patients following catheter ablation of VT with
      ischemic or non-ischemic ventricular dysfunction. This study will specifically evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of adjunctive RSDN in the prevention of ICD therapy in patients with
      ischemic or non-ischemic ventricular dysfunction who are to receive a catheter-based VT
      ablation.

      The goal of this trial is to test the impact of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation
      (RSDN) as an adjunctive treatment for patients with either ischemic or non-ischemic
      cardiomyopathy undergoing catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The proposed
      study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized control trial. Patients undergoing VT
      ablation will be randomized to either VT ablation alone or VT ablation + RSDN.

• After completion of the measurement, no more than six radiofrequency ablation lesions separated both longitudinally and rotationally (a &quot;spiral pattern&quot;, see figure) will be placed per renal artery.

• After completion of the measurement, no more than six radiofrequency ablation lesions separated both longitudinally and rotationally (a &quot;spiral pattern&quot;, see figure) will be placed per renal artery. The power will be started at 10 W and titrated to a maximum 20 W, as deemed appropriate by the impedance drop (goal 10% drop). Each lesion should be between 30-120 seconds in duration (no more than 120 seconds per lesion).</description>
