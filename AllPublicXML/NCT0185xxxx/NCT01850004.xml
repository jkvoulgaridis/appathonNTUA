      The study purpose is to test the hypothesis that Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
      (CP-CML) patients with stable Complete Molecular Response (CMR) who discontinue Dasatinib
      treatment are able to maintain a sustained remission in the long-term, with undetectable or
      minimally detectable BCR-ABL residual disease.

      Primary Purpose: Protocol designed to evaluate remission of disease after treatment
      discontinuation. Treatment re-started if relapse occurs

    <description>Relapse is defined as any of the following events while a subject is on study: the loss of MMR, loss of Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR), loss of Complete Hematologic Response (CHR) or progression to advanced/blastic phase.

               1. Men and women diagnosed with CP-CML, on treatment with dasatinib for a minimum of
                  2 years at the time of enrollment and in dasatinib-induced complete molecular
                  remission ongoing for at least 1 year prior to study entry.

                  meet other enrollment criteria are eligible for the study provided prior
                  Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) were discontinued due to intolerance or lack
                  efficacy, although only one instance of lack of efficacy to TKI is allowed.
