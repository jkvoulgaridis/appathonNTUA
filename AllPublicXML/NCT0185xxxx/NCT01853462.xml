  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of supervised balance and
      proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) training for the rehabilitation of ankle
      sprains
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supervised proprioceptive training has been recommended by recently published guidelines for
      the rehabilitation of ankle sprains. However, research evidence on the efficacy of this type
      of training is still weak, mainly owing to the methodological limitations of relevant
      studies. In addition, there is paucity of evidence concerning the effects of such training
      for the outcomes of functional performance, pain, ankle range of motion, and contradictory
      results have been reported for postural control.

      This study aimed to substantiate the benefits of supervised training for the rehabilitation
      of ankle sprains, and elucidate the effects of two different proprioceptive protocols on the
      above-mentioned outcomes.

    <measure>Pain Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the completion of training (follow-up 1), and eight weeks after the completion of training (follow-up 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The main component of the Greek version of the short form of McGill Pain Questionnaire (GR-SFMPQ) was used for the assessment of pain sensation of the sprained ankle. This consists of 15 descriptive adjectives for the pain sensation (11 sensory and 4 affective), which are self-rated according to their intensity level on a 4-point rating scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The total rating score (minimum = 0, maximum = 45) of the main component of the GR-SFMPQ was used for data analysis, with higher values representing a worse pain sensation.</description>

    <measure>Pain Intensity During the Week Before Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the completion of training (follow-up 1), and eight weeks after the completion of training (follow-up 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The second component of the Greek version of the short form of McGill Pain Questionnaire, which is a visual analogue scale (VAS), was used for the assessment. The VAS is a horizontal 10-cm line with clearly defined boundaries: 0 cm = 'No pain' and 10.0 cm = 'worst possible pain'. partipants made a mark on the line at the point that better described the average pain intensity for their sprained ankle, during the week before testing. The distance marked from the 'no pain' point was measured in mm and was used for data analysis.</description>

    <description>The third component of the Greek version of the short form of McGill Pain Questionnaire, which is a 6-point verbal rating scale, was used for the assessment. Participants noted what word at the time completing the questionnaire would best describe their pain sensation for the sprained ankle (scoring: no pain = 0, mild = 1, discomforting = 2, distressing = 3, horrible = 4, excruciating = 5). The score corresponding to the noted word was used for data analysis, with higher values representing a worse pain sensation.</description>

        <description>The Biodex Stability System, which is a dynamic tilting platform, was used for assessment. The anterior-posterior stability index corresponded to the variance of foot platform displacement in the sagittal plane, and it was measured in single-leg stance, for the sprained leg, without footwear. Three 20-sec trials were performed, with open eyes, and the mean score was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Pain Sensation</title>
        <description>The main component of the Greek version of the short form of McGill Pain Questionnaire (GR-SFMPQ) was used for the assessment of pain sensation of the sprained ankle. This consists of 15 descriptive adjectives for the pain sensation (11 sensory and 4 affective), which are self-rated according to their intensity level on a 4-point rating scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The total rating score (minimum = 0, maximum = 45) of the main component of the GR-SFMPQ was used for data analysis, with higher values representing a worse pain sensation.</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity During the Week Before Testing</title>
        <description>The second component of the Greek version of the short form of McGill Pain Questionnaire, which is a visual analogue scale (VAS), was used for the assessment. The VAS is a horizontal 10-cm line with clearly defined boundaries: 0 cm = 'No pain' and 10.0 cm = 'worst possible pain'. partipants made a mark on the line at the point that better described the average pain intensity for their sprained ankle, during the week before testing. The distance marked from the 'no pain' point was measured in mm and was used for data analysis.</description>

        <description>The third component of the Greek version of the short form of McGill Pain Questionnaire, which is a 6-point verbal rating scale, was used for the assessment. Participants noted what word at the time completing the questionnaire would best describe their pain sensation for the sprained ankle (scoring: no pain = 0, mild = 1, discomforting = 2, distressing = 3, horrible = 4, excruciating = 5). The score corresponding to the noted word was used for data analysis, with higher values representing a worse pain sensation.</description>

          <title>Electromyographic Activity of Anterior Tibialis Muscle During Ankle Dorsiflexion at 120°/Sec Speed</title>
          <description>Two surface electrodes and a ground electrode were used for assessment. Measurements were taken for the sprained leg, during isokinetic testing of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles, at 120°/sec speed, with the Biodex dynamometer. Normalized values of the electromyographic (EMG) signals were used for analysis, and EMG activity during maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the anterior tibialis muscle was used as the reference value for normalization.</description>

        <title>Electromyographic Activity of Tibialis Anterior Muscle During Foot Inversion at 30°/Sec Speed</title>
        <description>Two surface electrodes and a ground electrode were used for assessment. Measurements were taken for the sprained leg, during isokinetic testing of the foot invertor muscles, at 30°/sec speed, with the Biodex dynamometer. Normalized values of the electromyographic (EMG) signals were used for analysis, and EMG activity during maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the anterior tibialis muscle was used as the reference value for normalization.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, after the completion of training (follow-up 1), and eight weeks after the completion of training (follow-up 2)</time_frame>
