  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a significant increase in non-suicidal self-injury the last decades especially
      among young people and treatment initiative are sparse. We aim to assess the feasibility of
      methods, procedures, and safety of internet-based Emotion Regulation Individual Therapy for
      Adolescents (ERITA) as add on to treatment as usual (TAU) in 13-17-year-old patients with
      non-suicidal self-injury referred to psychiatric services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-suicidal self-injury has disseminated almost epidemically through the last decades in
      young persons. There is no evidence of any experimental treatment for non-suicidal
      self-injury in adolescents, superior to treatment as usual. Patients with stigmatizing
      illness such as non-suicidal self-injury may find internet-based interventions more
      acceptable. The study is a feasibility trial, with a randomization procedure in a parallel
      group design. Patients will be recruited from Child- and Adolescent Mental Health Services
      (age 13 to 17 years). The experimental intervention is internet-based, and therapist guided;
      ERITA consists of online Emotion Regulation Individual Therapy for Adolescents (ERITA) as
      add-on to treatment as usual. Treatment as usual is provided by multidisciplinary teams in
      nine outpatient clinics within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in the Capital
      Region of Denmark. Feasibility of recruitment and trial procedures will be monitored as well
      as explorative clinical outcomes.

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the intervention, a blinding of participants and therapists (intervention providers) is not possible. Blinded outcome assessment and data management will be performed. Statistical analyses will be performed by two blinded statisticians presenting independent reports. Based on the two blinded conclusions, two abstracts will be written and published (on a website).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Completion of follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Completion of follow-up will be defined as completing at least one clinical outcome (non-suicidal self-injury events) at end of intervention. If the number participants with completed outcomes is 26 out of 30, the fraction will be 87%, 95% CI 75% to 99%. A follow-up fraction of 87% or more will be acceptable for a future trial while a fraction below 75% will impose serious problems of interpreting the trial result in a future large pragmatic trial.</description>

    <measure>The fraction of eligible participants who consent to inclusion and randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine the fraction of potential participants as the number of eligible persons compared to the number of randomized persons. If the number of participants randomized out of the number of eligible persons is 30 out of 75, the fraction will be 40%, 95% confidence interval (CI) will be: 29% to 51%. A randomization fraction of 29% or more will be acceptable for a future trial, while a fraction below 29% will impose serious problems of recruitment for a future large pragmatic trial.</description>

    <measure>Compliance</measure>

    <description>Compliance with the experimental intervention will be defined as completing at least six of 12 ERITA sessions. ERITA will automatically register time for login and save the exercises that have been completed. If the number of compliant experimental participants is 11 out of 15, the fraction will be 73%, 95% CI 51% to 96%. A compliance fraction of 51% or more will be acceptable for a future trial while a fraction below 51% will impose serious problems of interpreting the trial result in a future large pragmatic trial.</description>

    <description>ERITA is a youth-adapted version of Emotion Regulation Group Therapy (ERGT), based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which encounters emotional recognition and regulation, crisis strategies and skills training. The ERITA intervention is provided as add-on to TAU and consists of 12 weeks, manualized, therapist guided internet-based therapy. The intervention also provides six modules for the parents focusing on NSSI and other risk-taking behaviors, emotional awareness, and validation skills. The participants must complete one module every week while the parents must complete a module every second week. A mobile app is available to complement the online treatment. The app includes reminders of homework and skills and allows to report on both self-destructive behaviors and impulses daily.</description>
