  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy soft tissue around the implant are considered as a biological seal to prevent
      inflammatory periimplant diseases and ensure healthy, stable and long-term survival of a
      dental implant. Due to the fact that the measurement methods in the literature differ, it is
      necessary to establish objective measurement method and to determine the minimum amount of
      tissue thickness to maintain a stable level of bone around the implant.

      Healthy soft tissue around the implant are considered as a biological seal to prevent
      inflammatory periimplant diseases and ensure healthy, stable and long-term survival of a
      dental implant. Due to the fact that the measurement methods in the literature differ, it is
      necessary to establish objective measurement method and to determine the minimum amount of
      tissue thickness to maintain a stable level of bone around the implant.

      Purpose:

      The aim of the study was to determine the effect of soft tissues in the implant area on the
      marginal bone level loss in the implant area and to define of the critical gingival thickness
      to minimize marginal bone level (MBL) loss.

      Materials and methods:

      75 bone level implants (Conelog® Camlog, Switzerland) were inserted in the aesthetic area.
      Thickening of soft tissues was performed both before and after implantation (group II and
      III), CTG and XCM were used (subgroup a and b). 12 months after the loading with final
      restoration, the thickness of soft tissues in the implant area was examined with
      ultrasonography (USG) device (Pirop®, Echoson, Poland), and each implant was subjected to
      Radiovisiography (RVG) RVG examination, where MBL loss was determined.

    <description>12 months after gingival augmentation Measurement of marginal bone level and soft tissue thickness were done. STT (soft tissue thickness) was measured using ultrasonography with a Pirop® dental, ultrasound device (Echoson Company, Poland). The patients underwent a clinical and ultrasound examination before, 3 and 12 months after gingival augmentation (GA) respectively to evaluate TKT at two points using ultrasound equipment (Pirop®, Echoson).
Intraoral radiographs were taken using a paralleling technique with a Rinn-type film holder in high resolution mode (Visualixe HD®, Gendex®, USA). Two images of each region were selected to calculate the marginal bone changes:</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To qualify for the study, the patients had to be &gt;18 years and have missing teeth in the
        esthetic zone. Additional inclusion criteria were as follows:

          -  missing single or double teeth in the anterior area of their upper or lower jaw with a
             proper inter arch relationship (incisors, canines and first premolar) with a ridge
             width (bucco-lingual) greater than 5 mm at its narrowest point and a minimum
             keratinized gingiva height of 2 mm buccally.

          -  No previous soft tissue augmentation procedure at experimental site

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The criteria that disqualified patients from the study were previous grafting procedures in
        the area of interest and systemic or local diseases that could compromise healing or
        osteointegration. Smokers and patients with bruxism were also excluded from the study.
        Additional exclusion criteria were as follows:

          -  implants placed with an insertion torque of 35 Ncm or less;

          -  irradiation in the head and neck area;

          -  untreated periodontitis;

          -  poor oral hygiene (plaque score Approximal Plaque Index (API) 20%, bleeding score 10%)
             and

          -  poor motivation;

          -  fresh post extraction sockets
