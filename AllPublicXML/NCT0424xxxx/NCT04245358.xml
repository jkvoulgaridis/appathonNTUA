      Detailed Description: This is an open, non-comparative, multicenter study that evaluates the
      performance and safety of the medical device Ainara®.

      In this study we use polycarbophilic vaginal moisturizing gel (Ainara®) for symptomatic
      treatment of vaginal dryness and we will monitor its impact on vaginal dryness symptoms.

    <intervention_model_description>Open-label, non-comparative, interventional multicenter study. The recently developed polycarbophilic, vaginal moisturizing gel (Ainara®) is widely used by gynaecologists in Europe to relieve vaginal dryness and related symptoms. Regarding the design choice, the adoption of a comparison versus placebo was not possible for technical reasons (the impossibility to use a real placebo without moisturizing effects).
The Research Question of the present study is the following: in a population of post-menopausal women affected by vaginal dryness, will a 1-month treatment with polycarbophilic vaginal moisturizing gel (Ainara®) significantly decrease the symptomatology evaluated by VHI and VAS in comparison with the baseline condition?</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale: the changing from baseline to day 3, 7, 21, 30 (final visit) for VAS mean value; The minim score is 0 and the maxim score is 5, where 0 represents no symptoms and 3 represents severe symptoms</description>

    <measure>subjective symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>• subjective symptoms: dryness, itching, burning, dyspareunia, and dysuria reported on patient diary and scored as reported in the AGATA study as follows: 0 = absence, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe intensity. The change in these variables will be evaluated from baseline to day 3, 7, 21, 30 (final visit).</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>• objective signs in the vaginal mucosa: dryness, thinning rugae, pallor, fragility, and petechiae scored as reported in the AGATA study by Investigator as: 0 = absence, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe alteration. The change in these variables will be evaluated from baseline to 30 day (final visit).</description>

    <measure>Vaginal pH</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>• Vaginal pH: it will be measured by the Investigators with a test strip delivered by Sponsor. The baseline values can be ≥ 5.0 (this was the minimum value need for vaginal atrophy diagnosis in AGATA study) to 9.0. The Investigator will insert the pH strip into the upper wall of the vagina and will consider the reading made while the strip is still damp. The change in the mean value of this outcome will be evaluated from baseline to 30 day (final visit).</description>

    <measure>Vaginal Trophism Maturation Value (MV)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>• Vaginal Trophism Maturation Value (MV): This outcome will be obtained from the cellular count of the vaginal smears at baseline and at the 30 days visit. The samples will be fixed, stored, and sent in the local laboratory in Timisoara, Romania (address details in TMF) for staining (Papanicolaou technique) and subsequent analysis. Samples will be evaluated by one independent cytopathologist blinded to the treatment. The MV will be calculated according to the following formula: MV = [1x (% superficial cells)] + [0.6x (% intermediate cells)] + [0.2x (% parabasal cells)]. The comparison will be between baseline and 30 days values.</description>

    <measure>Global Symptom Score (GSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>• Global Symptom Score (GSS) a composite score of symptoms, will be obtained to assess the effect of treatment on all individual symptoms taken as a whole. It will be calculated by the addition of the intensity scores of all individual symptoms (range, 1-15: 1 = only mild vaginal dryness, 15 = all five symptoms severe in intensity). This outcome will be compared, by assessing the change from baseline visit to 30 days visit (final visit).</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Assessment of Safety (PGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>• Patient Global Assessment of Safety (PGAS): it will be reported by the subject at all visits and all phone contacts in the patient diary using the 4-point scale:
1= very good safety, 2 = good safety, 3 = moderate safety and 4 = poor safety.</description>
