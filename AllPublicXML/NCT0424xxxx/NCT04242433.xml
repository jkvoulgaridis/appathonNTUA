  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful treatment of hepatitis C has been reported to be associated with 62-84% reduction
      in all-cause mortality (deaths), 68-79% reduction in risk of HCC and 90% reduction in risk of
      liver transplantation. The efficacy of NS5A inhibitors for the treatment of patients
      chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be affected by the presence of NS5A
      resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). Pre-existence of resistance associated
      substitutions (RASs) to direct antiviral agents (DAAs) reduces sustained virologic response
      (SVR) rates by 3-53% in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 infected patients depending on
      different predictors and the DAA regimen used. This study will prospectively analyze data
      from the MukhMantri Punjab Hepatitis C Relief Fund (MMPHCRF) to determine the posttreatment
      prevalence of various NS5A RASs, and their effect on outcomes of treatment with
      daclatasvir-sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir-ledipasvirin patients with chronic HCV.

      The study aims to assess the prevalence and effect of RASs on sustained virological response
      (SVR) rates in patients with treatment failure to a regimen containing sofosbuvir and
      ledipasvir/daclatasvir.

    <description>All subjects with viremic chronic hepatitis C will be given DAAs based on the MMPHCRF Treatment algorithm. Patients will be assessed for cirrhosis, prior treatment exposure, high risk groups like dialysis patients, HIV-HCV coinfection, etc. Accordingly treatment will be provided at any of the 25 peripheral centres or at the apex nodal treatment centre (PGIMER) of the MMPHCRF.
Baseline and post treatment RAS samples will be collected with consent.</description>
