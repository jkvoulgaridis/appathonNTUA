      Background: The pathophysiology of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) involves several
      mechanisms. Intestinal dysbiosis may influence factors involved in the pathophysiology of
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, such as changes in gastrointestinal motor patterns and
      increased intraabdominal pressure due to increased fermentation of non-digestible
      carbohydrates. However, few studies have focused on assessment of gut microbiome in the GERD.
      In this study, we investigated intestinal microbiomes, in individuals with Gastroesophageal
      Reflux Disease and healthy individuals, using metagenomic techniques.

      Methods: We performed a study comprising fecal samples of 22 adults, aged 18-60 years: 11
      with erosive esophagitis (eight male and three female) and 11 healthy controls (ten male and
      one female). Microbiome DNA was extracted from stool samples, and polymerase chain reaction
      amplification was performed using primers for the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (16S
      ribosomal ribonucleic acid). The amplicons were sequenced using the Ion Torrent™ Personal
      Genome Machine™ platform, and data were analyzed using QIIME™ software version 1.8
      (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology).

    <description>In this study, we investigated intestinal microbiomes, in individuals with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and healthy individuals, using metagenomic techniques. To analyze and compare different samples, we used two types of diversity indices: alpha (α) and beta (β). The relative abundance of the samples was calculated using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Boxplot graphs and tables were generated to compare groups. All tests performed took into account a bidirectional α of 0.05 and a confidence interval (CI) of 95%.</description>
