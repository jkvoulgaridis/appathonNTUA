      This longitudinal study tests the hypothesis that obesity affects drug pharmacology of acid
      suppression medications in children.

      The purpose of this research study is to see how the body breaks down certain medicines. Many
      medicines are broken down in the liver. The liver is an organ in the belly. A person's age,
      size, genetics (DNA), and the health of their liver decide how quickly the body breaks down
      medicines and how much medication a person needs to take. Everybody's liver has some fat in
      it, but the amount of fat is different from person to person. The purpose of this study is to
      see if the amount of fat in the liver affects how quickly acid suppression medications start
      and stop working and get removed from the body.

    <ipd_description>Deidentified experimental data may be shared with institutional collaborators outside of CMH and if it is determined that biological samples obtained from study participants must be transferred to institutions outside of CMH for the purpose of confirmatory analyses, appropriate inter-institutional material transfer agreements will first be executed. As this is a pediatric study, minimal blood volumes are being collected and we do not anticipate that biological samples will be available to share with the outside community upon completion of the study, beyond those samples that may be required for confirmatory analyses.</ipd_description>
