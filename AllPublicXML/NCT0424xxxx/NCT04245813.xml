  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a devastating disease with great impact on the quality of life and survival
      of those who suffer from it. The disease has a high prevalence and its treatment represents
      high economic costs for health systems. In Colombia, cardiovascular diseases that are part of
      chronic noncommunicable diseases are the first cause of death. According to figures from the
      World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014, 28% of deaths in the country were due to
      cardiovascular diseases.

      Pharmacological treatment, patient education and regular physical activity are the
      cornerstones for the treatment of heart failure and therefore the international clinical
      practice guidelines as well as the guide of the Colombian Ministry of Health recommend the
      performance of supervised physical exercise for patients with the disease. Cardiac
      rehabilitation programs using regular and supervised aerobic exercise positively impact the
      lives of these patients by improving functional capacity, quality of life, psychological
      well-being and can have an effect on important outcomes. such as hospitalizations and
      mortality.

      The Health Rehabilitation Group has carried out several research projects on heart failure
      and other cardiovascular diseases, and in agreement with the Ministry of Health and Social
      Protection (COLCIENCIAS) developed the Clinical Practice Guide for the Prevention, Diagnosis,
      Treatment and Rehabilitation of Heart Failure in population over 18 years of age
      classification B, C and D. The group's research has demonstrated the efficacy and safety of
      cardiac rehabilitation to improve functional capacity, abdominal perimeter and systemic blood
      pressure figures in patients with cardiovascular diseases, improvement in the quality of life
      in patients with heart failure and the prevalence of musculoskeletal diseases has even been
      described in this group of patients. In one of the studies, an exercise program was compared
      with an educational program and it was concluded that the exercise was effective in improving
      the health-related quality of life of patients with heart failure.

      Despite the benefits demonstrated by the cardiac rehabilitation programs, the adherence to
      exercise of the patients is low, especially during phase III of the program in which patients
      exercise in an unsupervised manner with periodic care follow-up. In some studies they have
      carried out other types of follow-up such as telephone control, home visits and
      telemonitoring, but there are no studies that carry out a low-cost program, with telephone
      follow-up and distance education to improve adherence in the phase III of cardiac
      rehabilitation.

      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of an education, follow-up and stimulus
      program of adherence to the achievements of phase III of the Rehabilitation Program in
      patients with heart failure, on functional capacity, quality of life, the need to return to
      phase II of the program and rehospitalizations.
