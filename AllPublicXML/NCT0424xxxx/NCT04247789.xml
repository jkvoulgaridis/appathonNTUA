  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is an important and prevalent problem in older adults. The ratio of fatigue may rise
      in older adults who live in nursing homes/rest homes. In the literature, a few studies
      investigated the prevalence of fatigue, and there is no study explaining the associated
      factors. The aim of the present study is to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in rest
      home residents and to determine the associated variables with fatigue.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The FSS is the most frequently used scale among the unidimensional scales which have been developed to assess fatigue. The scale rates the fatigue with nine items, For each item, the patient is asked to grade the fatigue level between 1 and 7, where 1 indicates strong disagreement and 7 indicates strong agreement. A score of 28 or higher generally indicates presence of fatigue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Quadriceps strength and handgrip strength will be measured by digital dynamometers named as Lafayette and Jamar dynamometers, respectively. Quadriceps strength will be measured in a sitting position with hip and knee flexed 90 degrees. The participants extend the knee and the examiner applies an opposite force to break this position. This test will be performed three times and the maximum value will be recorded in a kilogram. The handgrip strength will be assessed according to the American Society of Hand Therapists. The participants will be asked to squeeze as forcefull as possible the dynamometer. The maximum score of three trials will be recorded in kliograms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>6-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Six-minutes walk test will be used to evaluate the functional capacity or cardiorespiratory fitness. The participants will be walking in a 30-meter corridor for 6-minutes. If necessary the participants can use the walking assistive devices and take a rest. The total distance will be recorded in meters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Short Physical Performance Battery will be used to measure physical functioning. This battery includes 3 subdomains (gait speed, balance and chair stand test). The totatl score changes between 0 and 12. The higher score indicates better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Boddy mass index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The body measures (weight and height) will be assessed in kilograms and meters. The index will be calculated by dividing body weight by height squared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity habits</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity habits will be determined with a question&quot; How many times did you exercise for 30 minutes or more with a certain tempo?&quot; This question will be recorded as a dichotomous variable, 1 indicates present physical activity habits (&gt;2 times) and 0 no physical activity habits (&lt;3 times).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body mass</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds.</time_frame>
    <description>The weight will be measured in kilograms without shoes and within thin clothes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Height</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The height will be determined in an erect standing position as centimeters.</description>
