    <textblock>
      A Phase 1/2 open label trial of intravenous administration of TAEK-VAC-HerBy vaccine in
      patients with advanced HER2- expressing cancer. The study will be completed in 3 stages. In
      Stage 1 patients will be enrolled and treated according to a 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Up
      to 4 dose levels will be explored. Stage 2 will enroll patients with HER2- positive breast
      and gastric cancer to administer the TAEK-VAC-HerBy vaccine in combination with HER2
      antibodies. Stage 3 will enroll patients to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      TAEK-VAC-HerBy vaccine in combination with HER2 antibodies and PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. Patients,
      in all three stages, will receive TAEK-VAC-HerBy every three weeks, three administrations in
      total.
