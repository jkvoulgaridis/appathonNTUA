  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study consists of 3 sub-studies. Sub-study 1 is looking at how common is
      hyperkalaemia in admitted patients or patients attending emergency department and what
      happens to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) medications in these
      patients.

      Sub-study 2 is about patients with new diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection
      fraction (HFrEF) and how often these patients develop hyperkalaemia over 1 year and if
      hyperkalaemia leads to any changes to RAASi.

      Sub-study 3 is a questionnaire looking at decision making process of health-care
      professionals who treat patients with hyperkalaemia and/or HFrEF.

      The study aims to answer the following research questions:

        1. In adult patients (not receiving dialysis) who are admitted to hospital or attend the
           emergency department:

             -  How common is high potassium levels (hyperkalaemia)?

             -  In patients who have high potassium levels - what are their age, gender, ethnicity,
                health issues, regular medications they take?

             -  What investigations and treatments are patients with high potassium undergoing in
                hospital?

             -  How does hyperkalaemia impact on RAASi medications and does this vary according to
                the reasons why patients are taking RAASi in the first place?

             -  How frequent are repeat admissions/deaths in patients with hyperkalaemia at 12
                months?

        2. In patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF (impaired pumping function of the heart)
           including those with impaired heart function after a recent heart attack:

             -  How often do they experience high potassium levels over 12 months period and how
                does it impact on RAASi prescription?

             -  How frequently are these patients are admitted to hospital or die over 12 months
                period?

        3. What level of hyperkalaemia do healthcare professionals consider making changes to
           RAASi?

             -  What proportion of healthcare professionals are aware of RAASi benefits in heart
                failure with reduced ejection fraction and doses of RAASi we should aim for in
                HFrEF?

             -  What do healthcare professionals think may improve the way they treat patients with
                high potassium levels?
