  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective research study which will include patients who have progressed on
      immunotherapy as their most recent line of therapy. This study aims to characterize whether
      patients who fail to respond to immunotherapy versus patients who respond initially but after
      a period of time progress demonstrate different genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic,
      immunophenotyping profiles. Patients will have a one-time fresh tumor biopsy. Serial blood
      samples (total amount of blood drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 mL or 3 mL/kg in an 8
      week period), archival tissue (if available) and one stool sample will be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histological or cytological diagnosis of solid malignancies, with at
             least one tumor lesion amenable to core needle biopsy and consent to such a procedure.

          -  Patients must have progressed on immunotherapy (defined as anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies
             given as monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy) as their most recent line of
             therapy. Patients will be classified into two groups: 1) those who benefitted from
             immunotherapy with either complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or prolonged
             stable disease (SD) defined as &gt; 6 months with subsequent progression (i.e. acquired
             resistance), 2) those whose disease is primary refractory to immunotherapy with
             disease progression on first on-treatment imaging.

          -  Patients must be of good performance status, ECOG 0-1, for subsequent anticancer
             therapy, with either standard treatment or within the context of a clinical trial.

          -  Patients must be â‰¥ 18 years old.

          -  Patients must have provided voluntary written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition that could interfere with a patient's ability to provide informed
             consent such as dementia or severe cognitive impairment.

          -  Any contraindication to undergoing venipuncture.

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with patient
             safety, or evaluation of the collected specimens and interpretation of study results.
