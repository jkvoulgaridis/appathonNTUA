  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, crossover dietary intervention trial will test the effects of 4
      weeks of daily honey-flavored yogurt intake on markers of inflammation (Th17 cytokines) and
      oxidative stress (NOX2, UA, RSNO) and associative changes with microbial derived metabolites
      (SCFAs, BAs, ellagitannins), metabolism and the fecal microbiome. The above suite of selected
      markers will capture diet-induced systemic changes in inflammation and oxidative stress,
      while assessing associated microbial changes.

  <detailed_description>

      Those qualified for enrollment will be randomized into a double-blind crossover study to
      consume 2 morning servings of a 0.6 cup (150g) of plain yogurt with : A) cane sugar added in
      an isocaloric level as the honey or, B) 1 tbsp of phenolic-rich honey for 4 weeks. A
      one-month washout between periods will be used. The participants will be instructed to
      consume one yogurt in replacement of or as part of breakfast, and as a late morning snack.
      They will also be instructed to not add any additional items to the yogurt. Therefore, each
      study participant will consume 2 tbsp. of honey a day for four weeks, which is a realistic
      amount typically consumed by honey users.
