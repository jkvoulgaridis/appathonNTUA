  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute and fluctuating disturbance of consciousness and can occur in 80% of
      critically ill patients. Delirium is more frequent in mecanically ventilated patients and is
      associated with longer hospital stay, increased cognitive impairment and mortality. On the
      occasion of the change of the monitors in the ICU ward, allowing a total withdrawal of alarms
      in patients room, this study evaluates the prevalence of delirium before and after the alarm
      withdrawal. During the first period the patients will be monitored as usual, and during the
      second period patients will be monitored without alarms ringing in patients room. Delirium
      will be screened with a validated, clinical tool.
