  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current classifications of the laryngeal view during laryngoscopy are criticized for being
      subjective.

      The modified CL classification is criticized as it does not predict difficult intubation and
      especially grade 2 is operator dependent and partial view is not well defined. The numerical
      expression of the percentage of the glottic aperture (POGO = percentile of glottic opening)
      is another score. In this score, A POGO score of 100% accounts for full visualization of the
      larynx starting from anterior commissure to the posterior cartilage, while 0% indicated a
      complete absence of glottic opening. Previous validation studies reported on the reliability
      of POGO; however, accuracy was not evaluated.

      The use of a standard and effective classification method will facilitate and accelerate
      communication between anesthetists in difficult life-threatening situations such as difficult
      airway / difficult intubation / difficult ventilation and contribute to patient safety. The
      use of common terminology can also facilitate the evaluation of the performance of intubation
      tools. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and intra and inter rater
      reliability of the POGO score

      Reviewer anesthesiologist will be asked to score still images of laryngeal views, which will
      be obtained from patients requiring intubation for general anesthesia, after obtaining
      written informed consent. The images of the larynx will be captured first with the Macintosh
      blade and thereafter with the D blade. An expert panel will score these images with the
      Cormack Lehane and POGO scores. The set of images will be prepared from patients with both
      difficult and normal airway anatomy. Some images in the series will be repeated to assess
      intra rater variability. The anesthesiologist will be asked to rate 20 images both with the
      CL and POGO scores. The experience of the raters in airway management, their experience with
      videolaryngoscopy and scoring systems used currently when documenting videolaryngoscopy and
      demographic data will be also obtained. The POGO scores of the participants and investigators
      will be compared. The primary outcome measure was the reviewer's agreement with the correct
      POGO scores (accuracy).
