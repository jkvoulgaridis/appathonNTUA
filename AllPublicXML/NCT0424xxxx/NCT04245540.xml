  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single arm, open-label trial evaluating safety and tolerability of encapsulated Tabebuia
      avellanedae in 12 generally healthy women aged 18-45 with primary dysmenorrhea (PDM). This
      will be the first study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Tabebuia avellanedae in
      PDM. We also aim to collect proof-of-concept mechanistic data supporting the hypothesis that
      Tabebuia avellanedae reduces PGE2 concentration in vivo in women with PDM.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label trial evaluating safety and tolerability of 1,050 mg/day of
      encapsulated Tabebuia avellanedae every day for 2 months, as well as effects of the treatment
      on quality of life, pain intensity, and pain interference, in 12 generally healthy women aged
      18-45 with PDM. Outcomes of this study include questionnaires to evaluate: safety and
      tolerability using standardized adverse events scales (primary); participant reported
      measurements of quality of life, pain intensity, and pain interference around menses
      collected on validated instruments (secondary); and blood concentration of PGE2 and
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (tertiary). The protocol followed the SPIRIT guidelines
      and fulfilled the SPIRIT checklist.

PT and PTT will be combined to calculate the International Normalized Ratio (INR). INR is a calculation based on PT and PTT that measures the ability to form blood clots. INR values are dimensionless and will be reported numerically. A value less than 2.0 is considered normal. Any values of 2.0 or greater are considered abnormal and will result in exclusion from the study. If 25% or more of the study participants have INR values of 2.0 or greater at any point during the study period, the study will end and all participants will be withdrawn.

Systolic pressure will be assessed during the study period. Reported as: hypotension (less than 90 mmHg), normal blood pressure (90-139 mmHg), or hypertension (140 or greater mmHg). 2 consecutive readings of hypotension or hypertension will results in withdrawal from the study. Readings of systolic blood pressure from participants who complete the study will be reported in a table showing both systolic and diastolic readings at each time point assessed (4 weeks and 8 weeks).</description>

    <description>hs-CRP measures tissue inflammation and injury. This measure is used in standard cardiac practices to assess risk of cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and injury. This value is reported as milligrams per liter (mg/L). A value of less than 3 mg/L indicates average risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation and a value of 3 mg/L or greater indicates an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation. This will be reported as &quot;Number of participants with normal risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation,&quot; &quot;Number of participants with higher risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation,&quot; &quot;Change in number of participants with higher risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation to lower risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation,&quot; and &quot;Change in number of participants with normal risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation to higher risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation, reported as a percentage.&quot;</description>

    <description>Prostaglandins are a group of hormone-like substances that act as a principal mediator of inflammation in diseases and in menstruation. Changes in the level of prostaglandins directly correlate with the amount of pain that may be subjectively experienced. The normal range of this value is 200-400 picograms per milliliter (pg/mL). This will be reported as: &quot;Number of participants with normal prostaglandin levels,&quot; &quot;Number of participants with elevated prostaglandin levels,&quot; &quot;Number of participants with decreased prostaglandin values,&quot; &quot;Number of participants whose prostaglandin levels decreased,&quot; and &quot;Number of participants whose prostaglandin levels increased.&quot;</description>
