      The investigators are testing two models of support for pregnant women with an opioid use
      disorder (OUD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a cluster randomized clinical trial to compare the
      effectiveness of two models of support for reproductive health clinicians to provide care for
      pregnant and postpartum women with an OUD: 1) a collaborative care (CC) approach based upon
      the Massachusetts Office-Based-Opioid Treatment (OBOT) Model that would provide onsite
      training, and support to providers and participants through the use of care managers (CMs) vs
      2) a telesupport approach modeled on the Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes
      (ECHO), a remote education model that provides mentorship and guided practice and
      participation in a learning community, via video conferencing.

    <description>The CC team includes an obstetrical provider and a nursing case manager. The obstetrician will see all participants, initially to discuss preferences for addiction treatment, buprenorphine, methadone (MAT) or no MAT. The obstetrician will see participants every 1-2 weeks, as needed and will provide prenatal care. The care team will meet at least monthly and review the participants' status. For research purposes, the CM will obtain informed consent, collect and enter results of the urine drug screen (UDS) into a database. At enrollment and at 26 and 34 weeks' gestation the care manager will ask participants to complete an assessment battery of self-reported measures.</description>

    <description>ECHO is a remote education model that provides mentorship and guided practice and participation in a learning community, via video conferencing. The practice members who participate in ECHO will include obstetricians and nurses as well as other members of the care team who wish to join. Providers are given access to a password-protected website containing the recorded sessions, a discussion board, and resource library. CME credits are available for each session and can motivate providers to attend.</description>

    <description>The sites randomized to CC will have 4-6 on-site support visits at the outset of the study. These visits will occur during the first 3 months of the project. During these visits, study staff will again review buprenorphine induction procedures (heretofore referred to as &quot;initiation&quot; rather than &quot;induction&quot;) and dosing of buprenorphine as well as therapeutic behavioral treatments. The investigators will provide the center with forms and educational materials as well as an &quot;app&quot; that can be run to help dosing during initiation procedures. At the same time, the investigators will teach obstetricians, nurses and support staff the principles of motivational interviewing. The investigators will set up visits for the CM to meet with a recovery coach trainer provided by the investigators' community partner.</description>

    <description>The Weitzman Institute (WI), a community partner and provider for the ECHO condition, is a research and innovation center focused on improving care for medically underserved and special populations. Since 2013, CHCI/WI has provided education and technical assistance through an established video conference and online learning platforms to over 800 primary care providers and over 200 care team members who treat patients with chronic pain and opioid addiction. WI partners with national experts in pain care, substance abuse disorder, and MAT to create and deliver a robust training program for clinicians across the country through Project ECHO Â®. The WI will work with the study team to develop and staff the sessions.</description>
