  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder is characterized by widespread neurocognitive impairments, however
      despite substantial advances in the intervention and treatment of alcohol use disorders,
      exceptionally few studies have been directed to improving these deficits. This project
      leverages computerized cognitive training, applied as an adjunct to inpatient treatment, to
      enhance neurocognitive recovery. This project informs public health and future intervention
      efforts by interrogating factors critical to intervention efficacy and clarifying
      relationships between neurocognitive recovery and treatment outcomes, including
      post-discharge alcohol consumption.

    <textblock>
      Programmatic investigation of neurocognitive functioning in alcohol use disorder (AUD) has
      revealed widespread and sustained impairments. Despite conceptual relevance to treatment
      efficacy, few AUD interventions have been directed to the remediation of these impairments.
      This project is responsive to this gap. It will answer critical questions regarding the
      potential of cognitive training (CT), applied as an adjunct to inpatient treatment, to
      improve cognitive recovery and post-discharge functional outcomes in AUD.

      The current project will investigate the efficacy of two experimental cognitive training
      interventions in a sample of inpatients in treatment for AUD. While the effectiveness of CT
      to enhance function is supported by diverse literatures, it remains largely unexamined in
      AUD. The current project will interrogate the degree to which cognitive training
      interventions can &quot;transfer&quot; cognitive gains to untrained tasks/domains, and improve overall
      executive functioning. It will apply conceptual models from the CT and alcohol literatures to
      identify factors associated with CT efficacy. The impact of cognitive training on functional
      outcomes, including post-discharge drinking, will be investigated. Finally, relationships
      between cognitive recovery during treatment and post-discharge adaptation will be examined.
      Thus, the current work will be of substantial import to public health, alcohol science, and
      will inform future intervention efforts.
