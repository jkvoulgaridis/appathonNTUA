  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol is the common precipitating factor for both cirrhosis of liver as well as alcohol
      related chronic pancreatitis. However, in real life clinical setting, clinicians do not
      frequently see many cases of symptomatic pancreatitis in patients who present with features
      of cirrhosis of liver. On the contrary, in some patients presenting with alcohol related
      chronic pancreatitis, evidence of cirrhosis of liver is observed on imaging without other
      clinical features of cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data on exact incidence of chronic pancreatitis in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis is
      scarce and there are no data to support or refute as to whether the incidence is same between
      alcoholic cirrhosis or cirrhosis due to any other cause. The co-existence of cirrhosis and
      chronic pancreatitis in alcoholics vary between 0.04 - 6%.

      However, till now no study has been conducted to evaluate the incidence of CP in patients
      with alcoholic cirrhosis of liver. In this study, the investigators propose to assess the
      incidence of chronic pancreatitis in patients of ethanol related cirrhosis of liver and
      compare the same with patients of cryptogenic liver cirrhosis and hepatitis B and C related
      liver cirrhosis. This would be one of the few studies till date, to use EUS as the diagnostic
      modality.

      The patients of cirrhosis would be categorized based on their Child Pugh criteria into three
      categories. All these patients would undergo EUS at the Institute and chronic pancreatitis
      screening would be considered positive if they fulfill the Rosemont criteria for chronic
      pancreatitis.
