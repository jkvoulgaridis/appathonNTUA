  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a consistent approach to prevent falls with injury in
      nursing home (NH) residents. A centralized Injury Liaison Service (ILS) will be developed and
      tested in four nursing home facilities (two in the Durham, North Carolina area and two in the
      Boston, Massachusetts area). The ILS will combine successful elements of a Fracture Liaison
      Service (FLS) and video telehealth staff education (ECHO) models with the goal of decreasing
      injurious falls in nursing home residents.

      The ILS Program has four main components:

        1. Automated identification of NH residents at high risk for falls with injury

        2. Recommendations by the ILS nurse to manage medications, including deprescribing
           medications associated with falls and a prescription for osteoporosis medications

        3. Video telehealth sessions to educate staff

        4. Shared decision making with residents and/or families.

      The central hypothesis of this study is that the ILS model will reduce injurious falls by
      changing care delivery in two areas: deprescribing psychoactive and cardiometabolic drugs to
      reduce falls, and increasing osteoporosis treatment to prevent injury in the setting of a
      fall.

      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with nursing home staff to gain a better
      understanding of effective and non-effective injury prevention strategies. Information from
      these interviews will be incorporated into the study design. Outcome measures will focus on
      acceptability, demand, practicality, and feasibility of the program, as well as safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Facility inclusion criteria:

          1. More than 80 long-stay beds

          2. Within 30 miles of Boston or Durham, NC

        Resident inclusion criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 60 years

          2. NH length of stay ≥ 30 days

          3. Estimated 2-year risk of hip fracture ≥ 6% using FRAiL model

        Provider inclusion criteria:

        The NH-PRIDE intervention will target the &quot;usual&quot; providers including nurses, certified

        for the qualitative interviews on injurious falls prevention, 20 providers (4 from each
        facility) in the televideo sessions, and 60 providers (15 per facility) to participate in
        the post-intervention questionnaires.

        Additional eligibility criteria for providers include:

          1. Worked in the facility for ≥ 90 days

          2. Does not speak English

          3. Is less than 21 years old

        Resident exclusion criteria:

          1. Advanced dementia as defined by Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) = 6

             the study based on any specific diagnosis (e.g., congestive heart failure or
             schizophrenia); however, the algorithm used to make recommendations for medication
             management will consider individual co-morbidities.
