  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly nine-in-ten Americans overconsume salt. Black individuals are more prone to
      salt-sensitive hypertension. The central goal of the study is to determine if dietary sodium
      influences blood vessel function and nervous system regulation of blood pressure
      differentially in black, compared to white individuals. These findings may help to explain
      why high dietary salt causes increases in blood pressure more frequently in black, compared
      to white individuals. A secondary goal of this project is to also determine the role of
      lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, and nutrition) on potential baseline
      racial differences in cardiovascular function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study racial differences in cardiovascular responses to high dietary
      sodium. An overwhelming majority of Americans consume more dietary sodium than what is
      recommended by the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The
      investigators recently published data demonstrating that compared to white individuals, 1)
      black individuals have augmented increases in serum sodium concentration to a hypertonic
      saline infusion; and 2) exhibit higher blood pressure for a given serum sodium. In this
      proposal, the investigators will translate these findings by comprehensively assessing
      neurovascular responses to acute (single meal) high dietary sodium. The central hypothesis is
      that high dietary sodium influences sympathetic nerve activity similarly in black and white
      individuals; however, diminished vasodilator capacity and augmented sympathetic transduction
      (vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve bursts) contribute to exaggerated blood
      pressure dysregulation in black individuals. The investigators will also determine the role
      of lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, and nutrition) on potential baseline
      racial differences in cardiovascular function.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and sympathetic transduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one hour after soup, both conditions (high- and low-salt)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will directly record MSNA using an active tungsten microelectrode inserted into a nerve near the fibular head or popliteal fossa using standard microneurography techniques. The raw signal will be amplified, band-pass filtered, rectified, and integrated using a nerve traffic analyzer. The presence of MSNA will be confirmed by a pulse-synchronous signal that responds to an end-expiratory breath-hold and stimulation of muscle (tendon tapping), but not skin afferents (gentle skin stroke and/or startle stimulus). MSNA will be expressed as bursts per minute and per 100 cardiac cycles. Further, the investigators will measure common femoral artery blood flow using ultrasound and mean arterial pressure using photoplethysmography. This will allow determination of sympathetic transduction (the vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of MSNA) expressed as changes in blood pressure (mmHg) or changes in vascular conductance (ml blood flow/mmHg).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in flow-mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before, 30 minutes, and one hour after soup, both conditions (high- and low- salt)</time_frame>
    <description>Flow-mediated vasodilation will be assessed using continuous measures of brachial artery diameter and velocity via duplex Doppler ultrasound (Hitachi Arietta 70). The brachial artery will be imaged in the longitudinal plane proximal to the medial epicondyle using a high-frequency (6-12 MHz) linear-array probe. The ultrasound probe will be stabilized using a custom-built clamp. Shear rate (sec-1) will be calculated as [(blood flow velocity (cm*s-1) *4)/blood vessel diameter (mm)] The image will be recorded throughout a 60-s baseline, a 300-s ischemic stimulus (250 mmHg), and 180 seconds post deflation. FMD will be expressed as % dilation (final diameter-baseline diameter/baseline diameter x 100) and also normalized to the shear stimulus. Allometric scaling will be used if appropriate, including if there are baseline differences in artery diameter by race or condition.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in indices of arterial stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Before 30 minutes, and one hour after soup, both conditions (high- and low- salt)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the SphygmoCor XCEL system to assess pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV). A high-fidelity strain-gauge transducer is used to obtain the pressure waveform at the carotid and radial pulse. Distances from the carotid artery sampling site to the femoral artery (upper leg instrumented with a thigh cuff for oscillometric sphygmomanometry), and from the carotid artery to the suprasternal notch will be recorded. The investigators will also assess forward and reflective wave magnitudes. PWV will be expressed as cm/s and PWA will be expressed as % (calculated as augmentation pressure divided by the pulse pressure).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in blood pressure reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one hour after soup, both conditions (high- and low- salt)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure systolic and diastolic pressure using photoplethysmography at the finger. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be assessed at rest and during handgrip exercise. Blood pressure reactivity will be expressed as a change in pressure (mmHg) from baseline to a predetermined time during the stressor (e.g., minute one average and minute two average).</description>
