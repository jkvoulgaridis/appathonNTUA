      The study will be conducted in parallel at three sites: the Clinic for Aging, Anxiety and
      Mood Disorders (CAAM) at Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute (CU/NYSPI),
      the Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience Center at Stony Brook University Medical
      Center (SBUMC), and the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at
      Mount Sinai (MSSM). The following procedures will be approved by the local Institutional
      Review Boards (IRBs) at each site, where the site PIs (Bret Rutherford, MD at CU/NYSPI, David
      Hsu, PhD at SBUMC, and James Murrough, MD at MSSM) will be responsible for overseeing conduct
      of the study at their respective site. Dr. Jonathan Javitch is the scientific leader of this
      program and holds the IND for tianeptine use in this study.

      Investigators will recruit 75 participants with current unipolar MDD, non-delusional, between
      21-50, who have failed at least 2 two adequate treatment trials with a standard
      antidepressant. Patients will receive an 8-week treatment trial of tianeptine. Patients will
      also undergo structural and task-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that will be
      performed under Dr. Hsu's direction at SBUMC in order to maintain the internal validity of
      the data set. Approval has been granted for use of the MRI facility for this study by the
      Director of the Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN) Center at Stony Brook
      University. CU/NYSPI and MSSM subjects will be transported to SBUMC to complete neuroimaging
      procedures as described below. Participants will be screened for MRI clearance during their
      screening visit and again at SBUMC on the day of the scan. Subjects will be asked MRI
      screening questions to ensure that are scanning eligible. Participants will also have
      additional tubes of blood drawn for human whole-genomic testing. This microarray will be used
      to identify regions of the human genome that contribute to disease susceptibility and
      phenotypes. The Illumina human whole-genome array will be used to provide a comprehensive
      view of the genome, detects single nucleotide polymorphisms and other variations across the
      genome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability in adults worldwide (~16M
      patients in United States alone). Unfortunately, only 35-40% of patients achieve full
      remission following first-line treatment and treatment-resistant depression (TRD), failure to
      respond to 2 or more treatments, is a critical clinical problem. As with MDD, there is
      mechanistic heterogeneity in TRD and consequently, there is a need to develop treatments
      targeted to biologically distinct subgroups of patients. Significant evidence suggests

      dysfunction of endogenous opioid signaling pathways as a key biological deficit in some MDD
      patients. Investigators hypothesize that a subgroup of MDD patients with deficient opioid
      receptor signaling who have failed previous trials of antidepressants will better respond to
      pharmacological interventions specifically targeting this biological mechanism.

      In this application, Investigators propose to target the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) in TRD
      patients by using the antidepressant tianeptine. Although not available in the United States,
      Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant that has been used clinically in Europe, Asia, and
      South America since the late 1980s in millions of patients. Until recently tianeptine's
      molecular mechanism of action had remained unknown. Tianeptine is a different type of
      antidepressant than those currently approved in the United States in that it has a different
      mechanism of action than other antidepressants. Tianeptine is an opioid antagonist; it binds
      at the mu-opioid receptor. Currently approved antidepressants act on other systems of the
      brain that primarily affect serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Work in our laboratories
      has shown that tianeptine acts as a selective agonist of MOR, signaling in a manner analogous
      to enkephalins and endorphins, the endogenous opioid peptides. The investigator applied for
      and received an IND to import and use tianeptine for this study (IND application and approval
      letter are attached to this submission).

      The study will be conducted in parallel at three sites: the Clinic for Aging, Anxiety and
      Mood Disorders (CAAM) at Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute (CU/NYSPI),
      the Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience Center at Stony Brook University Medical
      Center (SBUMC), and the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at
      Mount Sinai (MSSM). The following procedures will be approved by the local Institutional
      Review Boards (IRBs) at each site, where the site PIs (Bret Rutherford, MD at CU/NYSPI, David
      Hsu, Ph.D. at SBUMC, and James Murrough, MD at MSSM) will be responsible for overseeing
      conduct of the study at their respective site. Dr. Jonathan Javitch is the scientific leader
      of this program and holds the IND for tianeptine use in this study.

      Investigators will recruit 75 participants with current unipolar MDD, non-delusional, between
      21-50, who have failed at least 2 two adequate treatment trials with a standard
      antidepressant. Patients will receive an 8-week treatment trial of tianeptine. Patients will
      also undergo structural and task-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that will be
      performed under Dr. Hsu's direction at SBUMC in order to maintain the internal validity of

      phenotypes. The Illumina human whole-genome array will be used to provide a comprehensive
      view of the genome, detects single nucleotide polymorphisms and other variations across the
      genome.

      The major goals of this project are (1) to determine if tianeptine is an effective
      antidepressant in patients who have failed two previous trials, (2) to define the
      relationship between opioid signaling deficits and response to tianeptine treatment, (3) to
      develop a comprehensive assessment battery capable of identifying endogenous opioid signaling
      deficits to explore biological heterogeneity in the TRD population.

    <description>Our target is depressive symptomatology as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The HRSD is a 24-item questionnaire used as an indication of depression and a guide to evaluate recovery. Total scores range from 0-74, not including atypical symptoms sub-scale. A score of 16 or above is typically considered to indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. Higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>

    <description>At baseline, and following 8 weeks of treatment with tianeptine(12.5 mg, 3x daily), participants will be assessed in a number of procedures to evaluate their emotional and physical pain state and pain stimulus response and the relationship of such states/responses to endogenous opioid signaling. To further assess emotional pain, participants will also undergo fMRI while performing a validated social rejection and social acceptance paradigm known to induce endogenous opioid release in control subjects and blunted release in MDD. Examining both rejection and acceptance is important because the MOR system regulates both social distress and social reward in animals and humans, and tianeptine may also act on abnormal MOR-mediated responses to social acceptance in MDD. Likewise, a second fMRI scan will be used to explore physical pain response using an established thermal pain sensitivity task.</description>
