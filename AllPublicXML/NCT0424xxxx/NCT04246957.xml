  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hair loss is a frequent cause of patient consultation in dermatology. It is known to have a
      strong impact on patients' quality of life for many reasons; such as esthetic aspect,
      financial implications, social consequences. Numerous studies have assessed the impact of
      some types of alopecia on patients' quality of life. One study compared the quality of life
      in patients with scarring alopecia with patients of non-scarring alopecia. No studies have
      compared quality of life between the different types of scarring alopecia nor different types
      of non-scarring alopecia. However, none have assessed the impact on the patient partner
      quality of life. In addition, few treatments for alopecia are covered by national health
      insurance in France. The main objective is to compare the impact on the quality of life in
      different types of alopecia. By using the average scores of the questionnaire Dermatology
      Life Quality Index (DLQI) for each type of alopecia.

    <description>The Dermatology life Quality Index (DLQI) is a ten-question questionnaire used to measure the impact of skin disease on the quality of life of an affected person. It is designed for people aged 16 years and above. There are 10 questions, covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, treatment. Each question refers to the impact of the skin disease on the patient's life over the previous week. Each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range form 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).</description>
