  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First-in-Human, open-label, sequential dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of
      KD033 in adult subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The main purpose of this
      study is to test KD033 at different dose levels to see if it is safe and well tolerated when
      given once every 2 weeks. Additional purposes of the study are to find out whether the study
      drug has anti-cancer effects and how the study drug is processed by the body.
