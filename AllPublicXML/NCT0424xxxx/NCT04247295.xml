  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators project is a randomised controlled trial that will compare the efficacy of
      the traditional casting method against the woodcast splint in distal radial fracture. After
      the investigators have taken consent and the patients have agreed to be a part of the
      project, the investigators will randomly divide the participants into two groups. One with
      the traditional cast and one with the wood cast. The difference will be measured by using the
      EQ-5D-Y tool alongside the use of the DASH score and our own questionnaire.

      The study will take place over the following year with the Sheffield Children's Hospital
      being the only site involved. Woodcast products have the CE declaration of conformity which
      is covered for the use in children, and apart from the type of cast the child is given, the
      course of treatment is the same for both group

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distal radial fractures are a very common fracture. Without good plaster immobilisation these
      fractures are prone to slipping. As a result, patients may end up with surgical treatment
      which would otherwise not be needed if the plaster were to hold the fracture position
      adequately. If one was shown to be better compared to the other, then all hospitals could
      start to use a more effective treatment.

      With traditional casting, some of the details of the fracture are missed due to the shadowing
      on the x-ray. The woodcast aims to reduce this shadowing, allowing a more detailed image of
      the fracture and hopefully a better outcome. Problems may arise with the plaster cast, at one
      or two week scans, in which the cast may need to be removed for imaging, this could lead to
      displacement of the fracture effecting the outcome. Woodcast would potentially not need to be
      removed or is easily removed due to the fact that it is not a complete cast and so would
      hopefully improve the outcomes for the patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children between the ages of 3 and 16 that present with a distal radial fracture.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with underlying physical and learning disabilities.

          -  Patients with significant co-morbidities that would put the patient at risk of extra
             distress.

          -  Pathological fractures for instance Osteogenesis Imperfecta, metabolic bone diseases
             etc...

          -  Patients who aren't fluent in English as we only have questionnaires available in
             English.
