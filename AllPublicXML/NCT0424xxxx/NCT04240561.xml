  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This current translational project, funded by NIH, aims to better understand the impact of
      various signal modification strategies for older adults with Alzheimer's dementia and its
      potential precursor, known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The investigators
      hypothesize that adults with Alzheimer's dementia represent an extreme case of restricted
      cognitive ability, such that very low working memory capacity and overall reduced cognitive
      capacity will limit benefit from advanced signal processing. Thus, the investigators
      hypothesize that adults with Alzheimer's dementia will receive greater benefit from
      acoustically simple, high-fidelity hearing aid processing that minimally alters the acoustic
      signal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the advanced signal-processing algorithms used in digital hearing aids have improved
      average hearing aid benefit and satisfaction, benefit is still highly variable between
      individual patients, with some individuals reporting much greater benefit than others. The
      standard approach to selecting signal processing does not consider individual auditory and
      cognitive differences and how these may be affected by different levels of advanced signal
      processing. Data provided by the parent grant, R01 DC0012289, indicate that adults with low
      working memory capacity (a cognitive skill describing ability to process and store
      information), more hearing loss and/or advanced age receive limited benefit from hearing aid
      signal processing that substantially modifies the original speech signal. The long term goal
      of the investigator's research is to optimize choice of signal processing based on individual
      auditory and cognitive abilities.

      The investigators will measure patient outcomes in response to two hearing aid signal
      processing strategies that represent two clinically common but very different approaches,
      which differ in the extent of their signal modification. Commercially available hearing aids
      will be used for this study. The primary patient outcomes for this project are an
      individual's speech intelligibility and conversation analysis in aided and unaided
      conditions. Conversation Analysis quantifies conversation breakdowns and repair behaviors as
      a function of hearing aid signal manipulations and communication partner perceptions of
      conversation difficulty. Outcome measures will take place after 3-5 weeks of use of each
      signal modification strategy. The flexibility in timing is to accommodate the scheduling
      needs of individual participants.

    <masking_description>Participants are randomly assigned to Hearing Aid fitting order A or B. One group will have the higher level of signal manipulation for the first session while the other group will start with the lower level of signal manipulation. Each group will then be given the other signal manipulation strategy. Outcome data will be collected by individuals blinded to which signal modification strategy the participant is using.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to final appointment ineach hearing aid condition will be assessed. Participants will take an unaided baseline at the start of the trial. Measure will be repeated at the end of each intervention (3-5 weeks after each fitting).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will listen to and repeat recorded low-context sentences presented at conversational level at varying levels of background noise. Scoring is determined by percentage of key words in each sentence a participant is able to hear and correctly repeat back to the tester. Scores may range from 0 to 100% and a higher score indicates better understanding (i.e. a better outcome).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to final appointment in each hearing aid condition will be assessed. Participants will take an unaided baseline at the start of the trial. Measure will be repeated at the end of each intervention (3-5 weeks after each fitting).</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be extracted from conversation samples recorded between person with cognitive impairment and caregiver participants during a mealtime. Conversations will be audio recorded, transcribed ortho graphically and annotated for conversation breakdowns and repairs using Trouble-Source-Repair conventions grounded in Conversation Analysis approaches. Units of measure are: 1)Proportion of problematic talk 2) Proportion of trouble sources 3) Proportion of unsuccessful repairs and 4)Proportion of complex repairs. Reductions in all 4 reflect a positive change.</description>
