      This experiment will consist of a total of four visits. The testing process will consist of a
      series of castings, surveys, data collection, and outcome testing that includes both
      endurance and aerobic exercises while wearing the check sockets of varying tension values.
      The outcome measures will be performed in the Nichol Hall Motion Capture Lab.

        -  The participants will sign consent forms and three casts will be taken on the first
           visit.

        -  The second visit will consist of fitting test socket A, which includes socket
           adjustments and the dynamic alignment. Once the socket is properly fit on the subject,
           we will begin their three trials (with two to three minute breaks in between trials) of
           the Time Up and Go assessment (TUG) followed by the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire
           (PEQ) survey.

        -  Visit three will be comprised of socket B fitting, alignment, and testing. The subjects
           will proceed with the same procedure as stated in visit two. Following the outcome
           measures, participants will take the PEQ survey for socket B.

        -  Visit four is the final visit of testing and data collection. Socket C will be presented
           to the subject and they will go through the same dynamic alignment process and outcome
           testing as the previous visits. Once finished, the subjects will take the final PEQ
           survey on socket C and receive their compensation.

    <description>This assessment requires a standard armchair, a stopwatch, and a walkway clearly marked at 10 feet. The participant will be instructed to begin to walk on the word &quot;Go&quot;. Promptly, the participant will stand up from the armchair, walk to the line on the floor at a normal pace, turn, then walk back to chair at their selected pace, and sit down again. Due to the fact that the participant will have to do this task three time they will be given a two to three minute resting period in between trials.</description>

    <description>To eliminate variables while casting the student investigators will be using a system very similar to that of Ossur's ICEX, developed in Reykjavik, Iceland. The ICEX system uses an air bladder system that allows a socket to be constructed directly onto the residuum; resulting in even pressure distribution during the time of casting. The ICEX system will ensure that the student investigators are obtaining consistent socket pressures and that the team will be precisely testing the distraction values on the multiple sockets obtained in this experiment. During this experiment, the researchers will be using a modified air bladder system.</description>
