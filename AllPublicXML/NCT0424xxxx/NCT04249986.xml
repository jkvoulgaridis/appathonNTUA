  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Backpacking is an increasingly popular outdoor recreational activity. The base pack weight
      (BPW) includes gear that is not consumed or worn on the body: shelter, sleep system,
      weather-proofing layers and personal gear to ensure a degree of comfort and safety. As such,
      reducing BPW is one of the most important tasks a backpacker manages when preparing for a
      trip. Available recommendations for ideal BPW are currently inconsistent, lack clear
      parameters, and rely on anecdotal evidence. The study aims to collect field data on perceived
      exertion and heart rate (HR) in relation to BPW during a day-long interval of hiking. Such
      findings can have implications on the cost and safety profiles extending from recreational
      backpacking to military and wilderness rescue operations.

    <description>Participants will be randomized to both 17 and 19 pounds for the first hike and the alternate condition for the second hike. A random number generator will create 1 block that includes 10 participants in each block to ensure comparable numbers to subjects starting at different base backpack weight. Participants assignments will then be included in a sealed manila envelopes.</description>
