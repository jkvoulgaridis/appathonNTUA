  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With MRI's increasing role in detecting central nervous system and orthopedic diseases,
      patients with ischemic history are increasingly referred for MRI exams. Currently, 3-lead ECG
      gating systems are utilized during cardiac MRI scanning as standard of care. However, this
      monitoring system is often insufficient to evaluate for the development of important
      arrhythmias or ischemia during MRI scanning. Morevoer, MRI associated magnetic fields and
      radio frequency pulses can produce interference in the ECG signal that leads to
      non-diagnostic ECG signals. MiRTLE Medical, a Massachusetts-based medical device company, has
      developed a high-fidelity, MRI-conditional 12-lead ECG monitoring system. This 12-lead ECG
      system is a first of its kind that addresses the MRI-induced interference and safety issues.
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of this 12-lead ECG system in the clinical setting.
      The investigators hope that this system will be helpful for image-guided therapeutics
      especially electrophysiology.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will aim to recruit 2-3 patients per month, with a total of 40 patients over two years. These 40 patients will be assigned into two MRI groups -12-lead ECG gating system as the study group and 3-lead ECG gating system as the control group. The study group patients will have MRI with 12-lead ECG monitoring device produced by a Massachusetts-based medical device company MiRTLE Medical, while the control group will have MRI with 3-lead ECG gating which is standard of care. Diagnostic image quality and severity of artifact will be evaluated to compare these two groups.</intervention_model_description>
