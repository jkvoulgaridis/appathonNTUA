  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether disconnecting pulmonary vagus nerve branch
      can abatement chronic cough in patients undergoing unilateral thoracoscopic
      lobectomy,compared with preserving pulmonary vagus nerve branch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screened for the Inclusion criteria and the exclusion criteria,254patients undergoing
      unilateral thoracoscopic lobectomy are randomly assigned to two groups,disconnecting
      pulmonary vague nerve branches(D)and preserve pulmonary vague nerve branches(P).The surgeons
      find the vagus nerve pulmonary branch leading to the hilum and count the number of branches
      on all patients included.The incidence of chronic cough after surgery are compared between
      groups.

    <description>When the operation is in the right side, the Azygous vein bow is used as the marker, and in the left side, the aortic arch is used as the marker to identify the vagus nerve trunk.Then the surgeons dissect the vagus nerve trunk. This is used as a clue to find the vagus nerve pulmonary branch leading to the hilum. The position of the detachment is after the anterior and posterior pulmonary branches of the vagus nerve separating from the trunk and before the formation of the lung plexus.</description>
