      Objectives- To compare changes in labour-associated maternal and fetal hormone levels during
      breast stimulation, balloon induction and spontaneous labour. To compare efficacy and safety
      of labour induction methods in women with previous caesarean section.

      Design- Participants were randomized to undergo induction of labour by breast stimulation or
      intracervical balloon compared to spontaneous labour (controls).

      Setting- A single tertiary hospital Population- women at term, with previous caesarean
      section

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal serum levels of oxytocin, prostaglandin F2α, prostaglandin E2, prolactin, estradiol
      and cortisol levels were analyzed at 0, 3 and 6 hours post induction initiation, including
      the two groups catheter balloon and breast stimulation and controls in spontaneous labor.
      Fetal umbilical cord hormones were measured in the three mentioned above groups. Clinical
      outcomes were documented in the two induction groups.
