             range of 45 to 90 bpm

             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 30 days (or 5
             half-lives (whichever longer)) of planned administration of investigational drug in
             the current trial, or concurrent participation in another clinical trial in which
             investigational drug is administered

          -  Smoker of more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day

             repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males or repeatedly greater than 470 ms in females)
             or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study
