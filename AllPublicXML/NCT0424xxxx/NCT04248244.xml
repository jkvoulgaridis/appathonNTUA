  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a common type of cancer involving the cells in the blood (commonly
      affecting bones, kidneys and blood). Although it remains incurable, MM has become a highly
      treatable form cancer thanks to new and improved treatment modalities. As patients deal with
      this disease, they often suffer from multiple symptoms that are caused by both the disease
      itself and the different drugs used to treat it. Research has shown that the most common
      symptoms patients suffer from include pain, constipation, tiredness, tingling in hands and
      feet, breathlessness, sadness and difficulty remembering things. These symptoms may
      negatively affect the quality of life of patients.

      Palliative care (PC) is a type of treatment aimed at relieving symptoms and promoting the
      most optimal quality of life (QOL) for patients and their caregivers. Research has shown that
      patients with certain types of cancers, such as colon cancer and lung cancer, do better if
      they are seen by a PC provider early in the course of their disease. This study seeks to
      determine the effects of early PC involvement on participants with newly diagnosed MM

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with a prospective cohort design, and based in the outpatient or
      ambulatory care setting. Each participant will be followed for 12 months.

      Twenty eligible patients will be enrolled, and within eight weeks of diagnosis. Patients will
      meet with a member of the outpatient PC team, which consists of board-certified PC
      physicians, advance practice providers and nurse care coordinators, within three weeks of
      enrollment. Additional visits may be scheduled at the discretion of participants, oncologists
      or PC providers and participants will receive routine oncologic care throughout the study
      period.

      The primary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the effects of early PC
      involvement in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic MM

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess self-reported QOL, estimate the change
      in QOL relative to baseline, estimate number of participants with self-reported symptoms of
      depression and anxiety, to determine if monthly PC visits are feasible for participants, and
      to estimate health services utilization.
