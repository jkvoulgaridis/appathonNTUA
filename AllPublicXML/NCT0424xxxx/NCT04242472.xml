  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ethiopia is one of the high burden Tuberculosis countries and Tuberculosis is still the
      leading cause of mortality due to communicable diseases in the country. Nutritional status is
      one of the predictors of TB treatment outcomes. Thus, the current practices need integration
      of nutritional intervention in the DOT using Mobile health intervention. However, to
      investigator's knowledge, there is no sufficient evidence on the effect SMS text Messaging
      Mobile Health intervention on nutritional status and TB treatment outcomes in Ethiopia.

      To ensure the quality of SMS intervention, nutritional related SMS text message will be
      developed systematically through reviewing literature, systematic reviews and guidelines and
      appropriate behavioral theories by involving experts and patients. Automated SMS will be sent
      from one computer database at the scheduled date and time. A validated questionnaire will be
      adapted and pre-tested to check for any error. Adequate sample size is calculated for both
      arms with the ratio of 1:1 allocation. Standardized Anthropometric measurement, FANTA
      Household Dietary Diversity Score and WHO TB treatment outcome classification will be used
      for assessing the outcome variables. The data collectors will be trained on the objective,
      screening of eligible participants, the procedure of data collection, and how to assure the
      quality and security of the data based on the protocol. Continuous supervision will be
      employed throughout the data collection and intervention period. The data will be collected
      electronically and will be exported to STATA for analysis. Intention to treat analysis and
      regression analysis model will be employed.
