    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the side effects and feasibility of cryoablation,
      atezolizumab, and nab-paclitaxel in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that
      has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or has spread to other places
      in the body (metastatic). Cryosurgery, also known as cryoablation or cryotherapy, kills tumor
      cells by freezing them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving cryoablation, atezolizumab and
      nab-paclitaxel may improve response to the disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of cryoablation of a primary breast tumor followed
      by PD-L1 blockade in patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast
      cancer (TNBC).

      SCONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the systemic immune response to cryoablation of a primary breast tumor and
      PD-L1 blockade.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cryoablation of the primary tumor over about 1 hour. After 2-3 weeks,
      patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15 and nab-paclitaxel IV on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-3 weeks post surgery and
      then periodically thereafter.
