  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between normal cognitive decline and
      dementia. Individuals with MCI are having an impairment in cognitive function compared with
      normal age-matched counterparts, while their cognitive function is still sufficient for their
      daily function. The prevalent rate of MCI is ranging from 10% to 20%. Patients with MCI are
      more susceptible to dementia with annual conversion rate between 5% and 20%. It is well-known
      that dementia not only lead to devastating consequences to the patients and their
      care-givers, but also immense healthcare and socioeconomic burdens. The growing prevalence of
      MCI in our rapidly aging population warrants immediate action to identify effective
      interventions to prevent progression of the cognitive impairment and its conversion to
      dementia. Currently, there is no pharmaceutical treatment proven to be effective in
      alleviating the cognitive decline in MCI patients. Nonetheless, previous researches have
      demonstrated that mind activity, physical exercise and social engagement are all have
      positive effects in alleviating the cognitive decline in MCI patients. Tai Chi is a
      traditional form of Chinese mind-body exercise that consists of both physical exercise and
      meditation component. Practicing Tai Chi can also facilitate social engagement as people
      usually practice in group. Tai Chi is expected to be more acceptable to the older adults for
      incorporating it with their daily life to preserve cognitive function, compared with
      conventional physical activity modalities (e.g., running/jogging and gym-based resistance
      training). Preliminary evidences suggest the potential of Tai Chi for alleviating cognitive
      decline in older adults.

      A randomized controlled trial is needed to conclude on the therapeutic use of Tai Chi before
      it can be large-scale implemented at community level. This study seeks to extend previous
      findings of the beneficial effects of Tai Chi on cognitive function in older adults with MCI
      and examine the impact of Tai Chi training in protecting older adults with MCI from
      developing dementia. This study also attempt to delineate the behind mechanism of Tai Chi on
      alleviating cognitive decline by including measurements in neuroimaging and blood markers.

    <measure>30-min delay recall</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-min delay recall test assesses long term memory. Ten words will be read to the participants. The participants will have to recall the 10 words after 30 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Trial making test</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function will be trial making test. The participants will be asked to connect a number of dots according to particular sequence. The time needed for the participant to connect all dots will be recorded. The shorter time the participant needed to connect all dots correctly indicate the better executive function of the participant</description>

    <measure>Stroop test</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Attention will be assessed by stroop test. During the test, participants need to read out the colour of dots or words. The time needed to correctly named all colour of dots/words will be recorded. The faster the participant finished the test indicate the better attention of the participant</description>

    <measure>Verbal fluency</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal fluency test assesses the language domain of cognitive function. Participants need to name animals/ vegetable/ fruits as much as positive in 1 minutes. The more the participant named, the better of their language ability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digit span</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Working Memory will be assessed by digit span. Digit Span Forward requires the participants to repeat numbers in the same order as read by the assessors, and Digit Span Backward requires the participants to repeat the numbers in the reverse order of that presented by the assessors.</description>
