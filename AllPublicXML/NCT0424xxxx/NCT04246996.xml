  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem after surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and
      stress urinary incontinence. This prospective, randomized, single-masked (subject),
      two-parallel armed study aims to determine the effect of a single postoperative intravesical
      instillation of 80 mg of gentamicin sulfate in 50 mL of saline versus usual care on the
      proportion of women treated for UTI within 6 weeks following surgery for pelvic organ
      prolapse (POP) or stress urinary incontinence (SUI).

    <description>At the completion of the subjects surgery but prior to awakening from anesthesia, 80mg of gentamicin in 50 mL of normal saline will be infused into the subject's bladder through the standard-of-care transurethral catheter by the surgeon. The surgeon will then clamp the catheter and label the catheter with the clamping time. The catheter will be clamped to prevent the gentamicin from immediately flowing out of the bladder and thus allow the gentamicin time to have an effect. The subject will then proceed as usual to the postoperative anesthesia care unit. A member of the subject's care team will unclamp the catheter after 1 hour. The subject will otherwise have usual pre-operative and post-operative care.</description>

    <description>If the patient is randomized to no instillation, at the end of the surgery but prior to awakening from anesthesia, the surgeon will clamp the catheter and label the catheter with the clamping time. The purpose of clamping the catheter for subjects receiving usual care will be to ensure patients are masked to study arm assignment if they wake up and notice their catheter. The subject will then proceed as usual to the postoperative anesthesia care unit. A member of the subject's care team will unclamp the catheter after 1 hour. The subject will otherwise have usual pre-operative and post-operative care.</description>
