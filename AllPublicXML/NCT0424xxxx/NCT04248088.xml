  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite scientific advances in treatment, patients with heart failure experience daily
      distressing symptoms and mortality rates are high. Although standard exercise improves
      numerous physical and psychological symptoms in heart failure patients, exercise
      participation rates are very low because of exercise barriers. Our research is aimed at
      understanding whether home-based gentle types of exercise such as yoga, delivered via
      video-conference, are beneficial in patients with heart failure. Challenging conventional
      strategies and breaking down barriers to care by testing new types of exercise delivered via
      tele-health (ipads) are urgently needed to improve the distressing symptoms that heart
      failure patients face daily.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The over-arching goal of this research is to fill the substantial gap in knowledge about
      whether gentle forms of exercise will provide health benefits in patients with heart failure
      (HF). This gap is a particularly urgent problem as the prevalence and mortality rates for HF
      are rising. While medical therapy and standard exercise programs are known to decrease HF
      mortality and improve psychological outcomes, participation rates in standard exercise are
      low. Heart failure is a severe, life-limiting medical problem that affects millions of
      Americans and is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis in patients 65 and older.
      Patients with HF experience severe, distressing symptoms such as dyspnea and depression,
      along with co-morbid conditions that make standard exercise challenging. Therefore, lighter
      types of exercise, such as gentle stretching, may be particularly appealing and lead to
      higher exercise participation rates. Gentle stretching has been shown to improve blood
      pressure, breathlessness, and mood in patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension,
      lung disease, and depression, but few studies include patients with HF. Gentle stretching is
      an adaptable exercise that can be modified for co-morbid conditions such as arthritis, or
      symptoms, such as breathlessness. Our preliminary data show that short-term stretching is
      safe and feasible.

      The goal of this study, GEtting iN To Light Exercise in Heart Failure: GENTLE-HF, is to test
      whether patients with stable HF will adhere to a long-term yoga exercise intervention,
      delivered via videoconferencing, using i-pads at home, compared to a health education group.

      We will also test whether the intervention group has improvements in physical (endurance,
      balance, flexibility, strength) and psychological (depression, quality of life and self-care)
      function and HF severity biomarkers.

      A sample of 100 adult HF patients will be recruited from the University of Virginia, Heart
      and Vascular Center Clinics and the University of California-John Muir. Yoga exercise
      participants will participate in 3 months of live, home-based, video-conference delivered,
      twice-weekly home yoga exercise classes, then 3 months of combined recorded and live exercise
      (6 months total) that enable transition to home exercise. The health education group
      participants will participate in 3 months of health education classes via ipad and then 3
      months of reminders to complete symptom diaries. If effective, yoga exercise could be
      integrated into national guidelines for cardiac rehabilitation as a standard to improve
      distressing symptoms in patients with HF.

    <description>This questionnaire screens for symptoms of depression. The 8-item questionnaire assesses self-reported negative mood (sadness, guilt), views of self (self- criticism, worthlessness), and social cognition (loneliness, interpersonal alienation) in the past week. The questionnaire uses 5 response options ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (always). Scores are summed, with higher values indicating higher risk for depression. The total raw score is converted into a T-score. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score. The final score is a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.</description>

    <measure>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire measures quality of life in people with heart failure. This questionnaire is a 23-item, self- administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. In the KCCQ, a summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. Overall scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status. There are summary scores within the KCCQ and the overall summary score is created by the mean of Physical Limitation Score, Total Symptom Score, Quality of Life Score, and Social Limitation Score.</description>

    <measure>The Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Resilience Scale is a 25-item administered questionnaire that measures an individual's ability to adapt over time to stressors in life. Scores on the summated scale range from 25 to 175, with higher scores indicating higher resilience. All of the items are positively worded. Items are measured on a 7-point scale from 1(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Responses are summed to produce a total score where a higher score indicates higher resilience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Care for Heart Failure Index Questionnaire (SCHFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Care for Heart Failure Index Questionnaire (SCHFI) is a 39-item measure of heart failure self-care. The items range from never (1) to always (5). There are 3 subscales: maintenance scale, symptom perception, confidence scale, and management scale. All of the scales are scored in the same way and a total score is not computed. Separate scores for each scale are computed separately.
In general, to standardize a scale score, 1) determine the maximum possible scale score, 2) subtract the number of items from the possible score, and 3) divide 100 by that result to identify a constant for that scale. To score the scale, sum item responses, subtract the number of items answered, and multiply by the constant.The higher the score, the greater the ability to care for heart failure symptoms within each subscale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The PROMIS Questionnaire for Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire screens for symptoms of anxiety. The 8-item questionnaire assesses self-reported fear (fearfulness, panic), anxious misery (worry, dread), hyperarousal (tension, nervousness, restlessness), and somatic symptoms related to arousal (racing heart, dizziness) in the past week. The questionnaire uses 5 response options ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question. For example, for the adult 8-item form, the lowest possible raw score is 8; the highest possible raw score is 40, with higher values indicating higher risk for anxiety. The total raw score is converted into a T-score. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score. The final score is a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. A score of 50 is the average for the United States general population.</description>

    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in the older adult. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The client self rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale.
A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The FACIT-Sp Questionnaire for Spirituality</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy/Spiritual Well- being Scale (FACIT-Sp) is a measure of the religious/spiritual (R/S) components of quality of life (QoL). The questionnaire assessed the areas of spiritual well-being: meaning, peace and faith.
Response for each item is assessed according to Likert scale 0-4 (0 - not in any event, 1 - small, 2 - somewhat, 3 - a lot, 4 - severe). The total score for each area is in the range 0-16, and total score of the whole scale is between 0 and 48. In all areas of the questionnaire higher scores indicated better quality of life, that is a spiritual well-being.</description>
