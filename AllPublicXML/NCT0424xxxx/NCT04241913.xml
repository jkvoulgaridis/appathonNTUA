  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether the intervention, Mom Power, improves the self-regulation of
      mothers with a history of trauma and their children. The central hypothesis is that the
      intervention will shift behavioral and physiological self-regulation in mothers, children,
      and dyads to mitigate psychopathology risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are significant risk factors for psychopathology across
      the lifespan - risks that extend to the next generation, likely transmitted through both
      biological and behavioral pathways. Biobehavioral self-regulation and parenting are key
      candidates for transmission and potential points of intervention. However, nearly all
      intervention research takes a one-generation approach, measuring outcomes in the individual
      adult or child in treatment. Additionally, very little research has examined biomarkers of
      self-regulation in parents or children following treatment, and no known research has
      examined these processes in parents and young children simultaneously across treatment to
      explore bidirectional effects. There is a critical need to specify targets of two-generation
      interventions among high-adversity families to decrease intergenerational transmission of
      mental illness. The objective of this RCT is to determine whether Mom Power, an
      evidence-based two generation intervention for mothers with histories of trauma, enhances
      physiological and behavioral self-regulation in mothers and young children, testing
      mechanisms and examining bidirectional effects. The central hypothesis is that the
      intervention will shift behavioral and physiological (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia)
      self-regulation in mothers, children, and dyads to mitigate psychopathology risk. Three
      specific aims are proposed: 1) Examine intervention effects on children's biobehavioral
      self-regulation and psychopathology; 2) Examine intervention effects on mothers'
      biobehavioral self-regulation, psychopathology, and parenting behavior; and 3) Examine
      intergenerational change processes, including shifts in dyadic physiological and behavioral
      synchrony as well as bidirectional influences between mother and child self-regulation.

    <time_frame>Within 6 weeks of treatment group completion; approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Child self-regulation will be assessed physiologically with RSA baseline and RSA change during a parent-child dyadic task (Skowron et al., 2013); derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) collected using Mindware Technologies ambulatory mobile recorders during 1) 2-minute resting baseline; 2) a dyadic interaction task. ECG signals will be synchronized at acquisition with video and processed offline using Mindware software; research assistants will visually inspect for missing or erroneously identified R-peaks. Using spectral analysis of interbeat intervals, high-frequency heart rate variability will be extracted to quantify RSA within frequency bandwidths associated with respiration (.15-.40 for mothers; .24-1.04 for children), processed in 1-minute epochs averaged across tasks, and log-transformed.</description>

    <description>Mom Power is a 10-week therapeutic intervention for at-risk families that incorporates elements of several evidence based practices. It combines didactic material with mindbody self-care skills and in vivo practice to improve the quality of attachment between parent and child, and to reduce the psychopathology of at-risk parents. The child team component provides each child with one-on-one care focusing on meeting the child's social-emotional needs and providing attachment-related experiences within a developmental framework.</description>
