          -  Subject is capable of moderate-intensity, intermittent exercise for 1-2 hours as
             assessed by recent training history

          -  If participating in Study Session 1, 2, 3, or 4, subject has a treadmill VO2max ≥ 42
             ml/kg/min if male or ≥ 38 ml/kg/min if female, as measured during the screening at the

             glucose (70-110 mg/dl), as measured during the screening at the GSSI laboratory

          -  If participating in Study Session 1, 2, 3, or 4, subject has a normal resting blood
             pressure (&lt; 140/90 mmHg), as measured during the screening at the GSSI laboratory

             investigator of the same sex for collection of sweat electrolytes in the whole body
             wash procedure

             to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might confound the
             interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk

          -  Subject has been enrolled into a PepsiCo-sponsored study within the past six months
