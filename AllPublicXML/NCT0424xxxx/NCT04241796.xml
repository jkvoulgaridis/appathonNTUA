  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PATHFINDER is a prospective, multi-center study in which approximately 6,200 participants
      will be enrolled. An investigational multi-cancer early detection test, developed by GRAIL,
      will be ordered by and results returned to a study investigator. In cases with a &quot;signal
      detected&quot; test result (with a predicted or indeterminate tissue of origin (TOO)), the
      diagnostic work-up will not be dictated by the protocol, but will instead be coordinated by
      the ordering and treating medical team at the enrolling sites based on the participant's
      clinical condition, recommendations by each institution's clinical practices, and in
      consultation with the study investigator and interdisciplinary care team, as necessary.
      Additionally, proposed clinical care pathways, developed based on a review of guidelines from
      the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American College of Radiology (ACR) and
      other professional organizations, should be referenced by the medical team to determine the
      diagnostic work-up. The number and types of diagnostic procedures required to achieve
      diagnostic resolution will be assessed. Performance of multi-cancer early detection test will
      be evaluated. Additionally, participant-reported outcomes will be collected at several time
      points to assess participants' perceptions about the multi-cancer early detection test.
      Participants will be followed for approximately 12 months from the time of enrollment. Cancer
      status will also be assessed at the 12 month time point.
