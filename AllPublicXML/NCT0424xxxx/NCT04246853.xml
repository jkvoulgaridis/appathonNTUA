  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) through transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely investigated in research and clinical
      settings in order to modulate brain plasticity and improve clinical pain. Interestingly,
      newly developed paradigms i.e. tDCS of the resting state motor network have proved higher
      modulatory effects in terms of corticospinal excitability when compared to traditional M1
      tDCS.

      However, little is known about the effects of tDCS on the frequency changes of alpha
      oscillations (alpha peaks).

      Interestingly, previous studies show a correlation between reduced frequencies of alpha peaks
      during 1-hour experimental pain in comparison to baseline.

      The present study aims to investigate the effects of tDCS of the resting state motor network
      on the frequency and power of alpha peaks during prolonged experimental pain during 24 hours.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that chronic pain alters the frequency of alpha peaks. Specifically, recent
      studies showed a correlation between decreased frequency of alpha peaks and perceived pain.
      Furthermore, a correlation was found between high pain sensitivity and slower alpha
      oscillations during prolonged pain during 1 hour.

      To date, the effects of prolonged experimental pain during 24 hours on brain oscillations has
      not been explored. Moreover, it is unknown whether non invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)
      through transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can revert these pain-related feature.

      It is hypothesized that prolonged pain during 24 hours will reduce the frequency of alpha
      peaks and tDCS of the resting state motor network will revert it to baseline values.

      Furthermore, it is thought that decreased frequency of alpha peaks will be correlated with
      perceived pain intensity on Day 1 (before receiving the first tDCS session).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of alpha peaks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of alpha peaks will be extracted through electroencephalography (EEG) in the sensorimotor areas (Central-Parietal) of the brain. It is hypothesized that the frequency of alpha peaks will be reduced due to prolonged pain. It is expected that tDCS of the resting state motor network will revert the frequency to baseline values or even higher.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived pain intensity will be rated in a 0-10 Numerical rating scale (NRS): 0 no pain and 10 worst pain imaginable. Prolonged pain will increase perceived pain intensity. It is expected that active tDCS will not be able to reduce perceived pain intensity in comparison to sham tDCS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Amplitude of alpha peak</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Similar to the primary outcome, the amplitude of the alpha peak will be extracted through EEG in the sensorimotor area. It is expected that prolonged pain will be able to reduce the amplitude of alpha peaks and tDCS will increase it back to baseline values or even higher.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Power of alpha oscillations</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Spectral analysis will be performed on alpha activity and it is expected that this outcome will be reduced by prolonged pain and tDCS of the resting state motor network will be able to normalize it.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Amplitude of Mu-oscillations during motor imagery</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Amplitude of Mu-oscillations will be extracted from EEG during motor imagery tasks (abduction-adduction of index finger). It is expected that prolonged pain and motor imagery will produce a desynchronization of Mu-oscillations and on the contrary active tDCS will be able to synchronize it back similar to pain-free state.</description>

    <description>The active comparator is the Active tDCS group. The active tDCS will target the resting-state motor network and will apply a distributed direct current during the whole session. (The TIME during the direct current is applied is the only difference with Sham tDCS) Each tDCS session lasts 20 minutes and applies a total current of 4mA.</description>

    <description>This study has a parallel design and 2 groups: Active tDCS and Sham tDCS. Sham tDCS applies a standard sham protocol consisting of ramping up and down during 30 seconds at the beginning and at the end of each tDCS session. Each tDCS session lasts 20 minutes and applies a total current of 4mA.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the resting state motor network</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) delivers a low intensity current of up to 4 mA per session through small and circular shaped electrodes applied over the scalp. This induces a weak but focal electrical field that may modify the excitability of the underlying cortical target in a polarity and activity dependent fashion.</description>
