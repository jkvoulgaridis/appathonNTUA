  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 will be a dose escalation study of IV ICT01 (a monoclonal antibody targeting BTN3A) as
      monotherapy in patients with advanced solid or hematologic tumors, followed by a cohort
      examining the combination of ICT01 plus an approved checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). Part 2 will
      be a cohort expansion into two solid tumor indications and one hematologic malignancy for
      ICT01 monotherapy, and one CPI-approved indication receiving ICT01 plus CPI.
