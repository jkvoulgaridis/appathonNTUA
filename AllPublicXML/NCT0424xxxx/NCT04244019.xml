  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastasis (BrM) develops in approximately 40% of cancer patients. Stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS) is a form of radiotherapy that delivers high-dose per fraction to
      individual lesions that is commonly used to treat BrM.

      Radionecrosis (RN) is an adverse event that occurs in approximately 10 - 25% of patients 6 -
      24 months after treatment with SRS. Tumour progression may also occur due to local failure of
      treatment. Radionecrosis and tumour progression share very similar clinical features
      including vomiting, nausea, and focal neurologic findings.

      Radionecrosis and tumour progression also share overlapping imaging characteristics. Due to
      their similarities, physicians need to perform a surgical resection to diagnose the
      complication. By using a hybrid FLT-PET/MRI scan, the investigators propose that this
      combination scan will provide robust data with which to differentiate between radionecrosis
      and tumour progression without the need for surgery. The investigators plan to conduct a
      single center feasibility study to investigate the potential in differentiating between SRS
      and tumour progression in patients who have previously undergone SRS for BrM who are
      suspected to have either RN or tumour progression using hybrid FLT-PET/MRI imaging.

        Patients presenting after being treated with SRS with a new intracranial lesion with
        clinical and radiographic findings suspicious for either radionecrosis or tumour

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years or older

          2. Previously treated with SRS for BrM

          3. New intracranial lesion with clinical and radiographic findings suspicious for either
             RN or tumour progression

          4. Planned surgical resection of the lesion in question. The determination that the
             lesion is appropriate for and requires surgical resection will be made by the
             multi-disciplinary brain metastasis team. The surgery date does not need to be
             established and the patient does not need to have consented in order to be eligible
             for this study, however the imaging procedure will need to occur prior to the date of
             surgery.

          5. A negative serum pregnancy test within the two-week interval immediately prior to
             PET-MRI imaging for women of child-bearing age

          6. Ability to provide written informed concern to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment volume

          2. Active malignancy other than sarcoma

          3. Inability to remain supine for at least 60 minutes

          4. Pregnancy or breast feeding

          5. Age &lt;18 years

          6. Failure to provide written informed consent

          7. Contraindication for MRI as per current institutional guidelines
