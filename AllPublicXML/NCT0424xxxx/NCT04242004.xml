  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is one of the serious complications of elderly HIV-infected
      patients. The destruction of intestinal mucosal barrier and imbalance of bacterial flora
      caused by aging and HIV infection may be an important factor promoting the occurrence of NCI.
      Therefore, it is important to understand changes in gut microbiota of HIV-infected patients
      with NCI. Higher dietary intake of the essential fatty acid docosahexaenoic (DHA) has been
      associated with better cognitive performance in several epidemiological studies. To date,
      data are limited showing that DHA administration leads to benefits for behavioral disorders
      by modulating gut microbiota composition; the few studies on this subject, mostly completed
      in animal models. Moreover，low levels of DHA have been found in HIV-infected patients. The
      effect of DHA supplementation on gut microbiota and NCI status of HIV-positive patients have
      not been evaluated yet. Investigators aim to implement a case-control study to identify the
      relationship between gut microbiota and NCI in HIV-infected patients. At the meantime,
      investigators aim to implement a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      to assess DHA supplementation in HIV-infected patients with NCI for 16 weeks. The effect of
      DHA on gut microbiota and NCI were evaluated. Also, investigators aim to identify if the
      benefits for NCI of DHA caused by modulating gut microbiota composition and metabolites.

    <description>Participants underwent neurocognitive testing using an internationally validated comprehensive neurocognitive test battery covering 7 cognitive domains: verbal fluency, speed of information processing, executive functioning, learning, memory, attention/working memory and motor skills. Demographically-corrected (age, education, gender) T scores (mean of 50, standard deviation of 10) were developed based upon an age-matched control group. Individual test deficit scores, determined via demographically-adjusted T scores, ranged from 0 (T score of &gt; 40) to 5 (T score &lt; 20). Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) was assessed using the global deficit score (GDS), calculated as the average of deficit scores across all neuropsychological test. The cut-off for NCI was a GDS score ≥ 0.5</description>

    <measure>Gut microbiota</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators characterized the 16S rDNA fecal microbiome in participants. Shannon diversity index (SDI) was used to evaluate alpha (within sample) diversity. Beta (between sample) diversity was examined using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) of unweighted Unifrac distances. Relative abundance of microbial taxa was compared between samples using Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe)</description>
