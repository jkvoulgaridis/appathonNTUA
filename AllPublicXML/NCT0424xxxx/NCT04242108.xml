  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary angle closure diseases (PACD) are commonly seen in Asia. In clinical practice,
      gonioscopy is the gold standard for angle width classification in PACD patietns. However,
      gonioscopy is a contact examination and needs a long learning curve. Anterior segment optical
      coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a non-contact test which can obtain three dimensional images
      of the anterior segment within seconds. Therefore, the investigators designed the study to
      verify if AS-OCT based deep learning algorithm is able to detect the PACD subjects diagnosed
      by gonioscopy.
