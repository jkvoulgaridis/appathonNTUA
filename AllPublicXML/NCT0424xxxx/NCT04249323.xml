  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part, first-in-human study of single ascending doses (SAD; Part 1) and multiple
      ascending doses (MAD; Part 2) of CORT113176 in healthy participants; Part 3 is an optional
      part to investigate whether CORT113176 ameliorates the effects of prednisone on various
      pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. The 3 parts may not be conducted entirely sequentially
      provided that this is justified by pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data obtained from
      completed cohorts. The first MAD cohort will not start until data are available from at least
      2 SAD levels to allow MAD administration in the fasted state, or until after a food-effect
      cohort has been dosed in the SAD phase to allow MAD administration in the fed state. The
      expected exposure for the daily MAD level at steady state (taking into consideration
      potential accumulation on repeat dosing) must not exceed the highest exposure considered to
      be safe and well tolerated during preceding SAD cohorts.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Cohorts will receive a single dose of CORT113176 lipid capsule formulation by mouth on Day 1 in a fasted or fed state. Cohort A will receive a 50-mg dose in a fasted state. Cohort B will receive a ≤3-fold increase in dose from Cohort A in a fasted state; the dose will be determined after evaluation of safety and PK data for Cohort A. Subsequent cohorts will receive a ≤3-fold increase in CORT113176 dose from the previous cohort in a fasted or fed state; the dose and prandial state will be determined after evaluation of safety and PK data from previous cohorts. Following interim review of PK data, an alternative lipidic formulation may be administered beginning with Cohort B.</description>

    <description>Cohorts will receive a single dose of placebo matching CORT113176 lipid capsule formulation by mouth on Day 1. The dose of placebo, prandial state, and choice of formulation will match that used for the corresponding SAD cohorts receiving CORT113176.</description>

    <description>Cohorts will receive once- or twice-daily doses of CORT113176 lipid capsule formulation by mouth for 14 days. The anticipated exposure will not exceed the highest exposure considered safe and well-tolerated during Part 1. The dose schedule and prandial state will be determined after evaluation of safety and PK data from Part 1. The choice of formulation of CORT113176 to be used in Part 2 will depend on data review for Part 1.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In Period 1, participants will receive a single dose of prednisone 25 mg tablet by mouth on Day 1 in a fasted or fed state. After a 7-day washout, in Period 2, participants will receive a single dose of prednisone as in Period 1 plus a single dose of CORT113176 lipid capsule formulation by mouth on Day 1 in a fasted or fed state. The dose of CORT113176 and the prandial state will be determined after evaluation of safety and PK data from Part 1. The choice of formulation of CORT113176 to be used in Part 3 will depend on data review for Part 1. Part 3 will proceed only if sufficiently high plasma CORT113176 exposure is achieved in Part 1.</description>
