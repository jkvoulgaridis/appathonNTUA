  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a non-pharmacological,
      mind-body intervention to improve sleep quality, including a preliminary evaluation of
      neurophysiological signals. The study involves 4 weeks of guided mind-body practice at home
      using a smartphone app during bedtime and pre/post in-lab sleep study visits.

    <measure>Feasibility (i.e., subject retention at initial follow-up assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>At one month follow up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The primary metric for assessing Feasibility will be subject retention at the initial follow-up assessment. This includes the proportion of enrolled subjects that are active in the study at the initial follow-up assessment.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>At completion of the 4 week program</time_frame>
    <description>The primary metric for assessing Acceptability will be a self-report Acceptability questionnaire which evaluates enjoyableness, convenience, helpfulness, relevancy, odds of future use, and overall satisfaction of the program.</description>

    <description>Participants will utilize a daily sleep program available within a widely used smartphone app, which includes seven soundtracks (10-15min each) for guided mindfulness practice at bedtime. Techniques include breathing exercises, mental imagery, awareness of body and mind, and muscle and body relaxation.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the waitlist control group will be asked to maintain their usual care during the one month after baseline assessment. They will be asked not to start any new treatments for their insomnia. At the end of the one-month study, they will be given access to the mobile app.</description>
