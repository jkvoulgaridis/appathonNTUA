    <textblock>
      Rencent years have witnessed great progress of the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.
      However, most patients have poor outcomes following the currently first-line DA(daunorubicin,
      cytarabine)/IA(Idarubicin, cytarabine) chemotherapy, espiecially for the older patients and
      those not eligiable for receiving allo-HSCT. Azacitidine (AZA) was listed to methylation of
      drugs in China in 2018, is currently the only one approved methylation drugs in the treatment
      of AML(acute myeloid leukemia), in the NCCN guidelines. The homoharringtonie could induce
      AML(acute myeloid leukemia) cell lines and primary myeloid leukemia cell apoptosis, and the
      effect was dose dependent. While, HHT could also induce leukemia cells to differentiate into
      normal state, eventually achieve the goal of treatment, and control the disease. The
      investigators conducted a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the AZA plus
      HAG(homoharringtonie, cytarabine, G-CSF), HIA(homoharringtonie, Idarubicin,
      cytarabine)/HDA(homoharringtonie, daunorubicin, cytarabine). This study is aimed to validate
      the efficacy and safety advantages of the regimens that cotain homoharringtonie and
      azacitidine, and to determine which regimen would receive more living benefits.

      Currently, the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia still remains a therapeutic challenge.
      Patients received traditional chemotherapy have a low remission rate, poor prognosis and
      short survival period for patients. New treatment strategies are needed in find out a better
      chemotherapy regimen.

      Azacitidine (AZA) was listed to methylation of drugs in China in 2018, is currently the only
      approved drug for use in acute myeloid leukemia to methylation of drugs, in the NCCN
      guidelines. New combinations based on the azacitidine are currently undergoing, and the
      preliminary results brought new hope to the treatment of AML.

      The homoharringtonie was extracted from tricuspid plants of China. As a protein synthesis
      inhibitor, homoharringtonie plays a major role in the G1 / G2 phase in cells. In addition, it
      could induce AML cell lines and primary myeloid leukemia cell apoptosis, and the effect was
      dose dependent. Meanwhile it could also induce leukemia cells to differentiate into normal
      state, eventually controlled the progression of the disease.

      Combination with azacitidine may become a new option.This study intends to apply azacitidine
      in combination with homoharringtonie for treating AML patients, aiming to improve the
      efficacy, reducing adverse reactions and improve the living qualities of patients.

      Patients of denovo or relapsed AML(age≥60y) will receive AZA+HAG (homoharringtonie,
      cytarabine, G-CSF) regiment as induction therapy. After complete remission(CR), maintenance
      therapy with AZA+lenalidomide/AZA will be used every 4-6 weeks until progression or total of
      12cycles.

      Patients of denovo or relapsed AML(age&lt;60y) will receive AZA +HIA(homoharringtonie,
      Idarubicin, cytarabine) or AZA+HDA(homoharringtonie, daunorubicin, cytarabine) regiments as
      introduction therapy., After CR, post-remission therapy will follow with NCCN guidelines.

      The investigators choose historical AML patients receiving tranditional chemotherapy as a
      control group, to validate the efficacy and safety profiles.
