  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most common and fear symptoms for cancer patients, which seriously affects
      the quality of life in cancer patients. At present, oral opioid is the most common route to
      administrate cancer pain. However, the patients do not satisfy the pain administration with
      oral opioid after successful titration in many cases, especially the cases with severe cancer
      pain. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with hydromorphone can take analgesic effect
      rapidly. The aim of this trial is to compare the maintenance with hydromorphone PCA
      intravenously or switch to Sustained-Release Morphine orally after successful titraton with
      hydromorphone PCA intravenously in severe cancer pain.

    <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS, a score of 0 means no pain and 10 means the most severe) is used to assess the severity of pain. NRS of 24 hours is assessed every day. The mean pain score is a sum of NRS of day 1 (the day after successful titration of 24 hours) to day 3 divided by 3.
If the NRS of the morphine orally group &gt;3, the NRS in the one of both the hydromorphone PCA intravenously group declines more than 30% compared to morphine orally group, which is regards a positive result.</description>
