      1. objective

           - safety and efficacy evalaution of MASTER cells injected into knee of patients with
           osteoarthritis

        2. background

             -  osteoarthritis

                  -  Osteoarthritis is severe and intractable musculoskeletal disease that
                     eventually leads to joint failure and pain due to inflammation and joint
                     injury.

                  -  OA is one of the most prevalent diseases. The prevalence increases with age,
                     but overuse and trauma can result in OA in young population as well.

                  -  Injured cartilage can not be regenerated spontaneously, untreated injured
                     cartilage eventually leads to osteoarthritis. Surgical treatment may repair
                     the damage but the reparied cartilage may turn out to be fibrocartilage rather
                     than hyaline cartilage.

             -  Curent treatment

                  -  medical therapy: medication for symptom relief, together with exercise.
                     Medications include NSAIDS visco-supplement.

                  -  surgical therapy: total knee replacement arthroplasty

                  -  to overcome such limitations, cell therapy such as stem cell/ chondrocyte
                     injection is being investigated

        3. Hypothesis

           - Intra articular injection of MASTER cells will show safety and efficacy in terms of
           pain and functional improvement.

        4. Protocol 1) deisgn : Injection of MASTER cell 1X 10^8 cells/2cc (experimental arm) or
           2cc saline (placebo arm) into knee of patients with osteoarthritis 2) outcomes

             -  primary outcome : safety evaluation(adverse event)

             -  secondary outcomes : check on 1,2,3,6,9,12 months, atient reported outcome (WOMAC,
                KOOS, IKDC, pain VAS) 3,12 months SF-36, knee MRI score, serum cytokine, bone
                turnover marker 12 months x-ray 3) Disease

             -  osteoarthritis

                4) Subjects

                  1. inclusion : age 20-80yrs, diagnosed with OA according to ACR criteria for knee
                     OA, baseline pain VAS equal or more than 50mm

                  2. exclusion: lower extremities surgery within 6months or planned surgery,
                     concommitant systemic rheumatic diseases that can affect the results of the
                     trial, steroid intraarticular inejction into the index knee within 3months,
                     clinicallly meaningful abnormal lab tests (liver function, kidney function)

                5) evaluation

             -  primary outome : compare the number and proportion of of adverse event and lab test
                abnormalities between the two arms

             -  secondary outome

                  1. change of 100mm pain VAS

                  2. change of Western Ontario and McMAster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC)
                     pain VAS, IKDC, KOOS total score

                  3. change WOMAC sub scale, IKDC, KOOS

                  4. chagne of KHAQ

                  5. change of MRI indices

                  6. change of x-ray( joins space narrowing)

                  7. change of serum ESR/CRP, CTX-II
