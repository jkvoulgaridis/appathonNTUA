  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among Canadian men of which approximately
      20-30% present with high-risk tumour characteristic.

      Although surgery can be curative in patients evidencing pathological high-risk disease
      (extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement, positive surgical margins), a large
      proportion will develop biochemical failure within years from the surgical procedure. The
      failure rate is even more pronounced in those patients that present with high prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) levels, pT3 disease, positive margins and Gleason score â‰¥8 with an
      estimated 75% failure rate at 10 years.

      Post-operative radiotherapy (RT) has been shown in three randomized trials to significantly
      decrease the biochemical failure rate and in one of the trials a survival benefit was also
      seen with the addition of post-operative RT and is considered by many investigators standard
      therapy in patients with pathological high-risks factors even in absence of biochemical
      failure.

  <detailed_description>

      Although RT is known to potentially eradicate microscopic disease localized in the prostatic
      bed, the current dilemma is whether to deliver RT in the adjuvant setting (defined as the use
      of RT post-prostatectomy to patients at a higher risk of recurrence because of adverse
      pathological features prior to evidence of disease recurrence (i.e., with an undetectable
      PSA) or to use it as an early salvage therapy (defined as the use of RT in patients with
      rising PSA but no evidence of metastatic disease).

      There are several institutional retrospective reports on the use of RT as salvage therapy but
      no randomized trial has ever been completed. The best evidence available, however, supports
      early salvage RT as the best strategy to be used to maximize results.

      Our own group has shown excellent results using this approach in patients with low and
      intermediate risk disease and is currently exploring this approach in patients with high-risk
      disease. Hypofractionated RT offers a more convenient shorter course of treatment, reduces
      health-costs and appears to be as effective and safe as conventionally fractionated regimens.

      This Phase 2 trial will study the potential role of hypofractionated in the post-operative
      setting in patients with high-risk features with the primary objective of assessing toxicity
      from this approach.

      The use of androgen deprivation therapy in combination with RT in the primary treatment for
      patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer is well established. The use of
      androgen suppression in the post-operative setting has been less explored and its definitive
      role has not been fully explored.

      This is a phase II clinical trial to assess the feasibility and overall toxicity of adding
      one injection of neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy starting 12 weeks before plus Hypofractionated
      Radiotherapy for four weeks concurrently with another injection of luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog in patients with post-operative setting in patients
      with high-risk features.
