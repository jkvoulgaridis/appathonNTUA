  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: General movements (GMs) are endogenously generated movements of the entire body
      observable from the 9th week postmenstrual age to at least 20 weeks postterm age. The
      assessment of GMs, the GMA, is a method to differentiate between spontaneous normal vs.
      abnormal motor patterns based on visual Gestalt perception, and has proven to be a reliable
      tool to evaluate the integrity of the nervous system in early infancy. Trained GMA observers
      achieve an excellent inter-observer agreement, but this accuracy is known to decline when GMA
      is applied infrequently. Although specific changes in the quality of GMs are highly
      predictive for atypical neurodevelopmental trajectories, one pattern of GMs, the
      poor-repertoire, is still of low predictive power.

      Objectives: Tracking GMA observers' intrinsic and unconsciously applied analytic strategies
      may unravel hitherto unknown characteristics of GMs and Gestalt perception in clinical
      reasoning. We specifically aim to: detect parameters during the writhing movements period
      which differentiate normalising and deteriorating developmental trajectories (Aim 1);
      evaluate different strategies/modalities of expert guidance for clinical reasoning and
      develop novel didactical approaches for remote GMA training (remote visual and verbal
      guidance; Aim 2); create a database to provide expert-guided tutorials for remote clinical
      training, observer re-calibration, and self-evaluation for certified observers (Aim 3).

      Approach / methods: Based on our expertise in GMA and eye tracking, and a successful proof of
      principle (pilot experiment), we will conduct a series of experiments: GMA experts' eye
      movement patterns during clinical reasoning will be assessed to better understand the
      diagnostic category of poor-repertoire GMs (Experiment 1); benefits and potential
      difficulties of different modes of &quot;seeing through the eyes of an expert&quot;-approaches for
      GMA-training will be explored (Experiment 2); we shall evaluate enhancement of clinical
      reasoning as a result of intensive remote GMA training (Experiment 3).

      Level of originality / innovation: &quot;Tracking general movements&quot; will (1) contribute to better
      understand poor-repertoire GMs adding to the clinical necessity to closely follow infants in
      need for continuous or close-meshed clinical surveillance; (2) define the benefits of
      different modes/modalities of expert guidance for GMA, which will form the basis for
      innovative remote clinical GMA training; and (3) create a globally accessible database for
      remote clinical GMA refreshment-training and re-calibration.

        For the proposed experiments, observers will be divided into three groups. One group will
        consist of (a) naïve observers, that is, individuals who are not familiar with GMs, have
        not received any GMA training and are not medically educated. The two other groups will
        consist of (b) GMA-trained and certified observers: (b1) novice observers who have
        practiced GMA sporadically (def.: &lt;= 2 GMA/week for &lt;= 2 years) and have only little
        experience; and (b2) GMA experts, i.e. GMA tutors and individuals who have applied GMA
        regularly (def.: &gt; 2 GMA/week for &gt; 2 years).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Observers have to provide written informed consent to the study protocol, data analysis and
        data storage guidelines, as well as the publication of study results.

        Observers have to complete the experimental data acquisition. Apart from their lack of GMA
        training, naïve observers have to be of the same gender, of comparable age and educational
        level as GMA-trained observers.

        Novice observers and GMA experts have to be certified for GMA. Observers must have normal
        or corrected-to-normal vision (only individuals wearing soft contact lenses can be included
        in the eye tracking experiments).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Observers did not adhere to the study protocol, data analysis, data storage guidelines, or
        the publication of study results.

        Observers did not complete the experimental data acquisition. Observers have uncorrected
        visual impairments or visual impairments corrected with glasses/hard contact lenses.
