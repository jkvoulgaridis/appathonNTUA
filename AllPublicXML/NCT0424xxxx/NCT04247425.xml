  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well progressive resistance training works in improving the physical
      function of sarcoma survivors. Treatments for sarcoma can cause side effects such as fatigue,
      muscle loss, and weakness, which can negatively impact a patient's ability to physically
      function and enjoy an independent lifestyle. Engaging in a resistance training exercise
      routine may improve physical function, body composition, and bone density of sarcoma
      survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the feasibility of a home-based individualized progressive resistance
      training (PRT) program in sarcoma survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess secondary measures of feasibility of a home-based, individualized PRT program in
      sarcoma survivors.

      II. To determine if a 3-month PRT program improves physical function in sarcoma survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a series of progressive resistance training exercises at home twice weekly
      over 1 hour and receive instructional guidance from an exercise physiologist via
      videoconferencing once per week during one of these sessions for up to 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.

          -  Non-English speaking. At this time, we do not have resources to support translation of
             exercise physiologist (EP) sessions

          -  Dependent on a mobility device (e.g., crutches, wheelchair) for independent activities
             of daily living (IADLs)

               -  Use of a cane is permitted

          -  Participant has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere
             with cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of participant safety or study results
             (e.g., pregnancy)
