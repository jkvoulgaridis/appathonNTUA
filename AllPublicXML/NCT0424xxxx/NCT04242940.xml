  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess listening effort during a speech-in-noise task in
      bone-anchored hearing systems (BAHS) users via pupillometry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pupil dilation can be used as an objective indicator of listening effort during the execution
      of a task. The aim is to compare listening effort with different settings (OpenSound
      Navigator ON and OFF) of Ponto 4, the sound processor released by Oticon Medical AB in June
      2019, in listening scenarios that differ in complexity. The study consists of three visits of
      about two hours each in duration, during which the patients will perform a speech-in-noise
      task where the listening task varies in difficulty (i.e., in terms of signal-to-noise ratio,
      SNR). Pupil dilation will be recorded during the listening task as an indicator of listening
      effort. The patients will also use Ponto 4, instead of their own Ponto device, during a
      field-trial period of three months in between visit 2 and 3. Subjective evaluations of Ponto
      4 will be performed via three questionnaires, one regarding self-reported performance in
      everyday life, one regarding work-related fatigue, and one regarding overall sound processor
      preference (Ponto 4 vs. patient's own device). All these outcome measures are non-invasive
      measurements. This is a post market study and all products used are CE marked and used in
      clinical practice worldwide.

Possible responses are &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. The total NFR score is the number of &quot;yes&quot; responses divided by the total number of items, presented as a percentage (i.e., range 0-100). The higher the score, the greater the NfR felt by the respondent.</description>

    <description>Bone-anchored hearing systems (BAHS) use the body's natural ability to transfer sound through bone conduction. The sound processor picks up sound and converts it into vibrations that are transferred through the skull bone to the inner ear (cochlea). Thus, for patients with conductive or mixed hearing losses, patients with lasting hearing loss following a middle ear disease or malformations (such as microtia), the vibrations are bypassing the conductive problem in the ear canal or middle ear. The intervention in this study is audiologically fitting one/two bone-anchored sound processors (Ponto 4) to patients that are already implanted with abutments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Minimum 18 years and maximum 70 years old.

          -  UK English mother tongue.

          -  Bilateral conductive or mixed hearing loss.

          -  Users fitted unilaterally or bilaterally on abutment.

          -  Users are currently fitted with either Ponto 3, Ponto Plus or Ponto Pro (devices with
             a fitting range up to 45 dB HL).

          -  Users with at least 6 months of daily experience with one Ponto sound processor.

          -  BC thresholds of the implanted ear(s) better (lower) than or equal to 40 dB HL
             (average of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz) based on BC in-situ measurement at the first visit.

          -  People currently employed/self-employed (since the Need for Recovery questionnaire
             refers to work-related fatigue).

          -  Speech recognition scores better (higher) than or equal to 50% at +4 dB SNR with OSN
             OFF (as assessed via the first training list at Visit 1). This is to avoid including
             patients that are already &quot;giving up&quot; at +4 dB SNR.

          -  Users entitled for a sound-processor upgrade (according to the investigator) will
             first be selected. If there are not enough users entitled for an upgrade, then
             patients fitted with Ponto between 7 and 12 months before visit 1 will be considered.
             If there are not enough users within 7-12 months, then patients fitted with Ponto
             between 13 and 18 months before visit 1 will be considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Single-sided deafness (SSD)

          -  Hearing aid or cochlear implant on the opposite ear.

          -  Test persons with current eye diseases and/or history of eye surgery on both eyes.

          -  If the patient takes medications that can impact the autonomic nervous system - and
             hence pupil dilation (e.g., drugs for Parkinson's disease, peptic ulcers,
             incontinence, motion sickness).

          -  If the investigator or physician assesses that the patient is not fit for trial
             participation.
