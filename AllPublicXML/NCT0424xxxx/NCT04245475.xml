      Using immersive virtual reality as a form of pain distraction during a brief &quot;painful but
      tolerable&quot; temperature.

      This study will use Quantitative Sensory Testing (computer-controlled brief 10 second thermal
      pain stimuli) in healthy college students.

      The primary aim is to conduct a randomized, between-groups controlled study with healthy
      volunteers to explore whether interacting with virtual objects in VR via a high tech
      interactive VR system makes VR is significantly more effective/powerful compared to a less
      immersive passive VR system, vs. No VR, for reducing pain during quantitative sensory
      testing.
