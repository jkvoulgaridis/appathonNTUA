  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research will be conducted with a product for use in the intimate region in up to 75
      research participants who will use the investigational product for 28 ± 2 days. Will be
      evaluated and followed up throughout the study by a gynecologist to verify the safety and
      effectiveness of the product and possible adverse events.

      The study will evaluate the non-interference of a topical use product on the intimate area,
      helping to preserve the natural defenses. In addition, the epithelial hydration and pH of the
      intimate area will be evaluated.

      75 female participants, 18 to 70 years of age, healthy with complaints of vaginal dryness.
      The subjects will be submitted to gynecological evaluation in which pH measurements,
      hydration measurements and bacterioscopic collection will be performed. Then they will be
      guided to answer the questionnaires of Perceived Efficacy and Quality of Sexual Life. Next,
      participants will receive the product for home use, under real conditions of use, for 28 ± 2
      days. After 28 ± 2 days of use, subjects will return to the institute, and undergo further
      evaluations with the gynecologist. New pH measurements, hydration measurements (chronometry),
      bacterioscopic collection will be performed and the participants will answer the Perceived
      Efficacy and Quality of Sexual Life questionnaires.
