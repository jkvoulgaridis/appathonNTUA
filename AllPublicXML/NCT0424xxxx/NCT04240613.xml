      The efficacy of TVT-O (tension-free vaginal tape obturator) is well established in patients
      with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The objective of this study was to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction of TVT-O in patients suffering from primary, mixed
      (MUI) or recurrent urinary incontinence (UI) in long-term follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term results after TVT-O have been scarce. At five years no significant differences
      were seen between TVT (tension-free vaginal tape) and TVT-O for female SUI in a randomized
      trial. In two studies the patients were followed-up for ten years after the TVT-O procedure.
      The first randomized study reporting long term outcomes of TVT-O and outside-in TOT
      (transobturator tape) in women with urodynamic mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) showed that
      transobturator tension-free vaginal tapes are associated with a good and sustained
      patient-reported success rate.

      The success of the incontinence procedures should be assessed not only with objective
      measures but also with methods evaluating subjective satisfaction. The aim of this study was
      to evaluate the efficacy, safety and overall patient satisfaction of the TVT-O technique in a
      long-term follow-up of patients suffering from primary or recurrent SUI or MUI.

    <description>Objective treatment success was a negative cough stress test (CST), The CST was performed with a bladder volume of 300 ml aiming on adjusting the tape to allow a drop of saline to escape from the outer meatus of the urethra on strong coughing. The patient was subjectively cured if she answered to being very satisfied or satisfied with the operation.</description>

    <description>TVT-O is one of the most popular treatments for urinary incontinence (UI). Its efficacy is well established in patients with pure stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Data reporting long-term outcomes of TVT-O for the treatment of mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) or recurrent SUI is scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety and overall patient satisfaction of TVT-O in different subgroups of UI in a long-term follow-up.</description>
