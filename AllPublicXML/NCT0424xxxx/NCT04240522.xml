  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a frequent chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disorder,
      characterized by intensely itchy eczema. AD usually starts within the first 2 years of life.
      In 30 - 60% of children, inflammation spreads onto other body surfaces such as the
      gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, and the conjunctives within a few years. This
      sequence is called atopic march.

      Atopic dermatitis and associated atopic diseases are more frequent in families, suggesting a
      genetic predisposition. However, the underlying factors such as genetic phenotype,
      environmental factors, or life style which cause or worsen an existing allergic disease are
      not understood yet. Affected people suffer from recurrent flares that result in significantly
      impaired quality.

      This study will collect clinical and laboratory data to elucidate immunotolerance and
      preventiv stategies with the aim to develop new and individual treatment options of atopic
      diseases.

      Primary Objetive:

      In the planned project, the main objective is to identify endogenous (e.g. immunological and
      molecular factors) and exogenous factors (e.g. environmental, socioeconomic and microbial
      factors) that influence the course and remission of AD. More specifically to identify factors
      that are significantly different between patients that have or do not have remission from AD.

      Secondary Objective:

      (i) To identify endogenous and exogenous factors such as immunological, molecular and
      microbial factors to separate subgroups of patients (endotypes) with distinct local and
      systemic inflammatory responses.

      (ii) To identify potential biomarkers predicting the individual clinical course of AD and
      other atopic diseases including asthma, food allergy and allergic rhinitis.
