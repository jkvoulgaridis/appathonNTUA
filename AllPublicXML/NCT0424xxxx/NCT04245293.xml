  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, comparative, multicenter study that evaluates the performance and safety of
      the medical device Ainara®.

      In this study we use polycarbophilic vaginal moisturizing gel (Ainara®) compared with a
      HA-based gel (Hyalogin) for symptomatic treatment of vaginal dryness and we will monitor its
      impact on vaginal dryness symptoms evaluated by Vaginal Health Index and Vaginal Analogue
      Scale.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, comparative, multicenter study with two parallel group of subjects. The clinical investigation will be performed in three clinical sites.
The calculated sample size of subjects is 50 (25 subject for each arm). To obtain this number of evaluable subjects it will be needed to screen about 60 subjects (including 6 potential screening failure) and to enroll 54 subjects (estimating 4 subjects drop out). From the equal distribution per groups of treatment point of view, the minimum and maximum number of patients recommended for each of the three centers will be 8 and 25, respectively.
The research question is: in a population of menopausal transition women affected by vaginal dryness, will a 1-month treatment with polycarbophilic vaginal gel (Ainara®) significantly decrease the symptomatology evaluated by VHI and VAS in comparison with that occurred in a group of patients treated with a HA-based gel (HyaloGyn®)?</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Subjective symptoms dryness, itching, burning, dyspareunia, and dysuria reported on patient diary and scored as reported in the AGATA study as follows:
0 = absence, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe intensity. The change in these variables will be evaluated from baseline to day 3, 7, 21, 30 (final visit).</description>

    <measure>Vaginal pH</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured by the Investigators with a test strip delivered by Sponsor. The baseline values can be from 5.0 (this was the minimum value need for vaginal atrophy diagnosis in AGATA study) to 9.0. The Investigator will insert the pH strip into the upper wall of the vagina and will consider the reading made while the strip is still damp. For this outcome will be analysed the changing of mean values from baseline to 30 day (final visit) with comparison intra and inter groups.</description>

    <measure>Vaginal Trophism Maturation Value (MV)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Vaginal Trophism Maturation Value (MV): this outcome will be obtained from the cellular count of the vaginal smears at baseline and at the 30 days visit. The samples will be fixed, stored, and sent in the local laboratory in Timisoara, Romania (address details in TMF) for staining (Papanicolaou technique) and subsequent analysis. Samples will be evaluated by one independent cytopathologist blinded to the treatment. The MV will be calculated according to the following: MV = [1x (% superficial cells)] + [0.6x (% intermediate cells)] + [0.2x (% parabasal cells)]. The comparison intra and inter groups will be between baseline values and 30 days values.</description>

    <description>Global Symptom Score (GSS) a composite score of symptoms, will be obtained to assess the effect of treatment on all individual symptoms taken as a whole. It will be calculated by the addition of the intensity scores of all individual symptoms (range, 1-15: 1 = only mild vaginal dryness, 15 = all five symptoms severe in intensity). This outcome will be compared intra and inter groups, assessing the changing from baseline visit to 30 days visit (final visit).</description>
