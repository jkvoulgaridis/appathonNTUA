      Non interventional multi-centric study that will aim in evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      Fondaparinux in surgical cancer patients, identifying in parallel the most relevant and
      critical risk factors for Thromboembolism.

      It is a cohort study, recruiting cancer patients over 18 years of age, who have been
      diagnosed with cancer for over a period of one year.

      Exclusion criteria apply as well while all patients can withdraw their participation at any
      time point.

        Multi centered, non interventional study with inclusion and exclusion criteria as described
        in the above section. Due to the fact that this is an observational study the results of
        all correlations will be carefully discussed and will used only for the evaluation of
        cases.Patients' participation in the study may be interrupted at any time.

        The reasons for the interruption could be as follows:

          1. Withdrawal of patient consent

          2. Incorrect enrollment in the study, ie the patient does not meet the inclusion /
             exclusion criteria
