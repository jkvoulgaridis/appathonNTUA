  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators aim to use the in-vivo Transcatheter Mitral Valve
      Repair (TMVR) model to determine how Mitral Regurgitation (MR) affects coronary hemodynamics
      in patients affected with severe MR and concomittant angiographically-documented coronary
      artery disease. The investigators will also provide unique physiologic data on the acute
      effect of TMVR using the MitraClip system on coronary microcirculation in patients with
      severe MR.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with significant degenerative or functional MR planned for TMVR using
      the percutaneous edge-to-edge MitraClip system will be assessed for study eligibility.
      Patients with documented concomitant coronary artery disease, defined as coronary artery
      stenosis of 50% diameter or more in at least 1 epicardial coronary artery, will be informed
      about the study. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before enrolment
      in the study.

      The TMVR procedure will be performed under general anesthesia with fluoroscopy and
      transesophageal echocardiographic guidance using the MitraClip device via a femoral venous
      approach. Cardiac catheterisation and coronary angiography will be undertaken via the
      transradial route, using standard equipment. The hemodynamic data listed below will be
      acquired immediately before and after TMVR.

      For all lesions, intracoronary blood flow and pressure measurements will be used to generate
      the following intracoronary physiological parameters:

        -  Fractional Flow Reserve, FFR.

        -  Absolute coronary Blood Flow, ABF.

        -  Coronary Flow Reserve, CFR.

        -  Index for Microvascular Resistance, IMR.

        -  Baseline Resistance Index, BRI.

        -  Resistance Reserve Ratio, RRR.

        -  Instantaneous wave-free ratio, iFR

      Post-procedural evaluation: Patients will be followed up according to local standard clinical
      practice.
