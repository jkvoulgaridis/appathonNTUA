  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No study has been conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of an Opioid-Free
      Anesthesia (OFA) protocol compared to Opioid-Based Anesthesia (OBA) in thoracic surgery, at
      risk for intense post-operative pain, to improve patient care. The aim of the present study
      was to evaluate the effect of OFA on post-operative opioids consumption, pain and the
      post-operative period after lobectomy by Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy Surgery (VATS). systems.

      Investigators perform a retrospective, single-center study in 2019. Patients were divided
      into two groups: OFA (with dexmedetomidine) or OBA (sufentanyl).

      Investigators analyse the total postoperative opioid consumption in the 48 h after surgery.
      Investigators asses pain intensity in the 48 h after surgery, operative hemodynamic
      stability, Post-Operative Pain (POP) in Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and POP on day 30.

      All data are available in the medical record

      Hypothesis: OFA can reduce post-operative opioids consumption, pain in lobectomy by
      video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS).

    <description>The primary endpoint was the cumulative dose of postoperative opioid in the first 48 h (D2) (in milligrams of oral morphine equivalent) which included morphine and tramadol after conversion (1mg of intra-veinous morphine = 3 mg of oral morphine, and 10 mg of oral morphine = 50 mg of oral tramadol)</description>

    <description>Retrospective collection of clinical data recorded in the electronic medical record.
The following variables were continuously recorded in the institutional database: age, gender, body weight, height, personal medical history, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, type of thoracic surgery, the duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia (from intubation to extubation), the duration of PACU stay, the need for morphine titration, epinephrine, norepinephrine.
For data at day 30, the vast majority of patients were included in the enhanced recovery program and as such benefited from a consultation at 1 month with a coordination nurse who collected data on post-operative pain in a standardized manner.
All data was extracted from investigators institutional database and collected by a physician who was not involved in the care of the study patients.</description>

        All consecutive patients admitted for lobectomy or wedge video-assisted thoracoscopy in
        Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care at Louis Pradel University Hospital.

        If patient benefit of the OFA protocol, he was part of the group OFA (opioid free
        anesthesia) If patient don't benefit of the OFA protocol, he was part of the group OBA
