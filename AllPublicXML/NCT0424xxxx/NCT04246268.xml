  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INVOcell intravaginal culture system is a prescription device intended for preparing,
      holding, and transferring human gametes or embryos during intravaginal in vitro fertilization
      or intravaginal culture procedures.

      The original (FG-002) INVOcell culture system was FDA cleared through De Novo application
      (DEN150008). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the INVO Bioscience modified INVOcell
      system, comprised of the INVOcell Intravaginal Culture Device and Retention Device, in terms
      of the following:

      2.1 Effectiveness of achieving fertilization, implantation, embryo development, clinical
      pregnancy, and live birth after 5-days of continuous vaginal incubation.

      2.2 The comfort and retention of the INVOcell device and retention system intravaginally.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Pivotal, single arm, multicenter, open label trial to evaluate the efficacy,
      comfort and retention of the INVOcell Intravaginal Culture Device and Retention Device over
      5-days vaginal incubation. The effectiveness of the INVOcell device will be tested on a
      select population of infertile couples at several in vitro fertilization (IVF) centers. The
      providers at each center will conduct the processes of ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval and
      embryo transfer per the standard protocols for their centers. The planned sample size is 180
      participants across 3 sites (60 participants per site).

      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, comfort and retention of the INVOcell
      with the retention device, and demonstrate superiority following 5-day vaginal incubation as
      compared to current 3-day vaginal incubation indication.

      Specifically, the following will be assessed:

        1. The INVO Procedure using the INVOcell Intravaginal Culture Device can effectively
           maintain 5-days of continuous vaginal incubation with the transfer of blastocyst(s) at
           the end of the 5-days.

        2. The Retention Device retains the INVOcell in the vaginal cavity and is well tolerated
           during the 5-days of continuous vaginal incubation.
