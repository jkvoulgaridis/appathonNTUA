    <textblock>
      Improving the management of perioperative anxiety is important. Anxiety can have an impact on
      the intervention and can increase postoperative complications as well as emotional and
      behavioral incidents that then have an impact on adherence to care. These findings are also
      true in interventional cardiology. That is why, for several months, the Grenoble University
      hospital paramedical team, in collaboration with the medical profession, improved by using
      several techniques (educational sheet, therapeutic communication). Following a survey of the
      patients of Grenoble university hospital, a gray area persists in their care. The room where
      the patient attends his examination. The investigators would then use the new technology that
      makes virtual reality in the transfer room to evaluate its benefit in a random study on
      preoperative anxiety in interventional cardiology.
