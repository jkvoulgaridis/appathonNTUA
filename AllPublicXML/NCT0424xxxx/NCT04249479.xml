  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) is an important prognostic tool with regard to the
      detection of oncological, infectious and other abdominal disorders.

      The total iodine load (TIL) is regarded as a decisive factor in the opacification of
      parenchymal structures. The EICAR trial demonstrated that injection with high flow rates of
      prewarmed contrast media (CM) was safe and patients did not experience any pain, stress of
      discomfort during injection. Flow rates as high as 8.8 ml/s were injected without any
      discomfort. All concentrations used (e.g. 240, 300 and 370 mg I/ml) in this study were
      prewarmed. According to the recent recommendations (ESUR guidelines 10.0) it should be
      considered to warm iodine-based CM before administration. Warming the CM is hypothesized to
      result in a higher patient comfort, based on clinical observation. In addition to this, it
      reduces the viscosity of the CM and therefore it is hypothesized that this may reduce the
      risk of extravasation. According to these guidelines, it is regarded as best clinical
      practice. Surprisingly, these recommendations are merely based on a hypothetical assumption.
      In the literature, there are no studies evaluating this topic and it has never been clearly
      shown to result in a better patient comfort. For this reason, many clinics do not pre-warm
      their CM in daily clinical routine. Only one study evaluated subjective comfort in
      hysterosalpingography (HSG), in which CM is injected in to the cavity of the uterus. This
      study found that prewarmed CM alleviates the pain and decreased the incidence of vasovagal
      episodes during HSG. To the best of our knowledge, no study showed that prewarmed CM in CT
      resulted in higher patient comfort, in comparison to CM at room temperature (20° C).

      Up till now, all CM in the department is prewarmed. In case this study does not show a
      difference in patient comfort, prewarming the CM can be stopped, resulting in a considerable
      simplified workflow.

      The hypothesis is that usage of CM at room temperature (20° C) might result in a decreased
      level of patient comfort in abdominal CT, in comparison to pre-heated (37° C) CM, with no
      significant difference in diagnostic attenuation of the liver parenchyma between groups.

    <textblock>
      Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are performed daily on a regular basis. Since its
      advent, rapid technical advances in CT continuously improved image quality. Besides scan
      technique, the contrast media (CM) injection protocol is the crucial factor in abdominal
      imaging. Parenchymal contrast enhancement is determined by patient related factors (e.g.
      cardiac output, blood volume and patient weight), the CM injection protocol and the scan
      protocol. Much literature has been performed with regard to optimizing CM application and the
      scan protocol. Flow rate of the CM and patient discomfort have been thoroughly investigated
      in our department. Heating CM up to body temperature has been daily clinical routine in our
      department for years.

      According to the recent recommendations (ESUR guidelines 10.0) it is advised to warm
      iodine-based CM before administration. Warming the CM is expected to result in a higher
      patient comfort, based on clinical observation. Kok et al. showed in phantom experiments that
      high temperature, low iodine concentration and low viscosity significantly decreases
      injection pressure. Subsequently, as increased temperature reduces the viscosity of the CM,
      the decreased viscosity is hypothesized to reduce the risk of extravasation. A decreased
      viscosity might also have a substantial impact on individual tailored CM injection protocols
      in daily routine scanning as it is speculated that a decrease of viscosity and subsequent
      decrease in peak injection pressure could influence patient comfort during injection. The
      EICAR trial showed that prewarmed CM can be safely injected at high flow rates, without
      patient discomfort, pain or stress. However, the latter was not compared to CM at room
      temperature.

      Different CM concentrations are used in different hospitals throughout the world. The higher
      the concentration, the higher the viscosity of the CM. In present study, only one CM
      concentrations (e.g. 300 mg/ml) will be used, which is used in daily clinical practice for
      years. Heating the CM decreases the viscosity. It is therefore expected that the preheated CM
      in a concentration of 300 mg/ml has a lower viscosity in comparison to the CM at 20° C.

      Pre-warming CM might be regarded as best clinical practice. No studies have been performed to
      investigate this statement, nor is there any literature that shows that prewarmed CM has a
      favorable patient comfort compared to CM injected at room temperature. For these reasons,
      there remains to be some reluctance and many clinics still not pre-warm their CM. One study,
      in which CM is injected in to the cavity of the uterus to check for any anatomical variants
      and causes for infertility, showed a preference for prewarmed CM in hysterosalpingography
      (HCG). This study found that prewarmed CM alleviates the pain and decreased the incidence of
      vasovagal episode during the HCG.

      The hypothesis is that usage of CM at room temperature (20° C) might result in a decreased
      level of patient comfort in abdominal CT, in comparison to pre-heated (37° C) CM, with no
      significant difference in diagnostic attenuation of the liver parenchyma between groups. In
      case this study does not show a significant difference in patient comfort and diagnostic
      quality between groups, prewarming the CM can be stopped, resulting in a considerable
      simplified workflow.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is an observer blinded randomized controlled trial conducted according to Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice. The study will be a prospective evaluation of the patient comfort during the injection of CM at room temperature (20° C) and prewarmed (37° C). Attenuation of the liver and image quality will be evaluated afterwards.
We are aiming to prospectively enrol 216 consecutive patients, who will be scheduled for contrast enhanced abdominal CT.
216 patients will be divided into 2 different groups:
Group I: 300 mg/ml at a temperature of 20° C
Group II: 300 mg/ml at a temperature of 37° C
Iodine concentrated CM of 300 mg/ml is clinically used as a standard routine injection protocol for all CT scans in our department, including abdominal CT. The scan protocol is identical to our daily clinical practice. The only difference is that 50% of the included patients will receive CM warmed at room temperature. Both CM temperatures are warmed in an incubator.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>All subjects will be randomized into two different groups as listed in the study outline.
The randomization schedule will be prepared and centrally administered. A computer random number generator prepares the randomization schedule in a 1:1 fashion (balanced randomization). Stratification is performed, based on age (&lt; 60 and ≥ 60 years) and weight (&lt; 80 and ≥ 80 kg). Variable block randomization will distribute patients equally over time.
The blinding and randomization process will be conducted by Clinical Trial Centre Maastricht (CTCM, www.CTCM.nl) with a randomization program designed for usage of different techniques (minimization, block method, biased-coin, etc). The technician who administers the CM is aware of the CM temperature. Therefore, the technicians will be instructed before start of the study, not to give this information to the patient, not even when requested by the patient.</masking_description>
