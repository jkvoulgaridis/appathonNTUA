  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to develop evidence-based interventions that rural food pantries can use to
      limit the distribution and intake of ultra-processed foods and promote the distribution and
      intake of minimally processed foods in the food environment and among low-income populations
      to promote better dietary quality and health outcomes. This research project, The UnProcessed
      Pantry Project (UP3): A Novel Approach to Improving Dietary Quality for Low-Income Adults
      Served by Rural Food Pantries, uses the Social-Ecological Model to target multiple levels,
      including the food supply in the rural study location (community level), the food environment
      at the food pantry (environmental level), and participant dietary intake (individual level).
      Aim 1 will adapt evidence-based strategies to inform UP3. UP3 will improve dietary quality by
      influencing the food supply through organization-wide nutrition policies, modifying the food
      environment with minimally processed foods and nudges, and changing participant dietary
      intake through experiential nutrition education. The UP3 pilot study will be conducted during
      Aim 2 with 40 participants served by two rural food pantries in Montana. The purpose of the
      pilot study is to investigate potential short-term effects on nutrient intake and dietary
      quality (primary outcome), assess acceptability of UP3 among participants, and evaluate
      feasibility in rural food pantry environments. It is hypothesized that UP3 will improve
      access to minimally processed foods and decrease access to ultra-processed foods at the food
      pantry, which will improve overall dietary quality of individuals as measured by the Healthy
      Eating Index-2015 compared to baseline and to the control group. Demographic and food
      security data will characterize the population. Psychosocial factors will be collected to
      understand changes in knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about processed foods. Biomarkers
      of health data (i.e., weight, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, fasting lipid panel) will be
      collected to determine the feasibility of measuring potential short-term health effects
      alongside UP3. A control group of 20 participants at a rural food pantry will be used to
      assess dietary intake, psychosocial factors, height, and weight. Aim 3 will tailor UP3 for a
      scalable intervention suited for an R01 grant application to conduct a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT). UP3 is positioned to demonstrate the positive effects of limiting processed
      foods and increasing unprocessed and minimally processed foods on diets and, potentially,
      health among low-income populations. The short-term goals of this research are to develop an
      adaptable and scalable intervention suitable for rural food pantries serving low-income
      populations, as well as potentially contribute to a knowledge base around potential
      short-term effects of the minimally processed foods diet on dietary quality and health risks
      in those populations. The longer-term goals are to test the efficacy of the intervention in
      an RCT and then disseminate the approach to be integrated into rural food pantries serving
      low-income populations with the goal of decreasing health risks.

    <description>A 12 week pilot trial will be conducted at two rural food pantries in Montana with 40 low-income adults to measure within-participant changes over time. The study will provide the initial investigation of the extent to which UP3 will improve overall dietary quality as measured by the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI) compared to baseline. Psychosocial factors will be measured to understand changes in knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about processed foods. Data on biomarkers of health (i.e., weight, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, fasting lipid panel) will be collected to assess the feasibility of measuring potential short-term health effects of UP3.</description>
