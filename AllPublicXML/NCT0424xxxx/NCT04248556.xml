  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study for health care product safety assessment. The research will be
      conducted with 80 subjects, aged 18 to 70 years. The product will be applied on the right
      and/or left back of the research participants for 3 consecutive weeks. After 10 days, will
      have another application of the same product, which will be removed in 48 hours. Medical
      evaluation will be available throughout the study to assess possible adverse events.

      The objective of the study is to observe the effects of the application of the product on the
      skin and prove the absence of irritability and/or allergy.

      80 subjects, aged 18 to 70 years, phototypes I to IV (according to Fitzpatrick
      classification). The patch test will be used to verify the absence of primary and cumulative
      dermal irritation reactions and sensitization allergic reactions by the investigational
      products. The products will be applied as they are over semi-occlusive dressings.
