    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to compare the efficacy of OPC-64005 at 20 mg vs placebo and to
      assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of OPC-64005 at 10 and 20 mg in patients with major
      depressive disorder (MDD).The primary endpoint is the mean change from baseline in
      Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at Week 6 of the double-blind
      treatment period in the OPC-64005 20-mg group compared with the placebo group
