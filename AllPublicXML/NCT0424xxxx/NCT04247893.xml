  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in the world.
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the additional effect of photobiomodulation therapy on
      the quadriceps muscle and knee joint in a blood flow restriction exercise program for
      individuals with knee OA. To this end, volunteers will be selected at random, aged between 40
      and 65 years with pain in one knee, at least in the last 6 months, diagnosed with unilateral
      knee OA based on the criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology and
      radiographic confirmation for grades 2 or 3 of the Kellgren-Lawrence Classification, will be
      randomized into the following groups: (Exercises with blood flow restriction, n = 20),
      (Exercises with blood flow restriction + photobiomodulation, n = 20) and Exercises with blood
      flow restriction + placebo photobiomodulation (n = 20). 12 consecutive weeks of treatment
      will be carried out, with the volunteers being evaluated before and after, using the
      following instruments: The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC), sit and stand test, Timed up and Go (TUG), numerical scale pain assessment (END),
      pain-to-pressure threshold (LDP), skin temperature: quadriceps musculature, knee joint and
      maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the muscles: quadriceps, middle gluteus.
      For data analysis, normality test will be used to verify the data distribution and
      statistical test consistent with the appropriate comparisons within and between groups, thus,
      two factors are considered in the comparisons, time and group. A significance level of 5%
      will be adopted.
