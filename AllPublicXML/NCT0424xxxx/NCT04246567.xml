      The aim of this study to evaluate the patients who underwent controlled hypotensive
      anesthesia under standardized depth of anesthesia with total intravenous anesthesia or
      inhalation anesthesia; preoperative and 30. ,60. ,120. second of intraoperative period blood
      HIF 1a, TAS, TOS measurement and to investigate tissue hypoxia secondary to hypotensive
      anesthesia and the changes of the mediators at the tissue level and which hypotensive
      anesthesia technique is related.

      Controlled hypotension is the voluntary reversible reduction of arterial blood pressure.
      Hypotensive anesthesia is a method of anesthesia in which blood pressure is reduced in a
      controlled manner, especially in certain surgeries. İt reduces intraoperative bleeding and
      need for blood transfusion and provides a clean surgical vision in narrow-field surgeries or
      with high bleeding potential. Hypotensive anesthesia can be performed according to mean blood
      pressure (MBP) or systolic blood pressure (SBP).

      A non-invasive cerebral oximeter is used to see the changes in the brain due to high
      oxygen-dependent metabolism during induction and maintenance of anesthesia.

      Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor involved in cell adaptation
      mechanism activated in response to hypoxia.

      The biological activity of HIF 1 is determined by the expression and activity of the HIF 1a
      subunit.

      Total antioxidant status (TAS) shows the total effect of all antioxidants in the human body
      and total oxidant status (TOS) shows the total effect of oxidants.

      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) allows continuous and non-invasive monitoring of cerebral
      oxygenation. HIF 1a, TAS and TOS are laboratory markers that predict tissue oxygenation and
      perfusion.

      Hypotensive anesthesia can be performed according to both MBP and SBP. However, in our study
      that follow-up MBP is more advantageous/protective, although it is not supported by very
      strong data. The investigators recommend hypotensive anesthesia compared to MBP; but further
      studies are needed

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 60 ASA 1 patients aged between 18-55 who underwent elective rhinoplasty surgery were included the study.The patients were divided into two groups. One group received hypotensive anesthesia with total intravenous anesthesia technique according to MBP and the other group received hypotensive anesthesia with inhalation anesthesia technique. Blood samples were taken from all patients before anesthesia induction and 30. ,60. ,120. second of intraoperative period for TAS, TOS, HIF 1a. At the and of the operation patients were fallowed in the post anesthesia care unit for 30 minutes and pain and nause vomiting scores were evaluated. İn addition, surgical satisfaction and bleeding scores and anesthetic consumption of both groups were recorded</intervention_model_description>
