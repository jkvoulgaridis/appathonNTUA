      Phase 0, Open Label study of an alternative dosing interval of Brodalumab in patients with
      moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa. Consisting of n=10 patients receiving 210mg
      subcutaneously every week for 24 weeks. Patients will be followed for a period of 36 weeks
      (12 weeks after last dose of Brodalumab) to assess for safety.
