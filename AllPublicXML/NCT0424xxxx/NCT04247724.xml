      Fitness and health effects of 12 weeks of recreational team handball in untrained adult men
      and women aged 20-30 years&quot;

      Adult men and women aged 20-30 years will be recruited to take part in a 12-week intervention
      with recreational team handball. Half of the participants are men (n=32), who are randomly
      assigned to a group playing recreational team handball (n=16) and an inactive control group
      (n=16). The women (n=40) are also divided and assigned to a group with regular participation
      in recreational team handball (n=20) and an inactive control group (n=20). The training
      sessions will be offered 2-3 times weekly for 70 minutes per session by a supervised trainer.
      The sessions involves an injury preventive warm-up and ball exercises for 15 minutes followed
      by recreational handball on small pitches such as 4 vs 4. A comprehensive testing protocol is
      conducted before and after the training period. The measurements includes body composition
      and bone mineralization, blood pressure, resting heart rate, fasting blood sugar, insulin,
      cholesterol and bone markers. In addition, a number of physical tests which involves fitness
      level (VO2max), intermittent work, muscle strength and balance will further be conducted. The
      testing takes place at the University of Copenhagen. The training sessions will also take
      place at the University of Copenhagen or in a handball club near the University. The study
      will be approved by the local ethical committee of Copenhagen.
