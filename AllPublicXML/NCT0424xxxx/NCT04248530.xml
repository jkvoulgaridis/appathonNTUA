  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is the multicenter pilot study to obtain an assessment of the safety of renal
      denervation in the patients with uncontrolled hypertension on standard medical therapy in
      Korea.

    <textblock>
      DENEX system developed by Handok Kalos Medical Inc. is a renal nerve blocking system to
      efficiently block the sympathetic nerve of the kidney with minimal invasive procedure. It was
      developed to block the sympathetic nerves distributed in blood vessel wall by delivering high
      frequency energy to the renal artery for the purpose of treating hypertension.
