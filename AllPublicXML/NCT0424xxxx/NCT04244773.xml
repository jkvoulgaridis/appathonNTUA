  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Switzerland and still more
      than a quarter of the Swiss population smokes cigarettes. Recently, electronic nicotine
      delivery systems (ENDS; also called vaporizer, e-cigarette or electronic cigarette) have
      become popular with smokers who want to stop smoking or reduce their exposure to inhaled
      chemicals since ENDS use appears to be safer than tobacco smoking.

      The micronucleus cytologic assay test was originally developed to screen for drug toxicity in
      bone marrow samples from mammals. The technique identifies micronuclei on smears obtained by
      oral cavity exfoliation and indicate genomic instability. Buccal MNs may predict cancer risk
      for the upper aerodigestive tract. The HUman MicroNucleus project on eXfoLiated buccal cells
      (HUMNXL) found MN counts gradually increased during the progression from normal mucosal to
      precancerous lesions to carcinoma. MN assessment discriminates between exposure to tobacco
      smoke in smokers and in non-smokers, and has been tested on a small number of ENDS users.

      For this trial, cigarette smokers motivated to quit smoking cigarettes will be included.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive an ENDS and nicotine-containing
      e-liquids, which they will be allowed to use ad libitum. Additionally, they will receive
      smoking cessation counseling. Participants in the control group will receive smoking
      cessation counseling only. All participants will be followed over a 24-month period. Measures
      of MN frequency will test the potential effect of ENDS use on cancer-related outcomes, in
      particular incident of mouth-, lung- and kidney- cancers.
