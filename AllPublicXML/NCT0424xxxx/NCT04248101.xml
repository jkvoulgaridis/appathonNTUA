      The patients underwent one treatment option and then followed up for three weeks and the
      results noted in terms of success/failure and complications specific to each treatment option
      and analysed accordingly

    <description>The effect of treatment was noted in a structured proforma on weekly basis for 3 weeks.
Treatment was considered successful if, on local examination the granuloma disappeared completely and did not reappear during the follow up period.
And if the granuloma did not disppear completely during the follow up period after double ligation or application of silver nitrate, treatment was considered to have failed.
These variables were measured as frequency and percentages. The results were compared between the two groups using chi-square test. A significance level of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</description>

    <description>The complications were also noted in the above mentioned proforma during the follow up period on weekly basis for 3 weeks.
Complications relevant to the treatment i.e. infection, bleeding, chemical burns and skin discoloration were noted during local examination.
These variables were measured as frequency and percentages. The results were compared between the two groups using chi-square test. A significance level of &lt;0.05 was considered significant</description>
