    <textblock>
      Worldwide, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of chronic and end stage
      kidney disease. Large-sized prospective randomized clinical trials indicate that intensified
      glucose and blood pressure control, the latter especially by using agents that interfere with
      the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), halts the onset and (particularly) the
      progression of DKD, in both type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      (T2DM) patients. However, despite the wide use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), a considerable amount of patients
      develop DKD (20-40%), indicating an unmet need for renoprotective therapies as DKD largely
      causes the increased mortality risk from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with
      diabetes.

      Sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a relatively novel
      glucose-lowering drug for the treatment of T2DM as they lower plasma glucose levels by
      blocking renal glucose reabsorption. In addition, these agents exert pleiotropic actions
      beyond glucose control. As such, SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease proximal sodium reabsorption,
      reduce blood pressure, body weight and uric acid. In large trials and likely through these
      pleiotropic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for
      heart failure and reduce end stage kidney disease. At this point in time, the renoprotective
      mechanisms involved with SGLT-2 inhibition still remain speculative, though a consistent
      finding is that SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce estimated eGFR after first dosing, which is
      reversible after treatment cessation. This &quot;dip&quot; indicates a renal hemodynamic phenomenon
      reminiscent of the RAS blockers and is thought to reflect a reduction in intraglomerular
      pressure.

      The mechanisms of this observation have only been partially investigated by us and others.
      From studies in peolpe with T1DM it is hypothesized that SGLT-2 inhibition increases sodium
      chloride delivery to the macula densa, which in turn augments the afferent arteriolar
      resistances, known as tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), consequently reducing glomerular
      (hyper)filtration and hydrostatic pressure. Recently a trial has been conducted in humans
      with T2DM to investigate if this also holds true in these patients. Suprisingly, this study
      showed that the renohemodynamic actions of SGLT-2 inhibition in T2DM are not due to afferent
      vasoconstriction but rather efferent vasodilation [van Bommel/van Raalte Kidney International
      2019 in press]. The investigators realized that the SGLT-2 associated dip in eGFR remains
      insufficient understood. The increase in sodium excretion following SGLT-2 inhibition peaks
      at day 2-3 after which it normalizes. It is unknown whether this drop in eGFR is related to
      this peak in sodium excretion, as the drop remains after normalization of sodium excretion.
      Therefore it might be possible that glucosuria, by inducing osmotic diuresis, is the main
      driver of the reduction in intraglomerular pressure more than sodium, since SGLT-2 inhibitors
      cause persisting glucosuria.

      Furthermore, it is known that SGLT-2 induced glucosuria and possibly sodium excretion is
      dependent of renal function and HbA1c and consequently is diminished in people with CKD or
      without T2DM. However, the renoprotective effects in T2DM are also observed in patients with
      impaired kidney function and seem statistically independent of glucose levels. Until now it
      has not been investigated whether or not the SGLT-2 induced eGFR alterations occur in people
      with CKD with or without T2DM. It is clinically relevant to understand the renal hemodynamics
      of SGLT-2 inhibitors in these populations since then it is possible to interpret the results
      from the ongoing trials in people with CKD without T2DM, such as EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD.

      Recently, potential mediators of renal arterole tone, such as adenosine, have been measured
      to gain more insight into mechanisms of SGLT-2 inhibitor-induced changes in renal
      hemodynamics. Adenosine is known to augment preglomerular arteriolar resistance. Adenosine
      was significantly increased after SGLT-2 inhibition, as was also observed in patients with
      type 1 diabetes. However, it can also induce postglomerular vasodilation via A2aR activation
      in the presence of RAS blockade. One study in T1DM rats has shown that increased adenosine
      generation by the macula densa in response to SGLT-2 inhibition suppresses hyperfiltration,
      as the improvements in preglomerular arteriolar resistance were abolished after adenosine
      antagonist administration. To date, this has not been investigated in T2DM humans. Therefore,
      this trial will assess TGF responses with and without adenosine blockade by caffeine.
