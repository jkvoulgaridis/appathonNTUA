  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      6,000 patients with HT and/or DM will be recruited to participate a 12-week EIM exercise
      intervention, which also involve consistent feedback and reminders using information
      technology (IT). The primary outcome will be improvement of blood pressure at 1-year. Other
      clinical outcomes will be obtained on recruitment (baseline), 12-week (immediately after EIM
      classes) and 1-year after recruitment

The exercise level will be recorded by a tracker and provides feedback to the participants and physical trainer. The physical parameters such as fat percentage and blood pressure level will be feedback to the patients to encourage exercise.</description>
