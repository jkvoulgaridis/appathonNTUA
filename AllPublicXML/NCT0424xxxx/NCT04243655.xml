  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALF (ALF) is defined by three criteria: (1) rapid development of hepatocellular dysfunction
      (jaundice, coagulopathy), (2) hepatic encephalopathy, and (3) absence of a prior history of
      liver disease.

      Interval between onset of acute hepatic injury (jaundice) and onset of liver failure
      (encephalopathy with or without coagulopathy) in such patients (icterus-encephalopathy
      interval; IEI) has been described to be between 4 weeks (Indian definition) to 24 weeks
      (AASLD-ALF study group). Further, due to the diverse natural course, ALF has been
      sub-classified as hyperacute (IEI ≤ 7 day), acute (IEI ≤ 4 weeks) and sub-acute ALF (IEI ≥ 5
      week to ≤12 weeks) by British authors.

    <textblock>
      Since the 1960s, Liver Transplantation (LT) has emerged as a cornerstone intervention to cure
      liver failure. Mortality in patients with liver failure who cannot be rescued with Liver
      Transplantation remains high despite improvements in supportive care.

      Artificial Liver Support System (ALSS) in ALF aim to remove excess inflammatory cytokines and
      attenuate inflammatory response, to remove albumin-bound and water-soluble toxins, to restore
      and preserve hepatic function and mitigate or limit the progression of multiorgan failure
      while hepatic recovery or liver transplant occurs. ALSS may also provide benefit in instances
      where LT is contraindicated.

      The following beneficial effects have been documented with ALSS in ALF patients: improvement
      of jaundice, amelioration of hemodynamic instability, improvement of hepatic encephalopathy,
      SOFA score and survival.

      HA 330-II is a broad-spectrum adsorbent made of neutral macroporous resin, removes toxins
      such as Inflammatory mediators (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 &amp; TNF-α) along with hepatic toxins such as
      phenol, mercaptan, aromatic amino acids, false neurotransmitters and indirectly ammonia by
      improving liver function recovery. However, this indirect ammonia removal with HA 330-II is
      insignificant. By removing excess inflammatory cytokines and attenuating uncontrolled immune
      response, HA 330-II prevents worsening of encephalopathy, improves liver function recovery
      and improves prognosis.
