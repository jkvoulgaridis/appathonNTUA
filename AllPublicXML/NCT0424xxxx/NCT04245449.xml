  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors with arm paresis because of stroke use their &quot;good&quot; arm for daily
      activities, but in doing so may be self-limiting their own recovery of the &quot;bad&quot; arm.
      Traditional models of stroke rehabilitation fail to fully engage the survivor and care
      partner(s) in actively planning post-discharge habits that improve their capacity to live
      well over their entire lives. This study will test a cutting-edge in-person therapy + online
      training program designed to progressively transfer the responsibility of driving post-stroke
      recovery from the therapist to the survivor.

    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health Literacy will be assessed via a standardize 18-item test designed to assess an adult's ability to read and understand common medical terms. Minimum = 0, Maximum = 18. Higher scores indicate greater health literacy.</description>

    <measure>Change in self management skills from Baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' ability to manage their chronic condition (their stroke) will be assessed qualitatively using interview questions. Participants' narratives will be analyzed and reported as a description of how their own skills have changed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Efficacy for Managing Daily Activities from Baseline to 3 months and 5 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit, 3 months and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Efficacy will be assessed using the NIH PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Daily Activities assessment. Minimum score = 0, Maximum score = 8. Higher numbers indicate greater self efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in social Isolation from Baseline to 3 months and 5 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit, 3 months &amp; 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social Isolation will be assessed using the NIH PROMIS Social Isolation assessment. Minimum score = 0, Maximum score = 8. Higher numbers indicate less social isolation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Emotional Support from Baseline to 3 months and 5 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit, 3 months (Post Treatment+/- 3 days), &amp; 5 months (Follow up +/- 3 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional Support will be assessed using the NIH PROMIS Emotional Support assessment. Minimum score = 0, Maximum score = 8. Higher numbers indicate greater emotional support.</description>

    <description>TEAACH e-learning: 3-months of online educational modules include neuroscience education (based on an effective pain educational model37) to improve patient self-efficacy, and strategy-training38 to improve patients' problem-solving abilities for at-home arm use. The course is live on the MUSC MoodleCE platform.
TEAACH in-clinic therapy: 24 in-clinic sessions; 3 times/week for 4 weeks (month 1), 2 times/week for 4 weeks (month 2) and 1 time/week for 4 weeks (month 3) with 200 movement repetitions per session. In our RCTs, this therapy dose required ~1.0-1.5 hours/session. A critical element of TEAACH is the focus on linking in-clinic therapy to out-of-clinic real world paretic arm use via MoodleCE Learning Activities.</description>
