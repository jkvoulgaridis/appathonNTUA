  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity rate in Malaysia is higher than the average world obesity rate. Central obesity
      is a component of metabolic syndrome (MetS) which is also made up of dyslipidemia, impaired
      glucose tolerance, and hypertension. MetS is a continuum in the risk of developing
      cardiometabolic complication. Time Restricted Feeding (TRF) involves an extended
      physiological overnight fast. Researchers believe that the timing of meal intake that matches
      with the circadian rhythms is as important as the calories intake to prevent obesity and its
      complications. The investigators hypothesize that TRF is effective in weight control and
      improvement of metabolic severity. Subjects will be randomized into either the control group,
      which practices QQH dietary plan or intervention group, which practices TRF as an adjunct to
      QQH dietary plan.

      Subjects will be followed up at week 12 and week 24 to assess adherence, efficacy and safety
      of TRF.

      This study intends to fill a few research gaps as follows:

        1. Longer study duration of 6 months.

        2. This is the first study amongst the Asian population.

        3. Adherence level to TRF in real life setting is measured. This information can
           potentially predict the intensity level of TRF that are feasible for practice in real
           life and also its association with the efficacy of TRF.

        4. TRF is defined as eating within aâ‰¤12-hour period and fasting for at least 12 hours per
           day. This is the shortest fasting window studied so far.

    <description>Subjects practise TRF (2-3 meals) as an adjunct to the QQH healthy plate diet. Subjects of the intervention group can eat during the pre-determined 8-12 hours eating window, but they are only allowed to drink water and calorie-free drinks for the remaining 12-16 hours. Subjects are allowed to decide the time of their first and the last meal of the day as long as they eat within the 8-12 hour window period. However, skipping breakfast and having late dinner are discouraged.</description>
