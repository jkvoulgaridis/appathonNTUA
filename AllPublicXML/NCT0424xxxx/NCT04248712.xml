      Researchers are assessing the safety and effectiveness of antihistamines in the treatment of
      eosinophilic esophagitis.

      The purpose of this research is to determine if antihistamines are safe and effective for the
      treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Antihistamines are frequently used for the treatment
      of gastroesophageal reflux disease and allergic disorders, and we hypothesize they will be
      effective in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis as well. The two antihistamines used
      in this study are loratadine and famotidine.
