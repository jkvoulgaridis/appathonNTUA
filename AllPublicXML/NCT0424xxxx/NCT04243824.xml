  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate Ga-68 MAA distribution on PET/MRI after
      injection into the prostatic arteries in patients without prostate cancer who are being
      treated with prostate artery embolization for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

      Participants: Study subjects will be 5 men scheduled to undergo the PAE procedure at UNC
      Hospital for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

      Procedures (methods): Study subjects will undergo PAE using the standard technique. Prior to
      embolization of the prostatic artery with the bland embolic agent, Ga-68 MAA will be
      injected. Standard departmental radiation protection procedures will be followed. After the
      PAE procedure is complete, the patient will be transported to the UNC Biomedical Research
      Imaging Center to undergo PET/MRI.

      This study is an initial proof of concept evaluation to determine the feasibility of using
      Y-90 radioembolization performed using the Sniper balloon occlusion microcatheter to treat
      localized prostate cancer. This will be performed by evaluating Ga-68 MAA distribution on
      PET/MRI after injection into the prostatic arteries in patients without prostate cancer who
      are being treated with prostate artery embolization for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The
      distribution of the radiotracer activity within the prostate and any activity in adjacent
      organs will be determined for when the tracer is injected into the central prostatic
      arteries.
