  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to create a reference database of digital cognitive assessment data in
      combination with neuroimaging data of patients with mild cognitive impairment. The
      investigators will explore and derive correlations between parameters from routine MRI images
      and brain volumetric analysis and the digital cognitive data to identify parameters that are
      relevant to classify MCI patients vs preexisting healthy control data.

    <description>Philips IntelliSpace Cognition (ISC) is a digital assessment platform that supports Healthcare Professionals (HCP) in assessing the cognition of individuals. It consists of two interfaces connected to the DCDx-module in the cloud. ISC is hosted on the Philips Health Suite Digital Platform (HSDP). The first interface is the patient's interface and is presented via a tablet to collect data on how the patient performs a series of tests. The second interface is the clinician's interface and can be used on any PC or tablet. It allows for assessments to be selected and administered, observations made, data analytics performed and the generation of a report.</description>
