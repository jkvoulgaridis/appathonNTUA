  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary study objective is to evaluate the optimization of Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS)
      energy settings for lesion clearance of Seborrheic Keratosis (SKs) from off-facial areas of
      healthy adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Evaluate lesion clearance rate of SKs in off-face locations post-treatment versus
           baseline using multiple sized treatment tips with microneedles.

        -  Evaluate the clearance of the treated SKs using multiple energy settings at various time
           points initial procedure, compared baseline.

        -  Evaluate skin effects and adverse event rate.
