  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is the safety and tolerability of administering a vaccine
      targeting the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion kinase, in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in
      patients with unresectable or metastatic FLC and to assess the T-cell response.
