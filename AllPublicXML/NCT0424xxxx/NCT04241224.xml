        Participants must meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study:

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Ability and willingness to give written informed consent and comply with follow-up
             requirements

          2. PAD with Rutherford Class 2-4

          3. Stenotic lesion(s) in the peripheral vasculature

          4. Subject is a candidate for atherectomy for infrainguinal peripheral artery disease

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Target vessel with documented stenosis by angiography ≥70%

          2. Target vessel ≤ 3.0 mm in diameter

          3. Target Lesion ≤ 25cm in length

          4. The lesion to be treated is not severely calcified

          5. Untreated ipsilateral iliac stenosis ≤70% (or tortuosity that might prevent advancing
             sheath to lesion)

          6. No use of another atherectomy device in the same procedure

          7. Treatment site is not located in a graft

          8. Treatment site is not in, or distal to, a previously placed stent

          9. No flow limiting dissection proximal, distal, or in the target lesion (prior to the
             use of the investigational device)

        Participants meeting any of the exclusion criteria at the time of enrollment (index
        procedure/ intervention) will be excluded from study participation:

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Age below 22 years

          2. Pregnant, breastfeeding, planning to become pregnant. If women of reproductive
             capability will be enrolled, status will be assessed via pregnancy testing. Subject
             must agree to use effective birth control measures for duration of study. Pregnancy
             during study must be reported immediately.

          3. Myocardial infarction (MI) ≤ 60 days prior to procedure

          4. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) ≤ 60 days prior to procedure

          5. Endovascular or surgical procedure ≤ 30 Days prior to procedure or a planned
             endovascular or surgical procedure within 30 days after the index procedure

          6. Disorders or allergies precluding use of radiographic contrast including renal
             insufficiency severe enough to contraindicate use of radiographic contrast

          7. Subjects in whom anti-platelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic therapy is
             contraindicated

          8. Life expectancy ≤ 12 months

          9. Patient is participating in another investigational drug or device study
