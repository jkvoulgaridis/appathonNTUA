    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of aducanumab
      after a wash-out period imposed by discontinuation of feeder studies in participants who had
      previously received aducanumab (i.e. previously treated participants) or who had previously
      received placebo (i.e. treatment-na√Øve participants).

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization, significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria: -

          -  Any medical or neurological condition (other than Alzheimer's Disease) that might be a

             clinically significant conduction abnormalities within 1 year prior to Screening.

          -  A seizure event that occurred after stopping the feeder study and before Screening for
             this study.

          -  Evidence of impaired liver function as shown by an abnormal liver function profile at
             Screening.

          -  History of or known seropositivity for HIV.

          -  Clinically significant systemic illness or serious infection within 30 days prior to
             or during Screening.
