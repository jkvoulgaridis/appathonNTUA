      This Phase III study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of YH25448 as
      first-line treatment in locally advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
      patients with EGFR mutations
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      YH25448 is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective and irreversible EGFR Tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) that targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while
      sparing wild type EGFR.

      This is a Phase III, Randomized, Double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      YH25448 (240 mg orally, once daily) versus Gefitinib (250 mg orally, once daily) in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is known to be EGFR sensitizing mutation
      (EGFRm) positive, treatment-naïve and eligible for first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI.

    <time_frame>EORTC-QLQ-C30 analysis will occur when OS maturity is observed at approximately 45 months from the first patient being randomized</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 items and measures cancer patients' functioning (health related quality of life (HRQoL)) and symptoms for all cancer types. Questions can be grouped into 5 multi item functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social); 3 multi item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting); a 2 item global HRQoL scale; 5 single items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea) and 1 item on the financial impact of the disease.
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.
a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning
a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL
but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-LC13 includes questions assessing cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, site specific pain (symptoms), sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia (treatment related side effects), and pain medication.
The items on both measures were scaled and scored using the recommended EORTC procedures. Raw scores were transformed to a linear scale ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a higher level of functioning or higher level of symptoms. Provided at least half of the items in the scale were completed, the scale score was calculated using only those items for which values existed.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D comprises the following two questionnaires:
The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension comprises five levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problem, severe problem, unable/extreme problems).
The EQ VAS records the patients self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0-100) visual analogue scale. The patient's self-rated health is assessed on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) by the EQ-VAS.</description>
