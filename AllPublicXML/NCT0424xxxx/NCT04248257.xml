  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our trial will recruit young adult female relatives (YARs) of male or female carriers of
      BRCA1/2. YARs who consent to participate will be randomized to either a 3-session peer
      coach-led telephone counseling intervention or usual care navigation to peer support
      interventions provided by community organizations that support the hereditary cancer
      community. Study aims are to 1) Assess intervention effects on distress and decision making
      outcomes, including uptake of counseling for untested YARs, 2) Identify YARs most likely to
      engage with and benefit from the intervention, 3) Understand intervention mechanisms.
      Participants will complete interviews at baseline, 1, 6, and 12 months.
