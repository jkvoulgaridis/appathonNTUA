  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening and enrollment are temporarily on hold due to COVID-19.

      The purpose of the phase 1 portion (dose escalation) of the study will be to establish an
      optimally safe and biologically active recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or to determine
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for gilteritinib in sequential combination with fludarabine,
      cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG). The purpose of the phase 2
      portion (dose expansion) is to determine complete remission (CR) rates and composite complete
      remission (CRc) rates after two cycles of therapy. The study will also assess safety,
      tolerability and toxicities of gilteritinib in combination with FLAG, evaluate FLT3
      inhibition, assess pharmacokinetics (PK), perform serial measurements of minimal residual
      disease, obtain preliminary estimates of 1-year event free survival (EFS) and overall
      survival (OS) rate and assess the acceptability as well as palatability of the formulation.

      One cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment. A participant completing 2 cycles in phase 1 or
      2 will have the option to participate in long term treatment (LTT) with gilteritinib (for up
      to 2 years).

    <measure>Number of participants with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) (phase 1/dose escalation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as any of the events meeting the DLT criteria that occur during the observation period and that is considered to be possibly or probably related to gilteritinib.
Nonhematologic Dose-limiting Toxicity will be defined as grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity attributable to gilteritinib that persists for &gt; 48 hours without resolution to grade ≤ 2, will have gilteritinib dosing interrupted. Exceptions include the toxicities commonly seen with intensive AML reinduction regimens.
Hematologic Dose-limiting Toxicity will be defined as failure to recover a peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 500/μL and non-transfusion dependent platelet count &gt; 20000/μL due to documented bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia for greater than or equal to 50 days from the start of cycle 1 day 1.
Failure to recover peripheral counts due to disease involvement of the bone marrow will not be considered dose-limiting toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Complete Remission (CR) rate after 2 cycles of therapy (phase 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days</time_frame>
    <description>CR rate is defined as the number of participants who achieve the best response of CR divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. Complete remission is defined as having bone marrow regenerating normal hematopoietic cells and achieving a morphologic leukemia-free state and must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x 10^9/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L and normal marrow differential with &lt; 5% blasts, and they will be red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independent (defined as 1 week without RBC transfusion and 1 week without platelet transfusion).

Complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) is defined as achieving CR except for incomplete hematological recovery with residual neutropenia &lt; 1 x 10^9/L with or without complete platelet recovery at a post baseline visit. Red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independence is not required.</description>
