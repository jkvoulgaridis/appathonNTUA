  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity in both healthy volunteers and volunteers with
      chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Healthy volunteers will be administered either a single
      oral dose or multiple oral doses of ATI-2173 and assessed for safety and tolerability
      including blood tests to show how the body metabolizes and eliminates the investigational
      drug. Volunteers with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B virus infection will be administered
      multiple oral doses of ATI-2173 and assessed for safety and tolerability including blood
      tests to show how the body metabolizes and eliminates the investigational drug as well as how
      the drug effects the virus infection.
