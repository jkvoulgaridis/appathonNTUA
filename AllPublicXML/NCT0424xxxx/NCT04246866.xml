  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for intravitreal (IVT)
      administration of GEM103 in subjects with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry AMD.
      Safety and tolerability of a single dose of GEM103 will be assessed based on the occurrence
      of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Each subject will be followed for safety, pharmacokinetic
      (PK), clinical, and biomarker evaluations. Three escalating dose cohorts are planned.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation study in subjects
      with GA secondary to dry AMD to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD),
      and immunogenicity of IVT injections of GEM103 to a single eye in genetically defined
      subjects.

      The study is designed to identify the MTD for IVT administration of GEM103. Safety and
      tolerability of a single dose of GEM103 will be assessed based on the occurrence of DLTs.
      Three escalating dose cohorts are planned.

      Once determined to be genetically eligible, subjects will undergo clinical and ophthalmic
      assessments for inclusion eligibility into the study. Enrolled subjects will receive GEM103
      and be followed for safety, PK, clinical, and biomarker evaluations.
