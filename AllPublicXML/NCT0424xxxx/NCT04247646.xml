  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioid misuse and its associated negative effects have become an epidemic in the
      United States, and post-operative opioid use contributes to this terrible problem.
      Alternative strategies to opioid prescribing are thus highly sought after in the
      post-operative setting. Importantly, sleep and pain have a bi-directional relationship, and
      inadequate or impaired sleep regularly occur following orthopedic operations. Melatonin is an
      endogenous sleep hormone that can be administered exogenously, and that has been shown to
      have some potential as an analgesic agent. Here, using the premise that melatonin may improve
      sleep and pain in the post-operative setting, the investigators propose a randomized clinical
      trial in 120 participants undergoing total knee arthroplasties. Patients will be randomized
      to receive either sublingual melatonin 5 mg or matched placebo starting on post-operative day
      (POD) 0 and through POD . The investigators will measure post-operative opioid usage as the
      primary outcome, and post-operative pain scores as a secondary outcome. The primary safety
      outcome will be sedation level, as measured by the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS).
      Sleep will be measured objectively using wrist-worn actigraphy. Participants will be followed
      through POD 28, and will also have baseline data on sleep, pain, and cognition obtained prior
      to surgery.
