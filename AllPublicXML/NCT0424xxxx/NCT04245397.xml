    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLT), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SX-682 in the treatment of patients
      with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive twice daily oral SX-682 for six 28 day cycles. If patients are
      responding well to the treatment they can continue SX-682 treatment. The first participants
      will be administered 25 mg orally twice daily. Unless dose limiting toxicities occur,
      participants will enroll and receive the following increasing twice daily doses of SX-682: 50
      mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg.

      After establishing the maximum tolerated dose 40 additional participants will be enrolled at
      the maximum tolerated dose (or at the highest dose studied if a maximum tolerated dose is not
      identified). Participants will receive continuous SX-682 twice daily oral therapy in 28-day
      cycles for a total of 6 cycles. For patients responding well at the end of 6 cycles treatment
      may continue until disease progression or an adverse event leads to SX-682 discontinuation.
      Except for blood product transfusions, concurrent therapy for Myelodysplastic Syndromes is
      not permitted.

    <intervention_model_description>In this sequential model initially participant groups will enroll to receive SX-682 for six 28 day cycles in a dose escalation phase. A 3 + 3 participant design will be used to determine the safe dose. After 6 cycles at the specified dose of SX-682, SX-682 treatment can be continued. Once the safe dose level of SX-682 is determined, then participants will be enrolled at the this safe dose level of SX-682 in an expansion phase.</intervention_model_description>
