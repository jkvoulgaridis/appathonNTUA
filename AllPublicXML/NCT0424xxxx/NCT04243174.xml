  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA) can play a vital and an independent role in type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
      management care. Health research studies have shown evidence that PA can improve glycaemic
      control and glucose levels. PA is first line of self-care management recommended to patients
      with T2DM and most patients fail to perform the regular PA. It is always important for health
      providers to find better methods in encouraging and incentivizing PA in T2DM patients. Mobile
      phone messaging-based interventions have been shown to strengthen the delivery of health
      information and self-care management programs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have employed this as a tool for promoting T2DM self-care management interventions
      such as physical activity, glucose monitoring, medication adherence and nutrition. Despite
      the increasing number of these interventions globally, the effectiveness of mobile phone
      messaging-based interventions in Saudi Arabia context remains inconclusive and inconsistent.
      There is limited research conducted in this region. Therefore, there is a need for more
      studies to show evidence to ascertain the effectiveness of using mobile phone messaging to
      promote PA in T2DM patients in the context of Saudi Arabia.

Moderate
More days of vigorous activity of at least 20 minutes per day.
3. High
Vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days and accumulating at least 1500MET-minutes/week.</description>
