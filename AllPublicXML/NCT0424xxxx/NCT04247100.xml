  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if using a micro-current through a device called a TENS
      (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator) unit helps to improve functional
      gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) symptoms in children by stimulation of the vagus nerve. The
      study will compare two methods of stimulation to determine if there is a difference in the
      two methods.

    <intervention_model_description>30 participants will be enrolled in this double-blind sham control study. Fifteen participants will undergo sham stimulation for 4 weeks followed by active microstimulation for 4 weeks. The other 15 participants will have active microstimulation for all 8 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be sent home at baseline with a TENS unit and a sealed envelope with instructions for device settings. The envelope will contain instructions for either sham stimulation or active stimulation (unknown to the performing coordinator and participant). Both groups will receive a new device and another set of instructions from the study team at 4 weeks. It is possible and permitted that the performing study coordinator will become aware of which group the subject is in when checking in on the subject.</masking_description>

    <measure>Functional Disability Inventory (Child and Adolescent)</measure>
    <time_frame>At date of baseline assessment (beginning of therapy). Also assessed at follow-up visit after receiving first 4 weeks therapy ,and at follow-up visit after 8 weeks of therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Disability Inventory (FDI) Child and Adolescent questionnaire will be used to assess change in symptoms. Participants will rank physical trouble or difficulty completing 15 different daily activities (Eating regular meals, Being at school all day, Walking up stairs, etc.) on a scale of 0-4 (No trouble - Impossible). Higher scores indicate more difficulty functioning due to physical health.</description>

    <time_frame>At date of baseline assessment (beginning of therapy). Also assessed at follow-up visit after receiving first 4 weeks therapy ,and at follow-up visit after 8 weeks of therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom Intensity Questionnaire score will be used to identify the most prominent 5 complaints rated in a 10 cm Likert scale the intensity form. Patients will write in each of their top 5 most severe symptoms on the corresponding line. They will then rate the symptoms severity from none (0 cm) to worst you can possibly imagine (10 cm) by placing a vertical line on the scale.</description>

    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale Child form (PCS-C) will be completed by the participant. The PCS-C is a modification of the adult Pain Catastrophizing Scale for use in children, measuring pain-related cognitions and the dimensions of helplessness, rumination and magnification. Participants rate how strong their feelings are about pain on a 5 point scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of pain catastrophizing.</description>

    <measure>Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At date of baseline assessment (beginning of therapy). Also assessed at follow-up visit after receiving first 4 weeks therapy ,and at follow-up visit after 8 weeks of therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) assesses children grades 3 to 12 containing subscales assessing for symptoms of Separation Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder. Participants rate frequency of occurrence (how often do you feel x) on a 4 point scale ranging from 'Never' to 'Always'.</description>

    <measure>Functional Disability Inventory (Parent)</measure>
    <time_frame>At date of baseline assessment (beginning of therapy). Also assessed at follow-up visit after receiving first 4 weeks therapy ,and at follow-up visit after 8 weeks of therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Disability Inventory (FDI) Parent questionnaire will be used to assess change in the participants symptoms as rated by the participants parent/guardian. Parents will rank their child's physical trouble or difficulty completing 15 different daily activities (Eating regular meals, Being at school all day, Walking up stairs, etc.) on a scale of 0-4 (No trouble - Impossible). Higher scores indicate more difficulty functioning due to physical health.</description>

    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale Parent form (PCS-P) will be completed by the parent or guardian of the participant. The PCS-P is a proxy questionnaire to the PCS-C, measuring the feelings the parent has when their child is in pain. Parents rate how strongly they feel when their child is in pain on a 5 point scale. Higher score indicate higher levels of pain catastrophizing.</description>
