    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bipolar fractional
      radiofrequency treatment via use of the Profound System to achieve lift in lax submental
      (beneath the chin) and neck tissue, and to also study the device's effect on elastic and
      other extracellular matrix proteins.

      A multi-center, blinded, non-randomized, non-controlled study

      Up to 60 eligible participants will be enrolled at up to three (3) sites. Participants will
      receive one (1) treatment in the submental/neck area. Participants will complete follow-up
      visits for clinical evaluation at Day 14, 1 Month, 3 Month, and 6 Months after the study
      treatment. Standard photography will be obtained at Screening to the 6 Month follow-up, and
      3D photography will be obtained at Screening, Month 3, and Month 6 visit.
