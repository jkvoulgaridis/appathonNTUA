  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD occurs in as many as 17% of US military Veterans and is associated with a host of
      negative, long-term consequences to the individual, their families, and society at large.
      EBPs, such as Prolonged Exposure, result in clinically significant symptom relief for many.
      Yet, these therapies have proven less effective for military personnel and Veterans and
      treatment dropout rates are high. The investigators' team surveyed Veterans initiating EBPs
      for PTSD and a family member across four VA medical centers (N = 598; Project HomeFront). The
      investigators found that Veterans were more than twice as likely to complete EBPs when loved
      ones encouraged them to confront distress and that Veterans experienced greater treatment
      gains when they shared more with their loved ones about their treatment. A couples-based,
      exposure therapy for PTSD that integrates intimate partners into every session of PE could
      provide the opportunity to mobilize the whole household in the service of EBP engagement,
      while extending the goals of therapy beyond symptom reduction to family functioning. The
      investigators anticipate this intervention will teach couples to embrace a lifestyle that
      supports confronting trauma-related distress, so the Veteran and his/her family can achieve
      optimal functional outcomes.

      The investigators aim to improve the mental health, family functioning, and well-being of
      Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through developing and evaluating a
      trauma-focused, couple therapy for PTSD. The investigators will use strategies from
      Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (ICBT) to help intimate partners support Veterans
      during exposure therapy for PTSD (Prolonged Exposure; PE). The investigators anticipate this
      approach will increase Veterans' engagement in PE, but also improve relationship functioning,
      family functioning, and social functioning. Family involvement has been highlighted as a
      fertile avenue for improving the outcomes for patients with PTSD, yet families are
      infrequently integrated into evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs). The investigators' goals
      are highly consistent with RR&amp;D's mission to promote research that leverages family support
      as a pathway to reintegration and optimizes meaningful recovery and functioning.

      Objectives. The investigators will complete stages 1A and 1B of the Stage Model of Treatment
      Development. Specifically, the investigators will: (1) Expand the treatment outline using
      content experts and feedback from key stakeholders (Veterans, intimate partners, providers,
      and VA mental health leadership). (2) Conduct a pilot open trial to assess (a) the
      acceptability of treatment components, structure, and materials, (b) the feasibility of the
      intervention (retention and intervention fidelity), and (c) the study approach (screening,
      recruitment, and assessment process). (3) Explore the preliminary effects of the intervention
      on select outcomes including overall functioning, mental health functioning, social
      functioning, family functioning, and potential mechanisms (social control, subjective norms,
      and the degree to which Veterans rely on their partners for support).

      Methods: To accomplish Aim 1, the investigators will expand the outline for the intervention
      into an initial treatment manual through meetings with content experts and stakeholder
      feedback. Next, the investigators will develop fidelity checklists and revise the treatment
      manual through conducting the intervention with 2-3 couples. To accomplish Aims 2 and 3, the
      investigators will evaluate the intervention in a non-randomized, open trial with 10 Veterans
      diagnosed with PTSD and their intimate partners. Veterans will complete baseline and
      posttreatment structured diagnostic interviews. Both members of the couple will complete
      baseline surveys, posttreatment surveys, and posttreatment qualitative exit interviews. Using
      data obtained from the open trial, the investigators will assess the intervention's
      acceptability, feasibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. Upon completion of this proposal, the
      investigators will be well positioned to apply for Merit funding for a randomized clinical
      trial (Stage 2 of the Stage Model of Treatment Development) of this innovative, exposure
      based, couple therapy.
