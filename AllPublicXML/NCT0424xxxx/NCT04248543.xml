  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI)
      can objectively measure changes in the tumor/vertebral body and adjacent spinal cord
      following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for painful metastatic spine disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic spine disease (MSD) can result in considerable morbidity from pain, spinal cord
      compromise and neurologic disability. Recent developments in image-guidance and
      immobilization have enabled more accurate target localization, which allows methods of
      precise high-dose radiation delivery such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT
      carries potential risks of radiation induced myelopathy (RIM) and vertebral compression
      fracture (VCF). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive imaging modality that may be
      able to detect radiation-induced damage in the vertebral body or spinal cord following SBRT.
      Quantitative MR-based imaging methods may also help to quantify treatment response and help
      predict subsequent outcomes such as tumor control and VCF risk.
