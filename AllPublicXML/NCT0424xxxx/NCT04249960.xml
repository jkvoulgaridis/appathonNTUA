  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disruption of care during transition from child and adolescent mental health (CAMHS) to adult
      mental health services (AMHS) may adversely affect the health and well-being of service
      users. Indeed, transition-related discontinuity of care is a major health and societal
      challenge today. Current evidences show that this transition is not always properly managed
      and that improving the transition process can have a positive impact on the health and
      wellbeing of young people. Nevertheless, data available are still inconsistent and only few
      studies investigated possible models aimed at improving and operationalize the transition. At
      present, no information concerning the transition in the Geneva Canton is available.

      According to this lack of evidence, the current study aims at: 1) mapping the CAMHS/AMHS
      interface; 2) evaluating the longitudinal course and outcomes of adolescents approaching the
      transition boundary (TB) of their CAMHS; 3) determining the effectiveness of an experimental
      model of managed transition in improving outcomes, compared with usual care; 4) comparing
      these results with those of the EU funded MILESTONE study from several other European
      countries.

      The investigators will recruit all patients aged ≥ 16 years and 6 months from the Geneva
      Canton in charge at CAMHS and they will follow them for up to 24 months. CAMHS will be
      instructed to provide all their service users at the time of transition either usual care or
      a novel service called &quot;Managed Transition&quot;, which will include the use of a new decision
      support tool, the Transition Readiness and Appropriateness Measure (TRAM). A nested cohort
      Randomised Controlled Trial (ncRCT) design will be applied to divide patients into the two
      groups. The health and wellbeing of the young people will be assessed at baseline and then
      followed-up for 24 months to see whether they transition to AMHS or are discharged or
      referred to some other service. The investigators will then evaluate what impact the
      different transition experiences have on young people's health and wellbeing, and whether the
      process of Managed Transition has any benefits as compared to usual care.
