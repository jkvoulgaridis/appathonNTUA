  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ageing of the population is accompanied by the problem of chronic pathologies and
      sometimes heavy dependence, requiring admission to Nursing Homes (NHs). Approximately 660,000
      people currently live in NHs in France. One out of 3 NHs does not have a coordinating doctor,
      even though the law requires it, and access to care in these NHs is very unequal nationally
      and especially in the Limousin and Dordogne regions. Some Hospices may find themselves in a
      situation where there is no coordinating doctor and difficult access to General Practitioners
      (GPs) visiting a large area.

      This inequality of access to care results in a difference in care that can go as far as a
      loss of opportunity for residents who are immediately transferred to the emergency department
      (ED) with a risk of iatrogeny or delirium once in the ED or a risk of inappropriate
      hospitalization.

      Residents are hospitalized:

        -  when the latter could have been avoided because the health care team, not knowing what
           attitude to adopt, prioritized hospitalization

        -  Late because the resident waited for the attending physician to come, which resulted in
           a worsening of symptoms.

      The arrival of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an opportunity to find new models of care
      organization that can mitigate medical desertification but also develop advanced practices in
      gerontology. For example, nurses will be able to intervene at a first level for early
      detection, better triage and early management of certain pathologies.

      The &quot;MEDVIR society&quot; AI, developed by a French company, is a medical decision support system
      with Artificial Intelligence and offers pre-diagnosis based on the information collected
      (medical and surgical history, concomitant treatments and symptoms). MEDVIR is a diagnostic
      aid tool and does not replace the doctor who remains at the end of the chain, the final
      decision-maker.

      Before research is conducted to integrate this technology into routine care, it is important
      to validate the diagnostic relevance of AI in the elderly, as it has been validated in the
      general population.

      This pilot feasibility study will then enable us to methodologically dimension a future
      project to evaluate the efficiency of this new care system in the management of elderly
      patients in medical deserts in France.

    <description>Initial evaluation by the Nurse using the AI tool which enters into MEDVIR the patient's symptoms or functional complaints and comorbidities and is complemented by a telemedicine solution for data transmission to the remote tele-expert physician located in a regulatory center or health center. The remote doctor (a geriatrician from &quot;Prevention Care for Elderly Unit (UPSAV) platform&quot; of the Clinical Gerontology Division of the Limoges University Hospital) analyses the data collected by the Nurse and establishes a symptom severity criterion and a diagnosis with the help of the AI technology.
Both the geriatrician and the NHs nurse are not aware of the proposals made by AI.
The geriatrician can nevertheless initiate a visit to the resident's place of residence in order to verify the information necessary to establish the diagnosis and thus improve the relevance of the algorithm. For the resident, this study doesn't interfere with the usual care.</description>
