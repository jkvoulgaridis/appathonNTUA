  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to utilize physical activity monitoring to determine the trajectory
      of normal recovery as it relates to a patient's ability to get up and get moving. From this
      work, we hope to be able to define the range in patients' physical activity following knee
      replacement surgery, and thus, give clinicians a tool and the methodology to identify
      patients whose recovery is not progressing as quickly as expected. Data from physical
      activity monitors will allow the research team to identify how active patients are, how
      vigorous that activity is, and how well that activity correlates with standard and commonly
      used patient questionnaires.

    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study of the physical activity levels of adults who have been
      diagnosed with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee and are undergoing knee replacement
      surgery at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Data regarding patient activity and
      functional recovery will be collected using two methods. First, data will be collected
      through the extraction of three-axis accelerometer data, collected via a wrist-worn (and
      hip-worn for a subset of patients) physical activity monitor. This data will be collected in
      three intervals: pre-operatively, immediately postoperatively, and at 6 months
      postoperatively. Secondly, data will be collected by standard clinical assessment and patient
      reported outcome measures. These assessments will again take place pre-operatively, at 6
      weeks postoperatively, and at 6 months postoperatively. Additional data will be collected
      through a simple activity diary, which asks the participants to log their monitor wear-time
      along with the times that they took bicycle rides or extended walks.

      The expected duration of patient involvement is up to a total of 8 to 8.5 weeks over the
      course of up to 7 months. There are no clinical visits within this protocol beyond what is
      already within normal patient care. Patients will be asked to post their monitor back to the
      research centre for data collection and data processing twice during the study period.

      The aim of this study is to assess the trajectory of recovery in terms of physical activity
      in the post-operative knee replacement population, and subsequently to define the expected
      path of early recovery.

    <time_frame>Pre-operative (baseline), 6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient reported outcome measure to assess patient benefit. As summary index score from 0 to 1 is given, where 0 is the health state equivalent to dead, 1 is a full healthy outcome, and negative indicates a health state worse than dead. The score is derived from five sections (Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, Anxiety/Depression) scored 1 to 5, with higher corresponding to better outcomes. A second visual analogue score for perceived health is reported from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better perceived overall health.</description>
