  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to find out whether there exists a correlation between such
      important characteristic of individual's hand performance as grip strength, pinch strength,
      and the hand reaction. In addition, it will be investigated whether there is a change in
      normative values of this age group in relation to modern lifestyle. The study includes
      statistical data analysis and interpretation of the derived outcomes.

      Objective: To investigate correlation between grip force, pinch strength and hand reaction in
      a group of post-millennial in Central Anatolia, and also to provide a comparison to
      previously available results on millennial.

      Methods: Experimental data were collected by healthy subjects, who are university students.
      The sample comprises females and males, consented to participate in the study. The ages of
      the subjects will range from 18 to 25 years. Grip strength will measure with hand dynamometer
      and pinch strength will measure with pinch meter. Hand reaction will test with the Ruler Drop
      Test.

      For each subject, body mass, height and hand preference will be record. The study will be
      completed in accordance with the norms of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
      ethics committee of the University of Atilim (Turkey).

      The collected data will be undergone statistical analysis to extract any feasible
      conclusions. First, the correlation coefficients will be found to determine whether there is
      a noticable relationship between the independent variables grip strength and pinch strength
      versus the dependent variable ruler drop test. The calculated sample correlation coefficients
      have been tested for the significance.

    <description>The participants will sit upright on a chair with their feet supported. The tested arm will positioned on a table with the shoulders slightly abducted and neutrally rotated, the elbow in 90° of flexion, the forearm in 0° between pronation and supination, and the wrist in neutral resting position. The grip strength of both hands will measured using the Hand Dynamometer. Results will be evaluated in kilograms.</description>

    <description>During the test, the students had to sit having the upper arm forming an angle of 90 degrees with the mid forearm, which lies on a flat horizontal table surface. The hand is required to be open and positioned at the edge of the surface. Results will be evaluated in cm.</description>

The tested arm was positioned on a table with the shoulders slightly abducted and neutrally rotated, the elbow in 90° of flexion, the forearm in 0° between pronation and supination, and the wrist in neutral resting position. The participants were instructed to maintain that position during the test. The grip strength of both hands was measured using the Hand Dynamometer
3. Pinch Strength Participants were seated at a table on which the dynamometers were positioned.
The subjects were told to keep their elbow flexed without resting their arm or the grip handle of the dynamometer.</description>
