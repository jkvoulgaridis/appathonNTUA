  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the instruments used in translational studies related to cognition have proved to
      be inaccurate. For this reason, the objective of this study is to evaluate whether the
      Bordeaux Maze Test has adequate psychometric properties and is valid for its use to compare
      trials tested in preclinical (animal) studies and clinical population with Down syndrome.
      Specifically, it is intended to study the domains of memory (relational memory) and executive
      functions (work memory), both relevant in the cognitive functioning of the population with
      Down syndrome.

             disorder). Participation are allowed as long as they are considered stable and their
             medication with a regime that does not change in the 6 weeks prior to enrolment and
