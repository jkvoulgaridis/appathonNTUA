  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate two ways to help people re-engage with healthcare. The first is
      to assess if providing HIV treatment on the first visit (or within 1 week) can help people
      re-engage with care and ultimately stay in care after 24 and 48 weeks. It will also assess
      the success of starting treatment immediately by measuring the HIV virus in people's
      bloodstream after 24 and 48 weeks.

      The second part of this study is to assess a new behavioral treatment called
      60-Minutes-for-Health which aims to help people identify and overcome barriers to HIV care,
      to help with motivation maintaining in care, to help cope with negative feelings about HIV,
      and to help increase self-reliance in seeking healthcare amid other things that are happening
      in your life.

    <textblock>
      The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to cause significant illness and death in
      the USA despite availability of effective treatment. People who are aware of their HIV
      status, but who are out of care and not on medications, are therefore at risk of developing
      HIV related health problems. In addition, people with HIV who are out of care are at greater
      risk of transmitting HIV compared to people on HIV treatment with suppressed levels of virus
      in plasma. To date, there are no interventions that have been shown to successfully link this
      &quot;out of care&quot; population back into care and successfully maintain viral suppression.

      This study will test a strategy of providing immediate HIV therapy drugs, linkage to care,
      and a randomized intervention (60-minutes for health or diet and nutrition session). The goal
      of the study is to demonstrate that the 60-Minutes-for-Health intervention improves the rate
      of viral suppression at 24 weeks.

      The use of rapid antiretroviral therapy (rapid ART), defined as the initiation of ART within
      7 days of HIV diagnosis, has been associated with improved rates of linkage to care,
      retention in care and virological suppression after 1 year among persons newly diagnoses with
      HIV. In addition, the behavioral intervention, &quot;60-Minutes-for-Health&quot;, was shown in a pilot
      study to improve retention in care among PWH-OOC. We aim to undertake a study to evaluate the
      feasibility of providing rapid-ART to people who are aware of their HIV status, but have been
      out of care at the time they re-engage in care. In addition, study participants will be
      randomized to either the &quot;60-Minutes-for-Health&quot; intervention or a 60 minute diet and
      nutrition control session.

Mean scores for the seven acceptability metrics below will be computed for the total sample and each study arm (intervention, control).Among a subset of participants enrolled in four focus groups (10 participants each) will be held. Our interview guide will elicit feedback on the seven theory-based acceptability/feasibility metrics:affective attitudes towards rapid ART,perceived burden or reasons for discontinuation/dropout, perceived effectiveness, potential consequences (ethical, unintended, or side-effects) of rapid ART,willingness to participate in rapid ART,perceived costs (financial,social,emotional,physical) of rapid ART,perceived user experiences and satisfaction with rapid ART.</description>

    <description>60-Minutes-for Health: this is a psychological intervention which seeks to correct factors underlying decisions to delay or avoid HIV care and strengthen abilities to overcome HIV care utilization barriers. This is achieved through assistance identifying and reducing misinformation guiding HIV care attendance decisions; enhancing motivation to maintain HIV care via personal health goals; building skills for coping with negative feelings related to living with HIV; and increasing self-efficacy for navigating structural barriers and maintaining HIV care amidst competing priorities.</description>

        1. Potential subjects from UCSD Owen Clinic that fulfill the entry criteria will be
             contacted and offered an appointment for study recruitment

          2. Subjects identified in the UCSD emergency department HIV screening program will be
             contacted and offered an appointment for study recruitment

          3. San Diego Public Health Department (SDPHD) has implemented routine evaluations of
             their local HIV surveillance data in conjunction with other data to identify PWH who
             may be OOC33. This Data to Care program results in the evaluation of ~ 250 new cases
             per year in San Diego (~20-21 PWH-OOC a month), many of whom are found to be viremic
             and out-of-care. Once located, SDPHD will offer immediate transportation vouchers
             (Lyft) to and from the AVRC to expedite study enrollment and rapid ART start.

             infection);

          -  Prior ART regimens that in the opinion of the investigator precludes selection of a
             treatment option likely to result in virologic suppression (e.g. documented treatment
