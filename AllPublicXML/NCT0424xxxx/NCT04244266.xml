  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in the world represents a growing share of the general population. At hospital, the
      management of these patients could be problematic especially when calculating the drug
      dosage.

      According to the French guidelines, neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, should be used
      to reverse a residual neuromuscular blockade at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg of total body weight in
      non-obese patients. In morbidly-obese patients, with the modification of the fat/lean mass
      ratio, the optimal dose of neostigmine is non-consensual. To calculate the dose of
      neostigmine, some anesthesiologists use the total body weight, others use the ideal body
      weight and others use the adjusted body weight.

      Due to this practice variability, It may be useful to observe the mean time to recovery of
      neuromuscular blockade and side effects after pharmacological reversal according to the
      dosage of neostigmine.
