  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether radiotherapy combined with Temozolomide is
      more effective than radiotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with refractory pituitary
      adenomas. The Basic treatment was Radiotherapy over a period of six weeks, for a total dose
      of 54 Gy. The150 participants were randomized to use either radiotherapy plus Temozolomide
      (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the
      last day of radiotherapy), or radiotherapy plus placebo for 6 weeks. After a 4-week break,
      followed by six cycles of placebo or adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter
      for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was Objective Response rate, the
      second end point was PFS. Greater response was anticipated in patients treated with
      Temozolomide+ radiotherapy than radiotherapy alone.

      The purpose of this study was to determine whether radiotherapy combined with Temozolomide is
      more effective than radiotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with refractory pituitary
      adenomas. The Basic treatment was Radiotherapy, which is consisted of fractionated focal
      irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy per fraction given once daily five days per week (Monday
      through Friday) over a period of six weeks, for a total dose of 54 Gy. The150 participants
      were randomized to use either radiotherapy plus Temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of
      body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy),
      or radiotherapy plus placebo for 6 weeks. After a 4-week break, patients were then to receive
      up to six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide or placebo according to the standard 5-day schedule
      every 28 days. The dose was 150 mg per square meter for the first cycle and was increased to
      200 mg per square meter beginning with the second cycle, so long as there were no hematologic
      toxic effects followed by six cycles of placebo or adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per
      square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was Objective
      Response rate, the second end point was PFS. Greater response was anticipated in patients
      treated with Temozolomide+ radiotherapy than radiotherapy alone.
