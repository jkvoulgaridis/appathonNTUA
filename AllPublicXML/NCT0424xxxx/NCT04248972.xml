  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic illness characterized by the presence of generalised
      musculoskeletal pain among other symptoms, which reduce the quality of life of the patient.
      To develop an integral and global treatment to improve the quality of life in those with FM
      is still challenging. Therefore, new non invasive clinical interventions are needed to
      improve quality of life in those with FM. Low-level laser therapy has been shown to reduce
      pain immediately after treatment in acute neck pain and up to 22 weeks after completion of
      treatment in patients with chronic neck pain. Moreover, positive effects have been reported
      with red light therapy on muscle fatigue, improvement of exercise performance and markers
      related to exercise recovery, and thus showing its potential use in clinical practice.

      There are no studies using red light therapy in the whole body with the aim of
      photoregulation (PBM) in FM patients, and this may lead to promising results.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PBM on the main symptoms such as
      pain, quality of life, functionality, catastrophization, self efficacy and quality of soft
      tissue in the treatment of FM.

    <time_frame>time (t) 1(prior to treatment), t2(immediately after treatment) t3 (3 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire&quot; will be used. In this excerpt from the Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, the individual is asked to complete a self-explanatory, brief four-item query of usual leisure-time exercise habits.
For the first question, weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities are multiplied by nine, five, and three, respectively. Total weekly leisure activity is calculated in arbitrary units by summing the products of the separate components, as shown in the following formula: Weekly leisure activity score = (9 × Strenuous) + (5 × Moderate) + (3 × Light) The second question is used to calculate the frequency of weekly leisure-time activities pursued &quot;long enough to work up a sweat.
Total scores range from 0 to 99, with 0 being a very low level of physical activity and 99 being a high level of physical activity.</description>
