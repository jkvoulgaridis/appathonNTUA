      Cataract surgery is the only way to treat age-related cataract. For patients at early or
      moderate stages, cataract surgery is an elective surgery without objective indications.
      Therefore thee patients are uaually not aware whether they should receive the surgery. In
      clinical practice, traditional Patient Decision Aids (PDAs) booklets are used to provide
      health education to patients. However, PDAs lack real-time interaction with patients, and are
      unable to answer the new questions raised. As a result, many patients still have doubts about
      whether they should receive cataract surgery or not. In this study, we aim to assess the
      effectiveness of an interactive Q&amp;A mobile application based on natural language processing
      technology to enhance informed decisions made by cataract patients.
