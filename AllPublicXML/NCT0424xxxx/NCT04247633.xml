  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multi-center, single-arm, open-label trial to evaluate efficacy of
      palbociclib with endocrine therapy as adjuvant treatment in women with C-high/G-high risk
      ER-positive/HER2-negative T1-2N0-1 EBC(Early Breast Cancer)

      The investigators hypothesized that the GenesWell™ BCT may help inform decision about whether
      or not to have adjuvant chemotherapy to patients with high-risk pN0-N1, ER+/HER2- breast
      cancer in Korea. While adjuvant therapy for ER-positive EBC is effective in reducing risk of
      recurrence and improving survival, recurrences are still common, especially in patients with
      unfavorable factors in terms of clinical, pathological and/or molecular perspectives.

      Since the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, to endocrine therapy (ET) has proven
      clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicity profile in ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced BC,
      its use in the adjuvant setting may decrease risk of recurrences in patients with
      ER-positive, HER2-negative EBC after surgical resection of the primary tumor by enhancing
      primary endocrine responsiveness and preventing, or delaying the development of acquired
      resistance for endocrine therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of addition of palbociclib to standard
      adjuvant ET on event-free survival (EFS) in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative EBC but
      unfavorable clinicopathological (clinical high risk, C-high) and molecular features (genomic
      high risk, G-high).
