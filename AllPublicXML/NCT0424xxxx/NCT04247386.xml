  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to analyze the effectiveness and patient tolerance of the two bowel preparation
      regimens, we will compare Polyethylene Glycol Electrolytes Powder (PEG-4000) and Mizone with
      PEG-ELS. The aim was to demonstrate that polyethylene glycol electrolyte powder (PEG-4000)
      and Mizone is not inferior in overall quality of intestinal preparation to PEG-ELS in
      subjects undergoing colonoscopy.

    <description>The OBPS，a scoring system with scores between 0 and 14, where 0 is the best score，divides the colon into 3 segments (right, transverse and rectosigmoid colon); each is scored from 0-4 (0=excellent, If it is necessary to suction liquid stool to adequately see the colonic wall, a score of 2 (fair) is given; if it is necessary to wash and to suction, a score of 3 (poor) is given. The remaining scores fall into place around these anchors. ). A score 0-2 is added to indicate the total amount of luminal fluid.(0=The total amount of fluid in the colon is very small,1=a moderate volume of fluid overall in the colon,2=a large volume of fluid overall in the colon)</description>
