  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In β-thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), a significant production of fetal
      haemoglobin (HbF) may reduce the severity of clinical course and reactivation of γ-globin
      gene expression in adulthood. HbF induction is one of the best strategies to ameliorate the
      characteristic symptoms of these diseases. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only medication, approved
      by the US Food and Drug Administration, inducing HbF. However, treatments with HU induce
      sufficient HbF levels in only half of the patients, and side effects including leukopenia and
      neutropenia are frequently reported. Therefore, novel therapeutic inducers must be identified
      to develop a personalized treatment in β-thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia. The
      availability of new treatments depends on drugs already approved for other indications, and
      on pharmacokinetics and pharmacovigilance already assessed. Rapamycin (as Sirolimus) is an
      immunosuppressant agent, approved by the FDA for acute rejection prevention in renal
      transplant recipients. The ability of this drug to induce γ-globin gene expression in
      erythroleukemia cell line and erythroid precursors cells (ErPCs) in ß-thalassaemia patients
      is already known. A clinical investigation on the effects of sirolimus in ß-Thalassaemia aims
      to evaluate several parameters related to red blood cell status and HbF levels and is a first
      step for the full clinical development in this new indication.

      The general aim of this protocol is to demonstrate the applicability of a personalised and
      precision medicine approach in beta-thalassaemia; the clinical trial setting repurposes a
      drug, namely sirolimus. The presence of high Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) levels is considered a
      condition predictive of a favourable outcome in thalassaemia. Its increase induced by
      pharmacological agents is considered a potential way to improve the clinical status of the
      patients. In terms of efficacy analysis, the investigators will focus their attention on HbF
      levels.

      Primary objective:

      • The suitability evaluation of sirolimus for the treatment of beta-thalassemia patients
      within the frame of a comprehensive project aimed at the reduction of their transfusions
      need, with consequent amelioration of their quality of life. The purpose can be achieved
      through increasing of HbF levels pharmacologically mediated, with verification of a
      prerequisite, namely the correlation between the induction of HbF in vitro and in vivo in
      single patients.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the safety of sirolimus and correlation between administered dose and blood
           levels in beta-thalassemia patients

        -  To assess the influence of sirolimus on transfusion regimen

        -  To assess the effect of sirolimus on the hematopoietic and immune system of thalassemia
           patients.

The TranQol is a disease-specific Quality of Life measure that has been shown to be valid and reliable (Klaassen et al, British Journal of Haematology, 2014, 164, 431-437). On a total scale of 0-100, higher values always represent a better outcome. The questions are grouped into four domains: physical health, emotional health, family functioning, and school and career functioning. The adult self-report questionnaires include a fifth category on sexual activity which is only one item. Subscales are summed</description>
