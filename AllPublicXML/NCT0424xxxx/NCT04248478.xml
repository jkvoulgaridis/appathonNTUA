      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the nutritional behaviours of female patients with
      fibromyalgia according to the healthy population and the relationship of these behaviours
      with the current health status of the patient.

      In the investigatgor's clinical practice, eating-related problems (increased or decreased
      appetite, uncontrolled eating, etc.) are observed in fibromyalgia patients. In this study, it
      will be investigated whether this situation is different from healthy population and whether
      it is related with the healt status.

      Patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia according to 2013 American College of Rheumatology
      criteria and healthy volunteers are planned to be included in the study.

      Demographic data (sex, age, level of education, job, socio-economic situation) will be
      questioned and their body mass indexes (BMI) will be calculated from all participitants All
      participants' eating behaviour will be questioned with Three Factor Eating Questionnaire.

      In fibromyalgia patients, effect of fibromyalgia on the daily life of the patients will be
      questioned with Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire.

    <description>Participants' eating behaviour will be questioned with Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ). The TFEQ contains 51 items (questions) and measures three dimensions of human eating behavior 'cognitive restraint of eating' (Factor I - 21 items) 'disinhibition' (Factor II - 16 items) 'hunger' (Factor III - 14 items). Each item scores either 0 or 1 point. The minimum score for factors I-II-III is therefore 0-0-0, the possible maximum score 21-16-14.</description>

    <description>The effect of fibromyalgia on the daily life of the patients will be questioned with Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). The FIQ was developed from information gathered from patient reports, functional status instruments, and clinical observations. This instrument measures 10 items (physical functioning, work status (missed days of work and job difficulty), depression, anxiety, morning tiredness, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being) over the past week. The maximum possible score of each subtitle is 10. Thus, the total maximum score is 100, a lower score indicates better quality of life.</description>
