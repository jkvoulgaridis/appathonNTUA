  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) affects brain networks measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      Participants will undergo a screening that includes a psychiatric and medical history
      screening, TMS and MRI safety screening, and urine screening. If participants pass the
      screening procedure, they will be introduced to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a task that involves viewing words, sentences, or
      pictures. There will be up to seven visits and each visit will take less than 3 hours.

      MRI can be dangerous for people that have medical devices, metal objects, or metal debris in
      their bodies. TMS procedures are associated with a very low risk of seizures,
      &quot;muscle-tension&quot; type headache, ear damage, numbness of the face, fainting, dizziness, memory
      impairment, trouble concentrating, and acute mood changes. This study will use only levels of
      TMS that are within safety guidelines. There is also a risk of potential loss of
      confidentiality.
