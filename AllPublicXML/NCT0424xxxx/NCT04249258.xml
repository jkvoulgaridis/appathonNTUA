  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that Dobutamine will act in a similar fashion to Isoproterenol with respect
      to cardiac conduction. Our goal is to study the effects of Dobutamine on cardiac conduction
      and refractoriness during an Electrophysiology study (EPS). At the end of most EPS
      Isoproterenol is commonly administered in an effort to change the conduction properties of
      the heart. In our practice we have been using Dobutamine for this purpose for many years.
      Dobutamine has never been rigorously studied for this indication however. We designed this
      study to systematically study the effect of various doses of Dobutamine on the parameters of
      cardiac conduction and refractoriness that are commonly measured during an EPS. We are
      specifically looking to compare the effect that Dobutamine has on the sinus node with the
      effect it has on the atrioventricular node. Patients undergoing an EPS at Long Island Jewish
      Hospital will be recruited and consented. Measurements of various conduction parameters will
      be taken at baseline as is standard protocol for an EPS. Dobutamine will then be administered
      at doses of 5mcg/kg/min, 10mcg/kg/min, 15mcg/kg/min and 20mcg/kg/min. At each of these
      dosages the same conduction parameters will be measured. A comparison will then be made
      between the conduction parameters at baseline and when the Dobutamine is administered.
