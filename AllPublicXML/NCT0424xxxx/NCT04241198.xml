  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NOTAL-OCT V3.0 developed a proprietary interface, to enable AMD patients to self-operate
      the device following a short training.

      Notal Vision will sponsor a clinical study to explore the daily dynamics of retinal fluid in
      AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration) patients under anti-VEGF treatment. Patients will be
      taught at the clinic to self-operate the NOTAL_OCT V3.0 device and then will get the device
      for daily testing at home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include up to 15 eAMD patients, recruited by two medical centers, Tel-Aviv
      medical center and Assuta Hashalom medical center. At the screening visit, the patients will
      be imaged in their tested, eligible eye(s), using a commercial Zeiss Cirrus or Heidelberg
      Spectralis OCT.

      Then patients will be qualified to self-operate the Notal-OCT V3.0: each patient will be
      trained at the clinic on how to position the Notal-OCT V3.0 device and to self-scan the eyes.
      The patients will undergo a calibration and scanning session in the tested eye(s), identical
      to the scanning they will do by themselves at home. Patients who will not be able to operate
      the device, or patients with a poor image quality will be disqualified from the study.

      For qualified patients, the sponsor will coordinate, deliver and install the Notal-OCT V3.0
      at patients' homes. Patients participating in the study will be asked to do a daily scan of
      the tested eye(s) for one month. Testing duration is 1-2 min per eye.

      During the home testing patients will be able to call a support center for assistance. Weekly
      device checkup at patient's home will be done 2-3 times during the study.

      At the end of the study patients will be scanned again at the clinic using a the Notal OCT in
      the clinic and a commercial OCT -Zeiss Cirrus or Heidelberg Spectralis.
