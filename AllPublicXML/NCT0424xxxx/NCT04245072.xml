      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of antiangiogenic therapy to
      choroidal neovascularization secondary to central chorioretinitis.

      This study is planned as a follow-up. Patients with central chorioretinitis included in it
      will receive antiangiogenic therapy in accordance with the approved indications for use
      indicated in the instructions for the use of drugs in Ukraine.

      The treatment proposed in this study is based on the world experience and scientific
      developments of the Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy of the NAMS of
      Ukraine &quot;. Therefore, it is expected that the benefit / risk ratio in relation to the
      participation in this study should not be different from that described in the scientific
      literature and the benefits outweigh the risk. It is known that the absence of treatment in
      these diseases leads to an irreparable loss of central vision.
