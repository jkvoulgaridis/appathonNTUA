  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The employ of medical images combined with deep neural networks to assist in clinical
      diagnosis, therapeutic effect, and prognosis prediction is nowadays a hotspot. However, all
      the existing methods are designed based on the reconstructed medical images rather than the
      lossless raw data. Considering that medical images are intended for human eyes rather than
      the AI, we try to use raw data to predict the malignancy of pulmonary nodules and compared
      the predictive performance with CT. Experiments will prove the feasibility of diagnosis by CT
      raw data. We believe that the proposed method is promising to change the current medical
      diagnosis pipeline since it has the potential to free the radiologists.

      The routinely used diagnostic scheme of cancers follows the process of
      signal-to-image-to-diagnosis. It is essential to reconstruct the visible images from the
      signal of medical device so that the human doctor can perform diagnosis. However, the huge
      amount of information inside the signal is not optimally mined, which causes the current
      unsatisfactory performance of image based diagnosis.

      In this clinical trial, we will develop an AI based diagnostic scheme for lung nodules
      directly from the signal (raw data) to diagnosis, skipping the reconstruction step. In this
      trial, we will focus on the discrimination of malignant from benign lung nodules. We will
      collect a dataset of patients who are screened out lung nodules. All patients undergo
      preoperative CT scan (raw data and CT images available) and have pathologically confirmed
      result of the nodules. We will build a model using only raw data for diagnosis of the lung
      nodules. Moreover, another model from CT image will be built for comparison.

      Furthermore, we will perform follow-up on these patients and build a model based on CT raw
      data for prognosis analysis of lung cancer.
