      This study evaluate Frailty syndrome (FS) as a common syndrome in patients with cirrhosis and
      it is an independent predictor of hospitalizations, falls and mortality. Identifying,
      treating and preventing FS can improve the prognosis and quality of life of these patients
      and reduce health costs.

      Substudy I. The phase angle (PA) determined by electrical bioimpedance is an index of FS with
      prognostic value in outpatients with cirrhosis, but its usefulness in hospitalized patients
      has not been studied. Objective: To analyze the prognostic value of PA in hospitalized
      patients with cirrhosis. Patients and Methods: 100 hospitalized patients with cirrhosis will
      be consecutively included and PA will be determined by bioimpedance at admission. The
      correlation between PA and liver function and frailty markers, and the evolution during
      hospitalization, as well as the incidence of falls, hospitalizations and mortality during
      follow-up will be analyzed. Substudy II. Given the multidimensional nature of the FS, we
      propose a multifactorial non-pharmacological intervention based on evidence from previous
      studies that could be implemented in daily clinical practice. Objective: To evaluate if a
      multifactorial intervention can improve the FS and decrease the related events
      (hospitalizations, falls and mortality) in patients with cirrhosis. Patients and Methods: 150
      outpatients with cirrhosis will be included and evaluated using the Liver Frailty Index.
      Frail and pre-frail patients will be randomized into two groups: one group that will receive
      a multifactorial intervention, consisting of exercise at home, branched-chain amino acids and
      multispecies probiotic for one year, and one control group. The evolution of the Liver
      Frailty Index and other parameters (muscle and cognitive function, bioimpedance, risk of
      falls, quality of life) and biomarkers (miostatin, immune response, microbiota) of FS, and
      the incidence of hospitalizations, falls and mortality in both groups will be prospectively
      analyzed.

    <description>Physical exercise at home: At the beginning of the study, group sessions will be conducted with 5 patients of 1-hour duration, where they will be taught the individualized program according to their physical condition and they will be given the necessary material (pedaling, dumbbells and elastic bands) and paper support on the program, also using the Vivifrail method through infographics. The group session will be repeated every 3 months to check the compliance of the program by reviewing daily activity, evaluate possible problems and review the exercises. The program will consist of aerobic and anaerobic exercise by pedaling (cardiovascular resistance) and resistance exercises with dumbbells and elastic bands (muscular strength), flexibility training by stretching, and coordination and balance exercises. Patients will perform 3 sessions per week of 20-30 min. increasing progressively according to tolerance up to 45-60 min. each.</description>

    <description>Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA): In addition to the exercise program and the probiotic, patients in the intervention group will receive BCAA supplements (powder in 8:1:1 ratio in favor of L-leucine) 10 g 30-60 min. before the exercise session throughout the study, in order to enhance the effect of exercise on muscle mass and improve cognitive function. We have chosen this dose based on the literature data and the satisfactory results obtained with this dose in our previous study. BCAA supplements will be supplied by the Pharmacy Service of our center.</description>
