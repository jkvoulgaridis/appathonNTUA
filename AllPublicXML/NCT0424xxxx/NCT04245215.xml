      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of re-induction with ustekinumab ≈6mg/kg IV
      followed by two different maintenance dosing regimens 90 mg subcutaneous every 8 weeks (Q8W)
      vs 90 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks(Q4W) on clinical, biological and pharmacological outcomes
      in patients with Crohn's disease who show a secondary loss of response over time

      The study is a prospective double blind interventional study in patients with Crohn Disease
      treated with ustekinumab that show an objective secondary loss of response to ustekinumab
      after induction treatment (&gt;Week 16). Patients can be screened during a four week period. The
      screening includes a clinical, biochemical and endoscopic assessment. Patients will be
      randomized 8 weeks after the last subcutaneous injection with ustekinumab. All patient will
      receive an intravenous re-induction with ustekinumab ≈6mg/kg at baseline (8 weeks after last
      subcutaneous administration). After the intravenous re-induction, the patients receive either
      ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous Q4W or Q8W (altered with q8w placebo to mimic Q4W injections)
      till week 48. Clinical and biochemical evaluation will be planned every 8 weeks until week36
      with a final evaluation at week48. Primary endpoint will be assessed at week 48. Final
      assessment at week 48 will include clinical, biochemical and endoscopic evaluation.
