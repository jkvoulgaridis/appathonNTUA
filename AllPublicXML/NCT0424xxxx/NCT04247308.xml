  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 56 neonates with LBW will recruited by the convenience sampling to participate in
      this two group pre-test post-test, single blinded randomized clinical study. After the
      demographics, recruited NLBW will be randomly divided into two groups, group A and group B
      with block randomization. There will be four blocks, with the matrix design of 4X14 here 14
      being rows. Each block contained 4 chits (2 chits for each group), totalling 56. The subjects
      will be allotted to the group based on the randomly chosen chit by their parents. Once the
      block will be allotted, next row block was opened. Thus, equal number of NLBW will be
      assigned to each group over time.

      Group A will be receiving multimodal sensory and kinesthetic stimulation (MSKS) and Group B
      will be receiving regular lifesaving hospital care. Group A will receive the interventions
      for 2 weeks period, totalling 10 sessions. Each session will last for 30 minutes duration.

    <description>Sensory stimulations (ATVV) will be consisting of Soft lullaby between of 30-40 dB for Auditory, Gentle stroking massage in supine position(upper and lower limb)for Tactile, Visual Stimulations with Black and white card (distance of 8-10 in), gentle rocking (vertical and horizontal direction) for the stimulation of vestibular system and oral stimulation including stocking cheeks, lips, jaw and tongue, rubbing gum.Each stimulation will be given for 3 minutes.
Movement therapy will include: Guided range of motion: flexion-extension movements of lower limb (bicycle riding pattern). Hand should be placed around knee joint. Care must be taken as PI consist the cartilaginous joints at wrist and ankle. Anti gravity movements in prone (neck and spinal extension), Anti gravity movements in sitting (supported) and Upright positioning for 3min each</description>
