  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed at patients with dizziness believed to be due to conditions in the
      balance organ in the inner ear (vestibular diseases). Dizziness can be bothersome and
      influence postural control negatively, and can cause secondary musculoskeletal disorders.
      Dizziness can also result in reduced work capacity. The purpose of the project is to
      strengthen the knowledge base regarding symptom burden, prognosis and treatment of prolonged
      dizziness. The hypothesis is that musculoskeletal pain at baseline is a prognostic factor for
      prolonged dizziness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred to an tertiary otorhinolarynglogical clinic due to dizziness will be
      invited to participate in the study. The aims are to examine the prevalence, extent and
      distribution of musculoskeletal pain in patients with prolonged dizziness, and to investigate
      the associations between musculoskeletal pain, dizziness symptoms, psychological and physical
      function and health-related quality of life.

      Furthermore, the aim is to monitor the natural course of the dizziness symptoms and
      functional status in these patients, and examine risk factors for prolonged disability after
      6 and 12 months. The hypothesis is that muscle pain and distress at baseline may be
      independently associated with prolonged complaints at follow-up.

      Finally, patients who still are dizzy and have pain after 12 months will be invited to
      participate in one of two group interventions a) modified vestibular rehabilitation and b)
      virtual reality / exergaming. The interventions will be feasibility studies with a pre-post
      design.
