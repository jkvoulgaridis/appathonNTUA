  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Research Hypothesis for the present pilot study in a special care setting is that in a
      population suffering of mild and recent sleep disorders the pre-sleep arousal measured by the
      Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS) after 30 days of oral administration with a nutraceutical
      composed of hawthorn, lavender and hop (Sonidor®) shall significantly improve in comparison
      with the baseline condition.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sonidor® was developed as a nutraceutical composed of hawthorn, lavender and hop inducing
      sleep and relaxation in subjects with mild sleep disturbances. In addition, the Sonidor®
      innovative three-layer-tablet formulation should allow the active components to be released
      with different speeds into the gastrointestinal tract exerting a synergistic action to induce
      sleep-promoting effects.

      Primary objective is to have a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of Sonidor® in subjects
      affected by persistent mild sleep disorders (difficulty in initiating sleep for at least 1
      month and reduced quality of sleeping) to whom in special care setting have been suggested
      sleep hygiene guidelines and administered the tested nutraceutical for one month.
