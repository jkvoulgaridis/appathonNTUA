  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are blood disorders that occur when the body makes too
      many white or red blood cells, or platelets. This overproduction of blood cells in the bone
      marrow can create problems for blood flow and lead to various symptoms. One of the major
      problems is the formation of blood clots. These may form in the veins of a patient's legs or
      arms where they cause leg or arm pain, swelling or difficulty walking. These clots may travel
      to the lung and then cause chest pain, shortness of breath and sometimes death. Blood clots
      can also lead to poor or no blood flow to one's heart, brain, or other organs, causing
      damages that cannot be easily or ever repaired, such as stroke or heart attack.

      Patients diagnosed with certain types of MPN are associated with a higher risk of developing
      blood clots and related complications. For this reason, MPN patients are usually treated with
      low-dose aspirin, a common drug used for blood clot prevention, on long-term basis to prevent
      the formation of blood clots and other complications. However, recent studies also show that
      the risk of blood clots remains elevated in MPN patients treated with aspirin, and there may
      not be improvement or reduction in fatal or other events that are associated with blood
      clots. In addition, since this medical condition is rare, so there's a lack of studies done
      with high quality results to help physicians decide the best treatment plan for these
      patients.

      The study drug, apixaban, is a new type of orally-taken blood thinner that has been shown to
      be effective and safe for prevention and treatment of blood clots in various patient
      populations. The investigators will evaluate whether apixaban is safer and/or better at
      preventing blood clots and other complications in MPN patients compared to aspirin.
