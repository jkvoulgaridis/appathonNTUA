  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the growth of hospice, older adults have the opportunity to receive home-based care
      aimed at reducing suffering and focusing on quality of life at the end of life. While use of
      technology and educational videos has yet to be fully developed, structured, and evaluated in
      home hospice care, it has shown promise to improve care in other settings. Therefore, this
      study aims to develop and evaluate a multi-component technology-based care intervention,
      i.e., Improving Home hospice Management of End of life issues through technology (I-HoME),
      that focuses on assessing and addressing patient symptoms and caregiver burden in the home
      hospice setting through synchronous live video visits and educational videos. The aim of the
      second phase of the project is to conduct a single armed (N=10 dyads) pilot study with a
      focus on optimizing data collection protocols and the intervention before transitioning to a
      randomized pilot study evaluating the feasibility and potential efficacy of I-HoME (N=50
      dyads) compared to usual care (N=50 dyads).
