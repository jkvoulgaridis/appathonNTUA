      A prospective, single arm, non-randomized, multicenter, prospective case-series trial. The
      purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of using the Adjustable
      Continence Therapy (ACT) to provide a clinically relevant improvement in stress urinary
      incontinence.

    <description>Two ACT devices are implanted in each patient. The devices are intended for implantation in the paraurethral space, with the balloons located on each side of the urethra near the bladder neck. The ports are placed subcutaneously in the labia majora. The balloons are filled after implantation with an isotonic solution via needle injection into the port. The ACT implant can be placed using local, spinal or general anesthesia with the surgical instruments (provided separately).</description>
