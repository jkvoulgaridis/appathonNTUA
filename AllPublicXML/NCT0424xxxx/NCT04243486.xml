    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the safety and efficacy of UHE-105 Shampoo with that of the vehicle
      (VEH) Shampoo in subjects with scalp psoriasis. Half of the subjects will receive the UHE-105
      Shampoo, while the other half will receive the VEH Shampoo with no active drug.
