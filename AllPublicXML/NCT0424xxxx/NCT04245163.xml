    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of an educational intervention program in order to improve
      medication adherence in glaucoma patients. Half of the participants will receive the
      educational program while the other half will receive normal care and a leaflet about
      glaucoma.

      Introduction. As the world population ages, glaucoma is becoming an increasingly significant
      cause of blindness. Statistics gathered by WHO in 2010, show that glaucoma is the leading
      cause of irreversible blindness, worldwide. A key component in the management of glaucoma, is
      the use of prescribed medications· but the effectiveness of medications depends on patient's
      adherence to treatment. However, there is evidence of poor adherence to prescribed medication
      in chronic diseases and a causative factor for that is the limited education and the low
      health literacy. This study aims to investigate the reasons of non-adherence to the
      medication plan among patients with glaucoma and secondly, according the findings, to develop
      and implement a comprehensive educational program.

      Methods and analysis. This is a mixed method study which include 3 stages: a descriptive
      study (stage 1), focus group discussion (stage 2) and a randomised control trial (stage 3).
      Sample: Patients with glaucoma, using at least one kind of drops, will be recruited from the
      two ophthalmology clinics in Cyprus. Selected measures include: Glaucoma Treatment Compliance
      Assessment Tool (GTCAT), European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q6) and the
      Glaucoma Medication Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (GMSEQ). The data will be analysed by SPSS
      program with descriptive and inferential statistics. Content analysis will be used for the
      data from the focus groups.

      Ethics and dissemination. Permission to conduct the study received from the Cyprus National
      Bioethics Committee (ΕΕΒΚ ΕΠ 2019.01.220) and the board of management of the two
      ophthalmology clinics. All participants will be informed fully on the purpose and methods of
      the study. Consent forms will be signed and at any time participants will have the right to
      withdraw. Confidentiality of the participants will be respected as also the protection of
      data. Dissemination strategy includes presentations in international and national scientific
      conferences and publications in scientific journals.

    <measure>Change to the Glaucoma Treatment Compliance Assessment Tool (GTCAT-28)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: before intervention (4-12 months before), T1: immediately after the intervention (same day), T2: One month after the intervention, T3: Three months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Easy and quick questionnaire specially designed for patients with glaucoma. It contains 27 statements with 5-interval Likert-type scale response (eg, 1- disagree a lot, 5-agree a lot) and 1 open ended question for assessing the knowledge, the Health Belief Model components (Barriers, Benefits, Cues to Action, Self-efficacy, Severity, Susceptibility), the patient-physician relationship, and their physical and mental health. The correct answers range from 0 to 27, with the highest score indicating more adherence to the treatment. The purpose is to assess the change between several time points (e.g. before the intervention, after the intervention-same day, one month after the intervention and three months after the intervention). The reason is, firstly, to assess if there is a change between T0 and T1 and secondly to assess if the effect of the intervention (as indicated by the change in the GTCAT) remain for a longer period of time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q6)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: before the intervention (4-12 months before)</time_frame>
    <description>The HLS-EU-Q6, includes 6 statements with 5-interval Likert-type scale response (eg, 1- disagree a lot, 5-agree a lot). We will use the HLS-EU-Q6 to assess the level of Health Literacy among the participants.</description>

    <measure>Change to the Glaucoma Medication Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (GMSEQ-16)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: before the intervention (4-12 months before), T1: immediately after the intervention (same day), T2: One month after the intervention, T3: Three months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The GMSEQ consists of 10 questions assessing Self-Efficacy in Glaucoma medication in general and 6 questions assessing Self-Efficacy in the eye drop technique. The response categories are: 'not at all confident', 'somewhat confident', 'very confident' and 'does not apply'. The purpose is to assess the change between several time points (e.g. before the intervention, after the intervention-same day, one month after the intervention and three months after the intervention). The reason is to assess firstly if there is a change (between T0 and T1) and secondly to asses if the effect of the intervention (as indicated by the change in the GMSEQ-16) remain for a longer period of time.</description>

    <description>The intervention program will include 3 phases. At phase 1 a presentation on Microsoft PowerPoint in order to increase the general knowledge about glaucoma. At phase 2 a video and a one on one teaching to develop skills of administering the eye drops in a correct and systematic way. At phase 3, a discussion in order to identify cues to action that can easily be adopted by the patient in his/her daily routine, (such as, how to remember to put in drops) will take place.</description>
