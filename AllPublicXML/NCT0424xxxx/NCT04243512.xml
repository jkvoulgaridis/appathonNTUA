      In this study, the feasibility of delivering a time-restricted eating (TRE) intervention
      among fatigued cancer survivors will be assessed. The participants will be asked to eat ad
      libitum only within a self-selected 10-h window each day for 14 days. The primary aim is to
      assess the adherence of the participants to the 10-h TRE intervention.
