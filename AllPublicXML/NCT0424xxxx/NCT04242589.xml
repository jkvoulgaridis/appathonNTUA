  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since patients with spinal metastases are living longer, durable palliation with long-term
      tumor control are becoming increasingly important.

      EBRT results in durable local control of bone metastasis. However, about 25 % of patients
      with spinal metastases only achieved complete pain relief following EBRT for a median
      duration of less than 4 months. This could be partly due to spinal instability. In addition,
      almost half of the patients who receive EBRT will subsequently develop VCFs . Hence, RT does
      not stabilize the spine secondary to VCFs and is not effective in preventing imminent VCFs.
      Vertebroplasty has rapidly reduced pain and improved function in patients with VCFs. However,
      vertebroplasty does not provide local tumor control similar to EBRT.

      It is theorized that combining vertebroplasty with EBRT will stabilize the spine, relieve the
      pain, prevent imminent VCFs and minimize or avoid the need for opioids. It is hypothesized
      that combining a spine stabilization procedure such as vertebroplasty with RT will be the
      most effective management for patients with spinal metastases than RT alone for patients with
      spinal metastases. Combined vertebroplasty and radiotherapy is not a standard treatment
      option at present. This study is designed to quantify the advantage of adding vertebroplasty
      to radiotherapy for patients with spinal metastases. If the study is proven to be
      significant, it could become the standard of care for patients with spinal metastases.

          8. No prior EBRT to the target +/-1 vertebral body level

          9. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum (or urine)
             pregnancy test at the time of screening. WOCBP is defined as any female who has
             experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy) and is not postmenopausal.
             Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the
             absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females under the
             age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level &gt; 40

             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (Note:
             abstinence is acceptable if this is established and preferred contraception for the
