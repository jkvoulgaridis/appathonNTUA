  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) is the recommended standard of care as initial
      therapy for patients with motor neuron disease (MND) with deterioration of the respiratory
      function.

      SIGH_01 study is aimed at investigating the tolerability, safety profile and efficacy of sigh
      breaths during non-invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with MND in comparison to the
      standard ventilation support protocol.
