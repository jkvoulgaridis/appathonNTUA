  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine whether important clinical outcomes differ among women
      who access a misoprostol-only medication abortion regimen from a patent medicine vendor when
      compared with those who access it from a clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medication abortion with a misoprostol-only regimen within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy is
      safe and effective. Investigators aim to assess whether self-use of early (&lt;9 weeks)
      medication abortion using a misoprostol-only regimen results in non-inferior rates of
      clinical outcomes when compared with clinic-based provision of medication abortion.

      The investigators will prospectively recruit women who obtain misoprostol from patent
      medicine vendors and clinics. Follow-up will occur by telephone during three phone calls
      within 45 days of the first dose of misoprostol.
