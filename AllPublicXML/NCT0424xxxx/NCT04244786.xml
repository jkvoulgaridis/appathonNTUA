  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the tolerability and effectiveness of transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a potential treatment for non-suicidal self-injury
      (NSSI). NSSI is the deliberate attempt to harm oneself, most often through cutting or
      burning, without suicidal intent. NSSI is a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy often
      triggered by negative emotions, especially those involving feelings of rejection. tDCS is a
      low-cost, portable, well-tolerated, non-invasive form of brain stimulation that delivers a
      low current to a specific area of the brain via electrodes. Several studies have demonstrated
      its effectiveness in treating an array of conditions, depending on electrode placement,
      including depression and chronic pain. tDCS may also facilitate adaptive emotion regulation;
      researchers have also successfully used tDCS to reduce negative emotions and aggressive
      responses to social rejection. The investigators therefore seek to explore tDCS as a
      potential treatment for NSSI. This pilot feasibility study seeks 1) to examine how tDCS is
      tolerated in a sample of individuals who engage in frequent NSSI; 2) to gather pilot data
      regarding changes in neural responses during a social task after a series of tDCS sessions in
      this clinical population of individuals who engage in NSSI; 3) to gather pilot data on the
      effects of tDCS on NSSI behaviors and urges. The investigators seek to recruit a sample of 22
      individuals who engage in frequent NSSI to complete all study procedures, including
      neuroimaging. Individuals will be randomized to receive active- or sham-tDCS for two
      twenty-minute applications on each of three alternating days over approximately one week.
      Functional MRI (fMRI) will be performed at baseline and again after the completion of 6
      sessions of tDCS. Subjects' NSSI and urges to engage in NSSI will be recorded for three weeks
      in real-time, using an iPod- based system that reminds subjects to stop at certain times
      during the day to record their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This will allow measurement
      of NSSI urges and behaviors for one week before, one week during, and one week after the tDCS
      intervention. The long-term goal of this study is to identify a novel form of treatment for
      NSSI and to better understand NSSI pathophysiology.

    <description>A questionnaire to evaluate side-effects related to tDCS administration. This questionnaire asks about the presence and severity of possible side-effects of tDCS procedures, and was recently published as a gold-standard tool for this purpose: Aparício LVM, Guarienti F, Razza LB, Carvalho AF, Fregni F, Brunoni AR.

    <description>EMA assessment of NSSI urges and behavior before, during, and after tDCS intervention. EMA is a tool through which participants can respond to a brief questionnaire on a smartphone device while going about their daily lives. Participants will be prompted to complete a brief questionnaire 6 times per day over a 3 week period, which asks questions about urges to engage in NSSI and in actual NSSI behavior.</description>
