  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of
      BGB-3245 in participants with advanced or refractory tumors harboring specific v-RAF murine
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (B-RAF) genetic mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1a/1b (dose escalation and expansion) study of BGB-3245 in
      participants with tumors harboring B-RAF mutations that are likely to respond to a RAF dimer
      inhibitor. BGB-3245 is a second-generation B-RAF inhibitor that has demonstrated potent
      inhibitory activity against the RAF family of serine/threonine kinases preclinically. In
      preclinical studies, BGB-3245 showed it inhibited tumor cell lines harboring non-V600 B-RAF
      mutations; it was also active towards B-RAF/MAP-ERK Kinase (MEK) inhibitor-resistant tumors.

      Phase 1a will consist of a dose-escalation and dose-finding component to establish the MTD
      and/or RP2D and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BGB-3245 3245 in participants with MAPK
      pathway aberrations. Phase 1b will consist of an expansion component to further evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of BGB-3245 at the RP2D and to assess the
      preliminary antitumor activity of the compound in participants with select tumor types and
      B-RAF mutational status.

             following time frames will be excluded:

               1. Cyclical chemotherapy within a period of time that is shorter than the cycle
                  length used for that treatment (i.e., 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin C) prior
                  to Cycle 1 Day 1; and

               2. Biologic therapy (i.e., antibodies), continuous or intermittent small-molecule
                  therapies, or any other investigational agents within a period of 5 times the
                  half-life of the agent or ≤4 weeks (whichever is shorter) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          3. History or presence of gastrointestinal disease or other condition known to interfere
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          4. Leptomeningeal disease or untreated/unstable brain metastasis except participants with
             previously treated brain metastasis who are radiologically stable (imaging evidence
             required), asymptomatic and have been off steroids and antiseizure medications for
             longer than 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 are permitted.

          5. Any unstable, preexisting major medical condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator contraindicates the use of an IMP, including known human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
             Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or HCV antibody
             positive at Screening may be enrolled only if HBV DNA titers &lt;500 IU/mL or negative
             HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction test, respectively.
