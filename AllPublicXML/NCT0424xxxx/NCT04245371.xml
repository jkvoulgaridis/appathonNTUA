      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of Lidocaine Patch 1.8% in reducing the
      severity of symptoms in participants with moderate-to-severe pain from Carpal Tunnel
      Syndrome.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Following informed
      consent, participants fulfilling entry criteria will be randomly assigned into one of two
      treatment cohorts. Cohort 1 will be treated with active lidocaine study patch for 2 weeks
      following FDA approved dosing recommendations, i.e. 12 hours during each 24-hour daily cycle.
      Following a 1-week washout period, provided participants continue to meet criteria to
      proceed, they will then be treated with a placebo topical patch for 2 weeks. A final visit
      after another 1-week washout period will complete the study. Participants assigned to the
      Cohort 2 will be evaluated in the same way except they will enter the placebo arm first and
      then, after 1-week washout, they will enter the active treatment arm, provided to continue to
      meet criteria to proceed.

      For all measures, participants will serve as their own matched control. Comparisons will be
      made between significant improvements on active versus placebo treatment arms. The first
      two-week treatment period is Arm 1; the second two-week period is considered the cross-over
      arm.

      Participants failing treatment will be offered standard of care treatment of steroid
      injection. All participants will wear a brace for the duration of the study per standard
      clinical practice.
