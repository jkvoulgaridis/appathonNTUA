             medication within the 12 months prior to signing ICF.

          2. Subjects with epilepsy, or history of epilepsy, or conditions that lower seizure
             threshold, seizures of any etiology (including substance or drug withdrawal), or who
             have increased risk of seizures as evidenced by history of electroencephalogram with

             could compromise either subject safety or the results of the trial.

             Medical conditions that are minor or well controlled may be considered acceptable if
             the condition does not expose the subject to an undue risk of a significant AE or
             interfere with the assessments of safety during the course of the trial. The medical
             monitor should be contacted in any instance where the investigator is uncertain
             regarding the stability of a subject's medical conditions(s) and the potential impact
             of the condition(s) on trial participation.

          4. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption including history of stomach or
             intestinal surgery or resection that would potentially alter absorption and/or

             attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts, or behavior) and
             whose most recent episode meeting the criteria for any of these 5 C-SSRS Suicidal
             Behavior Items occurred within the last 2 years, OR

             - Physical Examination and Clinical Laboratory Results

         10. Positive hepatitis panel (hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody)
             and/or positive human immunodeficiency virus test (HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody) at
             Screening.

         11. Positive urine drug screen (with cotinine) or positive alcohol breathalyzer at
             Screening and Check-in. Subjects with a positive drug screen for illicit drugs or
             cotinine are excluded and may not be retested or rescreened. Subjects with a positive
             urine drug screen resulting from use of marijuana (any cannabinoids), prescription
             medications, over-the-counter medications, or products that, in the investigator's
             documented opinion, do not signal a clinical condition that would impact the safety of
             the subject or interpretation of the trial results may continue evaluation for the
             trial following consultation and explicit approval by the medical monitor.

         12. Subjects with a 12-lead ECG demonstrating the following:

             • QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula &gt;450 msec (average
             of 3 ECGs obtained at the Screening Visit).

         13. Subjects with any of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at the
             Screening Visit, confirmed by a single repeat measurement, if deemed necessary, and at
             the discretion of the investigator:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥2 × upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Total bilirubin ≥1.5 × ULN.

         14. Subjects with other abnormal laboratory test results, vital sign results, or ECG
             findings unless, based on the investigator's judgment, the findings are not medically
             significant and would not impact the safety of the subjects or the interpretation of
             the trial results. The medical monitor should be contacted to discuss individual
             cases, as needed.

             Tests with exclusionary results should be repeated to ensure reproducibility of the
             abnormality before excluding a subject based on criteria provided in the protocol. For
             ECGs, 3 consecutive recordings are required and if 2 of the 3 remain exclusionary,
             then the subject is not eligible for the trial.

             known) prior to dosing.

         20. Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Check-in.

         21. Donation of blood from 56 days prior to Screening, plasma from 2 weeks prior to

             mrem whole body annual exposure with consideration given to the half-lives of the
             previous radiolabeled trial drugs received.

         25. Any subject who, in the opinion of the sponsor, investigator, or medical monitor,
             should not participate in the trial.

         26. Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the trial and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
