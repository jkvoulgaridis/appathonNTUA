    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site phase 1 study of the safety, immunologic and virologic responses of ex
      vivo expanded donor-derived (DD) HIV-1 multi-antigen specific T-cell (HST) with non-escaped
      epitope targeting (NEET) therapy as a therapeutic strategy in HIV-infected individuals
      following Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation (alloBMT).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of donor-derived allogeneic
      expanded HIV-specific T-cell therapy (DD HST-NEETs) in HIV-infected alloBMT recipients on
      ART. Eligible donors will undergo a blood draw of up to 300mL to allow production of
      allogeneic DD HST-NEETs. Participants who meet specified inclusion criteria including
      neutrophil recovery post-transplant and for whom donor products have passed release testing
      will receive DD HST-NEETs at a dose of 2x107/m2 within 30 days of screening visit.

    <description>HIV-infected individuals following Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation (alloBMT) will be treated with DD HST-NEETS therapy. Participants and donors will be screened for eligibility. Eligible donors will undergo a blood draw of up to 300mL to allow production of allogeneic DD HST-NEETs. Participants, who meet specified inclusion criteria including neutrophil recovery post-transplant and for whom donor products have passed release testing, will receive DD HST-NEETs at a dose of 2x107/m2 within 30 days of screening visit.</description>
