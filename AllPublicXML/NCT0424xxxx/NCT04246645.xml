      Background: Impaired upper extremity is the major disability facing the children with
      hemiplegia as the inability to use hands for reach; grasp and manipulation affect their daily
      life activities. little attention has been given to gain perspective about abnormal movements
      that are detectable in hemiplegic cerebral palsy that are related to one's level of core
      stability and how they affect their hand functions.

      Background: Impaired upper extremity is the major disability facing the children with
      hemiplegia as the inability to use hands for reach; grasp and manipulation affect their daily
      life activities. little attention has been given to gain perspective about abnormal movements
      that are detectable in hemiplegic cerebral palsy that are related to one's level of core
      stability and how they affect their hand functions.

      Objective: The purpose was to investigate the effectivness of core stability exercises on
      hand functions in hemiplegic cerebral palsy.

      Methods: Thirty hemiparetic cerebral palsied children of both sexes, ranged in age from 6 to
      8 years enrolled in this study. They randomly assigned into two groups of equal number. Group
      (A) received the selective physiotherapy exercises and group (B) received the same selective
      physiotherapy exercises program in addition to core stability exercises three times/week for
      60 min for 12 weeks. Time motor performance, gross manual dexterity and skills of the upper
      extremity were assessed by using Jebsen Taylor Test (JTHFT), Box and Block Test (BBT) and
      Quality Upper Extremity Skill Test (QUEST) respectively before and after treatment.
