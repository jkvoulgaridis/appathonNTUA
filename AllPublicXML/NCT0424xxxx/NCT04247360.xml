  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When general anesthesia is performed for surgery, tracheal intubation is performed. In order
      to ventilate after performing tracheal intubation, air is injected into the cuff attached to
      the tube to fill the gap between the tracheal tube and the patients's inner surface of
      trachea.

      Even though, 20 to 30 cm H2O is known to be the appropriate pressure to prevent air leaks
      while preventing ischemic damage of tracheal mucosa. So, Researchers want to observe clinical
      differences in pressure at both ends of the safety zone of the cuff pressure.

      Patients who are scheduled for elective surgery/ general anesthesia are randomized to two
      groups.

      l : cuff pressure - 20cmH2O ll : cuff pressure - 30cmH2O

      After tracheal intubation with routine method, cuff pressure is continuously monitored with
      manometer. The anesthesia during surgery is maintained with 0.8 MAC of desflurane and
      continuous remifentanil. Clinical outcomes (sore throat, hoarseness and postoperative pain)
      are evaluated after 0 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours after surgery.
