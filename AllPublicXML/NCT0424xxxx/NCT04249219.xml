  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While conventional cigarette use continues to decline among youth and young adults,
      e-cigarette (EC) use is on the rise. The use of ECs during young adulthood, particularly 18
      years of age, is especially alarming because it is not only a critical period in development
      but also a time when tobacco use is established. Additionally, the tobacco industry targets
      individuals of this age with the hope that they will one day progress to using combustible
      cigarettes. Advertising may be one of the reasons leading young people to use ECs, and the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now has the authority to regulate EC advertisement
      features. The goal of the study is to determine which EC ad features most strongly influence
      young adults' attitudes, susceptibility, and intentions to use ECs. Fifteen ads from the most
      popular EC brands that employ a brand, product descriptions, and modeling features were
      selected. Young adults who are susceptible to EC use will come into the lab and view these
      ads. During exposure, they will be assessed for real-time visual attention using
      eye-tracking, orienting responses using heart rate, and arousal using skin conductance as
      well as pre- and post-ad self-report measures of attitudes, susceptibility, and behavioral
      intentions. These factors will help determine the most high impact features, which will be
      associated with the greatest visual attention, orienting responses, and arousal levels and
      changes in attitudes. Findings from this study will provide public health officials important
      and urgently needed information as to what advertising features are contributing to the sharp
      rise in the use of ECs among young adults.
