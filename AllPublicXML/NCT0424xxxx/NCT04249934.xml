    <textblock>
      Women that require breast reconstruction and meet eligibility will be enrolled in this study.
      The study is being completed to determine the effect of caffeine in deep inferior epigastric
      perforator (DIEP) flap perfusion using the Vioptix tissue oximeter monitor and to determine
      if caffeine in the acute postoperative period affects overall flap complication or loss
      (complete loss from anastomotic issue).

      The researchers hypothesize that a single 8 ounce cup of regular coffee will not affect free
      flap perfusion as indicated by the Vioptix, and that it will not affect overall free flap
      survival at thirty days.
