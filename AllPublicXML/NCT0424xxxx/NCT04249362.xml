      This is a Phase II open-label, single-arm, multicenter, international study to evaluate the
      clinical activity of durvalumab in patients with Stage III unresectable NSCLC who are deemed
      to be ineligible for chemotherapy per Investigator assessment. Patients will be enrolled into
      2 cohorts according to radiotherapy pretreatment dose (Cohort A: standard radiation therapy
      [60 gray (Gy) ± 10% or hypofractionated bioequivalent dose (BED)]; Cohort B: palliative
      radiation therapy [40 to &lt; 54 Gy or hypofractionated BED]).

      This is a Phase II open-label, single-arm, multicenter, international study to evaluate the
      clinical activity of durvalumab in patients with Stage III unresectable NSCLC who have an
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 to 2 and who were treated with radiotherapy
      but are ineligible for chemotherapy. Patients will be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to
      the dose of radiotherapy received prior to study entry (Cohort A: Standard Radiotherapy [60
      Gy ± 10% or hypofractionated BED]; Cohort B: Palliative Radiotherapy [40 to &lt; 54 Gy or
      hypofractionated BED]). Patients must not have progressed following radiation therapy, and
      radiation therapy must be completed within 6 weeks (42 days) prior to first study drug
      administration. The last dose of radiation therapy is defined as the day of the last
      radiation treatment session. All patients will receive 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion
      every 4 weeks (q4w) for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13 doses/cycles)
