      This study is a phase II, prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy
      of autologous umbilical cord blood infusion.

      The study population will consist of 72 children ages 2 months to 12 years with cerebral
      palsy. The population will be randomly assigned to 2 groups, 36 children in each group. The
      study group be treated by cord blood in the beginning of the study and the control group by
      placebo product. The study population will be stratified to reduce variance 3 groups by age:
      2-12 months / 1-6 years / 6-12 years The study will consist of 4 stages Stage 1: initial
      assessment by physiotherapist and occupational therapist / treatment by cord blood or placebo
      / blood work before and after treatment Stage 2: at stage 1 + 3 months assessment by
      physiotherapist and occupational therapist Stage 3: at stage 1 + 6 months assessment by
      physiotherapist and occupational therapist / cross-over treatment by cord blood or placebo /
      blood work before and after treatment Stage 4: at stage 1 + 12 months assessment by
      physiotherapist and occupational therapist The primary outcome is improvement motor skills
      six months after treatment at stage 3
