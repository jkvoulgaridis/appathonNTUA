  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compensatory aids (e.g., alarms, calendars) play an important supporting role when completing
      everyday tasks (e.g., appointments, medication management), and there is a growing body of
      scientific work suggesting that compensatory training improves daily functioning. However,
      traditional paper-based calendars and to-do-lists have limitations related to accumulation of
      information, difficulty retrieving information, and remembering to complete activities. Such
      limitations may be overcome using a digital format through organized digital files, search
      functions, and alarms. This pilot project proposes to train older adults at risk for
      cognitive decline to use the Digital Memory Notebook (DMN), a tablet-based application (app),
      to support everyday functioning. The primary goal is to obtain preliminary evidence that a
      6-week, individual and group-based DMN training intervention results in demonstrable changes
      in target behaviors (e.g., goal-directed DMN use to support everyday activities) among older
      adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC).
      Participants will complete a curriculum involving 2-hour weekly sessions for 6-weeks. Each
      week will cover a specific function of the DMN and will include standardized goal-setting and
      weekly homework targets. Following the 6-week intervention, participants will continue to use
      the DMN app for 4-weeks to evaluate stability. Participants will complete a questionnaire
      packet 1 week prior to the 6-week intervention, 1 week after the 6-week intervention, and 5
      weeks following the 6-week intervention. MCI and SCC participants will complete separate
      6-week individual or group interventions spaced two months apart at UCD.

      The manualized curriculum will involve 2-hour weekly sessions for 6-weeks. The study
      personnel will administer all intervention sessions. Each week will cover a specific function
      of the Digital Memory Notebook (DMN) and will include standardized goal-setting and weekly
      homework targets. A research assistant will assess homework adherence using a standardized
      form and through data extracted from the DMN (e.g., number of alarms set). Mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) participants will complete
      separate 6-week individual or group interventions. Following the 6-week intervention,
      participants will continue to use the DMN app for 4-weeks to evaluate stability.

      Participants will also be asked to complete questions about their medical background
      including history of traumatic brain injury or stroke, as well as any current medical
      conditions and questions regarding demographics including age, ethnicity, and education.

      Potential participants will be told that participating in the study will involve completing
      questionnaires at 3 different time points within 12 weeks (i.e.,week 1, week 8, week 12),
      identifying a knowledgeable informant who will also complete questionnaires, participating in
      a 6-week course to learn how to use the DMN and to support everyday functioning, and to
      continue to use the DMN for one month following the intervention.

      Information collected will be in the form of counts (e.g., number of alarms set) and number
      of minutes spent on the device. Specific content entered into the DMN will not be reviewed.
