  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of short-term fasting to reduce chemotherapy toxicity
      and enhance anti-tumour response in patients with colorectal carcinoma subjected to
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fasting for 24-48 hours during chemotherapy improves the response of the immune system
      against tumors and reduces chemotherapy toxicity through yet unknown mechanisms. The
      investigators have found that fasting induces the activation of p21, a protein that stops
      cell proliferation and plays important immune roles. The investigators hypothesize that p21
      induction with short-term fasting enhances the immune anti-tumour response and reduces
      chemotherapy toxicity. To test this, half of the colorectal carcinoma (CRC) participants will
      follow 48 hours of fasting, 24 before and 24 after chemotherapy, under constant and
      specialized nutritional supervision. While the other half will follow a standard diet. A
      complete blood immunological profile at each chemotherapy cycle will be generated in
      collaboration with expert cytometrists, and gene expression, biochemical parameters, tumor
      evolution and toxicity markers will be measured. The investigators will (1) perform a
      complete analysis of immune cells to characterize the immune effects of fasting during
      chemotherapy; (2) analyze the effects of fasting on genes, metabolites and other molecules,
      to identify the responsible biological mechanisms, focusing on p21; (3) assess the reduction
      of chemotherapy toxicity in patients of colorectal carcinoma subjected to short-term fasting
      during chemotherapy.

      Our project will further explore a safe, inexpensive, relatively unexplored and powerful
      nutritional intervention that can improve the quality of life and survival rates of millions
      of cancer patients: short-term fasting. Also, our project will have an important scientific
      impact, since previous reports have not yet described a clear mechanism explaining the
      beneficial effects of short-term fasting with chemotherapy

    <description>To evaluate changes in chemotherapy toxicity, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 toxicity table score will be calculated, taking into account different analysis and questionnaires on toxicity symptoms.
Analysis will include:
Hematological analysis (erythrocytes, thrombocytes, white blood cells, Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and Platelet/lymphocyte ratio).
Biochemical analysis (sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminases, creatine kinase, troponin T, C Reactive Protein (CRP), cortisol and prealbumin)
