  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants achieving clinical response as measured by Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response 50 (HiSCR50) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HiSCR50 is defined as at least a 50% reduction from Baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count, with no increase from Baseline in abscess or draining fistula count.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants achieving clinical response as measured by Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response 75 (HiSCR75) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HiSCR75 is defined as at least a 75% reduction from Baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count, with no increase from Baseline in abscess or draining fistula count.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with Flare by Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Flare is defined as a ≥25% increase in AN count with an absolute increase in AN count of ≥2 relative to Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute change from Baseline in Skin Pain score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Skin Pain score is assessed by the &quot;worst pain&quot; item (11 point numeric rating scale) in the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Symptom Daily Diary (HSSDD).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute change from Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a skin disease specific questionnaire aimed at the evaluation of how symptoms and treatment affect participants' health related quality of life (QOL). The DLQI total score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating lower skin health related QOL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until Safety Follow-Up (up to Week 71)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP. NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until Safety Follow-Up (up to Week 71)</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Results in persistent disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal from the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until Safety Follow-Up (up to Week 71)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP. NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP. TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study are reported.</description>
