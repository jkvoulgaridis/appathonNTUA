      This study aims to evaluate the time to escalation to triple therapy among the Japanese
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients newly initiating therapy with a
      combination of Olodaterol and Tiotropium (herein referred to as Tio/Olo) using real world
      data.

        The study cohort will include all patients who initiate Tiotropium/Olodaterol (Tio/Olo) or
        Tiotropium (Tio) during the patient selection period. Initiation (new use) will be
        determined based on no prescription claims for Tio/Olo or Tio during the baseline period or
        during all available data prior to cohort entry date. All patients will additionally be
        required to have a second claim for the index medication within 60 days after cohort entry
        to ensure primary adherence of index therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study cohort will include all patients who initiate Tiotropium/ Olodaterol (Tio/Olo) or
        Tiotropium (Tio) during the patient selection period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following exclusion criteria will then be applied to generate the unmatched cohort:

          -  Aged &lt;40 years on cohort entry.

          -  Any LAMA, LABA, or ICS maintenance therapy (alone or in combination) during the
             180-day baseline period prior to cohort entry for maintenance treatment and duration
             &gt;30 days, or any prescription within the 30 days prior to cohort entry.

          -  Patients without continuous enrolment (days since first inpatient/ outpatient
             encounter in the data) during the baseline period.

          -  No prior diagnosis of COPD [International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10: J41*,
             J43*, J44* and doubt (UTAGAIFLG) = 0 (no)]

          -  Patients without a second prescription claim of their index medication within 60 days
             after the cohort entry date.

          -  Diagnosis of asthma [ICD-10: J45* and doubt (UTAGAIFLG) = 0 (no)] during the baseline
             period.

          -  Diagnosis of lung cancer [ICD-10: C34*, D02.2, Z80.1, Z85.1 and doubt (UTALAIFLG) = 0
             (no)] or lung transplant (Health claim code: 150317670, 150322510, 150322610,
             150336510, 150336610, 150336710, 150399270) prior to the cohort entry date using all
             available data.

          -  Patients who initiate both Tio/Olo and Tio simultaneously on the cohort entry date.

          -  Any use of triple therapy (LAMA + LABA + ICS) during the baseline period or between
             the cohort entry date and 1 day prior to the start of follow-up.
