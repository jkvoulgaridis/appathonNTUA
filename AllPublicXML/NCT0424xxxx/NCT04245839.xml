  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicohort, multicenter study to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of JCAR017 in adult subjects with r/r FL or MZL.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

      This study is divided into three periods:

        -  Pretreatment, which consists of screening assessments, leukapheresis and the
           Pretreatment evaluation;

        -  Treatment, which starts with the administration of lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy and
           continues through JCAR017 administration at Day 1 with follow-up through Day 29;

        -  Posttreatment, which includes follow-up assessments for disease status and safety for 2
           years.

Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>

    <description>is questionnaire that will be used as a measure of health-related quality of life.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single item measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.</description>

The FACT-LymS items are scored on a 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;) response scale. Items are aggregated to a single score on a 0-60 scale. High scores indicate lower symptom burden.</description>

JCAR017 will be infused on Day 1 at a dose of 100 × 10^6 CAR-positive viable T cells (CAR+ T cells), 2 to 7 days after completion of LD chemotherapy. Each JCAR017 dose includes CD4+ CAR+ T cells and CD8+ CAR+ T cells.</description>
