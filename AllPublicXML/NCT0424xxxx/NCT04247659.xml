  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) technology has developed in the decade which is being a
      kind of cerebrovascular disease diagnostic tools in the clinical application, especially for
      paramagnetic material (such as DNA hemoglobin and hemosiderin) has a high sensitivity.

      The change of the signal on SWI bases on the change of local oxygenated hemoglobin content in
      the blood and deaeration hemoglobin content ratio, which can be used to indirectly reflect
      the hypoxia group oxygen intake fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate. When the
      intracranial vascular occlusion, corresponding responsibility vascular blood flow area of
      brain tissue will occur hypoperfusion, brain tissue will improve the compensation in
      accordance with its own OEF, causing ischemia area inside the venous drainage of deaeration
      hemoglobin content ratio increases and the hypointensity on SWI ,which display the asymmetric
      cortical vessel sign (ACVS). Studies have suggested that ACVS is more prone to early
      neurological deterioration and has a poor long-term outcome. After recanalization of ischemic
      stroke, the presence of equal CVS(return to normal) on SWI is associated with a good clinical
      outcome. In addition, the relationship between ACVS grade and collateral circulation in
      patients with acute ischemic stroke has been studied. For patients with massive cerebral
      infarction, the relationship between ACVS on SWI and the clinical prognosis of cerebral edema
      and cerebral hemodynamics is not completely clear. In this study, the clinical data of
      patients with massive cerebral infarction will be analyzed to explore the relationship
      between ACVS, cerebral edema , cerebral hemodynamic and clinical prognosis.

      Sodium aescinate is widely used in cerebral edema caused by cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral
      infarction.The main mechanism of sodium aescinate is anti - inflammatory, anti - exudate,
      anti - oxygen free radical, anti - edema, increase vein tension, improve blood circulation
      and nerve protection. In this study, investigators will investigate whether the application
      of sodium aescinate had an effect on ACVS on SWI in patients with massive cerebral
      infarction. Plasma s100-β, procalcitonin, neutrophil count, serum fibronectin, and
      endothelin-1 could predict cerebral edema in patients with cerebral infarction, this study
      will analyze the relationship between these markers and ACVS on SWI in patients with massive
      cerebral infarction.

      Clinical data and plasma samples of patients diagnosed with massive cerebral infarction in
      the department of neurology of the second hospital of hebei medical university during
      2020.1-2021.6 are collected.Clinical data include gender, age, TOAST classification, history
      of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, head Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging(MRI), Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI),Susceptibility weighted imaging SWI
      within 72 hours after onset, admission National Institute of Health stroke scale ( NIHSS)
      score, admission DWI-aspect score, Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score on day 90 of
      onset.Venous blood will be taken within 72 hours of onset (and before the use of sodium
      aescinate) to detect serum s100-β, serum procalcitonin, plasma fibronectin, serum
      endothelin-1 by ELISA.The cortical vessel signs（CVSs）on SWI in the ischemic territory are
      classified as 'prominent' if there are more veins and/or larger veins with a greater signal
      loss than those in the opposite normal hemisphere, 'equal' if there are no significant
      differences in appearance of veins in the both cerebral hemispheres, and 'less' if the veins
      in the affected area are decreased compared to those in the normal cortex.

      Patients with massive cerebral infarction to be included are randomly divided into
      experimental group and control group by random number table method.The experimental group is
      treated with sodium aescinate for injection on the basis of conventional treatment. The
      control group is not treated with sodium aescinate for injection.

      This study will explore the relationship between asymmetric cortical vessel sign(ACVS) grade
      and baseline clinical data, serum factors associated with brain edema in patients with
      massive cerebral infarction.In addition,after 10 days of sodium aescinate injection, the CVS
      level of the experimental group will be compared with that of the control group.The
      difference of CVS grading before and after injection of sodium aescinate in the experimental
      group will be compared.Finally,the indexes with significance in single factor analysis will
      be screened out, and the factors related to prognosis of massive cerebral infarction will be
      further analyzed by multi-factor logistics regression.
