  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of Dexmedetomidine
      Transdermal System (DMTS), compared with placebo, in participants following abdominoplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, one-time application study of DMTS or
      matching placebo over a 4-day treatment period.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive DMTS or matching placebo.
      Subjects will reside at the clinical study unit for up to a total of 7 days. The surgical
      procedure, the intraoperative anesthesia, and the medication used for infiltration of the
      wound for local anesthesia before the last stitch will be standardized. During the
      postoperative period in the clinical study unit, recovery procedures will be standardized.
