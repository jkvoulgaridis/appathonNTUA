  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to assess the feasibility of multi-field, extended
      HD-tDCS (MFE-HD-tDCS) with simultaneous computerized CT as a viable intervention to improve
      cognitive function in patients with MCI. This double-blinded, randomized pilot clinical trial
      of repetitive daily HD-tDCS/sham HD-tDCS, administered in combination with CT to subjects
      with MCI in 3 monthly blocks of 5 daily sessions for a total of 15 sessions will enroll 8
      participants.

    <description>This pilot study would prove the feasibility of the proposed approach. Treatment completion rates of less than 75% could be reasonably excluded if all 8 patients are observed to complete the 6 month treatment.</description>

    <description>Recruiting and consenting 8 patients over a period of 3 months would support the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale, 2-site, phase II trial with 120 MCI patients over a span of 5 years (i.e. approximately 32 patients/year</description>
