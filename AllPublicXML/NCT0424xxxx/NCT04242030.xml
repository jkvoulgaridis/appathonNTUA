  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some important progresses were made in the field of the meridian research, no
      breakthroughs have been achieved. Besides,there are some problems in meridian researches. The
      majority of the existing studies involve lots of subjective assessments for meridian
      phenomena. In addition, few studies have investigated the site specificity between two
      specific meridians.Therefore, this study is designed to detect the microcirculatory
      characteristics of meridian phenomena by using an objective assessment tool and investigate
      the site specificity for the meridian-visceral association and surface-surface association
      between two specific meridians.

      The Lung and Heart meridians are chosen as two specific studied meridians. 120 participants
      will be enrolled and divided into the healthy control group, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) group and healthy intervention group. Laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) will be
      used to assess the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomena for the Heart and
      Lung meridians. The site specificity for the meridian-visceral association will be
      investigated by comparing the microcirculatory difference between the Heart and Lung
      meridians in the healthy control group and COPD group. Besides, participants in the healthy
      intervention group will receive two sessions of moxibustion in the Heart meridian and Lung
      meridian respectively to explore the site specificity for the surface-surface association.

    <description>Participants in the COPD group will receive examination of laser doppler flowmetry(LDF).
The LDF probes will be left at 4 measuring acupoints, which include Shenmen (HT7) and Shaohai (HT3) of the Heart meridian, Taiyuan (LU9) and Chize (LU5) of the Lung meridian.</description>

    <description>Two sessions of moxibustion will be performed in the Heart meridian and Lung meridian successively.
Intervention in the Heart meridian: moxibustion will be performed above Shaohai (HT3) for 15 minutes. During moxibustion, the probes of laser doppler flowmetry will detect the microcirculatory characteristics of three measuring sites, which include the midpoint of the Heart meridian along the left forearm, Chize (LU5) of the Lung meridian, and the midpoint of the Lung meridian along the left forearm.
Intervention in the Lung meridian: moxibustion will be performed above Chize (LU5) for 15 minutes. During moxibustion, the probes of laser doppler flowmetry will detect the microcirculatory characteristics of three measuring sites, which include the midpoint of the Lung meridian along the left forearm, Shaohai (HT3) of the Heart meridian, and the midpoint of the Heart meridian along the left forearm.</description>
