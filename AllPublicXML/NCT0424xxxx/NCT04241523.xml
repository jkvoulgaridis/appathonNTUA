  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lenvatinib is the standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      The aim of the single-arm, open-label, phase II clinical trial is to assess efficacy and
      safety of lenvatinib as a preoperative conversion therapy in patients with potentially
      resectable HCC. Investigator hypothesized that lenvatinib may be an effective conversion
      treatment for HCC, and preoperative treatment with lenvatinib can improve resectability in
      patients with potential resectable HCC and improve the long term survival.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with potentially resectable HCC (intermediate or advanced stage), upfront
      therapy with surgical resection is of high recurrence rate after surgery. The aim of the
      single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial is to evaluate whether
      preoperative lenvatinib treatment could improve resectability and therefore improve the long
      term survival.

      Participants who are recruited in this study in this study will be treated with lenvatinib
      and will be evaluated for the feasibility for surgical resection by a multidisciplinary team
      every 8 weeks. If the participants underwent curative resection, they will receive lenvatinib
      treatment for 48 weeks after surgery.

    <description>The percentage of patients who receive curative liver resection for HCC. The criteria for curative resection: (1) no active tumor thrombosis is observed in hepatic veins, portal veins, bile ducts or inferior vena cava; or the type of portal vein invasion was converted from Vp3/Vp4 to Vp1/Vp2; (2) no active metastasis to adjacent organs or distant organs, or to lymph nodes; (3) the surgical margin ≥ 0.5 cm; (4) the number of active tumor nodules decreases from ≥4 to &lt;4; (5) the ratio of future liver volume to standard liver volume increases from &lt;40% to ≥40% (for those with liver cirrhosis) or from &lt;30% to ≥30% (for those without liver cirrhosis).</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
A serious adverse event (SAE) refers to an event in clinical trials that requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, permanent disability, incapacity, threats to life or death, and birth defect, etc.
Number and classification of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 were recorded.</description>
