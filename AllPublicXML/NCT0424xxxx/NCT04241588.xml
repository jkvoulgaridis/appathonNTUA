  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neural basis underlying motor performance in children using a prosthesis has been
      severely understudied resulting in minimal empirical evidence. With the use of low-cost 3D
      printed prosthetics, the purpose of this study is to examine the assessment of primary motor
      cortex activation and the representation of gray and white matter in a child with congenital
      limb loss. This will be accomplished by cross-examining results from fNIR and Anatomical
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The proposed research uses anatomical MRI to test if
      children with unilateral congenital partial hand reductions demonstrate less gray and white
      matter in the motor representation zones. Moreover, the proposed research will focus on an
      assessment of motor performance using continuous and discrete tasks with a robotic
      manipulandum. Assessment of motor performance and neural networking are critical to
      increasing our limited knowledge of how the child increases the number of motor repertoires.

    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate enrolling a total of 40children between 3 and 18 years of age.
      Specifically, two groups of children will be recruited; children with unilateral congenital
      upper-limb reductions (n=20) and age and sex-matched control group of typically developing
      children (n=20). Considering the effect size from preliminary data and to account for a 10%
      drop-out rate, a total sample of 40 subjects will provide 80% power to detect a true
      standardized effect size.

      All subjects including controls will attend four data collection sessions that will include:
      one fitting session, second to obtain a baseline, the third visit will be one month after
      baseline, and the final visit will be four months after baseline. Participants will attend an
      initial measurement session to take a 3D scan of the affected and nonaffected upper limbs as
      well as several anthropometric measurements. During this session, three pictures of the upper
      limbs will be taken which will also be used to verify the fit the prostheses in a process
      previously validated by our research team. The subjects will then perform an anatomical MRI
      scan. The MRI scan is not a clinical scan intended for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.
      The research participants will then be asked to come for two testing visits. During the first
      testing visit (visit 1), participants will be fitted with the prosthesis and required
      adjustments to improve comfort and avoid pressure point will be performed. After fitting the
      prosthesis, participants will be given 15 minutes to explore the prosthesis and adjust the
      tensioner dial to regulate the opening of the fingers to perform the Box and Block Test.
      After the training and accommodation period, participants will be asked to perform 3 trials
      of flexion and extension of each wrist with and without the prosthesis and 3 different trials
      of the Box and Blocks Test for each hand while monitoring neural activity of the primary
      motor cortex using a fNIRS device. After a brief period of rest and encouragement, the
      subject will be asked to perform eight trials of discrete (four trials) and continuous (four
      trials) tasks using a robotic manipulandum (InMotion Arm Robot, Interactive Motion
      Technologies, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). These tasks have been previously used for the
      assessment of changes in upper-limb performance and the effect of different treatments in the
      recovering of motor function of children with acquired or congenital hemiparesis, ataxia, and
      hemiparesis. This data collection performed at baseline will be performed again one and four
      months after baseline. Eight weeks after the baseline measurements, participants will be
      asked to visit our laboratory for a second time and perform the same assessments. Between the
      testing visits, participants will be encouraged to use the prosthesis for a minimum of 2
      hours a day.

    <measure>Change of mean values of brain hemodynamic responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline of mean values of brain hemodynamic responses at 4 month.</time_frame>
    <description>The oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) are two major chromospheres in the blood which absorb NIR light. The concentration of HbO and HbR varies in the capillary blood during the rest and task sessions. Thus, brain functional information can be revealed by the estimation of HbO and HbR. HbT is the total hemoglobin.</description>

    <measure>Change of hemispheric dominance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline of hemispheric dominance at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Laterality Index revealing hemispheric dominance. The Laterality index will reveal hemispheric dominance using the following formula:
Laterality index=(Oxy l-Oxy r)/(Oxy l+Oxy r) In this equation, l represents the channels from the left hemisphere and r indicates the channels from the right hemisphere. The Laterality index value will reveal which channels in the group showed a higher change during the task. Positive values indicate left-hemisphere dominant activation, while negative values indicate a right-hemisphere dominant activation.</description>

    <description>The parents of the participants select a response for each question using the following categories which are scored from 0 to 4: &quot;not at all&quot; =0, &quot;a little&quot; =1, &quot;somewhat&quot; =2, &quot;a lot&quot; =3, or &quot;very much&quot; =4. A higher score indicates higher satisfaction. The CAPP-PSI is a standardized measure of prosthesis satisfaction in children with limb deficiency.</description>

A higher score indicates higher satisfaction. The OPUS is a self-report questionnaire consisting of five modules. Module 5 (OPUS Satisfaction) will be used to assess different satisfaction element.</description>

    <description>The fingers and thumb were made of polylactic acid polymer manufactured using industrial 3D printers. The palm, socket, forearm brace, and leveraging the structure were made of polylactic acid which has properties similar to thermoplastic that facilitate post-manufacturing adjustments. Elastic cords placed inside the dorsal aspect of the fingers provided passive finger extension. Finger flexion was driven by non-elastic cords along the palmar surface of each finger and was activated through 20-30 degrees of wrist or elbow flexion. The device will be given to participants so that they may practice using the device at home.</description>
