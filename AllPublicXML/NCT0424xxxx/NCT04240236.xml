  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that preemptive scalp block in neurosurgical
      patients may decrease incidence of PONV after craniotomy through decreasing intraoperative
      inhalational agents' concentration and decreasing intraoperative opioids requirements, with
      better intraoperative hemodynamics and lesser recovery time

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will be recruited after admission to the hospital for surgery. Randomization will be
      performed using computer-generated random number tables in opaque sealed envelopes prepared
      by an anesthesiologist who will be not part of the study

      Patients will be randomly divided into two groups using a computer generated random number
      chart. Group S received scalp block with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, whereas Group C received
      scalp block using 20 mL normal saline and will be considered as control group.

    <measure>PONV incidence &amp; severity during the 1st 24 hours in ICU.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of the PONV was classified as: 0: without PONV, 1: nausea, 2: vomiting and 3: vomiting more than 2 times [8]. In addition, the incidence of PONV, the first time there was need for ondansetron and its total dose was recorded. With PONV score â‰¥ 2, the investigators used 4 mg ondansetron IV for antiemetic regimen. The total dose over 24 hours (given as divided doses) must not exceed adult dose of 32 mg.</description>

    <measure>Intraoperative Mean blood pressure in mmHg</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Mean blood pressure will be measured at specific timing coded as follows: Tzero: mean blood pressure will be measured preoperatively as baseline T1: mean blood pressure will be measured after intubation T2: mean blood pressure will be measured after scalp block T3: mean blood pressure will be measured during pinning T4: mean blood pressure will be measured at skin incision Then mean blood pressure will be measured every 15 min for 1 hour, and every 1 hour till end of surgery T-end: mean blood pressure will be measured at skin closure</description>
