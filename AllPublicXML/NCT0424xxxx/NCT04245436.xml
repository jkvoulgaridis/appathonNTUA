      To identify predictors of the magnitude and trajectory of response to flexibly-dosed
      duloxetine and escitalopram response in adolescents with anxiety, including those with
      depressive symptoms. And also to examine long-term predictors of sustained response and
      relapse in adolescents. To examine predictors of developing depressive disorders in anxious
      adolescents.

    <description>The PARS is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing the severity of anxiety symptoms associated with common anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The PARS score is derived by summing 5 of the 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, and 7)</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to duloxetine, treatment will be initiated at 30 mg qAM through Week 4 (V5) (consistent with the registration trial for duloxetine in pediatric patients with generalized anxiety disorder). Then, duloxetine will be increased to 60 mg qAM at Week 4 (V5) and will be continued at this dose until Week 6 (V6) or the end of the acute phase of the study. Beginning at Week 6 (V6), duloxetine may be increased to 90 mg daily and at Week 8 (V7), may be increased to 120 mg daily.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to escitalopram, will initiate treatment at 5 mg qAM for 1 week and then 10 mg qAM (the recommended starting dose for adolescents 12-17 years and the dose used in the pediatric registration trials). After Week 4 (V5), escitalopram will be increased to 15 mg and this dose will be continued until either Week 6 (V6) or the end of the acute phase of the study; however, at Week 6 (V6), escitalopram may be increased to 20 mg qAM based on efficacy.</description>
