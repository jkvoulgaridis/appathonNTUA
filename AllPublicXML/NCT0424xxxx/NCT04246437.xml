  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-synucleinopathies refer to age-related neurodegenerative and dementing disorders,
      characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in neurons and/or glia. The anatomical
      location of alpha-synuclein inclusions (Lewy Bodies) and the pattern of progressive neuronal
      death (e.g. caudal to rostral brainstem) give rise to distinct neurological phenotypes,
      including Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Dementia with Lewy Bodies
      (DLB). Common to these disorders are the involvement of the central and peripheral autonomic
      nervous system, where Pure Autonomic Failure (PAF) is thought (a) to be restricted to the
      peripheral autonomic system, and (b) a clinical risk factor for the development of a central
      synucleinopathy, and (c) an ideal model to assess biomarkers that predict phenoconversion to
      PD, MSA, or DLB. Such biomarkers would aid in clinical trial inclusion criteria to ensure
      assessments of disease- modifying strategies to, delay, or halt, the neurodegenerative
      process. One of these biomarkers may be related to the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) and
      related changes in the substantia nigra (SN) and brainstem. [18F]F-DOPA is a radiolabeled
      substrate for aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAADC), an enzyme involved in the production
      of dopamine. Use of this radiolabeled substrate in positron emission tomography (PET) may
      provide insight to changes in monoamine production and how they relate to specific
      phenoconversions in PAF patients. Overall, this study aims to identify changes in dopamine
      production in key regions including the SN, locus coeruleus, and brainstem to distinguish
      between patients with PD, MSA, and DLB, which may provide vital information to predict
      conversion from peripheral to central nervous system disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a diagnosis if pure autonomic failure

          2. Patients with autonomic failure and possible PD, MSA, or DLB

          3. Healthy adults aged 18 and above

          4. Clinical exam confirming clinical designation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have any type of bioimplant activated by mechanical, electronic, or
             magnetic means (e.g., cochlear implants, pacemakers, neurostimulators, biostimulators,
             electronic infusion pumps, etc.), because such devices may be displaced or
             malfunction.

          -  Subjects who have any type of ferromagnetic bioimplant that could potentially be
             displaced.

          -  Subjects who have cerebral aneurysm clips.

          -  Subjects who may have shrapnel imbedded in their bodies (such as from war wounds),
             metal workers and machinists (potential for metallic fragments in or near the eyes).

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, because the effects of high field MRI on fetuses are not
             yet known.

          -  Minors (younger than 18 years)

        Also excluded are subjects incapable of giving informed written consent:

          -  Subjects who cannot adhere to the experimental protocols for any reason, or have an
             inability to communicate with the researcher.

          -  Subjects who have limited mental ability to give informed consent, mentally retarded,
             altered mental status, mental disability, confusion, or psychiatric disorders.
