  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complementary and alternative therapies for weight loss treatment may be effective. There are
      few studies showing promise of the use of hypnosis in weight-reduction programs; however,
      there are lots of bias and more rigorous rials are needed to establish the relationship
      between hypnosis and weight management. Furthermore, the effect of hypnosis may not be
      directly related to weight loss but rather on behavioral change. On the basis of the trans
      theoretical model of change, we hypothesized that audio taped hypnosis would facilitate
      greater movement through the stages of change toward weight loss as compared to general
      advice.

      OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to assess the ability of audio taped hypnosis to
      promote weight loss through its effect on the stages and the processes of change as defined
      by the Trans theoretical Model of change.

      DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: American University of Beirut Medical Center.
      PARTICIPANTS: Adults with overweight and obesity will be recruited if they had previous
      attempt to lose weight, are planning to lose weight within the next 6 months or are not
      satisfied with the results of their current weight loss plan.

      INTERVENTIONS: This research will be triple blinded randomized placebo controlled trial. The
      intervention group will be listening to a hypnotic audio-file on a USB and the control group
      will be listening to a placebo audio-file on a USB . The hypnotic audio-file will consist of
      a 20 minutes recording prepared by an experienced hypnotist and the control audio-file will
      consist of a 20 minutes recording with direct messages targeting lifestyle modification.
      Follow up visits will take place at 21 days, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months following the
      intervention to assess for any change in participant's readiness to lose weight.

      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome will be the difference between the groups in
      acquiring at least one stage change (upward) as defined by the S-weight from baseline to 3
      weeks, 6 months and 12 months post intervention. The secondary outcomes include difference in
      the mean score of any item of the processes of change between hypnosis audio-file and control
      audio-file, weight in kg at 3 weeks, 6 and 12 months as compared to baseline weight, decrease
      in waist circumference in cm as compared to baseline at 6 and 12 months between the hypnosis
      and control groups, exploring factors that may affect any of the primary and secondary
      outcomes such as gender, age, educational status, baseline BMI, PHQ2.
