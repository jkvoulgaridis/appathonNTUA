  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Backwards walking has been shown to improve balance and walking in patients who have knee
      Osteoarthritis. It is not known if these benefits may also be seen after surgery in patients
      who have had a hip or knee replacement because of Osteoarthritis. This study will look to see
      if it is possible to conduct a bigger study into how effective backwards walking may be after
      joint replacement. Patients who come to the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford for a hip
      or knee replacement will be invited. They will be placed into one of two groups at random: a
      group where they have a course of physiotherapy plus a backwards walking programme or a group
      where they have a course of physiotherapy. The physiotherapy will last for 12 weeks and those
      who take part will have two study assessments. The first will be before any treatment and
      patients will complete five measures and also be issued with a simple tick box diary to
      complete over the 12 weeks. The second assessment will be after the treatment and will
      involve the same five measures and the diaries will be collected in. Participants at this
      assessment will also be asked if they would like to take part in an interview for the study.
      This is to see what the patients thought of the study. During the study the researcher will
      record things such as how many patients say 'yes' to the study and how many participants drop
      out of the treatment, to understand if a bigger study could take place.

    <description>This group will undertake a routine course of one to one out-patient physiotherapy which will include a BW programme. The BW programme will be prescribed by a physiotherapist and the participant will carry it out, along with other prescribed exercises, in their own home. Each participant will initially be prescribed a 5 minute BW programme to be completed once a day. The length of the BW programme and intensity will be progressed or regressed as deemed appropriate by the treating clinician with the aim for patients to achieve at least 10 minutes of BW every day of the week.</description>

    <description>This group will undertake a routine course of one to one out-patient physiotherapy over 12 weeks. To allow comparison between the two groups the control group will also have up to four review appointments where their home exercise programme can be progressed or regressed. The physiotherapy treatments will be not be restricted (apart from no BW programme) to allow for a pragmatic approach based on the treating clinician's clinical judgement, however their content will be recorded on treatment logs.</description>
