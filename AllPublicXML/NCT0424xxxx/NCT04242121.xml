  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the clinical application of
      the XN-1000/20 hematology analyzer for risk stratification in patients with multiple myeloma
      based on the number of detected plasma cells in peripheral blood at the different stages of
      treatment. This clinical study is observational and does not involve drugs. 100 subjects with
      newly diagnosed multiple myeloma will be enrolled in this study and followed for 3 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma is considered as a
      marker for highly proliferative disease and associated with a worse prognosis.

      Plasma cell counting is conventionally done by means of peripheral blood film morphology
      using light microscopy. However, this manual method is laborious as well as imprecise due to
      the low number of cells counted, and inter-observer variability. Flow cytometry with
      monoclonal antibodies is unsuitable as a screening test. The procedure is not automated, and
      it is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, new rapid, effective and inexepensive methods
      are needed for risk-stratification in patients with multiple myeloma.

      Automated antibody-synthesizing or secreting cells counting from routine haematology systems
      (XN-1000/20) without sample preparation and in less than 1 minute will further reduce the
      workload in haematology laboratories and it can be used for counting circulating plasma cells
      in peripheral blood in patients with multiple myeloma.
