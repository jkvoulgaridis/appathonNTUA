  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a dreadful disease due to its often advanced
      stage at diagnosis and poor sensitivity to chemotherapy. A locally unresectable tumor
      (locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC)) is present in 30% of the cases and is defined as
      a surgically unresectable tumor encasing the adjacent arteries [celiac axis, superior
      mesenteric artery (SMA)]. In these patients, chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for
      decades, optionally combined with radiotherapy. The results of small randomized trials
      comparing chemoradiotherapy with chemotherapy of patients with LAPC are divergent.
      Considering the emerging role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), the combination of
      checkpoint blocking antibodies with agents that target the inhibitory effects of the TME
      could lead to better responses in tumor historically resistant to checkpoint blocking
      antibody approaches. Furthermore, the addition of standard-of-care chemotherapy could further
      potentiate the anti-tumor effects of immunotherapy approaches by reducing the tumor burden,
      exposing antigens, and directly affecting the immunosuppressive TME compartment.

      To explore the safety and synergy of the proposed combinatorial approach, participants with
      locally advanced PC will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab administered in combination with
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel followed by immune-chemoradiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive nivolumab and ipilimumab. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg will be given on Day 1 (± 3
      days) of each 28-day treatment cycle. Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg will be given only on day 1 in cycle
      1. Nivolumab will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 (± 5) minutes and then, after a
      30 minutes rest period, ipilimumab will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 (± 5)
      minutes.

      Pre-medication for chemotherapy (based on standard-of-care and local institutional standards)
      and chemotherapy will then be administered after a further 30 minutes rest period. The
      recommended dose of nab-paclitaxel is 100 mg/m2 administered as an IV infusion over 30 to 40
      minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 will be adminestered
      over 30 to 40 minutes immediately after nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day
      cycle.

      At the beginning of cycle 3, patients also undergo concurrent MRI-guided adaptive SBRT (8 Gy
      x 3 fractions) delivered by ViewRay MR-Linear Accelerator.

      Cycles repeats every 4 weeks for 4 courses (16 weeks) in the absence of disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study closure.

      Once 4 cycles of study treatment have been completed, subjects without disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity may continue as per Investigator's Choice to either:

        -  Continuation of treatment with nivolumab, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine or surgery.
           Nivolumab can be continued until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity,
           withdrawal of consent, or up to 12 cycles in total. Patients will receive chemotherapy
           until PD, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent, according to investigator's
           judgment

        -  If tumor response allows for surgical intervention, the subject will be eligible for
           that treatment as deemed appropriate by the investigators. Surgical intervention may not
           occur prior to completing the planned 4 cycles of nivolumab, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine
           and SBRT regardless the patient demonstrates a major response to therapy. Patients after
           PC resection will receive treatment until recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal
           of consent, clear clinical deterioration, or for a maximum of 6 cycles, according to
           investigator's judgment Patients who discontinue without PD (stable disease (SD),
           partial response (PR), or complete response (CR)) will have both the safety follow-up
           period and survival follow-up period to occur simultaneously during the 2-year follow-up
           period. The duration of this follow-up is up to 2 years following the last dose of study
           treatment, although a longer follow-up period could be considered in selected cases if
           an efficacy signal is apparent. Patients will receive follow-up CT/MRI scans every 2
           months (±14 days) until documented progression of disease, withdrawal of consent from
           active participation in the study, lost to follow-up, or for at least 2 years after
           start of treatment, whichever is earliest. Tumor evaluations will be assessed by the
           investigators and response to be determined according to response evaluation criteria in
           solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 guidelines. Tumor assessment scans, for participants who have
           ongoing clinical benefit beyond the 2-year period from start of treatment, may continue
           to be collected as part of standard-of-care treatment. Subsequent therapies will also be
           recorded in this survival follow-up period.

      All subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason will have a safety follow-up visit
      about 30, 60 and 100 days after treatment discontinuation and will be followed for OS and
      post-study anticancer therapies approximately every 90 days by phone or review of medical
      records until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow-up.

      To minimize the risks of adding or nivolumab + ipilimumab followed by nivolumab and
      chemo-radiation, safety will be monitored by a Bayesian stopping rule for the rate of
      treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation greater than 30% (summarized baseline
      toxicity rate). For example, if 3 patients out of the first 6 or 4 out of the first 7
      evaluable patients experience treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation, accrual to
      the trial will be temporarily suspended and the principle investigator and study team will
      review the toxicity data and recommend either modification or termination of the trial.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 6 months

          -  ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 0-1

          -  All participants will be required to undergo mandatory pre- and on-treatment biopsies
             at acceptable clinical risk as judged by the investigator. An archival pre-treatment
             sample is acceptable

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10⁹/L

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (patients with Gilbert's
                  Syndrome must have a total bilirubin ≤ 50 mmol/L)

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception as
             indicated in Appendix 3. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is
             insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been
             done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per
             year) is required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be
             determined in consultation with the investigator. WOCBP must follow instructions for
             birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours,
             contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for
             the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. WOCBP should therefore use an
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for
             nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year (Appendix 3). The investigator shall review
             contraception methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men
             that are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when
             the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception
             should be continued for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the
             investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab is up to
             25 days. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31
             weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after
             the last dose of investigational drug. Women who are not of childbearing potential
             (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not
             require contraception

          -  Subjects must have signed and dated a BIOPAC approved written informed consent form in
             accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

             or checkpoint pathways

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results

          -  Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune
             condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger
             are permitted to enroll.
