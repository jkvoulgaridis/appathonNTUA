  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational, multi-center prospective, post-market registry is to
      confirm real-world device safety and performance, to ensure the continued acceptability of
      identified risks, and detect emerging risks.

      The objective is to collect product safety and performance data for Medtronic CE-Marked
      Coronary and Structural Heart (CSH) products.

      The main goals of this data collection are as follows:

        -  Detection of new emerging risks

        -  Ensuring the continued acceptability of identified risks

        -  Identification of any new device-related and procedure-related complications which were
           not anticipated or documented in the Instructions For Use (IFU) or Risk Management.

      Subjects are enrolled and, if applicable, followed according to routine care practices at
      their treating hospital.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Subject or legally authorized representative provides written data release and/or
           informed consent per institution and/or geographical requirements prior to discharge
           from participating registry hospital.

        -  Subject has or is intended to be treated or treated with an eligible Medtronic Coronary
           and Structural Heart (CSH) product

      Exclusion Criteria:

      â€¢ Currently participating in an investigational drug or device study.

      Data collection includes, for example:

        -  Demographics

        -  Product performance information

        -  Safety Events

        All consecutive subjects with the intent of being treated or treated (up to discharge from
        treating hospital) with a market-approved Medtronic CSH product, are candidates to be
        enrolled. The Investigator will determine subject eligibility in SYMBIOSIS based upon the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria. If a subject meets all inclusion and none of the exclusion
        criteria, they will be informed about the SYMBIOSIS Registry. SYMBIOSIS will collect data
        of numerous patient conditions for which Medtronic CSH products are being used.
