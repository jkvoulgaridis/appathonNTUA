    <description>The ITN delivers small electrical currents to the inner cavity of the nose, gently activating nerves that stimulate the body's natural tear production system. Those in the ITN &quot;active&quot; arm will receive the active tips which contain the current from the base to the nasociliary nerve. Those in the ITN &quot;sham&quot; arm will receive tips without the current.</description>
