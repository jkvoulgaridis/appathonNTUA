  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research shows that older people need reminders to increase fluid consumption. The aim of the
      research was to investigate the effect of an audible alarm on the fluid consumption of old
      people living in a nursing home. The research was conducted as a single-blind, randomized
      controlled, prospective experimental study on the pre-test post-test model.

      The study was performed between 27 July 2017 and 1 February 2018 at a nursing home in the
      west of Turkey. Out of 979 in nursing home who conformed to the inclusion criteria of the
      study, 100 (intervention group (n: 50) and control group (n: 50) were voluntarily included in
      the sample. The intervention group was given education and a wristwatch which gave an audible
      alarm to remind them to drink liquid, the control group was given only education. The old
      people in both groups were monitored before the education, after the education, after the
      audible alarm and 15 days after the audible alarm every three days on total of 12 days. The
      amount of liquid that the elderly should drink daily was determined according to Gaspar
      formula.

A Beyid wristwatch was used. This spoke the time in Turkish, every hour on the hour. In this way, the old people were reminded to drink a glass of liquid each hour. The watch had an alarm capability, and could be taken on to sleep mode at night in order not to wake the old people.</description>
