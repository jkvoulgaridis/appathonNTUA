  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the interpretation of multiparametric
      MRI (mpMRI) with an algorithm called habitat risk score (HRS) in combination with a panel of
      blood biomarkers is more effective at detecting prostate cancer than standard of care
      interpretation of mpMRI with the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS).

        Study participants will be targeted for enrollment from a consecutive cohort of men who are
        referred to the University of Miami for prostate cancer evaluation and management, which
        includes internal and external physician referrals, most often due to an increased PSA,
        and/or abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male participant, aged 40-85 years.

          2. In good general health as evidenced by medical history.

          3. Referred for a biopsy of the prostate for evaluation of prostate cancer due to
             elevated or increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or an abnormal digital rectal
             exam (DRE).

          4. Participant must agree to forego testosterone supplementation during the duration of
             the study due to unknown impacts on prostate cancer biomarkers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous or current history of prostate cancer or treatment for prostate cancer.

          2. Previous history of pelvic radiation.

          3. Known allergic reactions to MRI contrast or inability to undergo MRI due to renal
             toxicity.

          4. Inability to undergo blood draw or biopsy of the prostate as per protocol.

          5. Prior MRI guided biopsy of the prostate for prostate cancer evaluation.

          6. Previous prostate biopsy or prostate procedure within 6 months of enrollment within
             the trial.

          7. Standard contraindications to MRI, such as allergies to contrast die, renal toxicity,
             ferromagnetic metal in body/eye, pacemaker, defibrillator, other mechanical device, or
             extreme claustrophobia (medication with anti-anxiety agents, such as Ativan, may be
             attempted) will prevent eligibility and will be applied for all protocol-related MRIs.

          8. Patients with impaired decision-making capacity.
