    <time_frame>3-5 days post-enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will be contacted by phone to ascertain whether they took antibiotics for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. 'Appropriate antibiotic treatment' is a dichotomous measure. If the participant's throat swab was positive for GAS and they took antibiotics, or if their throat swab was negative for GAS and they did NOT take antibiotics, antibiotic treatment will be deemed 'appropriate.' All other scenarios will be deemed not 'appropriate.'</description>

    <description>The MD who clinically assessed the patient and who later discharged the patient home will be asked - if the participant was randomized to rapid testing - whether the testing was helpful. (The outcome will be ordinal on a Likert scale). If the participant was randomized to standard testing, they will be asked how helpful NOT having rapid testing was, again measured on the same Likert scale.</description>
