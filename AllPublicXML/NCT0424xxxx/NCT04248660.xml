    <textblock>
      Uterine artery doppler measurements will be made at 11-14 weeks and 20-22 weeks of gestation,
      and the classification of these measurements according to type of delivery; and to
      investigate the change in the effect of delivery type on uterine artery flows on obstetric
      outcomes (maternal, fetal, neonatal outcomes).

    <textblock>
      The first and second trimester perinatal examination results performed by the same operator
      from pregnant women who have applied to the clinic since the first trimester are removed from
      the ViewPoint 6.0 server and database and their uterine artery doppler values (uterine artery
      PI and RI values, presence of uterine artery notch), placental location, gestational week of
      measurement, blood pressures, PAPP-A and hCG MoM values, obstetric results (type of birth,
      week, weight, ante-postpartum complications), data to be generated from other hospital
      records will be saved to the base

        Patients who had uterine artery doppler measurements and delivered at 11-14 weeks and 20-22
        weeks of pregnancy will be the study group. these patients; Doppler results will be
        classified according to pregnancy results, and the classification of these measurements
        according to type of delivery; and the effect of delivery on uterine artery flows on
        obstetric outcomes (maternal, fetal, neonatal outcomes) will be examined.
