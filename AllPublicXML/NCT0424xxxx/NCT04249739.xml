    <description>Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Keytruda ™ (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. The
             subject may also provide consent for Biomedical Research. However, the subject may
             participate in the main trial without participating in Biomedical Research.

          2. Be 19 years of age on day of signing informed consent (or acceptable age according to
             local regulations, whichever is older).

          3. Have histologically or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of gastric or GEJ
             adenocarcinoma. (EBV positive GC and MSI-H GC will be excluded from this study). The
             patients must have EBV negative and MSS (or MMR-proficient) GC to enter this study.

          4. Have metastatic disease or locally advanced, unresectable disease.

             lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if
             progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.

          6. Newly obtained fresh biopsy is required before enrollment (stomach biopsy required but
             if stomach cancer is not intact due to previous surgery, metastatic lesion biopsy can
             substitute)

          7. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          8. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should

          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication . Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         11. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of

          4. Has pre-existing peripheral neuropathy &gt;Grade 1.

          5. Is a WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to treatment
             . If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy
             test will be required.

          6. Has active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          7. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          8. Has a known sensitivity to any component of oxaliplatin or xeloda

          9. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

         10. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         19. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

         23. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

         24. Is or has an immediate family member (e.g., spouse, parent/legal guardian, sibling or
             child) who is investigational site or staff directly involved with this trial, unless
