  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase 1 healthy volunteer study to assess the mass balance, elimination, and metabolic
      profile of CRN00808. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A, to characterize the
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance of orally administered
      radio-labeled CRN00808; Part B, to determine the absolute bioavailability of CRN00808
      administered using CRN00808 and radio-labeled CRN00808 as intravenous and oral forms.

             cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix may be enrolled.

          3. Use of any investigational drug within the past 60 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer

          4. Have a medically significant abnormality observed during screening or the admission
             physical examination or in any other baseline measurements

          5. Use of any prior medication without approval of the investigator within 14 days prior
             to admission

             C antibody (HCV-Ab) or has a history of a positive result

          7. History of alcohol or substance abuse in the past 6 months

          8. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the subject's
             appropriate participation in this Phase 1 study
