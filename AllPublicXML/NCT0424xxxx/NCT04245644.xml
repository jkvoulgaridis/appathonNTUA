    <textblock>
      The evidence on the value of aspirin, statins, metformin, beta-blocking ACE inhibitors agents
      as chemopreventive agents in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is limited.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether regular use of aspirin, statins, metformin,
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blocking agents use, before
      diagnosis, after surgery and in neo-adjuvant treatment setting, can increase rate of
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in participants with pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma. The secondary aim is to evaluate if there is any difference in terms of
      &quot;chemoprevention&quot; between aspirin, statins, metformin and beta-blocking as chemopreventive
      agents, and if their prolonged daily use can positively influence the chemopreventive action.

      400 patients with the following inclusion criteria will be enrolled in 3 years:

        1. cytological or histological diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in any portion
           of the gland, with or without metastases in other sites

        2. patient age between 18 and 90 years

        3. any medicine or drug in the daily patient therapy

        4. Patients undergone to primary chemoradiotherapy or surgical resection, followed by
           adjuvant therapy or preceded by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, are included in the study
           Anamnestic, clinical and pathological data, included data on the aspirin, statins,
           metformin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blocking agents
           assumption will be collected during the first visit with the surgeon. A database managed
           by a dedicated data manager will be created to collect and analyse data.

      Patients will be followed for at least 24 months The study will last overall 5 years.

      Sample size and Population

      This study is designed as a monocentric observational prospective study. In a recent study
      [9] authors found that the use of low-dose aspirin before and after a diagnosis of pancreatic
      cancer reduces of 32% the risk of recurrence (Hazard ratio HR=0.68, p&lt;0.01). On the basis of
      this study and considering that we will study the effect of other drugs as chemopreventive
      agents, the estimate required sample size to achieve 90% power to detect at least 28%
      reduction in a hazard of the &quot;drug users&quot; group, by using a two-sided 0.05-level log-rank
      test, is 400. Therefore, from February 2019 to February 2022 we expect to enroll 400 patients
      with a diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at any stage meeting the following
      inclusion criteria. Median follow-up is estimated to be 24 months after the first disease
      diagnosis.

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria

      Inclusion criteria are:

        1. cytological or histological diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in any portion
           of the gland, with or without metastases in other sites

        2. patient age between 18 and 90 years

        3. any medicine or drug in the daily patient therapy

        4. Patients undergone to primary chemoradiotherapy or surgical resection, followed by
           adjuvant therapy or preceded by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, are included in the study

      Exclusion criteria are:

        1. age under 18 years

        2. lack of cytological or histological diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

      Data collection methods

      Anamnestic, clinical and pathological data, included data on the aspirin, statins, metformin,
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blocking agents assumption will be
      collected during the first visit with the surgeon. A database managed by a dedicated data
      manager will be created to collect and analyse data. The PI will be responsible of the data
      security.

      Statistical analysis

      Association between variables will be assessed using the Chi Squared test (or Fisher's exact
      text where appropriate) for categorical variables and the Spearman's correlation for scale
      variables. DFS and OS will be estimated using Kaplan-Mayer method and Log Rank tests will be
      used to evaluate the difference between survival curves. The impact of aspirin, statins,
      metformin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blocking agents on the
      risk of recurrence will be estimated using Cox regression models. Variables resulting
      significant (p value &lt;0.05) at univariate analysis or variables which are known
      prognostic/risk factors will be included in the multivariable regression models. A p value of
      &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis will be conducted
      using SPSS v23 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) and R v3.3.0 (https://cran.r-project.org).
