  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators want to find the concentration of epidural ropivacaine, which can block
      hemodynamic changes in the onset of pneumoperitoneum in the laparoscopic gastrectomy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to previous patient's response, the investigators will allocate the concentration
      of ropivacaine of next patient during Co2 insufflation. And, for this allocation of
      concentration of ropivacaine, the investigators use biased coin design up-and-down method.

      Based on the practices, the starting concentration is 0.375 %, and the step size of
      concentration is 0.125%.

    <description>Heart rate will be recorded before anesthesia induction, during CO2 insufflation, after Co2 insufflation. The mean value of heart rate before anesthesia induction will be regarded as the baseline values. If maximum heart rate after Co2 insufflation increased by &gt;20% from baseline value, the response will be regarded as &quot;fail&quot; and increased concentration of ropivacaine will be applied to next patient by up and down method.</description>
