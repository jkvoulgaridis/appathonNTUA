  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will address a critical knowledge gap: there are no evidence-based
      smartphone apps for reducing young adult drinking. The purpose of the study is to test
      alcohol-related smartphone applications designed to provide assistance during actual drinking
      situations to help young adults reduce their drinking. It is the researchers hypothesis that
      participants will self-administer less alcohol when using the experimental app with feedback.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An app giving in-the-moment feedback could increase perceived impairment, and reduce drinking
      and consequences.

      The cued go/no-go (CGNG) task is an ideal choice for in-the-moment impairment feedback. Its
      instructions are simple; practice effects are minimal; and is sensitive to alcohol. The CGNG
      tests ability to respond fast to &quot;go&quot; targets (activation) while withholding response to
      &quot;no-go&quot; targets (inhibition). Activation/inhibition tension is externally valid. Dual process
      models posit risk behaviors stem from overactive appetitive drives that are compelling and
      hard to inhibit. Poor CGNG performance post-alcohol has been related to poor simulated
      driving, enhancing external validity. Moderate dosing to .05-.06% blood alcohol content (BAC)
      reliably increases inhibition errors, but slowing reaction time (RT) to &quot;go&quot; cues requires
      higher doses. RT to go cues often recovers later in a drinking episode (acute tolerance) but
      ability to inhibit does not. Thus at this BAC, ability to respond remains but inhibition is
      impaired, which relates to risk behaviors like DUI as young adults underrate impairment.

    <intervention_model_description>heavy drinking young adults will be randomized to 1 of the 3 apps. After initial use of their randomized app, they will then be dosed to .06% blood alcohol content (BAC) in groups of 3 in a naturalistic lab, followed by app use, then 1-hr when they can self-administer alcohol up to .12%. For 4 weeks post-session, all participants will use the experimental app for 2 weeks in real drinking occasions and not use it the other 2 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
