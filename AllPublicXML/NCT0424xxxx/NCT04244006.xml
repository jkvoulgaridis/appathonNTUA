  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no effective therapy for the management of Netherton Syndrome (NS)
      Patients use emollients with a limited efficacy on scaling and no efficacy on skin
      inflammation and pruritus. They may also use topical corticosteroids or calcineurin
      inhibitors in case of eczematous lesions. The use of therapies targeting skin inflammation
      has been reported in a few case reports. Their efficacy is very limited and their uses are
      limited because of the chronicity of the disease, the impaired skin barrier function and the
      risk for skin infections and skin cancers. Therefore, there is a huge medical need for novel
      therapies in NS.The expected consequences of this study are that a 16-week course of
      dupilumab will be more effective than placebo for the treatment of moderate to severe NS
      Dupilumab could therefore improve skin condition and quality of life.

      This is a proof of concept (pilot) double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of NS. Patients will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive dupilumab (2 doses of 300 mg), or placebo, at baseline
      and then 1 dose of dupilumab 300 mg, or placebo, every 2 weeks until week 14 (total of 8
      administrations).Moderate to severe NS were selected in order to be able to measure the
      improvement of skin condition.
