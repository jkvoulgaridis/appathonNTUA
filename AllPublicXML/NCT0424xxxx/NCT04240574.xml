  <brief_summary>

      This study will investigate the clinical efficacy of micro water jet technology in the
      debridement and healing of chronic lower extremity ulcers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort, single-center, open-label study in subjects with chronic lower
      extremity wounds. The study will enroll up to 20 subjects. Subjects will undergo screening
      evaluations to determine eligibility to enroll in the study. All study subjects will receive
      micro water jet technology debridement as opposed to other debridement methods as part of
      their wound care treatment. The other aspects of subjects wound care protocol will remain
      unchanged. In the case of bilateral limb ulcers, or multiple ulcers, subjects will have the
      option to receive micro water jet debridement on one or all of the ulcers.
