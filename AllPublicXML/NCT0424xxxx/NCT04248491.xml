  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the Emsella Chair therapy to Sham and to
      determine whether electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of chronic pelvic
      pain. Currently there are no other studies utilizing the Emsella Chair for the treatment of
      chronic pelvic pain. Eligible subjects will receive 2 treatments per week for a total of 4
      weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common and often debilitating in both men and women. It occurs
      below the umbilicus and is severe enough to cause functional impairment or require treatment.
      The health care burden of CPP is substantial. First line treatments involve a
      multidisciplinary approach and include general relaxation and stress management, patient
      education, self-care and behavioral modification, and pain management. Second-line agents
      include physical therapy (avoiding kegel exercises), and oral and intravesical agents. More
      invasive options including neuromodulation.

      The Emsella chair is currently approved as a treatment for stress urinary incontinence.
      Chronic pelvic pain patients may benefit from treatment. The Emsella chair generates
      electromagnetic stimulation which is able to penetrate deep into the pelvic floor muscles
      inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation for weak pelvic floor muscles. The Emsella
      chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment
      of SUI, in addition to other pelvic floor related discorders. HIFEM technology induces deep
      pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises
      over 28 minutes.

    <description>Since both overactive bladder (OAB) and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) share urinary urgency and frequency symptoms, this validated measure will evaluate additional aspects associated with OAB and IC/BPS. The OAB-q SF consists of two scales assessing symptom bother and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in patients with OAB.

    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) lists thirteen statements describing different thoughts and feelings that may be associated with pain. Each statement is rated as: 0 =not at all, 1= to a slight degree, 2= to a moderate degree, 3= to a great degree, and 4= all the time. Subjects who report a larger number associated with such thoughts during pain are more likely to rate the pain as more intense.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to sit on the device and the height will be adjusted until the subject's feet are on the floor. The active treatments are individualized, since some subjects will be more sensitive than others. The Emsella Chair will be turned on and the setting gradually increased to the subject's sensory threshold; the maximum sensation the subject can tolerate. The setting will be decreased slightly and stay unchanged for the remainder of the treatment. The treatment threshold should be increased with every treatment until the subject reaches 100%.</description>
