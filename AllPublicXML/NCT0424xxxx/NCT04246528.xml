  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) is an organization established
      by researchers, health care providers, and people living with scleroderma (systemic
      sclerosis; SSc) from Canada, the United States, Mexico, Australia, France, Spain, and the
      United Kingdom. The objectives of SPIN are (1) to assemble a large cohort of SSc patients who
      complete outcome assessments regularly in order to learn more about important problems faced
      by people living with SSc and (2) to develop and test a series of internet-based
      interventions to help patients manage problems related to SSc, including a self-management
      program (SPIN-SELF Program).

      In the SPIN-SELF full-scale trial, eligible SPIN Cohort participants will be randomized to
      the SPIN-SELF Program or to usual care only. The SPIN-SELF Program was designed by SPIN
      members based on key tenets of behaviour change that have been successfully incorporated in
      programs for more common diseases and on patient input. It utilizes social modelling through
      educational videos of SSc patients describing their challenges and what they have done to
      cope with SSc, as well as videos teaching key self-management techniques. After an
      introduction to self-management and instructions on how to navigate the program, a short quiz
      comprised of one-item questions will direct patients to modules that are most relevant to
      their symptoms and disease management challenges. The program's modules address (1) pain; (2)
      skin care, finger ulcers, and Raynaud's; (3) sleep problems; (4) fatigue; (5)
      gastrointestinal symptoms; (6) itch; (7) emotions and stress; (8) body image concerns due to
      disfigurement; and (9) effective communication with healthcare providers.

      The proposed SPIN-SELF trial is a pragmatic RCT embedded in the SPIN Cohort that will
      evaluate the effectiveness of SPIN's self-management program, compared to usual care, on
      improving patients' disease management self-efficacy. The investigators will randomize 440
      SPIN Cohort patients with low disease-management self-efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SPIN Cohort currently includes over 1800 SSc patients from 47 sites in Canada, the United
      States, Mexico, Australia, and France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. SPIN Cohort
      participants complete outcome measures via the Internet upon enrolment and subsequently every
      three months. Eligible patients, based on questionnaire responses (Self-Efficacy for Managing
      Chronic Disease (SEMCD) Scale24 ≤ 7), will be invited to participate in the SPIN-SELF trial.

      Randomization of 440 SPIN Cohort patients will occur at the time of participants' regular
      SPIN Cohort assessments. Eligible participants will be randomized automatically using simple
      1:1 randomization, using a feature in the SPIN Cohort platform, which provides immediate
      randomization and complete allocation sequence concealment.

      The primary objective of the SPIN-SELF full-scale RCT is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      SPIN's online self-management program, compared to usual care, on disease management
      self-efficacy. Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of SPIN-SELF on functional
      health outcomes. Outcome measures that are routinely assessed as part of the SPIN Cohort
      assessments every 3-months will be evaluated.

      Statistical analyses will be done blind to trial arm allocation. For the primary analysis,
      the investigators will use an intent-to-treat approach that compares all patients randomized
      to intervention group to patients receiving usual care only. Intervention effects will be
      estimated using a generalized linear model, adjusted for baseline SEMCD scores, recruitment
      centre, sex, age, disease duration, and diffuse versus limited SSc status. The investigators
      will examine missing data effects using multiple imputation.

      Analysis of secondary outcome variables and time points will be done similarly. Analysis of
      usage log data will be conducted to understand the association of uptake and use patterns
      with intervention effect. Statistical significance for all analyses will be based on
      two-sided α = 0.05.

    <description>The 6-item SEMCD Scale measures self-efficacy among patients with chronic medical conditions by asking them to rate their confidence that they can perform certain tasks related to managing their disease. Items are rated on a numerical scale ranging from 1 (not confident at all) to 10 (totally confident). The score for the scale is the mean of all item scores, with higher scores reflecting greater self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>The SPIN-SELF program utilizes social modelling through educational videos of scleroderma patients who describe their own challenges and what they have done to cope with living with scleroderma, as well as videos of patients and health professionals who teach key self-management techniques. The program includes sections on general self-management skills, including goal-setting and self-monitoring), progress tracking, sharing goals and progress with friends and family, and patient stories of experiences with using self-management techniques to cope with SSc symptoms. The program's 9 modules focus on (1) coping with pain; (2) skin care, finger ulcers and Raynaud's; (3) sleep problems; (4) fatigue; (5) gastrointestinal symptoms; (6) itch; (7) managing emotions and stress; (8) coping with body image concerns due to disfigurement; and (9) effective communication with healthcare providers.</description>
