  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sought to determine if the number of meals per day with an adequate protein
      content (defined as eating &gt;30 g protein or &gt;0.4 g protein/kg body mass each) is associated
      with presenting physical disability in Mexican adults aged 60 years and older. Physical
      disability was evaluated with self-reported questionnaires for different activities of daily
      living.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detailed dietary information was obtained for each participant to estimate dietary protein
      intake per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner). One meal was considered with adequate protein
      content if it contained &gt;30 g or &gt;0.4 g/kg. Then, the number of meals with an adequate
      protein content was counted and classified as Zero meals, One meal, or Two or Three meals.

      Physical disability was assessed with two validated questionnaires. One for instrumental
      activities of daily living (Lawton) and another for activities of daily living (Barthel).
      Disability was classified for each questionnaire item according to the authors' scales. Most
      items considered a physical disability if the participant reported any difficulty performing
      that task.

      To analyze the association between the number of meals with adequate protein content
      (predictive variable) and physical disability (outcome variable), we used binomial logistic
      regression for each item. For the number of meals, we set the group of Zero meals as the
      reference. The analyses were adjusted for age, BMI categories, number of diagnosed diseases,
      sex, and inadequate protein intake per day (&lt;1.2 g/kg/d).

    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Disability reported for each item of instrumental activities of daily living (assessed with Lawton questionnaire). This instrument assesses how well the subject performs some daily activities involving tools (e.g. handling finances, taking medication, using the telephone). The instrument consists of five items for men and eight for women, and each item is coded for 0 (disabled) or 1 (functional) depending on if subjects are capable to successfully complete the activity. We only used the five items that apply for both men and women.</description>

    <measure>Disability on Activities of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Disability reported for each item of activities of daily living (assessed with Barthel questionnaire). This instrument assesses how well the subject performs some daily activities (e.g. dressing, using stairs). The instrument consists of ten items for both men and women coded as 0 or multiples of 5 (i.e. 5, 10, 15) depending on if subjects are capable to successfully complete the activity. When the subject performs the activity without difficulty (the highest score) he/she is deemed as functional, and any other difficulty as a disability.</description>
