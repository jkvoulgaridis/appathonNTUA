  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the antitumor efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in
      combination with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) versus CRT alone in participants with
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab +
      chemoradiotherapy is superior to placebo + chemoradiotherapy with respect to bladder intact
      event-free survival.

    <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the questions &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; and &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent).
