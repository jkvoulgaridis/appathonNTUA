    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment with either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is essential in patients with atrial fibrillation for
      the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) a condition that happens when a blood clot
      forms elsewhere in the body and travels through the blood stream to plug another vessel.
      While there are significant number of real-world publications on the use and outcomes of
      NOACs for stroke prevention, evidence from routine clinical practice on the use and outcomes
      of reduced doses of NOACs is scarce. By evaluating routine clinical practice data from
      national registers in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, researchers want to gather
      information about the safety and how well reduced doses of NOACs work in patients with
      irregularly heartbeats which are not caused by a heart valve problem (non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation, NVAF). As a primary aim of this study, treatment with low doses of NOACs
      (Xarelto [generic name rivaroxaban], Eliquis [generic name apixaban] or Pradaxa [generic name
      dabigatran]) will be compared with VKAs (warfarin) in Nordic patients with NVAF to assess the
      occurrence of stroke and systemic embolism [effectiveness]) and intracranial hemorrhage a
      type of bleeding that occurs inside the skull [safety]).
