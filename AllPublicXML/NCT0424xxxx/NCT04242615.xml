  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure (AKI) is defined by a deterioration of kidney function over a short
      period. This definition was clarified recently in order to allow homogenization and optimal
      comparison of patients in clinical studies by the classifications RIFLE in 2004, AKIN in 2007
      and KDIGO in 2013. These classifications decline several stages of ARI through the increase
      in the plasma creatinine level and the decrease in urine flow.

      Even though AKI is a frequent pathology in all hospitalized patients, there are only few
      studies that are interested in this entity in conventional hospital services except intensive
      care or intensive care. Indeed, the recent meta-analysis including the 154 studies focusing
      on the ARI defined by the KDIGO criteria, only 7 have recruited patients in conventional
      nephrology services. However, patients admitted for an ARI which requires treatment in a
      medical service probably have epidemiological characteristics and a different prognosis than
      those requiring treatment in intensive care. In addition, the parameters of the RIFLE, AKIN
      or KDIGO scores are more difficult to establish in conventional hospital services than in
      intensive care, especially for hourly monitoring of urine flow, not allowing an optimal
      classification of the episode of IRA.

      This study set out to develop a prognostic score for intra-hospital mortality in ARI based on
      a first historical cohort. The investigators then validated this score on a second
      prospective cohort obtained over an independent inclusion period and at a distance from the
      first.

        We included all patients over 18 years of age admitted for ARI, defined by an increase in
        serum creatinine of more than 50% of baseline serum creatinine in patients without chronic
        kidney disease or increased serum creatinine at 100 umol / L compared to baseline serum
        creatinine if the patient had a serum creatinine clearance less than 60 mL / min / 1.73m2
        calculated by the MDRD (Modification of the Diet in Renal Disease) formula, hospitalized in
        the Nephrology department of the Besançon University Hospital Center. Our exclusion
        criteria were kidney transplantation and patients from the intensive care unit.

        In our analysis, we constituted two cohorts: the first from January 1, 2001 to December 31,
        2004 for the development of the prognostic score, then a second extending from January 1
        2010 to December 31, 2013 for the validation of the score.
