      The objective and the purpose of the trial is to: assess the efficacy of Pregabalin Krka and
      Dulsevia® in patients with PDPN, investigate the effect of Pregabalin Krka and Dulsevia® on
      pain and on quality of life (QOL), depression symptoms, cognitive functions, sleep quality
      and daytime sleepiness and assess the safety of Pregabalin Krka and Dulsevia® in patients
      with PDPN.

      During the 3 months (12 weeks) 5 visits and 2 phone calls are planned.

      After the ICF signature and before therapy is allocated, a screening procedure is carried out
      to verify eligibility: laboratory analyses (concentrations of TSH, vitamin B12, folic acid,
      glucose, HbA1c, pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential), assessment of PDPN (with
      questionnaire DN4), assessment of cognition (with questionnaire MoCA), habits, medical
      history (medical/surgical history and concomitant diseases, previous and/or existing therapy
      of pain in PDPN, concomitant medications) with measurements and evaluation of pain according
      to VAS.

      On Visit 2 investigator checks the results of laboratory tests, of pregnancy test, measures
      vital signs, evaluates pain in PDPN according to VAS, checks previous analgesic therapy and
      concomitant medications.

      If patient meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, he/she is eligible and will be
      randomly assigned (automatically through electronic version of case report form (eCRF) into
      two therapy groups (treatment arms) - tretament with Pregabalin Krka OR treatment with
      Dulsevia®.

      Investigator performs assessments of: QoL, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, depression
      and adverse events.

      At Visit 3, compliance monitoring is done, pain intensity in PDPN by VAS is evaluated,
      concomitant therapy is checked, vital signs are measured, doses of IMP are adjusted and
      adverse events assessment are carried out.

      At Visit 4, pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and compliance monitoring are
      carried out; concomitant medications are checked, vital signs are measured, pain intensity in
      PDPN by VAS is evaluated, IMP are adjusted and assessment of adverse events is carried out.

      At Visit 5 investigator performs again assessments of: QoL, sleep quality and daytime
      sleepiness, depression, cognition and PDPN. Evaluation of the pain intensity in PDPN by VAS
      and assessment of the adverse events should be performed. Pregnancy test for women of
      childbearing potential is carried out.

      During the 3 months (12 weeks) 5 visits and 2 phone calls are planned.

      Procedures and administration:

      On arrival at the trial site at Visit 1 the patient receives the complete information on the
      trial procedures. The patient confirms his decision to participate by signing the informed
      consent form (ICF). After the ICF signature and before therapy is allocated, a screening
      procedure is carried out to verify eligibility: laboratory analyses (concentrations of TSH,
      vitamin B12, folic acid, glucose, HbA1c, pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential),
      assessment of PDPN (with questionnaire DN4), assessment of cognition (with questionnaire
      MoCA), habits, medical history (medical/surgical history and concomitant diseases, previous
      and/or existing therapy of pain in PDPN, concomitant medications) with measurements and
      evaluation of pain according to VAS.

      Patient is instructed not to take any PDPN medication and/or analgesics, if existing on a day
      of Visit 2.

      Information obtained at Visit 1 is input in the eCRF.

      Visit 2 (initial baseline visit): 0-7 days after Visit 1

      Investigator checks the results of laboratory tests, of pregnancy test, measures vital signs
      (heart rate, blood pressure), evaluates pain in PDPN according to VAS (separate assessments
      of current pain intensity, average pain intensity in last 24-h, worst pain intensity in last
      24-h, average pain intensity in last 4 weeks and worst pain intensity in last 4 weeks),
      checks previous analgesic therapy and concomitant medications.

      If patient meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, he/she is eligible and will be
      randomly assigned (automatically through electronic version of case report form (eCRF) into
      two therapy groups (treatment arms).

      Investigator performs assessments of: QoL (with questionnaire SF-36), sleep quality and
      daytime sleepiness (with questionnaires ISI and ESS), depression (with questionnaire MDI) and
      adverse events.

      Administration:

      Eligible screened patients are randomly assigned into two therapy groups (treatment arms):

      ARM 1: treatment with pregabalin (Pregabalin Krka) or ARM 2: treatment with duloxetine
      (Dulsevia®).

      Each patient receives a Patient diary number 1, including the doses of Pregabalin Krka or
      Dulsevia® (depending on randomization) from Visit 2 (day 1) till Phone call 1, scales for
      assessing the pain and with the date of Phone call 1.

      Treatment during PERIOD 1 (FLEXIBLE-DOSE REGIMEN during the first 14 days (±3 days) in order
      to allow the investigator to give each patient an optimal dose of IMP.

        -  ARM 1: pregabalin (Pregabalin Krka 25-150 mg/ day) FLEXIBLE-DOSE REGIMEN. Investigator
           can choose total Pregabalin Krka daily dose: 25 mg/day, 50 mg/day, 75 mg/day, 150 mg/day
           or 300 mg/day (from Phone call 1 further on)

        -  ARM 2: duloxetine (Dulsevia® 30-60 mg/ day) FLEXIBLE-DOSE REGIMEN:

      Investigator can choose total Dulsevia® daily dose: 30 mg/day or 60 mg/day

      At the Visit 2, RM is given to each patient to cover the treatment till the next Visit 3.

      Phone call 1: week 1 (± 3 days) At week 1 (7 ± 3 days after Visit 2) investigator calls the
      patient by phone and ask him or her about possible adverse events and to evaluate the pain
      intensity in PDPN by VAS which is a part of Patient diary 1.

      Investigator can adjust the dose of IMP during phone call:

        -  If average pain intensity in PDPN in last 24-h equal or below 30 mm (measured by VAS) is
           NOT achieved, the investigator can increase the dose;

        -  if bothersome adverse event occurs the investigator can decrease the dose (if possible).

      The investigator also ask the patient if he or she is taking the IMP appropriately (according
      to investigator's instructions).

      NOTE: On the next visit (Visit 3; 14 ± 3 days after Visit 2) following daily doses should be
      achieved by each patient:

        -  ARM 1: Total Pregabalin Krka daily dose: MINIMUM dose 150 mg/day

        -  ARM 2: Total Dulsevia daily dose: MINIMUM dose 60 mg/day

      Visit 3: week 2 (14 ± 3 days after Visit 2) At Visit 3, compliance monitoring is done, pain
      intensity in PDPN by VAS is evaluated, concomitant therapy is checked, vital signs are
      measured, doses of IMP are adjusted and adverse events assessment are carried out.

      Investigator collects the Patient Diary 1. Data in Patient Diary 1 are checked.Treatment

                (if patient was till now treted with lower dose) is required.

      At the Visit 3, RM is given to each patient to cover the treatment till the next Visit 4.
      Patient is requested to bring packages with all blisters (empty blisters and blister with
      unused IMPs and RM) on the Visit 4.

      Each patient receives a Patient diary number 2, including the doses of Pregabalin Krka or
      Dulsevia® (depending on randomization) from Visit 3 till Phone call 2, scales for assessing
      the pain and with the date of Phone call 2 (28 ± 3 days after Visit 3).

      Patient is requested to bring the Patient diary on the next visit.

      Information obtained at Visit 3 is input in the eCRF.

      Phone call 2: 4 weeks(28 ± 3 days) after visit 3 At week 6 (28 ± 3 days after Visit 3) the
      investigator again calls the patient by phone and asks him or her about possible bothersome
      adverse events and to evaluate the pain intensity in PDPN by VAS (separate assessments of
      current pain intensity, average pain intensity in last 24-h and worst pain intensity in last
      24-h) which is a part of Patient diary 2.

      The investigator can adjust the dose of Pregabalin Krka or Dulsevia®, if necessary. If
      average pain intensity in PDPN in last 24-h equal or below 30 mm (measured by VAS) is NOT
      achieved the investigator can increase the dose and if bothersome adverse event occurs the
      investigator can decrease the dose to the previous dose.

      The investigator also checks if the patient takes the medicines appropriately (according to
      investigator's instructions).

      Visit 4: week 8 (42 ± 3 days after Visit 3) At Visit 4, pregnancy test for women of
      childbearing potential and compliance monitoring are carried out; concomitant medications are
      checked, vital signs are measured, pain intensity in PDPN by VAS is evaluated (separate
      assessments of current pain intensity, average pain intensity in last 24-h and worst pain
      intensity in last 24-h, average pain intensity in last 4 weeks and worst pain intensity in
      last 4 weeks), IMP are adjusted and assessment of adverse events is carried out. Investigator
