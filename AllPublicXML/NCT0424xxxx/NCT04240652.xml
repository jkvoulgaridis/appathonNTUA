    <textblock>
      The greatest harm of diabetes is various acute and chronic complications, especially diabetic
      retinopathy(DR), leading to extremely high rates of disability and blindness. Early
      screening, early diagnosis, and early treatment are the keys to maintaining vision in
      patients with DR. However, compared with the high prevalence of diabetes in China, the DR
      screening ability is relatively inadequate. To change this situation, deep learning(DL), a
      form of artificial intelligence (AI), might be a potential effective method to solve this
      dilemma.

    <textblock>
      The greatest harm of diabetes is various acute and chronic complications, especially DR,
      leading to extremely high rates of disability and blindness. However, if the fundus
      examination is carried out regularly in the early stages of onset, the risk of blindness can
      be significantly reduced. Therefore, early screening, early diagnosis, and early treatment
      are the keys to maintaining vision in patients with DR. However, compared with the high
      prevalence of diabetes in China, the DR screening ability is relatively inadequate.

      The Diabetic Retinopathy Screening and Prevention Program is a branch project of MMC. Its
      purpose is to carry out an efficient workflow for early detecting, timely managing of DR, and
      to establish a referral system for implementing treatment and the long-term follow-up of DR
      by means of DL. First, In order to improve its sensitivity and specificity, more participants
      are involved in other medical institutes besides MMCs, then we can effectively explore the
      prevalance of DR in China and helps to early screening, prevention, treatment and referal
      process of DR. Secend, we collect participants' serum, plasma,DNA, several medical
      stastistics and life styles to explore genetics, new biomarkers, risk factors of DR.

      Objective:

        1. To validate the methodology and feasibility of DR screening using a DL based automated
           DR grading system in clinical practice.

        2. To explore the prevalence of DR and subgroup identification, and fundus images analysis,
           etc.

        3. To explore the genetics, new biomarkers, risk factors of DR.

        4. To explore the methods of early screening, prevention, treatment and referal process of
           DR.
