  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress perfusion CMR has recently considered as one of the methods of choice for establishing
      the diagnosis of CAD based on its high diagnostic accuracy, lack of ionizing radiation as
      well as its ability to simultaneously assess the cardiac function, myocardial perfusion, and
      viability, however, there are some concerns on its suitability for assessment of myocardial
      perfusion in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery who suffer from recurrent
      angina. The study of hemodynamic forces offers a promising tool for further understanding of
      the interplay between the myocardium and blood as well as the mechanisms of cardiac filling.
      This work represents a retrospective follow up study of CMR data, available on CMR-database,
      from 112 patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) performed around 10
      years before the initial CMR examination. The study subjects underwent stress CMR testing;
      using both stressors; dobutamine and adenosine (done on two separate occasions). Injection of
      gadolinium contrast medium for late gadolinium enhancement was done with adenosine stress
      testing for late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Offline analysis of these data will be done
      with the use of dedicated software for assessment for myocardial ischemia together with
      quantitative measurements of the hemodynamic forces with the help of dedicated software
      (QStrain version 1.3.0.79; Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands).

    <textblock>
      In total 112 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) subjected to stress
      CMR examination on two separate occasions with both stressors; dobutamine and adenosine for
      assessment of myocardial ischemia as result of typical /atypical angina pectoris. The results
      from dobutamine (namely, detection of wall motion abnormalities) and adenosine stress CMR
      (namely, detection of perfusion abnormalities) will be compared with the values obtained from
      the measures of the hemodynamic forces of the LV (i.e., changes in the intraventricular
      pressures during systole and diastole). The dimensionless root mean square (FRMS) is computed
      over the entire heartbeat as a measure of the overall force amplitude. In addition, LV global
      longitudinal strain (GLS) and LV global circumferential strain (GCS) will be measured using a
      CMR feature tracking techniques. The expected results are as follows: Dobutamine wall motion
      analysis in combination with perfusion imaging has the highest diagnostic accuracy for the
      detection of ischemia in patients after bypass surgery and outperforms pure dobutamine wall
      motion or perfusion analysis and adenosine perfusion. Whereas, perfusion imaging with both
      stressors reflects the extent of ischemia more precisely than wall motion analysis.
      Nevertheless, assessment of hemodynamic forces adds to the diagnostic accuracy as well as the
      prognostic value of stress CMR in post-CABG patients, in whom stress testing with either or
      both stressors might fail to precisely define myocardial ischemia or reflect an associated
      subtle cardiac dysfunction.

        The study population are known to have coronary artery disease and underwent
        revascularization therapy via bypass surgery around 10 years before the initial CMR
        examination. Those presented with manifestations of recurrent post-CABG angina, with either
        typical or atypical presentation. Each patient had two CMR examinations on two occasions
        using both dobutamine and adenosine stress agents.
