      The main objective of this study is to assess the burnout prevalence among French general
      practitioners in private practice.

      As secondary outcomes, this study aim to measure the impact of sociodemographic variables,
      organizational practice models and workload. the investigators also intend to characterize
      the prevalence of depression, anxiety, fatigue and stress, drugs and alcohol consumption, use
      of psychotropic medication, and preferred strategies to cope with their symptoms.

      The BOUM protocol is designed to provide a better understanding of the current burnout
      prevalence among French general practitioners, as well as its risk and protective factors.

      In order to fulfil those objectives, the methodologist estimated a 1536 individuals sample
      size, using an expected prevalence of severe burnout ranged between 10% and 20% (from the the
      EGPRN study - Soler, J.K., et al., Burnout in European family doctors: the EGPRN study.
      Family Practice, 2008. 25(4): p. 245-265), thus allowing the investigators to retrieve
      results with a 95% confidence level and a 2% error margin.

      All analyses will be performed in a bilateral formulation for a 5% alpha error under the
      Stata® software (version 13, StataCorp, College Station, US). A difference will be considered
      statistically significant for p&lt;0.05. The population will be described as frequency and
      percentage for the categorical variables, and as mean ± standard deviation or median
      [interquartile range] for the quantitative variables, according to their statistical
      distribution (normality studied by the Shapiro-Wilk test). Confidence intervals for
      population prevalence will be characterised with a binomial test. Comparisons between groups
      of burnout will be performed using Chi2 or Fisher's exact test for the categorical variables
      (followed by a Marascuillo post-hoc tests if needed), and by an ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test
      if normality and homoscedasticity not respected (Bartlett test) for the quantitative
      variables (followed by Tukey-Kramer or Dunn tests when necessary). Finally, considering the
      variables clinically relevant and those with a pertinent univariate analysis results, a
      multivariate analyse of ordinal polynomial regression type will be proposed; its results will
      be expressed as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals and presented as a Forest-plot.
