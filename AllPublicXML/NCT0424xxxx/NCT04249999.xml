  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased level of physical activity (PA) are of benefit in the management of cystic fibrosis
      (CF). This randomised control tial will assess whether three-months use of an online platform
      can help increase PA levels in people with CF (compared to a control group continuing routine
      treatment).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition that predominantly affects the lungs through an
      accumulation of thick mucus. As there is no cure for CF, it is a disease that is managed
      through intensive medication, nutrition, physiotherapy, exercise and physical activity (PA).

      Increased levels of PA are of benefit to people with CF, and therefore interventions that
      promote PA are warranted, particularly in adolescence, whereby PA levels decrease. Telehealth
      interventions are of particular interest in CF, whereby strict cross-infection guidelines
      prevent patients meeting in person, and allowing patients to overcome geographical barriers
      at the same time.

      Previous research has shown engagement with an online platform (www.activonline.com.au),
      specifically designed to monitor PA in CF, is feasible and acceptable to people with CF.
      Therefore, a full randomised control trial is warranted to assess the efficacy of this
      intervention in changing PA.
