  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of osteopathic manipulative treatment
      (OMT), a form of non-invasive manual treatment, for a faster recovery of cardiovascular
      parameters after a rugby union match in professional male athletes. To this end, the effects
      of OMT on resting cardiovascular function and cardiovascular reactivity were evaluated in
      twenty-three male players 18-20 hours after a match and compared with a corresponding
      no-match (control) condition. Assessment of resting cardiovascular parameters 18-20 hours
      after a match revealed the presence of elevated mean arterial pressure and heart rate, and
      reduced vagally-mediated heart rate variability compared with a no-match condition. OMT
      provoked a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure and increased vagally-mediated
      heart rate variability at rest both in the after match and control conditions. Moreover, OMT
      favoured a larger vagal withdrawal in response to an orthostatic stress compared with a sham
      treatment. These results suggest that OMT may be implemented as a recovery strategy to
      restore athletes' cardiovascular homeostasis after a rugby union match.

    <textblock>
      The presence of cardiovascular autonomic alterations in the aftermath of an intense exercise
      performed during a competitive match may indicate incomplete recovery and prolonged
      fatigue.Therefore, the implementation of effective interventions aimed at favoring a faster
      recovery of athletes' cardiovascular homeostasis in the aftermath of a competitive match may
      be beneficial for greater adaptations to subsequent training and enhanced overall
      performance. In this regard, osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is a form of
      non-invasive manual treatment that uses a set of touch, manipulation and mobilization
      procedures to diagnose, treat, and prevent illness or injury. In the present study, the
      investigators sought to explore the efficacy of a single session of OMT in restoring
      alterations in cardiovascular parameters at rest and in response to an orthostatic challenge
      in trained adult male athletes long after (18-20 hours) a rugby union match.
