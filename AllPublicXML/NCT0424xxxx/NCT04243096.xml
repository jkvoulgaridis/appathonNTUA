      This is a single-arm clinical trial to investigate wearable sensors for assessing outcomes
      following physical therapy in people with knee osteoarthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, single arm, interventional, 19-week study to investigate the utility
      of digital assessments to measure the efficacy of physical therapy for reducing pain and
      improving function in people with knee osteoarthritis. A total of 60 participants will be
      included. Participants will receive a supervised in-clinic physical therapy program for 12
      weeks and will undergo multiple laboratory functional assessments of strength, balance, gait
      and joint movement while being monitored with a motion capture system and wrist and lumbar
      wearable sensors. Additionally, participants' activities will be monitored at home with the
      same wrist and lumbar wearable sensors. After completion of the physical therapy program,
      there will be an additional 6-week monitoring period to measure persistence of the treatment
      effect during which time participants will continue to follow an exercise program at home.
      Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 week, 12 weeks, and 18 weeks.

      The primary objective will be to measure the effect of physical therapy on functional
      performance and pain using both patient reported outcomes questionnaires and digital metrics
      obtained from the laboratory assessments and wearable sensors worn at home. Pain phenotyping
      questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing assessments will be used to evaluate the
      effect of specific pain phenotypes in treatment response.
