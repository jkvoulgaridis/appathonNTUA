  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence supporting that physical therapy interventions can be effective for the
      management of patients with CTS. No consensus on the best approach exist. It seems clear that
      the median nerve is affected in several ways (compression, inflammation, excursion) in carpal
      tunnel syndrome. Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation is a treatment approach consisting
      of the application of an electrical current throughout needling filaments placed close to the
      nerve, in this case the median nerve. The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare
      changes in function, symptom severity and the intensity of pain after the application of
      Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation vs. endoscopic surgery in women with CTS at short-
      and long-term follow-up periods.

    <description>An 11-point Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS, 0: no pain - 10: maximum pain) will be used to assess the patients' current level of hand pain and the worst and lowest level of pain experienced in the preceding week.</description>

    <description>The Spanish version of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) will be used to assess function. This questionnaire evaluates 2 domains: 1) the functional status scale assesses ability to perform 8 common hand-related tasks; and, 2) the symptom severity scale includes 11 items assessing pain severity, numbness, and weakness at night and during the day. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (1: no complaint; 5: severe complaint), with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

    <description>. Subjects self-perceived improvement will be assessed using a Global Rating of Change (GROC) which consists of a 15-point scale ranging from -7 (a very great deal worse) to +7 (a very great deal better). It has been reported that scores of +4 and +5 are indicative of moderate changes in patient status, whereas scores of +6 and +7 indicate large changes in the status of the patient.</description>
