  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a free-living, 6-week fish oil (FO) or placebo (PLA) supplementation
      intervention alongside participants' habitual resistance exercise training (RET) regimens.
      Twenty young, healthy resistance-trained subjects who do not currently supplement with FO
      will be recruited to participate. An eligible participant will be between ages 18 and 35 and
      will have a minimum of two years of RET experience. Participants will be randomized into a FO
      group and a PLA group. The FO group will supplement with 4g/day of FO (4g fish oil
      concentrate: 2g EPA+ 1g DHA) and the PLA group will consume 4g/day of coconut oil (saturated
      fatty acids), as administered via gel capsules, in conjunction with their current RET
      program. Prior to intervention all participants will complete baseline biometric, strength,
      and neuromuscular testing. Participants will also have blood drawn to test for omega-3 fatty
      acid status, and complete and return a 3-day diet record and a physical activity recall. In
      order to monitor adherence to supplementation, FO and PLA bottles will also be returned
      weekly and pills will be counted. 3-day diet records will be obtained to ensure calorie and
      protein intakes remain consistent throughout the intervention period. Weekly physical
      activity records will also help to ensure consistency of participant training and to make
      sure all participants are following their training regimes in a progressive fashion.
      Following 6 weeks of FO or PLA supplementation, subjects will repeat all initial biometric,
      strength and neuromuscular testing, as well as a second, post-intervention blood draw.
