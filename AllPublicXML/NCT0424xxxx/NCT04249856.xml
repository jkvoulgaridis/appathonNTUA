    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the Dynamic Spectral Imaging (DSI) Colposcope (DySIS) in it's ability to
      diagnose cervical dysplasia. Half of participants with be examined by the DySIS colposcope,
      there the other half will be examined by standard colposcopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colposcopy has been shown to be a subjective exam, and is dependant on the colposcopists.
      Sensitivity for colposcopy has been shown to be as low as 50%.

      To improve this, different adjunctive technologies have been introduced to add a more
      objective approach to the colposcopy exam. One of these devices is the DySIS colposcope,
      which measures the aceto-white reaction that may occur on the cervix uteri after the
      application of acetic-acid. The device provides the examiner with a colour-coded map
      indicating areas of interest. Studies have shown promising results indicating that using this
      device together with the colposcopists own interpretation of the cervix uteri can potentially
      lead to an increase in the performance of the colposcopy exam.

      In Denmark all women referred for colposcopy have 4 biopsies taken, according to the Danish
      national guidelines.

      In our study these 4 biopsies are as following:

        1. The area the colposcopists views as the worst before the DSI-map is seen.
           Colposcopy-Directed Biopsy (CDB)

        2. The area indicated as the worst by the DSI-map (DSI-directed biopsy)

        3. additional biopsy

        4. additional biopsy All biopsies are placed in separate containers and analysed separately
           by specialized pathologists.
