      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (1:1) controlled clinical trial, which plans
      to enroll 260 subjects. The aim of study is to assess the safety and efficacy of SeQuent® SCB
      in the treatment of in-stent restenosis in coronary arteries.

      All eligible subjects with ISR lesion in coronary will be randomly assigned to receive
      SeQuent® SCB (study group) or receive SeQuent® Please Neo (control group) balloon treatment.
      All subjects will be scheduled to clinical follow up at 30 days, 6 months, 9 months and 12
      months after index procedure and will be scheduled to receive the angiography at 9 months
      after index procedure. The primary endpoint was segment late luminal loss at 9 months after
      index procedure.
