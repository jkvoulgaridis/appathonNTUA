      AIM: The study was intended to evaluate the effectiveness of piezosurgery in enucleation of
      radicular odontogenic cysts in comparison to the conventional technique from both the
      clinical and radiographic perspectives.

      METHODS: Fourteen (8 females and 6 males) patients with age range of 30-55 years who had
      radicular cysts associated with non-vital teeth, were operated at the Oral and Maxillofacial
      Surgery Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University. The patients were randomly
      divided into 2 groups;1) the study group (7 patients) in which cyst enucleation using
      piezosurgery was employed, 2) control group in which the cysts were removed using the
      conventional technique. The following parameters were assessed; postoperative pain, time of
      operation, hemorrhage control and field visibility, ease of operation, neurosensory
      evaluation and radiographic percentage of change in bone defect volume between preoperative
      and 3-months postoperative values.

    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the visibility of the field and ease of operation, a visual analogue scale was used. Each parameter constituted a horizontal 100 mm continuous line in which value of zero indicates minimum level of the assessed parameter and 100 indicates the maximum level. Each surgeon marked on the line then the score is determined by measuring in mms from the left end of the line to that marked point. (higher scores mean a better outcome)</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>A probe was used to prick the patient's skin relevant to the area of operation to assess the neurosensory function in comparison to the contralateral side.If the patient states a difference in sensation between the side of operation and the normal side, it was assigned as &quot;Y&quot; and if there was no difference in sensation between the two sides, it was assigned as &quot;N&quot;.</description>
