      To determine the efficacy of using MRI/US fusion imaging technology to direct focal ablation
      of prostate tissue using nanoparticle-directed laser irradiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single-dose study of AuroLase Therapy in the focal
      ablation of prostate tissue via nanoparticle directed irradiation.

      The patient population consists of men with low to intermediate risk localized prostate
      cancer with MRI visible and confirmed focal areas of prostate cancer using MR US Fusion
      Guided Biopsy.

      There is one arm/group to this study: Up to sixty (60) patients will receive a single
      intravenous infusion of AuroShell particles 12 to 36 hours prior to MRI/US guided laser
      irradiation using an FDA cleared laser and an interstitial optical fiber diffuser.

      Efficacy and acute volume of ablation will be assessed by contrast-enhanced MRI 48 - 96 hours
      after laser illumination to allow time for the appearance of coagulative necrosis and prior
      to reconfiguration of tissue by lytic action. An appearance of a 'void' (e.g., lack of
      contrast in ablation zone) on MRI would be more generally expected than lesion shrinkage.

      Efficacy of focal ablation of prostate tissue will be assessed by MRI /Ultrasound guided
      target biopsy 6 months after laser treatment and at 1 year via MRI /Ultrasound guided target
      biopsy in combination with standard systematic biopsy. Per standard of care, patient follow
      up will continue beyond the one year study visit but will be outside the scope of the study.
      Patients will be consented for up to 5 years in order to track their disease status and
      progression or recurrence if any.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have documented histological or cytological evidence of tumor(s) of the
             prostate.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 45 years of age

          -  Patients or their legal representative must be able to read, understand and sign an
             informed consent

          -  Organ confined clinical T1C or clinical T2a prostate cancer that is visualized on MR
             imaging

          -  Prostate cancer is diagnosed by MR image guided biopsies

          -  Gleason Score ≤ 7; and 2 or less positive lesions on prior MR US fusion guided
             prostate biopsy.

          -  A non MRI visible cancer detected via systematic standard biopsy will not be
             considered an exclusion condition provided the non-MRI visible cancer is singularly
             located in the contralateral hemisphere of the prostate; is Gleason 6 cancer; and
             comprises no more than 6mm linear extent of cancer in a single core on standard
             biopsy.

          -  If any standard biopsy cores are positive on the same hemisphere of the prostate
             gland, they must be confirmed as likely to form a contiguous lesion with the target
             lesion detected on MRI and therefore be from the same location in the prostate as MR
             lesion was biopsied and proven to be cancerous. (e.g., Left/Right, Base, Mid Gland,
             Apex).

          -  Prior mpMRI results dated within 120 days prior to ablation.

             in questions prior to the day of dosing with PEGylated AuroShell particles
             (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no
             regulatory authority approved indication)

          -  Patients with evidence of an active bacterial infection or with a fever ≥ 38.5 ºC
             (101.3 ºF) within 3 days of the first scheduled day of dosing

          -  Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by
             the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed

          -  Patients with renal insufficiency with an estimated glomerular filtration (EGF) &lt;= 30
             are excluded, as they will not be able to undergo gadolinium enhance MRI.

          -  Patients with acute or chronic hepatic dysfunction as evidenced by clinically
             important (&gt; grade 1) changes in AST, ALT, bilirubin, or albumin, or either ALP or GGT

             adverse events experienced during the conduct of this study.
