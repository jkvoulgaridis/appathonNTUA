  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trichotillomania is characterized by recurrent hair pulling resulting in hair loss causing
      significant distress and impairment which persists despite repeated attempts to stop.
      Behavioral based therapies focused on increasing awareness of hair pulling followed by the
      use of an incompatible behavior have proven effective. In an effort to enhance awareness, a
      wrist worn motion detection device was created. In this study, we will test the feasibility
      of the HabitAware device and accompanying app as a system for delivering self-administered
      habit reversal training (HRT).
