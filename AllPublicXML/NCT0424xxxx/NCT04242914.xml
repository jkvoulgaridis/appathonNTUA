  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-suicidal self-injuries (NSSI) is a deliberate harm a person causes directly to their
      body, resulting in structural or functional damage, without suicidal ideation. This behavior
      is related to unbearable internal stress, thoughts, or mental pain, which NSSI assists in
      dismantling. To date, there is no generally approved therapy that assists in lowering NSSI.
      Ketamine is a sedative drug, presently at the focus of psychopharmacologic research, which
      was found to improve depression, when taken orally, and lower suicidal ideation, when given
      intravenously. Our aim is to assess the efficiency of intravenous ketamine in decreasing NSSI
      symptomology in women with a history of childhood sexual abuse presenting with such behavior.
      Participants will be recruited among hospitalized patients from the Tel-Aviv Medical Central
      psychiatric ward, who will present with either NSSI urges or behavior. The study design is a
      randomized control, double blind trial. Each patient will be assessed before, during, and
      after the trial by physical examination, blood tests and questionnaires. The patients will be
      randomized into research group (treated by ketamine and midazolam intravenously) or control
      group (treated intravenously via midazolam only). Our hypothesis is that treatment by
      intravenous ketamine will lower NSSI symptomology, and enable optimal treatment while being
      hospitalized.
