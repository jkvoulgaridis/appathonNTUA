  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the outpatient rehabilitation clinic, therapists provide therapeutic interventions to
      treat patients with various tendinopathies, including lateral and medial epicondylosis.
      Current conservative treatment includes immobilization for forced rest of the inflamed
      tendons and muscles, as well as mobilizations to focus stimulation of synovial fluid, provide
      movement to nourish cartilage, promote periarticular extensibility, and provide sensory and
      proprioceptive input. Musculoskeletal disorders can accompany both local and referred pain
      patterns that need to be assessed and treated. When an acute trauma or repetitive
      micro-trauma occurs, that may result in decreased range of motion and increased pain causing
      the onset of weakness and function of the affected extremity. An alternative approach is
      through the provision of Piezowave Myofascial Acoustic Compression Therapy (MyACT), which
      provides mechanical stimuli delivery to improve circulation and provide relief of pain. The
      focused sound waves produced by the Piezowave MyACT device are classified by a pressure
      surge, which is followed by a drop in pressure and a brief negative pressure phase low
      energy/low pressure application. It is this transformation of mechanical stimuli into
      biochemical signals, or mechanotransduction, which yields the treatment of myofascial and
      musculoskeletal pain. There is currently limited research to support the benefit in regards
      to increased function and decreased pain when the Piezowave MyACT is used for the treatment
      of lateral and medial epicondylosis. Of the limited research available, treatment with
      non-invasive shock wave therapy, complications are low and effect is achieved in most cases
      within three to five sessions.

      If Piezowave Myofascial Acoustic Compression Therapy (MyACT)) is applied as treatment for
      symptoms of lateral and medical elbow tendinopathies, then the patient will experience
      increased function demonstrated by Quick DASH (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand)
      score and decreased pain demonstrated by subjective reporting on the numeric pain rating
      scale.

    <description>The Quick (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) score will assess participant report of function based on daily activities by creating an upper extremity functional score. There are 11 questions that ask the participant to rate their difficulty or limitations and pain in order to complete specific tasks. Each questions will ask the participant to select one of the five measures from no difficulty, not limited at all or none to unable, extreme and I can't sleep, with the latter of the measures indicating decreased upper extremity function. A maximum total score of 55 and minimum of 11.</description>
