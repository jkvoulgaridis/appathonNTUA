  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this planned research is to more fully test the efficacy of a very brief,
      inexpensive, single-session, and web-delivered personalized normative feedback (PNF)
      intervention evaluated in a successful pilot R34 study to prevent alcohol misuse and
      associated negative consequences, as well as increase behavioral health treatment seeking
      behaviors among a difficult to reach and treatment resistant veteran population. The
      investigators expand on successful pilot work by (1) building a large publicly available
      database of young veteran drinking and treatment seeking norms, (2) focusing on reaching
      veterans who have recently separated from the military and drink heavily but who have not
      recently sought any behavioral health treatment, (3) evaluating how an enhanced intervention
      offering PNF content specifically related to treatment seeking affects preparatory behaviors
      and actual treatment initiation, and (4) testing hypothesized mediators and moderators of
      intervention drinking and treatment initiation outcomes relevant for this population. In Aim
      1, the investigators will add to a large database of drinking norms for the population by
      collecting drinking and treatment seeking information from veterans underrepresented in the
      pilot, such as female veterans (total sample N = 2,500). In Aim 2, investigators then use
      these norms in a randomized controlled trial of the PNF intervention designed to reach heavy
      drinking young veterans who are not currently receiving behavioral health care (N = 800) and
      test if additional feedback about treatment seeking can help promote treatment initiation
      among this treatment resistant group. Outcomes at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months are compared for
      participants receiving an enhanced PNF condition (N = 400) to an attention-only control
      condition (N = 400). In Aim 3, the investigators test mediators of intervention efficacy on
      drinking outcomes (i.e., changes in perceived norms, increases in treatment initiation) and
      explore moderators of outcomes to determine if the brief intervention works better for
      veteran participants based on age, gender, reasons for drinking (social versus coping),
      perceived stigma, posttraumatic stress disorder disorder and depression symptoms, and
      solitary drinking.

    <description>Control participants will receive content similar in length but different in content from the PNF (i.e., non-drinking focused). These participants will receive information based on their actual and perceived behavior of playing video games, a strategy used in prior PNF work to balance attention to non-targeted behaviors.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Personalized Normative Feedback</intervention_name>
    <description>The personalized normative feedback (PNF) focuses on behavioral norms, where participants see (1) how their perceptions compare to other same-gender veterans' actual drinking and (2) how their actual drinking compares to other same-gender veterans' actual drinking. The format of the intervention highlights typical days per week, drinks per occasion, and binge drinking as per traditional PNF interventions. PNF will also contain a video description of theories of normative influence (e.g., how individuals are affected by perceptions) and a description of the normative data sample. Participants also see enhanced PNF content that will focus on sharing with participants treatment information that the investigators obtained from a pilot sample.</description>
