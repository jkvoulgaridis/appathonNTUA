  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite availability of several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), in one-third of patients,
      epilepsy remains uncontrolled with AEDs. There is a need to develop new approaches to improve
      the existing medications to relieve patients' epilepsy, and OPC-214870 is being studied for
      this purpose.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 40 kg/m^2, inclusive.

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis and history of photoparoxysmal response on EEG.

          -  Subjects must be stable for 1 month prior to screening. Stable is defined as having no
             change in concomitant therapy and no worsening in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subjects may be treatment-na√Øve to AEDs or currently treated with up to 3 AEDs.

          -  Subjects must have a reproducible standardized photosensitivity range on EEG of at
             least 3 points in at least 1 eye condition.

          -  Subjects who agree to remain abstinent, or practice double-barrier forms of birth
             control, from trial to screening through 90 days after the last dose of IMP, OR males
