      Whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) to an internal temperature of 38.5 C (101.3 F) using an
      infrared heating device has been associated with significant reductions in clinical
      depression. This prior work utilized a WBH medical device that is manufactured in Germany, is
      not FDA approved, and is not widely available. The goal of this initial pilot project is to
      ascertain whether an infrared sauna, the Curvey Sauna Dome, which is readily accessible
      (i.e., can be purchased by consumers in the US) can be used to conduct WBH that achieves an
      internal body temperature of of 101.3 F in healthy volunteers.

      Prior work has demonstrated that whole body hyperthermia (WBH) to an internal temperature of
      38.5 C (101.3 F) using an infrared heating device is associated with significant reductions
      in clinical depression. This prior work utilized a Heckel WBH device, a medical device
      manufactured in Germany that is not FDA-approved and that is not widely available. The goal
      of this pilot project is to ascertain whether the Curve Sauna Dome, an infrared sauna that is
      readily accessible (i.e., can be purchased by consumers in the US) can be used to conduct WBH
      that achieves an internal body temperature of of 38.5 C (101.3 F) in healthy volunteers.
