      To evaluate if surgical removal of residual disease adds benefit in stage IV melanoma
      patients with partial response or stable disease after a minimum 9 months of first-line PD-1
      inhibition. Primary endpoint: Disease-free survival (DFS) at 12 months.

      A Phase II Randomized Controlled Open-Label Parallel Group Interventional Multicenter Trial.
      Patients with metastatic melanoma, stratified for stage M1a or M1b/M1c, that have received
      first-line treatment with PD-1 inhibitors for a minimum of 9 months resulting in either
      partial response or stable disease according to RECIST 1.1 will be eligible. Patients will be
      screened for operability based on CT-scans examined by a multidisciplinary team, with the
      criteria that complete (R0) resection of all metastases should be possible. If the
      multidisciplinary team find that this would be possible, patients will be included and
      randomized 1:1 to either surgery with continued PD1-inhibition or current standard of care
      with continued PD1-inhibition only. At progression, treatment will be according to the
      treating medical oncologist. Active follow-up will be performed for 12 months.

    <description>Patients randomised to the interventional study arm, receiving both surgical metastasectomy and continued immunotherapy. Each patient case will be individually planned for surgery. Procedures will include, but will not be limited to, lung resections, liver resections, bowel resection, skin excisions and lymph node clearances. Patients in both study arms will continue with PD-1 inhibitor 12 months after randomization, and will then be treated according to their medical oncologist.</description>
