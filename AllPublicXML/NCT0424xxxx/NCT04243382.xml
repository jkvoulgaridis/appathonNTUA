    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II, prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy
      of autologous umbilical cord blood infusion.

      The study population will consist of 60 children ages 18 months to 12 years with ASD. The
      population will be randomly assigned to 2 groups, the study group be treated by cord blood in
      the beginning of the study and the control group by placebo product.

      The study will consist of 4 stages Stage 1: initial assessment by physiotherapist and
      occupational therapist / treatment by cord blood or placebo / blood work before and after
      treatment Stage 2: at stage 1 + 6 months assessment by physiotherapist and occupational
      therapist / cross-over treatment by cord blood or placebo / blood work before and after
      treatment Stage 4: at stage 1 + 12 months assessment by physiotherapist and occupational
      therapist The primary outcome is improvement of social communication skills six months after
      treatment at stage 1
