  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Tanzania, according to the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), malaria prevalence
      has declined from an average of 18.1% in 2008 to 7% in 2017, marked as an epidemiological
      transition from meso-endemic to hypo-endemic levels with variation across and within regions
      and/or councils. Children of school-age have become increasingly more vulnerable as compared
      to those aged less than five years. In high-transmission settings, up to 70% of school-aged
      children harbour malaria parasites which is mostly asymptomatic, accounting for around 50% of
      the mortality, 13-50% of all school absenteeism. The NMCP developed a supplementary malaria
      midterm strategic plan (SMMSP 2018-2020) to customise malaria interventions by stratifying
      the burden of malaria in Tanzania mainland and recommended use of
      Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for intermittent preventive treatment in school children
      (IPTsc) in high malaria strata. The investigators plan to evaluate the implementation of
      IPTsc using DP, given three times a year, for evidence on the operational feasibility and
      effectiveness of IPTsc on clinical malaria incidence at a high endemic area in Handeni
      District Council (DC), Handeni Town Council (TC) and Kilindi DC of Tanga region, Tanzania.

      The study is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to assess feasibility and
      effectiveness of IPTsc using DP against standard of care (control). Wards in the three study
      districts (Handeni DC, Handeni TC and Kilindi DC) will be the randomisation unit (clusters).
      Each ward will be randomised to implement IPTsc or not (control). In all wards in the IPTsc
      arm, the interventional drugs (DP) will be given at an interval of four months, three times a
      year. For study evaluation of the impact of intervention, in each district representative
      randomly selected wards, will provide randomly selected school per ward (24 in total) to
      formulate part of evaluable children per intervention. Mixed design methods will be used to
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing IPTsc as part of a more
      comprehensive school children health package.

      The study is expected to be operationally feasible given existing school health programme for
      Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) control and the school net programme (SNP). IPTsc is
      expected to increase malaria case management effectiveness and to have additional effect in
      reducing the burden of disease on top of optimal access to malaria case management (MCM) and
      malaria vector control (MVC) initiatives e.g. early diagnosis and treatment, and
      insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) coverage, respectively.
