  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to assess how accurately and safely NIRS non-invasive monitoring can
      detect changes in intracranial pressure to determine if this noninvasive device can be used
      instead of invasive monitoring with Licox in the future.

    <measure>Correlation between changes in Licox and NIRS oxygenation measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 5 days of the monitoring duration</time_frame>
    <description>Licox measures oxygenation in terms of partial pressure (PtO2) and NIRS measures it in terms of saturation (rSO2). The changes in PtO2 versus the changes in rSO2 will be compared for equivalence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between changes in pressure reactivity index and Licox versus NIRS</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 5 days of the monitoring duration</time_frame>
    <description>The pressure reactivity index (PRx) is derived using ICM+ software; the PRx is a correlation coefficient ranging from -1 to +1; PRx &gt; 0 indicates poor autoregulation. We will investigate if PRx correlates with changes in rSO2 as measured by NIRS (if changes in autoregulation correspond with changes in oxygenation).</description>
