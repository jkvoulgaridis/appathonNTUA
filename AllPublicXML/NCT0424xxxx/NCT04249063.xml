  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of a fundal block in reducing women's
      perception of pain during NovaSure endometrial ablation (EA) in an outpatient-based setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers aim to determine whether participants receiving the paracervical and fundal
      block (experimental group) achieve clinically and statistically significant reductions in
      self-reported pain during NovaSure EA, as compared to those receiving paracervical block
      (control group). All women will obtain concurrent procedural sedation. Women's perception of
      pain will be recorded on a scale from 0 to 10 using the visual analogue scale (VAS).

      The researchers hypothesize that the participants receiving combined paracervical and fundal
      block will experience less pain during the active procedure, as compared to those receiving
      paracervical block alone.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds into active ablation procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Thirty seconds into the active NovaSure EA procedure, all participants will be asked the same standardized question to rate their pain. The question will be posed by the registered nurse assisting the physician, and the women will score their perception of pain on a scale from 0 to 10 using the VAS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Using the VAS, all participants will be asked to rate their pain 1 hour post-procedure.</description>

    <measure>Rescue analgesics/and or sedation</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of active ablation procedure to discharge from unit (t = 0 sec to t = ~3hrs).</time_frame>
    <description>The use of additional rescue analgesics/and or sedation during the active ablation procedure and post-operative period will be recorded and compared between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of active ablation to discharge from unit ( t= 0 sec to t = ~3hrs).</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse reactions that occur in response to the fundal injections during and following the procedure will be recorded and compared between groups.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-procedure prior to discharge (t = ~3hrs).</time_frame>
    <description>The acceptability of the ablation procedure will be evaluated between groups by asking each participant if they would recommend the procedure to a friend.</description>
