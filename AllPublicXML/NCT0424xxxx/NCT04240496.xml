  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clozapine (Clz), an atypical antipsychotic, is the reference medication for patients with
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Due to the high inter-individual variability of its
      pharmacokinetics and its narrow therapeutic index, a close therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)
      of Clz is highly recommended.

      Several factors can cause a variation in the pharmacokinetics as age, smoking habits, coffee
      consumption and drug interaction. Genetic factors related to hepatic expression levels of the
      cytochrome P450 (CYP), regulate the hepatic clearance of Clz, thereby determine its
      bioavailability.

      The CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 isoenzymes are mainly responsible for the metabolism of several drugs
      including Clz. It has been demonstrated that there is an interethnic variation in the
      expression and function of these two isoenzymes. This variation is caused by single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding these proteins.

      While the Influence of the different polymorphisms related to CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 have been
      established especially in Asian and Caucasian populations, no study has examined the impact
      of these SNPs in the southern Mediterranean populations. Moreover, the impact of these SNPs
      is very controversial. The present study aims to investigate in Tunisian schizophrenic
      patients, the influence of genetic (CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms) and non-genetic factors
      on Clz pharmacokinetics.
