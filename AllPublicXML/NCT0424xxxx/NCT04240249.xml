  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people have problems with self-assertiveness. That can have negative impact on their
      lives. This study will test a constructive self-assertiveness intervention program delivered
      online. In addition, the relative effect of guidance during the intervention will be
      investigated.

      In a randomized controlled trial three groups will be compared:

        1. constructive self-assertiveness with guidance

        2. constructive self-assertiveness without guidance

        3. Waitlist control
