             cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma) with disease progression
             during or after the prior platinum-containing chemotherapy:

               1. The prior platinum-containing chemotherapy may be a systemic treatment for
                  metastatic disease or in the adjuvant or neo-adjuvant setting.

               2. Participants who were intolerant to or ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy
                  are also eligible.

               3. Participants must be naïve to checkpoint inhibitors

          -  Participants must have measurable disease.

          -  Participants must provide a tumor tissue sample, either from archival tissue or newly
             obtained core or excisional biopsy. If the participant received local therapy (For
             example: radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy) after the archival tissue was taken,
             a new biopsy will be required.

          -  Participants who have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 to 1

          -  Life expectancy greater than or equals to (&gt;=) 12 weeks as judged by the Investigator

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol

          -  Participants with known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections are in general
             eligible if the following criteria are met:

               1. Clinically indicated participants must be stable on antiretroviral therapy (ART)

               2. have no evidence of documented multi-drug resistance that would prevent effective
                  ART.

               3. Have an HIV viral load of &lt; 400 copies per milliliter (/mL) at Screening.

                  may be eligible only after consultation and agreement with the study Medical
                  Monitor.

               6. If prophylactic antimicrobial drugs are indicated, participants may still be
                  considered eligible upon agreement with the study Medical Monitor

             are in general eligible if the following criteria are met:

               1. HBV viral load below the limit of quantification and be on a stable dose of

               2. Participants with a history of HCV infection should have completed curative
                  antiviral treatment and require HCV viral load below the limit of quantification.

               3. Participants on concurrent HCV treatment should have HCV below the limit of
                  quantification

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases causing clinical
             symptoms or require therapeutic intervention are excluded. Participants with a history
             of treated CNS metastases (by surgery or radiation therapy) are not eligible unless
             they have fully recovered from treatment, demonstrated no progression for at least 4
             weeks, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to the start of study
             treatment.

          -  Participants with interstitial lung disease or has had a history of pneumonitis that
             has required oral or intravenous (IV) steroids

          -  Participants with significant acute or chronic infections

          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an
             immunostimulatory agent

          -  Participants with clinically significant cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease
             including: cerebral vascular accident/stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina,
             congestive heart failure, or serious cardiac arrhythmia
