  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main complaint of patients who received a presbyopia correcting lens (regardless of the
      design) are visual disturbances such as glare, halos (rings around lights), starbursts (rays
      around light sources), mainly at night. The degree of limitation or how bothered patients are
      varies from patient to patient. To explain these symptoms different theories have been
      proposed including splitting the light into different focal points which decreases the
      intensity of the light reaching the retina. Most factors are common to all patients who
      received the lens; however, patients are not equally affected by these symptoms. Angle kappa
      has been considered a factor. Angle κ is the angle between the visual axis (straight line
      that passes through both the center of the pupil and the center of the fovea) and the
      pupillary axis (perpendicular line to the surface of the cornea that passes through the
      center of the pupil).
