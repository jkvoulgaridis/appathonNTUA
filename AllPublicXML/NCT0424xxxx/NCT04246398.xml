      1. ASD children with gastrointestinal problems that interfere with daily routine will be
           recruited at the center for Autism led by Prof Zachor, and at the Pediatric Neurology &amp;
           Development Center at Shamir Medical Center. Publications in the social media- facebook
           and support groups for Autism will also be used. The decision whether or not to initiate
           any medical treatment will not be influenced by the study investigators and will be made
           solely by the treating doctor.

        2. If possible, participants will provide informed consent after receiving a thorough
           explanation by the study team, as will both parents or other legal guardians.

        3. Two groups randomization will be performed, group A and group B. The group randomization
           will be double blinded.

        4. Participants randomized to group A will receive 10 capsules FMT twice a week for 3
           weeks, and at week 12 followed by 3 weeks placebo twice a week.

        5. Participants randomized to group B will receive 10 capsules placebo twice a week for 3
           weeks and at week 12 followed by 3 weeks FMT twice a week.

        6. At baseline, participants will undergo a full physical examination, vital signs, medical
           questionnaire, ROME III questionnaire for kids &gt;age4 /&gt;age 10, ATN-GISSI-17
           questionnaire, Aut-Eat questionnaire regarding eating habbits, the Social Responsiveness
           Scale (SRS) and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS).

        7. Parents/ care providers will fill a daily symptoms follow-up questionnaire at baseline

        8. Fecal samples will be provided for analysis of microbiome and proteome at beseline,
           weeks 3,12, 15 and 6+9 months.

        9. At each FMT/Placebo administration a short questionnaire asking about possible adverse
           events, GI symptoms, overall well-being, and medication changes will be administered

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 50% of children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to suffer from one or more
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.The GI symptoms vary from constipation (~20%), diarrhea
      (~14%), Abdominal pain/discomfort (14%), bloating (12%), incontinence (12%), reflux (7.4%),
      nausia (6%) and difficult with bowel movements (6%).

      The severity of ASD is associated with the observed GI symptoms, although no cause-effect
      relationship between GI symptoms and ASD was proven so far. ASD with GI symptoms patients
      might display significant behavioral manifestations, such as anxiety, self-injury and
      aggression and these may be attributed to the GI symptoms themselves. Therefore alleviation
      of the GI symptoms could be important also for improvement of ASD.

      In addition to the possibility that the nervous system influences the gut and the GI
      symptoms, there is also the possibility that the gut and the microbiome within the gut may
      influence the central nervous system.

      Considering the findings that children with ASD have a history of using significantly more
      antibiotics and that gut permeability increases in ASD it is reasonable to assume that ASD
      patients have distinct microbiomes and gut metabolites.

      Nevertheless, perhaps changing the gut microbiome could lead to improvement in some of the
      symptoms. So far, studies on influencing ASD (behavior and GI symptoms) by addressing the gut
      microbiome are optimistic but mostly open-labeled and still inconclusive.
