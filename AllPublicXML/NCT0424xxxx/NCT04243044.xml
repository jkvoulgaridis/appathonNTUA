  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tcSCS) is a form of electrical stimulation delivered
      over the skin of the spine that may be valuable for reducing spasticity without the side
      effects of antispasticity medications. The intensity of stimulation, or dose, that promotes
      the best response is not known. Understanding the response to different intensities of
      stimulation and how they affect spasticity will help guide rehabilitation for persons with
      SCI. Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects tcSCS as a non-drug intervention for
      spasticity management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity involves involuntary muscle activity in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) that
      can include increased response to muscle stretch and physical touch, as well as muscle
      stiffness. Due to the combination of symptoms, several drug therapies are currently
      prescribed to reduce spasticity but they may have negative side effects including fatigue and
      muscle weakness. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tcSCS) is a form of electrical
      stimulation delivered over the skin of the spine to that seem to have effects that are
      similar to drug therapy. Prior studies of tcSCS in persons with SCI suggest that tcSCS can
      reduce spasticity without negative side effects. The intensity of stimulation, or dose, that
      promotes the best response is not known. In addition sensitive measurements are necessary to
      assess the changes that can be seen in multiple presentations of spasticity. Understanding
      the response to different intensities of stimulation and how they affect spasticity will help
      guide rehabilitation for persons with SCI. Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects
      tcSCS as a non-drug intervention for spasticity management.

    <measure>Change in posterior-root muscle reflexes</measure>
    <time_frame>Before, immediately, and 2 hours after each intervention through study completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PRMRs will be assessed to identify the spinal stimulation threshold at which muscle activity occurs in the quadriceps (reflex threshold). Electrode placement as outlined for intervention will be followed for this assessment. Briefly, stimulating pulses of 1ms duration (via a Digitimer DS7A constant current stimulator) will be delivered through the stimulating electrodes and intensity will be gradually increased until a motor event is electrophysiologically observed in the quadriceps. This reflex threshold stimulation intensity will be utilized to set the parameters of the three tcSCS intervention sessions - 80% of reflex threshold (0.8RT) and 120% of reflex threshold(1.2RT).</description>

    <measure>Change in Pendulum Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before, immediately, and 2 hours after each intervention through study completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pendulum test will be performed during which the participant will be positioned supine on a mat with the lower leg hanging over the mat. A member of the study staff will support the participant's extended lower leg and then release the leg allowing it to swing freely. Muscle activity during each maneuver will be recorded using electromyography (EMG) of the quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles of the lower extremity identified as having the greatest spasticity. Biomechanical measurements will be captured through the use of electrogoniometers placed at the knee and ankle joints.</description>

    <time_frame>Before, immediately, and 2 hours after each intervention through study completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Ankle clonus test will be performed during which the participant will be seated at the edge of a mat with the lower leg hanging over the mat. A member of the study staff will support the participant's leg above a box and the release the leg allowing the front of the foot to land on the edge of the box. Muscle activity during each maneuver will be recorded using EMG of the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles of the lower extremity identified as having the greatest spasticity. Biomechanical measurements will be captured through the use of electrogoniometers placed at the ankle.</description>

    <measure>Change in Plantar Flexor Withdrawal Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before, immediately, and 2 hours after each intervention through study completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle activity induced through noxious sensory input will be assessed through instrumented flexor withdrawal reflex testing. The noxious sensory stimulus will be standardized through electrocutaneous stimulation to the plantar surface of the participant's foot (parameters: 25mA and 50mA, 500Hz, 20ms train). Muscle activity after each stimuli will be recorded using electromyography (EMG) of the quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles of the lower extremity identified as having the greatest spasticity.</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation will be delivered for 30 minutes using cathodal stimulation with a single round electrode placed directly over the spine at the T11/T12 spinous interspace, and a dispersive (reference) electrode placed over the umbilicus. For assessing different stimulation intensities, tcSCS will be delivered at frequency of 50Hz. Stimulation intensity will be set to the specified level determined through a pre-stimulation assessment (constant stimulation at 0.8x resting threshold, constant stimulation at 1.2x resting threshold, bursting stimulation at 0.8x resting threshold). For assessment of varying stimulation frequencies (30, 50, 80 Hz), tcSCS will be delivered at 0.8xRT for 30 minutes. Treatments will be a minimum of 48 hours apart.</description>
