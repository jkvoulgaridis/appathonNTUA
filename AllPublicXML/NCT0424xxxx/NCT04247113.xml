      Prevention and early intervention are the most effective methods for influencing eating
      habits. This study helps fulfill the Department of Psychiatry's missions of clinical
      innovation and advancing science. Findings will inform future clinical practice, improve the
      care provided to patients in their important role as parents, and foster interdisciplinary
      collaborations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morbid obesity is both highly heritable and affected by environmental factors. The child of a
      parent undergoing a weight-loss surgery (PWLS) is at especially high risk of obesity. The
      most effective approach to reducing the risk of childhood obesity is a parent-based program.
      However, adherence remains a challenge, largely due to lack of tailored interventions.
      Typical interventions are not individualized to target the unique characteristics of the
      family nor timed to be delivered when the family is geared for change. Parent-Based
      Prevention following a bariatric surgery (PBP-B) is a novel targeted intervention that
      focuses on parental behaviors important for developing healthy eating and lifestyle behaviors
      in young children. PBP-B personalizes treatment goals through a focused parent-based approach
      that includes a family meal. Additionally, PBP-B is timed to capitalize on the Halo Effect
      period, in which the BMIs of the family members of the person undergoing weight loss surgery
      reduce spontaneously, yet only temporarily.

      This study will investigate whether PBP-B is feasible, acceptable, and associated with
      improvement in short-term outcomes that predict long term risks of obesity (e.g., parental
      feeding practices, child eating behaviors, child physical activity levels, and child sleep
      hours). Ten adults who had weight loss surgery and are the parents of one or more children
      aged 1-10 will receive PBP-B (with their partners, unless they are single parents). This
      study will collect important pilot data that will inform the design of future adequately
      powered studies to test ways to reduce the likelihood of adult obesity in children of a
      parent who had weight loss surgery.
