  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main challenges in maintaining tight glucose control in a closed-loop system
      occurs at meal times. Amylin is a gluco-regulatory beta-cell hormone that is co-secreted with
      insulin in response to nutrient stimuli, and is deficient in patients with type 1 diabetes.
      Amylin, in the postprandial period, contributes to regulating glucose levels by delaying
      gastric emptying, suppressing nutrient-stimulated glucagon secretion, and increasing satiety.
      Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of the hormone amylin. A closed-loop system that delivers
      both insulin and pramlintide, based on glucose sensor readings, has the potential to better
      normalize glucose levels, especially during the post-prandial period.

      The aim of this project is to assess whether co-administration of pramlintide with rapid
      insulin in an artificial pancreas system will improve glycemic control in adults with Type 1
      Diabetes.
