      Background :

      Diabetes is correlated to an increase in patient morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology
      of diabetes is still poorly understood. Significant variations in blood sugar have been shown
      over time in patients with cystic fibrosis with or without diabetes. No study has evaluated
      the association between the nutritional profile and the glucose tolerance in adult with
      cystic fibrosis, by integrating data on energy consumption (detailed nutritional profile) and
      energy expenditure (rest energy expenditure, body composition, and physical activity).

      Given the epidemiological changes in cystic fibrosis correlated to the increased prevalence
      of diabetes and the clinical impact of nutritional status, the association between these
      factors remains to be studied.

      Objectives of the study :

      - Main objective :

      To describe adult patients with cystic fibrosis in terms of :

        -  Nutritional profile

        -  Food behaviour

        -  Physical activity

        -  Rest energy expenditure

        -  Body composition - Secondary objectives : To research the association between the
           nutritional profile and the glucose tolerance.

      Study design :

      The study will last 12 months. It's an observational cross-sectional study; patients are
      include during a scheduled review at the Cystic Fibrosis Resource and Competence Centre (CRCM
      de Lyon) and their participation lasts only one day. The inclusion period will last 12
      months.

      Expected results

      The expected results are:

        -  Identify the inter-relationships between nutritional profile and glucose tolerance in
           adult patients with cystic fibrosis

        -  Describe the body composition and consumption on resting energy of adults with cystic
           fibrosis

      The perspectives are:

        -  Propose nutritional and dietetic measures to limit the deterioration of the glucose
           tolerance in adult patients with cystic fibrosis

        -  Develop equations for evaluating consumption on resting energy specific to adult
           patients with cystic fibrosis in order to more specifically adapt the nutritional
           recommendations to each patient

      The research perspectives are to compare adult patients with cystic fibrosis followed in
      France and Quebec in terms of:

        -  nutritional profiles, nutritional quality index of food and eating behaviours, resting
           energy expenditure, body composition

        -  nutritional medical practices (dietary monitoring, recommendations given to patients,
           intake of pancreatic enzyme).

    <description>Glucose tolerance is the factor studied. It's established on the basis of Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) data, with measurement of glycemia and insulinemia at T0, T60 and T120 min.
Carbohydrate status will be determined using the international classification:
Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT) (G0 ≤ 7.0 mmol / L and G2 ≤ 7.7 mmol / L),
Abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) defined by indeterminate status (INDET) (G0 ≤ 7.0 mmol / L and G2 ≤ 7.7 mmol / L, but G1 ≥ 11.1 mmol / L) or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) (G0 ≤ 7.0 mmol / L and G2&gt; 7.7 mmol / L but &lt;11.1 mmol / L)
Diabetic status (CFRD) (G0&gt; 7.0 mmol / L or G2 ≥ 11.1 mmol / L).</description>
