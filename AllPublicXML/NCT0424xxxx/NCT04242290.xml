  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervicogenic headache (CEH) is a type of symptomatic headache that is characterized by
      chronic unilateral headache secondary to cervical spine dysfunction. Generally, it gets worse
      by neck movements, continuous placement of the head in an awkward position and exposure to
      external pressure on the upper cervical or occipital region.

      The pain was demonstrated to originate from lower cervical disc prolapse and spinal nerve
      roots in some studies, while it is suggested in some others to occur due to the upper
      cervical region as well. Although disturbed cervical alignment has been determined in tension
      headache and migraine, there are few studies with controversial results in the literature
      investigating the effects of the change in cervical lordosis on CEH. These contradictory
      results strongly influence the decision of whether exercise should be added to the treatment
      protocol in CEH and also the creation of an appropriate treatment program by the clinicians.
      In light of this background, the aim of this study was to compare the cervical radiographs of
      patients with CEH and patients with neck pain without a headache.

      The general demographics, pain status and cervical radiological evaluations of the patients
      was performed in this prospective, cross-sectional, single-blind study evaluating two
      different disease groups compatible in age and gender and the two groups were compared.

      For inclusion in the Cervicogenic Headache group, inclusion criteria determined by the
      Cervicogenic Headache International Study Group (CHISG) were used.

      Symptoms of all patients were questioned in detail and physical examinations were performed.
      After obtaining demographic information such as age, height and weight, severity and duration
      of pain were asked to the patients and Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) were used for pain assessment Cervical radiographic analysis was evaluated measuring
      general cervical lordosis and upper cervical lordosis on lateral standing X-rays using
      Surgimap®. General cervical lordosis and Upper cervical lordosis measurements were performed
      on the lateral cervical graph.

    <description>General cervical lordosis is basically measured by the &quot;Cobb&quot; method. In the lateral graph, the angle between the two lines drawn perpendicular to the lines passing on the inferior end plate of the C2 and C7 vertebrae is considered as the &quot;General cervical lordosis angle&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Upper cervical lordosis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the measurement of upper cervical lordosis, a line is drawn from the uppermost posterior point of the odontoid process to the lowermost posterior point of C2. The second line is drawn to pass between the lowermost-posterior portions of the C3 and C4 cervical vertebrae. The angle between these two lines is considered the &quot;upper cervical lordosis angle&quot;</description>

        It was included 45 women with cervicogenic headaches with an age of 18-50 years and 45
        women with only neck pain in the same ages who presented to the Neurosurgery outpatient
        clinic.
