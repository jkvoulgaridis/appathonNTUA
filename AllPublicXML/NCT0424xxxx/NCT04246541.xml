  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The utilization of arthroscopic surgery to treat meniscus injuries has continued to increase
      in recent years, partly due to a younger, more active population, and improved technology and
      technique. However, pain management in the post-operative period is critical to the ability
      to perform this procedure as an outpatient surgery. Traditionally, oral narcotic agents have
      been the preferred analgesic postoperatively in orthopaedic surgery. However, these agents
      are associated with several side effects, including nausea/vomiting, constipation, and
      somnolence. In addition, opioid agents have a significant potential for abuse in comparison
      to non-narcotic analgesics. In light of the rising opioid epidemic and nationwide initiatives
      to limit narcotic usage, surgeons must explore alternate pain modalities in the acute
      postoperative period. Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.1 Multiple prior studies have examined the
      beneficial effect of oral and intravenous (IV) ketorolac as an analgesic in the postoperative
      period,1-3 including arthroscopic meniscus surgery. However, the beneficial effects of this
      agent following arthroscopic meniscus surgery have not been extensively described.
