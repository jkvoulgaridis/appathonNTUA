      Feasibility study of a simplified respiratory support system for newborn infants
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; feasibility trial that evaluates usage of a simplified
      respiratory support system for newborn infants. The study aims to evaluate both the
      feasibility of providing uninterrupted support for the first hours of life as well as a
      modified respiratory support system.

      The system is a modified version of the commercially available rPAP system. The revised
      design has a simplified gas supply and allows elimination of a complicated driver. The new
      system has low resistance to breathing equal to the rPAP system. The study will recruit 40-60
      infants in a single centre without a comparison arm.

      The trial is conducted as a first step towards a large randomised trial.
