  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the feasibility and reliability of PDAC molecular subtyping on tissue
      core biopsies samples acquired under EUS guidance. Moreover, this study will assess the
      impact of molecular subtypes assessed on EUS-FNB samples in patients with resectable and
      unresectable (locally advanced, advanced, and metastatic) PDAC undergoing chemotherapy on
      treatment response and survival and the utility in monitoring disease response to therapy and
      early occurrence of disease relapse using the TaqMan RNA assay in serum
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PDAC patients are categorised as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced,
      metastatic and recurrent. Substantial neoplastic tissue is only available for the resectable
      group. This is unfortunate as the other groups are those that would benefit the most from
      molecular characterization and identification of markers, which may be predictive and/or
      provide therapeutic stratification. For these categories of patients, only fine needle
      aspiration or small biopsies could be obtained until now. However, the introduction of new
      needles, specifically designed to acquire larger high quality biopsy samples under endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS), has now made it possible to test prognostic, predictive and therapeutic
      stratification markers. However, the applicability of EUS-fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB)
      samples for this purpose has yet to be clinically validated. The working hypothesis of this
      proposal is that the molecular sub-classification of PDAC on EUS-FNB tissue samples could be
      applied for prognostic stratification and therapeutic decision strategies in both resectable
      and unresectable patients using DNA and RNA biomarkers.

        This study concerns consecutive individuals with a solid pancreatic lesion who will undergo
        diagnostic EUS-FNB. Those with a histological diagnosis of PDAC will be enrolled in the
        study. Enrollment will include patients with resectable disease and those with unresectable
        disease, which can be divided in different stages, i.e. borderline resectable, locally
        advanced, advanced, and metastatic.
