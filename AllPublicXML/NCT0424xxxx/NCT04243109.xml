  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trial with a pharmaceutical specialty in a new combination.

      Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is indicated in the treatment of adult
      patients with multiple treatment-resistant or relapsing myeloma who have received at least
      two previous treatments, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and who have experienced a
      disease progression in the last treatment.

      The combination of Pomalidomide with Cyclophosphamide at metronomic doses (Very low doses)
      and Dexamethasone is tested in this clinical situation.
