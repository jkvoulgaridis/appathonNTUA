  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of surgically covering myelomeningocele
      spina bifida spinal cord developmental defects using Neox Cord 1K, cryopreserved human
      umbilical cords, via a laparotomy-fetoscopic surgical approach. Intact repair of the defect,
      prevention of cerebral spinal fluid leakage and wound dehiscence will be assessed at birth
      and at 12 months of age.

    <description>Under general anesthesia and tocolysis, in-utero repair starts with a laparotomy, followed by exteriorization of the uterus and external cephalic version to position the fetus. Uterine entry will be accessed using 3 cannulas, followed by heated-humidified carbon dioxide insufflation for visualization. Fetoscopically, the placode will be dissected and the lesion repaired. NEOX Cord 1K®, a cryopreserved human umbilical cord patch, will be used for meningeal closure over the spinal cord, followed by closure of the fetal skin layer. Next, the carbon dioxide will be removed and replaced with amniotic fluid or with Lactated Ringers Solution. Finally, the fetoscopic hysterotomy sites will be sutured, and the laparotomy site closed in multiple layers.</description>
