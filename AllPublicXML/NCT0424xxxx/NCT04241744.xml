  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine in patients receiving intravenous (IV)
      antibiotic(s), if giving oral vancomycin therapy will prevent C. difficile-associated
      infection (commonly called CDI). Oral vancomycin is an antibiotic that is commonly used to
      treat CDI. The investigators want to study if using this drug can prevent the development of
      CDI while you are in the hospital receiving IV antibiotics. The key risk factors for
      developing CDI are age and IV antibiotic therapy. CDI is an infection in your colon caused by
      an organism called Clostridium difficile (or C. diff for short) that causes diarrhea. Up to
      12% of hospital-acquired infections have been reported to be CDI. It can lead to longer
      hospital stays and more costs associated with the hospital stay.
