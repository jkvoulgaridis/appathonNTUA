  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator plans a randomized trial of active rehabilitation and
      standard care for acute concussion management. The investigator hypothesizes that patients
      with acute concussions managed with active rehabilitation will have decreased risk of
      prolonged concussion symptoms.

      Specific Aims:

      To compare the risk of prolonged concussion symptoms (PCS) between an active rehabilitation
      and a standard care cohort after an acute concussion.

      To determine if active rehabilitation compared to routine care reduces the risk of PCS for
      high-risk patients.

      This is a prospective randomized control trial of pediatric patients in the emergency
      department (ED) diagnosed with an acute concussion. Patients 8-18 years old with an acute
      concussion diagnosis will be eligible. All patients will receive pedometers to monitor their
      activity levels. If the patient is in the control group the patient will receive standard
      concussion management per the treating ED physician. Patients in the active rehabilitation
      group will receive instructions based on the latest CDC concussion management guidelines that
      specify a symptom-limited progressive return to full activities. This group will be
      instructed to take at least 10,000 steps a day for five days on their pedometers.

      One to five days after the ED concussion diagnosis a trained research coordinator will call
      all subjects to reinforce the management plan.

      28 to 32 days post ED concussion diagnosis, research assistants will contact subjects via
      email or phone call to complete the concussion symptoms inventory.

    <ipd_description>For the study, researchers will collect the age, gender, past medical history and through surveys, past, present and future symptoms after a head injury. This information will be used to determine which age groups are at risk and which constellation of symptoms persist following an acute head injury. All research documents and PHI will be kept in a locked cabinet and a password protected RedCap database that only study staff personnel have access to. No data will be shared until manuscript is written, but will only be shared in manuscript and not in individual data. If significant adverse data is found for a patient, the Lead PI will discuss with the subject and primary care physician.</ipd_description>
