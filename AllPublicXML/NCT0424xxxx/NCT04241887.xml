  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver tumors causes acute pain during the
      periooperative setting. In order to facilitate tumor access, patient should collaborate with
      a surgeon during the procedurę, therefore should be conscious.

      This study aims to assess the impact of a single shot thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) on
      a patient's haemodynamic stability, patient's and operator's comfort and satisfaction during
      the operation and analgesia in the post-operative period.

    <textblock>
      High temperatures used during the percutaneus radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) of liver tumors
      can cause acute pain in the perioperative setting. In order to facilitate tumor exposure and
      access, patient should collaborate with a surgeon during the procedurę, therefore should be
      conscious. It is mandatory to provide an adequate acute postoperative pain control for our
      patients.

      This prospective randomized, single center study was approved by the Bioethics Committee at
      the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, (Poland) under the resolution No. 46/2017.

    <description>Anesthesia was performed under the ultrasound guidance: the Th8 spinous process was identified, then a probe was moved lateral to medial until two adjacent transverse processes and the pleura were visible. After anaesthetising the skin with 2ml of 1% lignocaine (Lignocainum hydrochlorici, WZF 1%), the Touhy needle 22G (Smith Medical)was introduced under the real time guidance. Once in the paravertebral space, 20ml of 0,25% bupivacaine (Bupivacainum hydrochloricum WZF 0,5%, Polfa Warsaw SA) was injected with an end point of a characteristic pleural displacement.</description>
