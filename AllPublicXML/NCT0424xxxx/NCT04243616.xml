    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study that will enroll 36 subjects, who have
      pathologically proven diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, clinical stage tumor 1-3 (cT1-T3),
      node 0-3 (cN0-N3), metastasis 0 (cM0), hormone receptor positive (HR+)
      (estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) and/or progesterone-receptor-positive (PR+) human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative or hormone receptor-negative (HR-)
      (estrogen-receptor-negative (ER-) and progesterone-receptor-negative (PR-) human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative/triple-negative breast cancer.

      Hypothesis: The addition of cemiplimab (PD-1 inhibitor) to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      in patients with locally advanced HR+ HER2 negative or triple-negative (TN) breast cancer
      having positive PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 tumor expression will be associated with an increase in
      pathologic complete response of at least 20%.

      Primary Objectives:

      Assess pathologic responses in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cemiplimab.
