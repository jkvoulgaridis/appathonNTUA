  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite its poor abundance in the liver, CYP2D6 is the second most important CYP in drug
      metabolism, metabolizing 20% of drugs. The high inter-individual variability in CYP2D6
      expression is explained by genetic variations, but also by drug-drug interactions (DDIs).
      Recent studies have pointed out the poor therapeutic predictable value of DDI. Indeed, the
      clinical outcomes of a DDI may involve several intrinsic factors affecting the vulnerability
      to and extent of DDI, such as genetic polymorphisms, comorbidities, age and sex.

      In this regard, the present research project aims to investigate the effect of genetic
      polymorphism on DDIs involving CYP2D6 (gene-environment interaction) and its implications for
      tramadol efficacy and safety in a clinical setting. In a previous study, we demonstrated
      differences in both the rate of phenoconversion and the magnitude of DDI in healthy
      volunteers, that were either heterozygote normal metabolizers (NMs) carrying a non-functional
      CYP2D6 allele (activity score (AS) 1) and homozygous NM carrying two fully-functional CYP2D6
      alleles (AS 2).

      This prospective study will include patients scheduled for a general surgery of less than 3
      hours and planned to be treated with oral tramadol as a routine post-operative pain
      management.

      Patients taking part in the study may receive diagnosis, therapeutic or other interventions
      but the groups of individuals (controls vs inhibited) are predefined based on the routine
      treatment of the patients.

      There will be no assigned specific interventions to the study participants and CYP2D6
      phenotypes will be classified in five activity score groups (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, &gt;2) in the
      absence or presence of a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor received as part of routine medical care.

      PK of tramadol and its active metabolite (M1), as well as its analgesic and PD effects and
      safety, will be compared between groups. Finally, the data generated will be used to build a
      physiologically-based PK (PBPK) model for tramadol in different sub-groups. The model will
      aim to predict the effect of CYP2D6 inhibition in virtual populations with different
      genetically-related CYP2D6 activities. This should allow prospective dose adjustment of
      tramadol (or appropriate drug selection) based on patients' genotype in the presence of a
      CYP2D6 inhibitor.

        Patients will be recruited through a pre-surgery anesthetic evaluation visit. During their
        scheduled visit with an anaesthesiologist, potential patients will be invited to
        participate to an information session where project aim and design, procedures involved,
        expected duration as well as possible risks will be explained in details.

        After sufficient time of reflection, volunteers willing to participate in the study will
        sign the consent form.
