      Determine if the addition of a specific acupuncture protocol to a standard of care prescribed
      exercise program is more effective at improving pain and function in adult patients with
      plantar fasciosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, multi-site trial investigating whether a specific
      acupuncture protocol can improve pain and function in adults with plantar fasciosis when
      added to standard of care treatment. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a
      significant improvement in both pain and functional outcomes, both acutely and over time, in
      the experimental group compared to the control group.
