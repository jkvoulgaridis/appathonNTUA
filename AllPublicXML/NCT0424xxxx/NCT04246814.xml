  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is currently an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Global
      estimates indicate that 382 million people live with diabetes (8.3%), and that number could
      reach 592 million in 2035. The diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) present as sore wounds with
      disintegration of the skin. The DFU affect 15% of diabetic patients. Several studies have
      been conducted aiming to find therapeutic strategies for the healing of DFU, among the
      reported therapeutic methods the Low-level Laser Therapy (LLLT) has been highlighted. The aim
      of this study is to investigate the effects of different doses of LLLT in the treatment of
      DFU. Methods: This study is characterized as a double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT),
      consisting of four groups, the control group will have only dressing and placebo LLLT
      application and the other three groups will have dressing and real LLLT GaAs 904 nm
      application. Expected outcomes: to elucidate the effects of different doses of LLLT GaAs 904
      nm on the treatment of DFU, beyond to identify the most effective dose.

      All groups will perform the same procedures twice weekly. Volunteers will be comfortable with
      the affected foot exposed. The diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) will be cleaned using saline
      solution and gauze, then the ulcer temperature will be checked using the digital infrared
      thermometer. Diabetic wounds will be measured and photographed at baseline and every 10
      visits until the study is completed, the images will be analyzed using the ImageJ program for
      follow-up throughout the intervention. The DFU will be ranked according to the Wagner Scale.
      Afterwards the volunteers will receive LLLT application and conventional treatment in the
      form of Helianthus Annuus oil dressing. Both therapist and participant will be instructed on
      precautions to be observed when using LLLT. Goggles will be provided prior to administration.
      The lower cylinder of the LASER probe will be placed perpendicular to the DFU, the floor and
      edges of the ulcer will be irradiated using punctual and scanning techniques, respectively.
      Once a week blood glucose levels will be obtained for patient screening. All data will be
      recorded until the end of the visits in a control form prepared.
