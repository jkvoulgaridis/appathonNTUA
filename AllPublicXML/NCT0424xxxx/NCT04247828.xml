  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the feasibility of developing a smart augmentative or alternative
      communication (AAC) system that is effective in delivering communication capabilities that
      automatically adapt to the users' physical abilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diversity of the more than 1.3% of Americans who suffer from severe physical impairments
      (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions
      such as manual signs, gestures or interaction with a touchscreen for communication. This
      clinical trial will test the feasibility of developing a smart-AAC system designed using
      individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique
      manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. The investigators will demonstrate
      the proof-of-concept that a single surface electromyographic (sEMG) and inertial measurement
      unit (IMU) hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in information
      transfer rate (ITR) and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is
      optimized compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface for subjects with SPI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Control Subjects:

          -  Adults and Children; &gt;12yo

          -  Male or Female

          -  All participants will be: (a) able to spell, (b) able to follow 2-3 step directions,
             (c) have functional vision sufficient to read 40 point text

          -  No history of communication disorders;

          -  No history of neurological disorders affecting speech or head movement.

        Subjects with SPI:

          -  Adults or Children; age&gt;12yo

          -  Male or Female

          -  All participants will be: (a) able to spell, (b) able to follow 2-3 step directions,
             (c) have functional vision sufficient to read 40 point text, and (d) have a motor
             impairment that requires the use of an alternative access strategy to communicate
             and/or use technology.

          -  Current or prospective AAC user with complex communication needs representing a broad
             spectrum of developmental and acquired SPI disabilities resulting from high spinal
             cord injury, chronic Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, brain stem stroke, cerebral palsy,
             locked-in syndrome, among others;

          -  Sufficient head control and voluntary facial muscle activation (on the basis of

             vertebral, spinal cord, or nerve roots that places the subject at risk;

             would severely reduce stamina and/or place the subject at risk for conducting the
