      Purpose: to investigate the efficacy of early exercise in patients with moderate to severe
      stroke regarding functional outcome and walking ability.

      Methods: Patients with medium to severe stroke (NHISS &gt;7) were recruited 24 - 48 hours after
      stroke onset from two stroke units in Sweden. Both groups received usual care. The
      intervention group received even 20 minutes bed-cycling 5 days per week with a maximum of 15
      sessions. Functional outcome was measured with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel index
      and walking with the 6-minute walking test (6MWT). Measurements were performed pre- and
      post-intervention (3 weeks), and at 3-months follow-up.
