  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired hypoglycemia awareness, a significant problem for children with type 1 diabetes, is
      defined as neurogenic symptom response before autonomic response to hypoglycemia. Avoiding
      hypoglycemia appears to restore hypoglycemia awareness.

      Investigators have previously demonstrated in a retrospective study that Flash Glucose
      Monitoring system decreased the risk of severe hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic children and
      adolescents, even though Flash Glucose Monitoring system, unlike Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring system, does not provide glucose alerts.

      Continuous Glucose Monitoring system, by providing real-time data with alarms, could benefit
      to subjects still experiencing severe hypoglycemia with Flash Glucose Monitoring system.
      Besides, in adults, Continuous Glucose Monitoring system reduced more effectively impaired
      hypoglycemia awareness compared to Flash Glucose Monitoring system.

      In that context, investigators would like to assess the impact of Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring system instead of Flash Glucose Monitoring system on hypoglycemia in children and
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>

      All subjects will start with a 7 days run-in phase using their current Flash Glucose
      Monitoring System associated with a blind Continuous Glucose Monitoring system (Envision,
      Medtronic).

      After one week, subjects randomized in the the interventional group will be provided with the
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring (Guardian Connect, Medtronic) and trained by dedicated diabetes
      educators for Continuous Glucose Monitoring usage including insertion of the sensor,
      calibration of the device twice daily and interpretation of the data. Subjects will use the
      sensors according to the license.

      For both groups, insulin doses decisions are made by the participant according the received
      education.

      After one week, all subjects will be contacted by phone focusing on the use of the
      technology. The treatment period is 8 weeks. The last week of the treatment period, subjects
      will use the blind Continuous Glucose Monitoring system (Envision, Medtronic) in addition to
      their allocated Glucose Monitoring system.
