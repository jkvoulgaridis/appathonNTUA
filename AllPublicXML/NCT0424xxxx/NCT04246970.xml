  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PreLiveR-T consists of a prospective randomized clinical trial conducted in an adult
      population that is a candidate for liver transplantation (LT) at the Hospital La Fe Valencia
      (Spain). The study is structured in three phases: I) Prehabilitation (2 months before LT);
      II) Training, divided in two successive periods: Supervised training (months 3-6 after LT)
      and Unsupervised training (6-12 months after LT); III) Long-term follow-up (2 years after
      LT).

      Primary outcomes are related to post-surgery evolution (morbidity and mortality,
      hospitalization length, etc.). As a secondary outcomes are collected those related to:
      functional capacity, muscle strength and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>

      The main objective is to study the post-surgical impact (post-S) of a Prehabilitation program
      on candidates for liver transplantation (LT), as well as to study the effects of
      posttransplant training on the clinical and functional evolution of the recipients. Also this
      project pretends to assess the influence of functional capacity (FC) improvement on the short
      and long term post-S evolution of the LT candidates. This is a prospective randomized
      clinical trial in which three phases follow: Prehabilitation, training and follow-up. The
      sample will be constituted by 60 candidates for LT, randomized in a control group (CG, n=20),
      a Prehabilitation group (PG, n=20) and a Prehabilitation-posttransplant training group (PTG,
      n=20). To conventional care, a Prehabilitation program will be added to the PG and PTG. After
      the LT, just PTG will follow a posttransplant training program. The long-term follow-up will
      be extended to 2 years post-LT. The variables under study will be: complications and post-S
      evolution; FC; quality of life; etc. The individualization of Prehabilitation and
      posttransplant training program, and also medical control, will ensure safety and offer the
      potential benefits that these types of programs can provide.

    <description>Maximum respiratory pressures will be measured using a Respiratory Pressure Meter MicroRPM® and the unit of measure is cmH2O. MIP and MEP are probably the most frequently reported non-invasive estimates of respiratory muscle strength. Ever since Black and Hyatt (1969) reported this technique it has been widely used in patients, healthy control subjects across all ages, and athletes. Pressure is recorded at the mouth during a quasi-static short (few seconds) maximal breathing. Reference: Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2002;166:531-535</description>

    <description>The SPPB is a simple test to measure lower extremity function using tasks that mimic daily activities. The SPPB examines three areas of lower extremity function; static balance, gait speed, and getting in and out of a chair. Static balance is measured in units of time (seconds) and patients are timed holding 3 different stances. Gait speed is measured in time (seconds) to walk 4 meters. Chair sits are measured as the time (seconds) it takes to get up and out of a chair 5 times without using one's arms to assist the exercise. Collectively, the three tests are used to generate a total score (0-12) that reflects a patient's frailty (score of 0) or lack of frailty (score of 12).

    <description>Short-Form Liver Disease Quality of Life (SF-LDQOL) is formed by 9 dimensions: symptoms of the disease, effects of the disease on the activities of daily life, memory/concentration, anxiety, sleep, loneliness, hopelessness, stigma for the disease and sexual functioning. The minimum and maximum values of the scale are 0-100, so that the higher the score, the better health related quality of life (HRQL).</description>

It includes interval aerobic exercise (5 cycles of 2 minutes at 70 percentage of Watts or heart rate of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CEPT) and 3 minutes of active rest at 40 percentage; peripheral muscle training and balance exercises in a circuit of 10 phases, 10 to 15 repetitions, from 1 to 3 sets (the participants will work at moderate intensity, no more than 5-6/10 on the modified Borg scale); Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) through a threshold loading device [2 sessions / day, 3 sets of 15 repetitions, at 60-70 percentage of the maximum inspiratory pressure (cmH2O)]; ventilatory reeducation by an incentive inspirator based on the vital capacity evaluated in the initial spirometry. Both the aerobic modality and the resistance training, will increase the intensity of work (HR, Watts, Kg or cmH2O) between 2-5 percentage every 2 weeks complying with the principle of training overload.</description>

    <description>Prehabilitation will be followed by a posttransplant training program. In this, the patient will perform supervised exercise (IIa interval aerobic exercise and resistance training) 2 days / week, and a physical exercise program at home until completing a total of 5 sessions / week in the aerobic modality. In the unsupervised phase (IIb), the patient will continue with the learned physical exercise program, but without supervision, 5 sessions / week (including a minimum of 2 non-consecutive sessions to perform resistance training).</description>
