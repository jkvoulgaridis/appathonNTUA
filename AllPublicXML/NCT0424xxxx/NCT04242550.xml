  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, and currently, the best
      behavioral treatments only work for 40-60% of adults. BED often co-occurs with mood and
      anxiety disorders, and both are associated with neurocognitive deficits related to executive
      function (EF). These EF deficits contribute to worsening BED symptoms and make it difficult
      for these adults to adhere to treatment recommendations. The proposed study aims to develop
      an EF training enhanced behavioral treatment for BED and compare its effectiveness to the
      standard cognitive behavioral therapy for patients with BED and a co-occurring mood or
      anxiety disorder.

      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate an EF training enhanced cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for BED (EF-BED+CBT) compared to standard CBT in patients with BED
      and a comorbid mood/anxiety disorder to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of EF-BED+CBT in reducing binge eating, impairment, and comorbid
      depression/anxiety symptoms. Adult participants with BED and comorbid mood/anxiety disorder
      will be randomized to a four month remote treatment of either EF-BED+CBT or CBT alone.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, following treatment (month 4) and 2-month
      follow-up (month 6).
