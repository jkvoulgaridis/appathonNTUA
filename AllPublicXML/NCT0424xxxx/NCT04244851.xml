  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnourished patients are at risk of many complications, including infections, pressure
      ulcers and readmissions. Little is known about their care pathway after hospital discharge.

      This study aims to determine care pathways of malnourished patients after hospital discharge
      and to determine what they need to better take care of their malnutrition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients hospitalized in the post-emergency unit of Rennes University Hospital during the
      study period will be screened for malnutrition.

      Data concerning newly diagnosed malnourished patients will be recorded and those patients
      will be contacted 3 months after their hospital discharge.

      A qualitative study will be conducted among malnourished patients and their families : a
      sample of patients and their caregivers will be interviewed to better understand their
      perception of malnutrition and what they need to better take care of malnutrition.
