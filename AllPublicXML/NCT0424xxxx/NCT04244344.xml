  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A fall is an event which results in a person coming to rest unwittingly on the floor or
      ground or other lower level. Those who have fall history have significantly more
      hospitalizations and clinical visits as well as emergency department visits than those who do
      not. Loss of confidence in walking, fear of falling, social isolation and depression can also
      occur in those patients. Fall is a predictor for decreased functional status and risk factor
      for the whole institution Approximately 30% to 40% of people aged 65 years and older who
      lived in the community fall each year. Multiple studies related to falls have shown a close
      relation between sex and age. As a result, Elderlies who are prone to falling consume more
      health care resources than non-fallers.

      STRATIFY proved to be more accurate and more frequently utilized. STRATIFY was originally
      derived in mixed acute/rehabilitation geriatric wards of UK urban teaching hospital using a
      'case control' design and multi-variate regression to identify predictors of falls in
      hospital inpatients. This resulted in a simple five-point score (each item scoring 1 or 0),
      with predictive &quot;cut-offs&quot; as 2 or 3 used in the original validation studies which followed.
      STRATIFY was not designed or validated for continuous modelling of risk but for use in
      categorical prediction 'high' versus 'low risk'. Sensitivity and specificity were both found
      to be in excess of 80% in the two UK cohort of the original paper, leading to wide spread
      adoption of the tool in clinical practice. It is now ten years since the publication of the
      original STRATIFY paper and a number of prospective studies in several cohort of patients
      have been published.

      Objective and Propose

        1. To assess the effectiveness of the fall preventing intervention after targeted group is
           screened by the tool &quot;STRATIFY&quot; in triage

        2. To look at the discrepancy of fall perception of patient/caregiver and the assessment
           result using &quot;STRATIFY&quot;.

        3. To compare the fall rate after applying the screening tool &quot;STRATIFY&quot; and with
           intervention given in their AEDs.

      Hypothesis

        1. It is hypothesized that the effectiveness score collected from patient and/or caregivers
           via questionnaires within data collection period shows positive result and these
           measures are worth to execute in A&amp;E.

        2. It is hypothesized that there may not be a big discrepancy of fall perception of
           caregivers with the result of assessment tool and there is a discrepancy of fall
           perception of fall perception of patients as they may over-estimate their ability

        3. It is hypothesized that the fall rate of intervention group will be lower than that of
           control group.

      Rate of fall incident which is properly documented and reported to AIRS after using fall
      screening tool &quot;STRATIFY&quot; and intervention given will be the intervention group.

      Rate of fall incident of usual practice in a designated period will be the control group.

      Methodology:

      Design: Prospective two-center observational study Data collection Frequency: Cross-sectional
      Sampling Design: convenience sampling Sampling Tool: Assessment forms &amp; Questionnaires

      Data collection Time:

      Subject recruitment started from 1/2020 to 3/2020. Geriatric Attendance were extracted from
      the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) in the period of 1/2019 to 3/2019 and
      1/2020 to 3/2020 Numbers of fall cases were extracted from AIRS system. Setting: KWH A&amp;E and
      PWH A&amp;E (different cluster)

      Population and sample size For a 95% confidence interval with width=0.3, the expected sample
      size is at least 267 subjects needed to be recruited based on the rule of thumb that SD =
      range/4. In this study, approximately 300 subjects will be recruited (~150 from Kwong Wah
      Hospital and ~150 from Prince of Wales Hospital) .

      Subject recruitment:

      Nurse investigators will be assigned to different duty by Duty in-charge in each shift. First
      of all, the research nurse will screen the case with inclusion and exclusion criteria. After
      that, investigators will approach to the target group, 10mins will be given to the target
      group to consider whether to participate in the study or not. Once the target group decided
      to participate in the research, fall risk of targeted patients will be screened by using
      &quot;STRATIFY&quot; fall risk assessment tool at triage by investigators. Patient will be screened
      into 2 groups, either at risk (score≥2) or not at risk (score&lt;2). Nursing intervention
      includes fall signage, fall bracelet, instruction card will be provided to high risk group
      (score≥2). Questionnaires will be distributed to the target groups to collect their opinions
      towards the screening tool and the intervention upon they were discharged or admitted.

      Content Validity The content validity of patient/caregiver effectiveness score questionnaire
      and instruction card will be established by a panel of eight including one geriatric nursing
      consultant, one emergency nursing consultant, two emergency medicine specialists and four
      advanced practice nurses from two A&amp;Es. They will review the questionnaire and all
      suggestions will be incorporated into the final version of the questionnaire. Ten lay persons
      will be invited to complete the questionnaire to examine the readability to general public.

      Selection and Withdrawal of subjects Nurse investigator will be assigned to different duty by
      Duty in-charge in each shift. First of all, the research nurse will screen the case with
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. After that, investigators will approach to the target
      group, 20mins will be given to the target group to consider whether to participate in the
      study or not. Once the target group decided to participate in the research, fall risk of
      targeted patients will be screened by using STRATIFY at triage by investigators. Patient will
      be screened into 2 groups, either at risk (score≥2) or not at risk (score&lt;2).

      Nursing interventions Fall signage, fall bracelet, instruction card will be provided to high
      risk group. Patients of high risk group will be positioned close to the nurse's station. For
      high risk patients, nurse should ensure that the bed is at the lowest height, the brakes are
      locked and the patient's belongings are within reach. Questionnaires will be distributed to
      the target groups to collect their opinions towards the screening tool and the interventions.
