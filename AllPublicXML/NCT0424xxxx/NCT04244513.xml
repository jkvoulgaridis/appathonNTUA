      1. Evaluating therapeutic effects of globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation
           (DBS) on Huntington's disease (HD) patients with chorea；

        2. Explore the relationship between brain network conditions and DBS efficacy in HD
           patients

        3. Explore the effect of different programmed parameters on the treatment of patients with

      1. Evaluating therapeutic effects of GPi-DBS on HD patients with chorea: Clinical data of
      patients at different treatment time points will be collected, using different clinical
      assessments. The clinical case report form for HD-DBS is consistent with Enroll HD project
      and the case report form is attached in the appendix. The main purpose is to determine the
      efficiency of DBS treatment for HD with chorea by comparing the patients' status before and
      after surgery.

      Primary endpoints: Changes in chorea score of UHDRS, changes in total motor score (UHDRS).

      Secondary endpoints: changes in cognition will be assessed by stroop interference test,
      stroop word reading test, stroop colour naming test, trail making test, symbol digit modality
      test and mini-mental state examination(MMSE); changes in anxiety assessed by Hamilton Anxiety
      Scale(HAMA); changes in depression assessed by Hamilton depression scale(HAMD) and Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI); changes in the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric
      symptoms assessed by the Problem Behaviours Assessment for HD and changes in quality-of-life
      assessed by UHDRS functional assessment and UHDRS total functional capacity assessment.

      2 Explore the relationship between brain network conditions and DBS efficacy in HD patients
      The electrophysiological signals during the operation of HD patients will be collected and
      analyzed, and compared with the postoperative disease conditions, to determine the
      relationship between the patient's EEG activity and the mechanism of disease development,
      disease progression, and treatment effect.

      3. Explore the effect of different programmed parameters on the treatment of patients with
      DBS After the HD patient is turned on, the patient is programmed to adjust the program
      control parameters of different patients during adjustment, and the effects of different
      program control parameters on the patient, tolerance, and related side effects are clarified.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized into two groups, of which the first group will be routinely activated after surgery and then stimulated for 6 months. The second group of patients will be re-launched 3 months after surgery, continued stimulation for 3 months, and then entered the open study. Patient data will be collected before surgery, 3 months after surgery, and 6 months after surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This study adopts a blind design. One day before the first programming, the grouper and the programmer will release the cover independently. Only the grouper and the programmer will know the group information of each patient, in which the programmer does not communicate with the patient about the programming parameters. After each programming, the results are uniformly placed in the programmer to keep the others (patients, neurologists) blind about grouping and parameters. The evaluation will be finished by neurologists and video records of the patient's motor assessment. Neurologists do not participate in the surgical treatment and programmer. The statistical team is independent of other researchers. When performing statistical analysis, only the group information is known, the programming parameters corresponding to the group are blinded. The Medtronic company only provides equipment support and does not participate in any clinical research process.</masking_description>
