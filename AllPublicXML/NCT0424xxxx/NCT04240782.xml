  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent peer-reviewed research indicates that low-income families are at higher risk for
      unhealthy dietary intake and associated poor health outcomes. Interventions that teach
      individuals from low-income families about cooking and healthy eating are warranted to
      improve overall dietary behaviors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the
      Market to MyPlate Program on participants' reported cooking, shopping, and dietary behaviors
      using a cluster randomized trial design, where class cohorts are randomly assigned to
      education with produce allocations, education only, or control conditions. A secondary aim is
      to collect program feedback and better understand facilitators and barriers to farmer's
      market use and food waste reduction.

    <description>The adults and children will learn how to prepare the fresh produce during an age appropriate, evidence-based, family cooking school. The class will provide participants with a no-cost, low-risk incentive to try new vegetables, and will empower them to build healthier lives through nutrient-rich, locally sourced meals. Participants will also receive nutrition education and information on how they can integrate local produce into their food budget. One of the class sessions will focus solely on how to budget for healthy food, comparison shop, and make the most of their food dollars. Participants will learn how to use their SNAP benefits at local farmers markets.</description>
