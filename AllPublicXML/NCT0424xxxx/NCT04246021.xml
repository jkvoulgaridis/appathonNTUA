      This study is a nonrandomized, single arm, open-label study stratified by iron-deficiency
      status.

      The study aims to investigate the effect of FCM (without ESAs) on anemic cancer patients
      undergoing chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy); stratified by status of iron
      deficiency (i.e. non-iron deficient vs. iron deficient patients ). The study will also try to
      find out whether serum level of Hepcidin and C reactive protein can correlate with response

      Patients will receive one or two doses of FCM, based on the body weight and Hb level.
      Patients will be followed-up for a total of twelve weeks. The study is divided into a
      screening, treatment and follow-up phases and is expected to be completed in 12 months.

    <description>Patients will receive one or two doses of Ferric carboxymaltose (ferrinject), based on the body weight and Hb level.
Ferric carboxymaltose will be administered as a single infusion if the needed dose is 1000 mg as a short IV infusion
If the needed Ferric carboxymaltose dose is &gt; 1000 mg, an initial dose of 1000 mg will be given as a short IV infusion and the remaining dose will be given the week after in a similar fashion</description>
