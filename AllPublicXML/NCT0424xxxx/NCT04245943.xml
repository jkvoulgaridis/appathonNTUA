  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a non-randomized intervention study with group-based physical exercise. Cancer
      survivors who have participated in the rehabilitation program at the Center for Education and
      Rehabilitation are included in the study.

      The cancer and cancer treatment have led to patients struggling with physical, mental and
      social late effects which prevent them from functioning in everyday life and return to work.
      The purpose of the project is to investigate whether one municipal group training measure can
      help to lower the threshold for the user to maintain good exercise habits and return to work
      / everyday life, as well as the effect on the user's physical form and quality of life and
      the transition between health level and the body itself measure.
