  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study aims to describe the outcome for patients with
      persistent or chronic critical illness treated at Remeo, a clinic specialized for patients in
      need of prolonged intensive care and intensive care rehabilitation in Sweden. Patients'
      disease characteristics and the treatment in multidisciplinary patient centered teams for
      intensive care, weaning from mechanical ventilation and simultaneous rehabilitation will be
      described. Patients will be followed one year after discharge to document health related
      quality of life, physical function, frailty, mental illness and used health care resources.
