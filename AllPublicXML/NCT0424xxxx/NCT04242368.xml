  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of buffered hypertonic (1.8%) saline
      nasal rinses as compared to isotonic saline nasal rinses in patients with chronic
      rhinosinusitis (CRS). Evidence from basic science research suggests that hypertonic solutions
      may have beneficial effects over isotonic saline rinses; however prior clinical studies on
      this topic have been inconclusive and limited due to highly variable inclusion criteria,
      large variability in the volume and concentration of irrigation solution, and inconsistent
      outcome measures. The goal of the study is to utilize a cross over study design to directly
      compare the impact of two different types of saline irrigation.

      Primary aim:

      Compare the efficacy of buffered hypertonic saline irrigations to buffered isotonic saline
      irrigations on patient reported outcome measures of chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms and nasal
      obstruction in patients with CRS. Based on in vivo data and prior clinical studies, the
      investigators expect participants will experience greater symptom improvement with hypertonic
      saline rinses as compared to isotonic saline irrigations.

      Hypothesis: Participants will have greater improvement in patient reported outcome measures
      (SNOT-22 and NOSE) when using buffered hypertonic sinus irrigations as compared to buffered
      isotonic saline irrigations.

    <description>Participants will complete the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT)-22, a validated questionnaire for assessing symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, before and after completing each intervention.
SNOT-22 is a validated scale which measures sinonasal symptoms for sinusitis patients. The 22 questions are rated on a scale of 0-5 for a maximum total score of 110. Higher scores represent more symptomatic patients.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE), a validated questionnaire for assessing symptoms of nasal obstruction, before and after completing each intervention.
NOSE scores can range from 5 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms. Classes are mild (5-25), moderate (30-50), severe (55-75), and severe (80-100).</description>
