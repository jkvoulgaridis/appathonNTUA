      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial, based on the
      hypothesis that PCC reduces the allogeneic blood transfusion requirement relative to FFP in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery under CPB. 180 subjects will be randomly divided into 2
      groups (group PCC and group FFP), with 90 cases in each group. Patients will be given a
      4-factor PCC based on the patients' body weight and INR in group PCC and a dose of 10-15
      ml/kg FFP in group FFP. All the patients will be followed up respectively at 24 hours, 48
      hours, 72 hours, 7 days and 30 days after the surgery. The primary outcome is the rate of
      allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion required during the intraoperative and
      postoperative period up to 7 days after surgery, and we want to explore the efficacy of PCC
      reducing perioperative blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery under CPB, compared with FFP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion are major complications of cardiac
      surgery, which increase perioperative complications, perioperative mortality and medical
      costs.This study is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial, in order to
      determine whether PCC is more effective than FFP in reducing perioperative blood loss and
      allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery under CPB. Patients
      signed the informed consent, aged 18 to 80 years, receiving elective CABG or valve
      replacement or valvuloplasty under CPB in Fu Wai Hospital will be included. 180 subjects will
      be randomly divided into 2 groups (group PCC and group FFP), with 90 cases in each group.
      Preoperative management, anesthetic and surgical techniques will be standardized for both
      groups. When APTT is prolonged (&gt;1.5 times normal), patients will be given a 4-factor PCC
      based on the patients' body weight and INR (INR 2-4, PCC 25 IU/kg; INR 4-6, PCC 35 IU/kg;
      INR&gt;6, PCC 50 IU/kg) in group PCC and a dose of 10-15 ml/kg FFP in group FFP. All the
      patients will be followed up respectively at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 7 days and 30 days
      after the surgery to record observations relevant to the study and the results of laboratory
      testing. The laboratory tests include hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, platelet count,
      INR, PT, APTT, fibrinogen, serum glucose, creatinine, AST, and ALT concentrations. Blood loss
      is collected during the surgical procedure and within 48 hours after the surgery. The primary
      outcome is the rate of allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion required during the
      intraoperative and postoperative period up to 7 days after surgery. The secondary outcomes
      include (1) the total units of allogeneic RBC transfused during the intraoperative and
      postoperative period up to 7 days after surgery; (2) the volume of perioperative blood loss;
      (3) the rate of reexploration due to bleeding within 30 days after the surgery.
      Intent-to-treat analysis will be used for all the valid variables. Baseline characteristics
      will be tabulated shown and compared between PCC and FFP groups using standardized
      difference. The primary outcome will be compared using chi-square test and continuous
      secondary outcomes will be compared using t-test with log transformation of the variable. The
      use of postoperative hemostatic medications and reopening due to postoperative bleeding will
      be compared using chi-square test. Treatment effect will be measured by odds ratio and mean
      difference for binary and continuous outcomes with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. No
      correction for multiple comparison will be conducted in the analyses of the secondary
      outcomes, hence, the findings for secondary outcomes will be only interpreted as explanatory
      results. A two-sided P-value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

    <intervention_model_description>180 patients who meet the criteria will be randomly divided into 2 groups, named prothrombin complex concentrate group (group PCC) and fresh frozen plasma group (control group, group FFP), with 90 cases in each group. Preoperative management, anesthetic and surgical techniques will be standardized for all patients. Prolonged APTT (&gt;1.5 times normal)34 will be regarded as a trigger for administration of PCC or FFP, according to the randomized groups. In group PCC, patients will be given a 4-factor PCC based on the patients' body weight and INR (INR 2-4, PCC 25 IU/kg; INR 4-6, PCC 35 IU/kg; INR&gt;6, PCC 50 IU/kg). In group FFP, patients will be given FFP based on the patients' body weight (10-15 mL/kg).</intervention_model_description>
