      Background: There is no up-to-date information regarding presentation, management and
      clinical course of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) in Turkey. TURKMI registry
      is designed to provide insight to the characteristics, management from symptom onset to the
      hospital discharge and outcome of patients with acute MI in Turkey.

      Methods: TURKMI study, as a nation-wide registry, will be conducted in 50 percutaneous
      coronary intervention -capable centres selected from each EuroStat NUTS region in Turkey
      according to their population sampling weight, prioritizing the volume of hospital in each
      region. All consecutive patients with acute MI admitted to the coronary care units within the
      48 hours of symptom onset will be prospectively enrolled during a predefined 2-week period.

      The first step of the study has cross-sectional design in which baseline information such as
      symptoms, risk factors, time periods at each step from symptom onset to revascularization,
      way of arrival to hospital, biochemical analysis and in-hospital management and outcome will
      be assessed. The second step has a cohort characteristics in which enrolled patients will be
      followed-up up to 2 years. Follow-up visits will be conducted at 1st, 6th, 12th and 24th
      months, and predictors and risk of cardiovascular events, and implementation of guidelines
      will be assessed as secondary outcomes.

      Conclusion: The national TURKMI registry is expected to provide important information to
      improve the national policy of the diagnosis, management and outcomes of MI in Turkey

        The screened population will consist of all consecutive patients presenting with suspected
        acute MI in the participating hospitals. Men and women aged â‰¥18 years will be enrolled if
        they fulfil the following inclusion criteria;

          1. having hospitalized within 48 hours of onset of symptoms of the index event

          2. had a final (discharge) diagnosis of acute MI either [ST elevation MI (STEMI) or non
             ST elevation (NSTEMI)] with positive troponin levels, and

          3. having signed an Informed Consent. Patients unwilling or unable to consent will be
             excluded. To facilitate consecutive enrolment, all patients hospitalized at each
             participating site with acute MI will be recruited consecutively during the same 2
             consecutive weeks (15 days).
