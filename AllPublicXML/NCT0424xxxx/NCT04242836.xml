      Primary objective of our study is to develop and validate a computer-based digital
      near-vision optotype based on the Greek version of the print MNREAD.

      Present study aims to develop and validate a computer-based digital near-vision optotype
      based on the Greek version of the print MNREAD.

      Specifically, it aims to evaluate the level of agreement between the conventional printed
      greek MNREAD chart and the corresponding digital chart, as well as test-retest reliability of
      the digital optotype.

      To address these aims, four reading parameters measured with the print and the digital
      version are compared. These parameters are the following:

        1. Reading Acuity (RA)

        2. Maximum Reading Speed (MRS)

        3. Critical Print Size (CPS)

        4. Accessibility Index (ACC)

      All the comparisons take place in two groups: a) a Normal Vision Group (NVG), and b) a Low
      Vision Group (LVG) in order to estimate the reading capacity in a population with a wide
      range of vision.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reading Acuity (RA)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The smallest print that the patient can read without making significant errors, and can be calculated by the following formula:
Acuity (in logMAR)= 1.4 - (sentences x 0.1) + (errors x 0.01).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Reading Speed (MRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's reading speed when reading is not limited by print size , and is calculated by averaging the speed of the sentences with print size larger than the CPS. [(in words per minute (wpm)]</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Critical Print Size (CPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The smallest print size at which patients can read with their MRS, and is identified as the print size of the sentence fulfilling this criterion: all of the following sentences are read at a speed that is 1.96 times the standard deviation below the average of the larger preceding sentences (that is the MRS). In other words, it is defined as the smallest print size that yields 90% of the MRS [(in logMAR)]</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accessibility Index (ACC)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean reading speed measured across the 10 largest print sizes (1.3 to 0.4 logMAR) of the MNREAD Acuity Chart at 40 cm normalized by 200 wpm, which was the mean value for a group of 365 normally sighted young adults aged 18 to 39 years old.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) for study participants</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Level of agreement between the print and the digital version are evaluated by calculation of the ICCs for the 4 reading parameters (RA, MRS, CPS, ACC).</description>
