  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project addresses the problem of adverse drug reactions in the three most frequently
      prescribed therapeutic classes of drugs in children: antibiotics, analgesics, and mental
      health medications.

      We will conduct pilot testing of a pharmacogenomic testing panel and study how the tests and
      generated test results are utilized and understood by physicians, pharmacists, patients and
      their families.

      The specific objectives are to:

        1. Implement a pilot pharmacogenomics program to test medication safety and effectiveness
           of antibiotics, analgesics and mental health medication to enhance prescribing
           decision-making.

        2. Develop data collection forms to collect necessary patient information from the
           prescribing physicians.

        3. Develop pharmacogenomics reports to return results to physicians, pharmacists, patients
           and their families.

        4. Determine how the tests and results are perceived and utilized by physicians,
           pharmacists, patients and their families.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>150 participants on analgesics, anti-infectives and psychotropics will be given pharmacogenomic recommendations for the risk of gene related adverse events prior to or during treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020</time_frame>
    <description>We will be able to determine the barriers and facilitators of the implementation of the pharmacogenomic service in a health care facility.
This will be done by using standardized questionnaires after each pharmacogenomic report is issued. The prescriber and the patient will both answer questions about the utility of the genetic results, the format of the report and the clarity of the content.
Results will be recorded and summarized every 25 patients in order to improve the service and the recommendations through the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be enrolled if they can benefit from pharmacogenomic testing. This
             means their physician is considering the use of a drug that is part of the panels
             (analgesics, antibiotics, and mental health medication) or they are already using one.
