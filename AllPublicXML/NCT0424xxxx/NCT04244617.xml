      This study evaluates the effect and experience of peer-support in internet mediated ACT
      (Acceptance and Commitment therapy) in an explorative pilot study with mixed method design
      conducted in primary care. Peer-supporters are certified support persons with personal
      experience of mental health problems and the process of rehabilitation, which becomes
      professionally active in care and support to patients in their recovery

      The study is a mixed methods design consisting of an un-controlled pragmatic effectiveness
      study combined with semi-structured interviews in order to investigate the participant´s
      experience of treatment. Participants were recruited from patients who were referred to a
      central unit for internet- CBT (Cognitive Behavioral therapy) in primary care in Västra
      Götaland region, Sweden. Peer-supporters were recruited through a swedish patient
      organization. Participants were adults 18 years of age or older with an anxiety disorder.

      All participants were interviewed by a psychologist with a diagnostic instrument, a
      structured interview called PRIME-MD, before starting treatment. After the interview, all
      patients who were offered iCBT and met the inclusion criteria were requested to participate
      in the study.

      Patients who accepted inclusion were guided by both a psychologist and a peer-support in the
      iCBT treatment used in the study. The iCBT treatment program used is a transdiagnostic
      program aimed at treating people with mild to moderate anxiety problems.

      Quantitative data about psychosocial symptoms were collected, and qualitative data about the
      participants experience of treatment were collected through semi-structured interviews.
