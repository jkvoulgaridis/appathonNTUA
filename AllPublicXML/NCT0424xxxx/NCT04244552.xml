    <textblock>
      ATRC-101-A01 is a first-in-human, Phase 1b, open-label trial to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biological activity of escalating doses of ATRC-101,
      an engineered, fully human immunoglobulin G, subclass 1 (IgG1) antibody derived from a
      naturally-occurring human antibody.
