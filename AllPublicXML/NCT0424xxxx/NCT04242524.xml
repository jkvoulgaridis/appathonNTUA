      The purpose of this study is to understand how daily rhythms of behavior affect the
      expression of genes in fat cells, and how these daily cycles affect the way fat cells respond
      to insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar levels) before and after bariatric surgery.

    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery as a means of weight loss has become increasingly popular over the last
      10-15 years. In addition to promoting weight loss, bariatric surgery has become increasingly
      recognized for use in the management of diabetes. Recent studies have indicated that
      bariatric surgery can result in a marked improvement in insulin sensitivity before long term
      weight loss is attained. The goal of this project is to delineate the changes in the insulin
      responsiveness of subcutaneous adipocytes obtained by needle biopsy 2 weeks prior to surgery
      vs. 12 weeks after bariatric surgery, which could account for improvements in overall insulin
      sensitivity seen before any long-term sustained weight loss has occurred. The investigators
      will also examine gene expression in adipocytes (fat cells).

The intervention includes eating meals and snacks at fixed times and having lights off at a specific time at night and lights on at a specific time in the morning.</description>
