    <textblock>
      Detect anatomical level of acquired lacrimal passage obstructions among patients with
      epiphora. They were evaluated and divided into four groups Punctal, Canalicular, Nasolacrimal
      duct and Mixed groups according to level of obstruction
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 3 years period adult patients with obstructive epiphora were evaluated clinically by
      Probing /irrigation of lacrimal passages to detect anatomical level of obstruction.

      The main site of obstruction was the common canaliculus where 2/3 of patients had canalicular
      problems. The second common site of obstruction is nasolacrimal duct followed by the puncti.
