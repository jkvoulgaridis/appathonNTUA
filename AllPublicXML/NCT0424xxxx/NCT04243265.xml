      The objective of the present study will be to evaluate the clinical patellofemoral joint
      function (primary endpoint) and radiographically the patellofemoral arthritic degeneration
      (secondary endpoint) of of MPFL reconstruction with fascia lata allograft at a minimum
      follow-up of 2, 5 and 10 years in a group of 25 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral disorders make up about 20% of all knee pathologies and are often a source of
      diagnostic and therapeutic doubts for the orthopedic surgeon. In fact, the origin of this
      type of disorder is multifactorial and they can occur in the form of a large variety of
      clinical pictures with different penetrance in each patient.

      In accordance with the classification of Dejour et al., the instability of the patella can be
      divided into traumatic and a-traumatic (recurrent or habitual). The latter patients may
      present a variety of anatomical anomalies that predispose to dislocation: patella hypoplasia,
      genu recurvatum, conditions of ligament hyperlassity, hypoplastic external femoral condyle,
      trochlear dysplasia, high patella, torsional defects of the lower limb.

      The incidence of patella dislocation is estimated to be 5.8 cases per 100,000 people, with
      values that become five times higher in patients aged between 10 and 17 years. Conservative
      treatment is preferable in the first case of acute dislocation, however the recurrence of
      this episode occurs in a percentage equal to 15 - 44% in these subjects.

      Many surgical interventions have been described to correct the various factors that
      predispose to patellofemoral instability, with variable success rates (72% with the Hauser
      technique and 93% with the Roux-Goldthwait technique, 73% with that of Fielding et at. and
      78% with that of Trillat. after a long follow-up.

      On the other hand, Crosby and Insall, Arnbjornsson et al. and Marcacci et al. have
      demonstrated a similar clinical outcome in long-term controlled studies but an increase in
      degenerative changes in operated patients compared to patients treated conservatively. This
      can be explained by the fact that often a single procedure is not sufficient on its own to
      resolve such a complex pathology, or with the fact that the operations used so far
      excessively increase the pressures on the patellofemoral cartilage with subsequent arthrosic
      degeneration.

      The medial patello-femoral ligament (MPFL) is one of the main stabilizers of the patella in
      its movement on the femur; numerous studies have recently shown that this ligament is damaged
      in almost all cases, thus recognizing the role of structure that most limits the patella in
      its lateral dislocation to the MPFL (biomechanically speaking about 50 - 60% of the force).
      Following these studies, the reconstruction of the MPFL as an elective treatment for
      relapsing patella dislocation has recently been proposed. Currently, countless surgical
      techniques have been proposed that use various types of grafts: autologous tendons (the first
      in 1990 from Suganuma et al.), donor tendons (allograft) and synthetic ligaments.

      Our team recently developed a minimally invasive MPFL reconstruction technique using an
      allograft tendon of the fascia lata. The rationale for this technique is to stabilize the
      patella and limit medium-long term patellofemoral arthritic degeneration by restoring the
      MPFL in the most anatomical way possible, not using a tubular graft but an aponevrosis with
      biomechanical characteristics similar to the MPFL native. The MPFL reconstruction can be used
      alone or in association with the realignment of the extensor system by transposition of the
      anterior tibial tuberosity, managing to correct most of the recurrent patellofemoral
      instabilities. Only in very serious particular cases is it necessary perform additional
      procedures that are more invasive and have a more uncertain clinical result (such as
      Trocleoplasty).

      The objective of the present study will be to evaluate the clinical patellofemoral joint
      function (primary endpoint) and radiographically the patellofemoral arthritic degeneration
      (secondary endpoint) of of MPFL reconstruction with fascia lata allograft at a minimum
      follow-up of 2, 5 and 10 years in a group of 25 patients.

      Sample is represented by 25 patients underwent MPFL reconstruction using a minimally invasive
      technique using a donor-sided fascia tendon (allograft) performed at the Rizzoli Orthopedic
      Institute between 2011 and 2015 by the team of Prof. Marcacci.

      Any concomitant treatments: treatment of associated meniscal lesions (meniscectomy),
      reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), realignment of the extensor system by
      transposition of the anterior tibial tuberosity (intervention by Elmsile-Trillat).

      Follow-up visit will be carried out at 2, 5 and 10 years of average follow-up. The &quot;non
      parametric Wilcoxon&quot; and &quot;paired Student's t-test&quot; tests will be used to determine the
      changes between the various follow-up intervals in the outcome measurements respectively for
      the non-parametric variables (Tegner activity level) and for the parametric ones ( SF-12
      test, VAS pain test, KOOS test, Kujala test, &quot;tilt&quot; and &quot;sulcus&quot; angles, &quot;Insall-Salvati&quot;
      report).

      The changes between the various follow-up intervals in the objective IKDC score and in the
      Iwano score will be assessed by means of the &quot;Pearson chi-square test&quot;.

      All &quot;p values&quot; will be 2-tailed; the significance level will be defined at p ≤ 0.05.

    <description>The SF-12 (Short form health survey) is a questionnaire that aims to investigate the perception of individuals' psychophysical conditions. It is taken from a larger version, the SF-36. It is designed to have similar performance to the SF-36, while taking less time to complete.
Two summary scores are reported from the SF-12 - a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations). The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 points above or below 50, corresponds to one standard deviation away from the average.</description>

    <description>The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC Questionnaire) is a knee-specific patient-reported outcome which contains sections on knee symptoms (7 items), function (2 items), and sports activities (2 items). It's considered to be one of the most reliable outcome reporting tools in its category and was one of the instruments used in the popular MOON study. IKDC has been subjected to rigorous statistical evaluation and has proven to be a valid and responsive patient-reported outcome measure (PROM).
Scores range from 0 points (lowest level of function or highest level of symptoms) to 100 points (highest level of function and lowest level of symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Degree of patello-femoral arthritic degeneration</measure>

    <description>The radiographic evaluation involves the execution of 3 radiographic projections of the operated knee (lateral projection, axial projection of patella at 30° of knee flexion and long-leg standing radiographs.
Radiographs will be evaluated by one independent expert radiologist to determine the degree of patello-femoral arthritic degeneration according to the Iwano radiographic scale.
Stage 0 is normal; stage 1 is mild, in which the joint space is at least 3 mm; stage 2 is moderate, in which the joint space is less than 3 mm, but there is no bony contact; stage 3 is severe, in which partial bony contact less than one-quarter of the joint surface is present; and stage 4 is very severe, in which the joint bony surfaces entirely touch each other.</description>
