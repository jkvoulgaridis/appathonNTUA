        Patients will be enrolled under one of the following Modules Thoracic - TEVAR (Thoracic
        endovascular aneurysm/aortic repair) Patients requiring urgent or elective endovascular
        treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, penetrating aortic ulcer
        or intramural hematoma Abdominal - EVAR (Endovascular aneurysm/aortic repair) Patients
        requiring urgent or elective endovascular treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic
        aneurysm.

        Custom Device - FEVAR (Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm/aortic repair) Patients with a
        documented thoracic or abdominal pathology suitable for elective treatment using a
        custom-made Terumo Aortic endovascular device.

        Other Isolated Iliac Artery Aneurysm (IIAA) Patients requiring urgent or elective
        endovascular treatment of isolated Iliac Artery Aneurysms (IAA)

                  consent to study participation, not to treatment)

               -  Willingness to comply with the registry protocol

               -  Willingness to adhere to follow-up visits Note: Patients currently enrolled and
                  actively participating within the TREO registry (IP-0020-16) can have their data
                  migrated from TREO to the TiGER registry where local EC approval has been
                  obtained and the patient has been reconsented to TiGER for longer follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Patient is unable or unwilling to comply with the study follow-up regime.

               -  Patient is contraindicated per the IFU, or has any other medical, social or
                  psychological problems that in the opinion of the investigator preclude them from
                  receiving treatment as well as the procedures and evaluations pre and post
                  procedure

               -  Patient is eligible to be enrolled in or is currently actively participating in
                  the Terumo Aortic Global FACT clinical study (FACT-001)
