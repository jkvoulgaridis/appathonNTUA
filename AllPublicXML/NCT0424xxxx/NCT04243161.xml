  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is an involvement of the spinal cord, a nerve cord protected by the
      spine and extends from the base of the brain to the lumbar region. The spinal cord lesion
      causes complete or incomplete paralysis of voluntary mobility and absence, partial or total,
      of any sensitivity below the affected area; In addition, it also involves the lack of control
      over the sphincters of urination and intestinal evacuation, disorders of sexuality and
      fertility, alterations of the Vegetative Nervous System and risk of suffering other
      complications not less important as: bedsores, spasticity, kidney processes, ...

      The cervical and dorsal cord injury severely affects respiratory function due to paralysis
      and deterioration of the respiratory muscles. Several types of respiratory muscle training
      (RMT) have been described to improve respiratory function for people with SCI in the
      literature.

      Despite the relatively small number of studies included in this review, the meta-analysis of
      the pooled data indicates that RMT would be effective in increasing respiratory muscle
      strength and also lung volumes for people with SCI.

      More research is needed to obtain functional results after EMR, such as dyspnea, cough
      efficacy, respiratory complications, hospital admissions due to respiratory complications and
      quality of life.

    <description>The study variables PIM, PEM, FVC, PEF and EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire will be measured on the first day when patient incorporated into the seating position in the patient's bed. Reassessments will be performed every two week till patient discharge from hospital. After that patient will be assessed after 4 month and 1 year after the SCI.
SCIM III will be administered at discharge, 4 month later and 1 year after the injury.
Common clinical practice (pulmonary expansion exercises,drainage of secretions and training of inspiratory muscles) + expiratory muscle training at 50% load after MIP measurement.
The intensity of the treatment will be 50% of the PIM and PEM value (increasing the load in 2 cmH2O weekly). Three sets of 10 reps will be performed, with one total of 30 repetitions, resting 1 minute between each series.
The sessions will be held once per day, from monday to friday, during the entire hospital admission.</description>
