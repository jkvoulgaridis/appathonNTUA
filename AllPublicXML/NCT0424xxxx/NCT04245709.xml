  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of clenbuterol (taken by
      mouth) in subjects with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and to assess the effectiveness
      of clenbuterol with regard to motor function in subjects with ALS. Subjects will be in this
      study approximately 24 weeks. The study drug, clenbuterol, is taken twice a day. As part of
      this study subjects will have the following tests and procedures: medical history, vital
      signs, physical examination, blood tests, heart and lung function tests, muscle function
      test, ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised), thyroid function and for women who can
      become pregnant, pregnancy tests.

      This is an open label pilot trial in which 25 people with ALS will take clenbuterol orally at
      40-80 micrograms twice daily for 24 weeks. In person visits will occur at weeks 0, 4, 12 and
      24. Telephone visits will occur at weeks 1, 6, 16 and 20. During these visits several safety
      and efficacy outcome measures will be performed for research purposes including safety labs,
      thyroid functions, pregnancy testing, ALSFRS-R, FVC, and muscle strength testing (myometry).
      The critical test of treatment efficacy will be the comparison of the ALSFRS-R slope during
      treatment to the estimated pre-treatment slope. All participants will continue to have
      standard follow up care for their ALS at Duke (for patients followed here) or their local ALS
      clinic

    <description>The intervention is treatment with oral clenbuterol at 40-80 micrograms twice daily for 24 weeks. Dosage will initially be 40 mcg daily for one week, then 40 mcg BID per oral daily for the next 5 weeks. If the 40 mcg BID per oral is well tolerated in the opinion of Dr. Bedlack, the dose will be increased to 80 mcg each morning/40 mcg each evening for one week, followed by 80 mcg BID per oral for the remainder of the study. The selected target dose (80 mcg BID) is based upon the experience with the long-term administration of clenbuterol, specifically the beneficial muscle effects in a Phase I/II clinical trial that enrolled patients with late-onset Pompe disease who were previously treated with ERT (Koeberl et al. 2018).</description>
