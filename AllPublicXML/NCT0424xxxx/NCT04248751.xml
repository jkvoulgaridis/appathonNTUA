    <textblock>
      The rotator cuff is a complex of 4 tendons that aid in stabilizing and moving the shoulder.
      Rotator cuff tears are common shoulder injuries in adults. While some tears can be managed by
      physiotherapy, other rotator cuff tears will require surgery. On occasion, when a person has
      had a large rotator cuff tear for a long period of time, the tear can grow and the tendons
      retract. This effect makes it very difficult for the tendons to be repaired to their normal
      spot.

      The most common surgical technique employed to manage a tear that cannot be repaired is to
      remove all unhealthy, inflamed scar tissue in a process called debridement. Often there is a
      bone spur that must be shaved down as well. This can help to reduce the pain in the patient
      as well as assist the range of motion slightly but will not prevent the tear becoming larger.
      This will also not prevent a re-tear of the tendons.

      Recently, surgeons have begun using a variety of materials to help reconstruct torn rotator
      cuffs. New grafts made of highly purified collagen from bovine tendons has been used to
      bridge large gaps in the tendons, and repair the tendon back to the bone. This technique has
      been done many times by skilled shoulder surgeons in Canada, the United States and around the
      world.

      Initial reports by surgeons who do this procedure show that the patients have less pain and
      better range of motion than before the surgery. Shoulder surgeons do not know which is the
      better treatment for large rotator cuff tears. Both treatments (graft and debridement) can
      reduce pain and improve movement of the shoulder. The purpose of this study is to help
      determine whether patients who receive an allograft have better function and fewer re-tear at
      one year after surgery than those who received a debridement alone.

      Rotator cuff injuries are among the most common soft tissue injuries of the shoulder.
      Characterized by insidious onset of progressive pain and weakness, with concomitant loss of
      range of motion, patients with pathological conditions of the rotator cuff are often unable
      to associate the onset of symptoms with a specific traumatic event. Loss of continuity of the
      rotator cuff can be described in several ways, including acute or chronic, partial or
      full-thickness and traumatic or degenerative. For this study, only patients with radiography
      confirmed large rotator cuff tears (&gt; 3 cm) resulting from trauma and/or degeneration will be
      observed.

      Historically, many operative procedures have been used by surgeons in the treatment of large
      rotator cuff tears including open rotator cuff repair, mini- open rotator cuff repair,
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, bridging techniques, debridement, arthroscopic rotator cuff
      repair with acromioplasty, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair without acromioplasty, surgical
      augmentation, debridement etc. While the surgical repair of large rotator cuff tears has
      resulted in pain relief and improved function, the re-tear rate (55%-94%) has remained high
      despite advances in repair techniques. The re-tear rates correlate with the size of the
      rotator cuff tear as well as with other factors such as muscle atrophy, tendon quality, and
      postoperative rehabilitation protocol.

      With an effort to improve healing rates, surgeons have used various biologic tissues to
      either substitute for or augment the repair of the rotator cuff. These tissues include the
      patients' biceps tendon, fascia latae allografts and autografts, freeze-dried rotator cuff
      allografts, and synthetic materials such as polypropylene mesh.1 A new scaffold material made
      of highly purified, type I collagen from bovine tendons has shown great promise as a
      bioinductive implant that helps induce the formation of new tendon-like tissue over the
      surface of partial- or full-thickness rotator cuff tears.This new graft material has the
      benefit of decreasing surgery time, as it takes a few minutes to put in place, while
      increasing healing and tendon thickness.

      The investigators hypothesize that arthroscopic augmentation using a bioinductive collagen
      implant will have superior outcomes in terms of increasing healing, thereby decreasing
      re-tear rate, as compared to participants who are treated with the current gold standard
      treatment (consisting of debridement, acromioplasty, and rotator cuff repair). The
      investigators hypothesize that the participants with graft augment will have decreased pain
      both during the early recovery phase and two years post-operatively as compared to the
      non-augmented group. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that participants with the
      collagen scaffold will have better outcome scores at two years, as compared to the
      non-augmented group.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients that have consented to the study will be randomized into 2 groups with a 50% chance of being in either group. Patients will be blinded and assessed by blinded assessors. Only after the one-year mark will the patient become unblinded following being asked which intervention they believe they received.
Crossover design: Among those 38 patients without augmentation, we anticipate that 23 of them will have re-tear (assuming a 60% re-tear rate). We will offer them revision surgery with augmentation. Then those patients will be followed up 1 year and 2-years afterwards. MRI follow-up will be done at 1 year postoperatively to assess the healing rates. Outcome scores (as per above) will be collected at each follow-up and compared with their non-augmented scores to assess the improvement.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients randomized to this group will receive a regular rotator cuff repair where the bursa will be debrided thoroughly, and rotator cuff edges will be shaved down to stable tissue. The rotator cuff will be repaired using multiple single row triple loaded suture anchor placed adjacent to the articular margin. Then, the graft will be delivered to the subacromial space and positioned over the bursal surface of the suprasinatus tendon, ensuring that the lateral edge of the implant will overlap with the head of the humerus. The graft will be fixed with tendon and bone staples.</description>
