  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare, in patients with acute moderate and severe bronchiolitis
      the efficacy of two different methods of oxygenation to decrease respiratory rate, heart
      rate, bronchiolitis severity score and, provides rapid improvement oxygenation.

        1. Conventional oxygen therapy (O2 Simple face mask)

        2. High flow nasal oxygen therapy (O2-HFN)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization for children under one year of age
      and, caused by respiratory viruses. Although several medications and interventions studied
      for bronchiolitis treatment, hydration and oxygenation are the main treatments. High-flow
      nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC-O2) has been widely used to provide respiratory support in
      children with acute respiratory diseases. Patients had earlier improvement with HFNC-O2
      treatment to decrease the respiratory rate and respiratory effort compared to patients with
      standard low-flow oxygen (sLF-O2).

      HFNC-O2 therapy reduced more effective in heart rate, respiratory effort and length of
      supportive oxygen treatment compared to patients with standard low-flow therapy. However, the
      length of hospital stay and feeding ability had better consequences in patients with moderate
      and severe bronchiolitis treated with HFNC-O2.

      Another published study shows that in infants with acute bronchiolitis which required oxygen
      therapy was not found a significant difference between HFNC-O2 and sLF-O2, in terms of the
      length of supportive oxygen and hospitalization, and admission to the pediatric intensive
      care unit (PICU). HFNC-O2 therapy was more efficient than sLF-O2 and reduced the rate of
      intubation/invasive ventilation in acute severe bronchiolitis management. Despite these
      beneficial effects of HFNC-O2, it was not recommended by international guidelines yet.
      However, well designed, prospective randomized controlled trials are still needed to use this
      therapy in the wards.
