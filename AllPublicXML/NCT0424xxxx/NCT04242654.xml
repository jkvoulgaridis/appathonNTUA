  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing heart rate measurement by Doppler
      ultrasound or auscultation with a stethoscope in newborn infants who require stabilization or
      resuscitation immediately after birth. Enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to have
      their heart rate (HR) obtained by stethoscope (ST) or by Doppler ultrasound (DO). Neonates
      will be resuscitated in accordance with the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines.

    <textblock>
      Obtaining a baby's heart rate (HR) is an important part of neonatal resuscitation in the
      delivery room and helps the medical team decide how to treat the baby. When babies do not
      breathe well on their own, the medical team places electrocardiogram (ECG) leads on the
      baby's chest to obtain an accurate HR rapidly that can be seen by the entire team. Before the
      ECG leads are placed on the baby's chest, the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines
      suggest that medical team members listen to the baby's HR using a stethoscope for 6 seconds.
      However, it can take longer than 6 seconds for medical team members to obtain a HR which can
      delay a baby's care. The purpose of this study is to determine if Doppler ultrasound is a
      useful, alternative tool, aside from a stethoscope, that can be used to quickly obtain a
      baby's HR, particularly in high-risk babies. The primary objective will be the time that it
      takes to obtain a baby's HR by Doppler ultrasound as compared to listening to a baby's HR
      with a stethoscope. With this study, the investigators will be able to understand if Doppler
      ultrasound is a useful tool in the resuscitation of babies who are high risk.
