    <textblock>
      When using the rolled ring of a sterile glove as a loop drain in incision and loop drainage,
      is it superior to incision and drainage for treatment of a cutaneous abscess in 18 to 65
      year-old patients presenting to the Emergency Department, Family Health Clinic, Family
      Medicine Residency Clinic, or Internal Medicine Clinic?

      Hypothesis: When treating a cutaneous abscess, incision and loop drainage utilizing the
      rolled ring of a sterile glove as a loop drain is superior to the standard (incision and
      drainage) yielding a treatment failure rate of 1% at seven to ten days.

      Practicing medicine in an austere environment is fraught with challenges. One primary
      challenge is that clinicians will frequently be practicing without the supplies needed for
      specific indicated purpose. For treatment of a cutaneous abscess, sterile gloves are readily
      available whether at home or when deployed. It can be much more difficult to come across a
      penrose or vessel loop. In addition, follow up for wound repacking and reassessment is a
      struggle. Patients may have to move from location to location or have work hours that make it
      difficult to return to the clinic. The loop technique utilizing the rolled ring of a sterile
      glove solves both of these problems. Sterile gloves are always available and the Loop
      technique requires little to no follow up. Additional benefits include: subjects may
      experience less pain, improved cosmesis, faster healing, and decreased complication rates
      with incision and loop drainage utilizing the rolled ring of a sterile glove compared to
      traditional incision and drainage.

    <description>A record review will be performed to identify patients that had to return to the Emergency Department up to 30 days after the procedure due to complications. Attempts will be made to contact patients who fail to follow up. If unable to contact, a record review will be conducted in attempt to ascertain abscess status. If these measures are unsuccessful, patient treatment will be considered a success.
Record Review: Treatment failure will be defined as need for repeat drainage, intravenous antibiotic, hospitalization or surgical treatment within 7 days.</description>
