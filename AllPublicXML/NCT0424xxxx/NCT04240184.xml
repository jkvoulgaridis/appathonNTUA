      BACKGROUND:

      Musculoskeletal disorders, and in particular low-back pain (LBP), are common among blue
      collar workers. In the work environment, both physical- and psychosocial risk factors exist.
      Working in warehouses in Denmark involve large quantities of occupational lifting, high work
      pace and a low degree of influence at work. This study investigates both acute and long-term
      associations between physical- and psychosocial work environmental factors and risk of LBP in
      warehouse workers. The specific study aims are to investigate 1) exposure-response
      associations between quantity of occupational lifting and short-term (day-to-day) changes in
      LBP, 2) the influence of accumulated workdays and rest days during a working week on LBP, 3)
      long-term association between occupational lifting exposure and LBP when assessed over 1
      year, and 4) the role of psychological and social factors on the above associations.

      METHODS:

      The present study is designed as a 1-year prospective cohort study that will examine
      full-time warehouse workers from up to five retail chains in Denmark. Study aims 1 and 2 will
      be addressed using objective data based on company records with information on weight of all
      the goods handled by each warehouse worker during every single workday for 3 weeks. During
      this period, each worker will reply to text messages received before and after every workday
      (also on days off work) in which study participants will score their pain in the low back,
      bodily fatigue and perceived mental stress (scale 0-10). Long-term pain development is
      assessed using questionnaire surveys before and after 1 year. Further, pressure pain
      threshold (PPT) will be measured for selected trunk extensor muscles in approximately 50
      workers using algometry along with measurements of maximal trunk extensor strength.
      Associations are modelled using linear mixed models with repeated measures between variables
      and LBP controlled for relevant confounders.

      DISCUSSION:

      This study provides knowledge about the acute and long-term associations between physical-
      and psychosocial work environmental factors and LBP. The obtained data will have the
      potential to provide recommendations on improved design of the working week to minimize the
      risk of LBP among warehouse workers, and may potentially enable to identify a reasonable
      maximum lifting threshold per day (ton lifted/day).

        Enrolled study participants will receive a baseline questionnaire by e-mail that will
        address various aspects of physical-, psychological and social work environment and health.
        The questionnaire will also comprise an invitation to participate in a text message survey.
        Participants recruited for the text message survey will receive a SMS text message before
        and after every workday for 3 full weeks (21 days) to rate the magnitude of pain in their
        low back, and to score their current level of perceived physical fatigue and mental stress.
        During the same 3-week study period, section leaders at the warehouses will provide company
        records about the workload of each participating warehouse worker (goods handled by each
        worker, weight of the goods) along with a working schedule for each worker. One year after
        responding to the baseline questionnaire, the participant will be receiving a follow-up
        questionnaire
