  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients seen at the Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease will be asked to provide their
      written informed consent (authorization) to allow their identifiable medical record
      information related to their Inflammatory Bowel Disease to be placed in Center's Research
      Registry for the purpose of facilitating retrospective research studies directed at
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the identification and recruitment of potential, eligible
      subjects for participation in future research studies involving Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

      Information obtained from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Registry will allow a better
      classification of disease and factors that influence the natural course of disease; which may
      lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and may permit the development of
      better therapies and the potential for preventive therapies.
