      To define a target value of AUC MPA to improve the modified Rodnan score and / or respiratory
      impairment (DLCO or FVC) at one year in patients receiving MMF for the treatment of diffuse
      cutaneous or interstitial lung damage of systemic sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the treatment of autoimmune diseases, MMF is almost always prescribed at a fixed dose,
      regardless of AUC, or based on the target of AUC determined for organ transplantation. One
      study looked at determining an &quot;effective&quot; AUC threshold in systemic lupus erythematosus,
      which appears to be 35mg / h / l. This was also done for ANCA vasculitis.

      We therefore conducted this study to determine a correlation between AUC MPA and the
      effectiveness of MMF in systemic sclerosis.

      Prospective, observational, open study.

      Main objective: define a target value of AUC MPA to improve the modified Rodnan score and /
      or respiratory impairment (DLCO or FVC) at one year in patients receiving MMF for the
      treatment of diffuse skin involvement or pulmonary function in systemic sclerosis.

      The main endpoint will be evaluated on the evolution of the modified Rodnan score at 1 year
      after the initiation of MMF and / or the evolution of FVC and DLCO at 1 year after the
      initiation of MMF.

    <description>Modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) : min 0 max 51. A diminution in the mRSS of more than 25% from the initial value was considered as improved. On the contrary, an increase in the mRSS over 25% was considered as deteriorated. All other variations of mRSS were classified as stable. Minimal clinically important difference was also tested (worsening of mRSS ≥ 4.7).</description>
