      The main goal of this study is assess the effectiveness of a PtDA for patients with hip
      osteoarthritis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a health condition sensitive to patient's preferences and
      values regarding the benefits and risks of the different treatment options. In this sense,
      patient decision aids (PtDA) can play an important role in helping patients to incorporate
      their values, needs and preferences into the decision-making process, thus improving
      Person-Centred Care (PCC). Previous research has focused almost exclusively on knee OA, and
      therefore the aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a PtDA for
      patients with hip OA.

      Methods: The general design consists of two phases: 1) design a web-based PtDA for patients
      with hip OA, following the recommended procedures: systematic review of safety/effectiveness
      of treatments, and an iterative process of development with the help of an Advisory Committee
      composed of health professionals and patients; 2) To evaluate the impact of the PtDA on hip
      OA patients' decision-making process related with their treatment. For that aim, a
      multicenter randomized controlled trial will be carried out with 124 patients with hip OA in
      Tenerife (Spain) comparing intervention or usual care.

      Discussion: PtDAs have been recommended as a useful and effective resource for improving PCC
      in many health conditions. The intervention is intended to empower patients by fostering
      their active participation during the decision-making process about their treatment, and by
      ensuring they make informed decisions congruent with their values and preferences. This study
      will contribute to the scientific knowledge about effectiveness of PtDAs in hip OA, in order
      to improve the quality of health care offered to these patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict regarding the treatment for Hip Osteoarthritis, measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>DCS is a 16-item self-reported scale widely used in PtDA research. It is composed of five subscales: uninformed, values, support, uncertainty and effectiveness. This is a 0-100 point scale, where a high score means more decisional conflict.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of the disease and treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item scale will be udes to assess patients' knowledge of the disease and treatments</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Values about characteristics of treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to rate in a 0-10 scale the importance they attribute to different characteristics of treatment: mode of administration, improvement in pain and function, risk of mild and serious adverse effects, time until symptoms' improvement, duration of benefits, and in the case of arthroplasty, period of rehabilitation and risk of needing surgery revision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked the treatment they prefer: physiotherapy, medication, intra-articular injections, arthroplasty, not sure</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention to undergo the preferred treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with one item ranging 0 (not sure) to 5 (completely sure)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concordance between values and intention to undergo arthroplasty vs. conservative treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Binary variable (yes/no) derived from the association between values and intention to undergo arthroplasty (see statistical analysis).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision quality about arthroplasty</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Binary variable (yes/no) defined as a combination of adequate knowledge (≥60% of correct responses) and concordance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the decision making process scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Satisfaction with Decision Scale (SWD) is a validated 12-item scale measuring participants' satisfaction with healthcare decision making. The SWD uses a 5-point Likert scale where 0 is &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 4 is &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; This is a 0-100 point scale, where a high score means more satisfaction with the decision making process.</description>
