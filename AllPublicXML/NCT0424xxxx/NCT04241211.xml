  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical therapy that can lower PJK rates are also being sought. Teriparatide (TP), a
      recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH 1-34), is a bone forming agent mainly used to
      treat osteoporotic patients with high risk of osteoporotic fracture. There has been reports
      suggesting protective effect of prophylactic TP to osteoporotic patients receiving ASD
      surgery concerning PJK.6 Although it had limitations of small sample size and surgical
      selection bias owing to study design being retrospective. We hypothesized prophylactic TP
      would act as to reduce the incidence of PJK and therefore reduce PJF and necessity of
      revision surgeries in patients after ASD correction surgery. Our study can consolidate the
      beneficial effect of prophylactic TP to patients receiving ASD surgery by reducing the
      incidence of PJK.
