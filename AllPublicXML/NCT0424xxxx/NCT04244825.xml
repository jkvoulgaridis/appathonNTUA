          1. Recent (less than 6 weeks) significant wound (in the opinion of the Investigator), or
             presence of an ongoing non-healing skin wound or ulcer.

          2. Presence of any underlying physical or psychological medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would make it unlikely that the subject will complete the
             study per protocol.

          3. Active infection (diagnosed or suspected) or history of recurrent infections,
             including but is not limited to, bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, urinary tract
             infection, cellulitis or chronic ongoing infectious disease within 4 weeks prior to
             first dose of study drug. Note: Rescreening will be permitted after 28 days if an
             infection leads to screening failure.

          4. Active malignancy and/or history of malignancy in the past 5 years, except for
             non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the breast that has been successfully
             treated, carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been successfully treated, early
             stage, untreated prostate cancer, or prostate cancer with completion of treatment &gt;2
             years prior to Screening.

          5. Extensive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (where extent of emphysema &gt;extent of
             fibrosis on computerised tomography (CT) scan or FEV1: FVC ratio &lt;0.65).

          6. Other explanation for lung fibrosis, including but not limited to radiation,
             sarcoidosis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, collagen vascular disease,
             hypersensitivity pneumonitis, etc.

          7. IPF exacerbation within last 60 days.

          8. A history or current evidence of any medical condition, therapy, or laboratory
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subjects'
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subjects to participate, in the opinion of the Investigator.

             Diagnostic Assessments

          9. Positivity for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody (HIV-1 and/or HIV-2) and/or
             HIV-1 p24 antigen.

             cannot discontinue the anticoagulants within 2 days of Day (-1) bronchoscopy will be
             excluded.

         17. Treatment with any anti-fibrotic therapy (pirfenidone or nintedanib) within 30 days of
