      Lay Summary Older adults who are prefrail (an intermediate, potentially reversible stage
      between robustness and frailty) with early symptoms of cognitive impairment are a segment of
      the population that have hitherto remained &quot;silent&quot; and are currently not targets for
      screening and intervention. These individuals require early identification for preventive
      interventions to reduce disability, dependency and improve quality of life. To date, there is
      still no accepted definition of individuals upstream in the spectrum of physical frailty and
      cognitive impairment. Determining the prevalence and predictive ability of various
      definitions of co-existent frailty and cognitive impairment could identify older adults at
      greatest risk of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, the researchers aim to examine and
      compare (1) the prevalence of cognitive-prefrailty, prefrailty (IANA/IAGG consensus
      definition) and MCR syndromes, (2) the incidence and predictive ability of these three
      syndromes for adverse health outcomes including cognitive impairment and decline, dementia,
      physical functional impairment and decline, falls, hospitalization and mortality in older
      Quebec community dwellers.

      Scientific Summary

      Background Cognitive frailty is the simultaneous presence of both physical frailty and
      cognitive impairment, excluding concurrent dementia. This condition confers a greater risk of
      incident cognitive impairment and decline, dementia, falls and disabilities compared to
      either condition alone. Current definitions of co-existent frailty and cognitive impairment
      exist, including the International Academy on Nutrition and Aging (IANA) and the
      International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics (IAGG) consensus for cognitive
      frailty. There is also an analogous construct known as the motoric cognitive risk syndrome
      (MCR) associating slow gait speed and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). Current
      operational criteria identify individuals later in the trajectory of frailty and cognitive
      decline, which may be too late for effective interventions. The researchers propose to define
      a new and early condition in the spectrum of Cognitive frailty known as
      &quot;cognitive-prefrailty&quot;, which is a combination of prefrailty stage and SCI.

      Overall objective This study aims to determine and compare (1) the prevalence of
      cognitive-prefrailty, cognitive frailty (IANA/IAGG consensus definition) and MCR syndromes,
      (2) the incidence and predictive ability of these three syndromes for adverse health outcomes
      including cognitive impairment and decline, dementia, physical functional impairment and
      decline, falls, hospitalization and mortality in older community dwellers.

      Methods This study will use the database of the &quot;Nutrition as a determinant of successful
      aging: The Quebec longitudinal study&quot; (NuAge) study, which is a population-based
      observational cohort hat recruited healthy community-dwellers with age ranged from 67 to 84
      years (51.8% women) between November 2003 and June 2005, and followed them during 4 years.
      Cognitive-prefrailty, prefrailty and MCR will be defined using information collected at the
      baseline assessment. Incident adverse health outcomes including cognitive impairment and
      decline, dementia, physical functional impairment and decline, falls, hospitalization and
      mortality have been recorded during the 4-years follow-up period.

      Anticipated results Prefrailty (an intermediate and potentially reversible stage between
      robust and frailty) and SCI occur upstream in the continuum of frailty and cognitive decline
      and hence constitute more suitable targets for screening and early intervention in older
      adults.

    <description>Cognitive status has been measured using the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS)17 in the NuAge study. The 3MS test has a score range of 1-100.

    <description>A sex-specific global measure of physical performance will be computed as the sum of scores in four tests: standing balance, walking speed (normal and fast), chair stands, and timed &quot;Up &amp; Go&quot; according to a slightly modified method proposed by Guralnik and colleagues.18 The validity of this global measure has been previously reported in this population.19 Four levels of physical performance will be created for each of the five tests. A score from 1 (slowest) to 4 (fastest) is assigned according to the quartile of time needed to carry out the test. With the exception of standing balance, the lowest quartile indicates the best (shorter duration) score. The reverse is true with respect to standing balance. A score of 0 was assigned to those who could not do or did not complete the test because they felt unable to do so. Possible scores range from 0 (worst) to 20 (best).</description>

    <description>This is defined as a co-existing prefrailty using the Fried criteria. Frailty defined by the CHS index as proposed by Fried et al. will be identified by the presence of ≥ 3 of the following 5 components: 1) Shrinking as identified by an unintentional weight loss of ≥ 5% between two assessments, 2) Weakness as identified by a maximal grip strength in the lowest quintile stratified by body mass index quartile; 3) Poor energy as identified by an answer of &quot;no&quot; to the question &quot;Do you feel full of energy?&quot; from the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale; 4) Slowness as identified by an average walk speed in the lowest quintile stratified by median standing height, and 5) Low physical activity level as identified by a PASE score in the lowest quintile. Participants with none of the above components will be considered to be vigorous and those with 1 or 2 components will be considered to be in a prefrail stage.</description>

    <description>A combination of prefrailty stage using Fried criteria and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI).
The IANA/IAGG consensus defines cognitive frailty as CDR = 0.5 and frailty by the Fried criteria.SCI will be defined using a proxy for subjective cognitive complaint (i.e. memory complaint) and following the procedure used in previous multicenter prevalence studies on MCR syndrome. Memory complaint used to define MCR syndrome was based on standardized memory loss question on the 15-item or 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; &quot;Do you feel you have more problems with memory than most?&quot;). Memory complaint in our study will be elicited from this item of 30-item GDS.</description>

    <description>The diagnosis of MCR syndrome will be made following the criteria of Verghese et al. 5: a combination of subjective cognitive complaint, in particular of memory complaint, with the presence of an objective slow gait and the absence of dementia or mobility disability. MCR syndrome will be defined at baseline assessment and each year of follow-up period. Slow gait speed will be defined as gait speed that is one standard deviation (SD) or more below age-and sex-appropriate mean values established in the present cohort like in previous studies. The mean value and SD of female and male will be determined separately. Gait speed was determined from the 3-meter walking test using the best time of the two trials recorded and expressed as meters per second.</description>

    <description>The NuAge study has been designed to investigate nutrition as a determinant of successful aging in older men and women in Quebec. This study is based on a population-based observational cohort design that initially recruited healthy community-dwellers with age ranged from 67 to 82 years (51.8% women) between January 2004 and April 2005. All participants lived in the areas of Montreal, Laval, and Sherbrooke in the Province of Quebec, Canada. After recruitment, they have been followed for 3 years with one clinical follow-up assessment each year (i.e.; 4 data collection time). A previous analysis performed on the NuAge study database has shown a significant decline of physical and cognitive performances with time (respectively an average of 10% and 2%), participants with lower physical performance showing lower cognitive performance.</description>
