  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether drug-coated balloon (DCB) compared to
      conventional balloon angioplasty for side branch after provisional stenting will lead to
      lower rates of the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) at 12 months. The
      individual components of MACE include cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target
      lesion revascularization (TLR). True bifurcation lesions were defined according to Medina
      classification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized-controlled, single blind, superiority trial
      that will include 25 international sites. The investigators aim to enroll 784 subjects with
      true coronary bifurcation lesions in native coronary arterial segments.

      All patients with true coronary bifurcation lesions suitable for angioplasty will undergo 1:1
      randomization either to PS (provisional stenting)-DCB or PS-NCB (noncompliant balloon) group
      using a randomization schedule blocked by site.

      All subjects will be screened according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria
      per protocol and will further undergo angiography after successful stenting of the main
      vessel with ostium side branch visually estimated stenosis ≥70%. Data and images will be
      collected during the index procedure, during re-intervention in the case of clinically driven
      revascularization, and at the predefined 12-month clinical follow-up visit. All subjects will
      also undergo angiographic follow-up at 13 months.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will undergo 1:1 randomization to either PS-DCB which will be the treatment group or PS-NCB which will be the control group based on an online Clinical Research Data Management Platform provided by King Yee, Beijing CN. The initiation of the trial is defined as the time of randomization. After study subjects' enrollment and randomization, the study intervention will take place immediately. The follow-up visits for the primary endpoint are scheduled at 1, 6, and 12 months after the index procedure. Angiographic follow-up is scheduled at 13 months.</intervention_model_description>

NC balloon dilating ostial side branch (SB) (1:1 ratio).
DCB dilating SB. Specifically, the DCB, which had to be 2-3 mm longer on each side than the predilatation balloon, was inflated at nominal pressure for 30~ 60 s. The ratio of the DCB diameter to the nominal diameter of the SB was recommended to be between 0.8 and 1.0. DCB should be delivered to the lesion within 2 min after entering human body.
