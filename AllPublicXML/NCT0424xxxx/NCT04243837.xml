  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 is a multiple ascending dose trial in healthy volunteers (HV) of LYT-100 to determine
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile under fed conditions.

      Part 2 is a single dose safety, tolerability, and PK trial in HV of LYT-100 under fasted
      conditions.

      Part 3 is a trial of up to 6-months duration for safety, tolerability, PK, biomarkers and
      exploratory clinical assessments in breast carcinoma patients with secondary lymphoedema

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1: This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose
      design to assess the safety, tolerability and PK profile of multiple doses of LYT-100
      administered under fed conditions at steady state in healthy participants. Up to 4 dosing
      cohorts are planned.

      Part 2: The dose level immediately below the maximally tolerated dose in Part 1 will be used
      in Part 2. Following a minimum 7-day washout of the cohort that received this dose, subjects
      in Part 2 will be administered a single dose of their assigned treatment under fasting
      conditions to permit a comparison of the rate and extent of absorption of LYT-100 under
      fasting conditions to the equivalent dose in a prior fed cohort.

      Part 3: Once the optimal dose and regimen is determined with or without food, Part 3 will
      follow with an open-label, single treatment arm to assess the safety, tolerability, PK,
      biomarkers and effect on exploratory clinical endpoints of LYT-100 over a period of up to
      6-months of dosing in breast carcinoma patients with secondary lymphoedema following sentinel
      lymph node biopsy and/or axillary node dissection, with or without radiation.
