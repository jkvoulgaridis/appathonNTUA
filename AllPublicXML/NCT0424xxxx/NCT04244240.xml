  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder. Symptoms include acute and chronic
      complications. Due to progress in SCD care, patients with SCD are living longer than before
      and we focus more attention in chronic complications.

      Children with SCD experience worse cognitive functions than healthy children, and fewer is
      known about cognitive functions in adults. Studies suggest lower cognitive performance in
      SCD, mostly in executive functions and processing speed, but the biological and anatomical
      substrates of cognitive decline are not yet well established in SCD. Often times, cognitive
      impairments and cerebral disorders are not diagnosed and treated in adults with SCD.

      The main objective of this study is to propose a deep neuropsychological assessment in adults
      with SCD and cognitive complaints and to highlight links between cognitive functions and
      clinical, biological and neuroradiological markers. The hypothesis of this study is that
      cognitive functions are associated with severity of the SCD, with bood abnormalities, with
      MRI markers and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) markers of cerebrovascular disease. The secondary
      objective of this study is to validate a brief cognitive assessment tool (BEARNI tool) in
      adults with SCD.

      This study is an observational cross-sectional study that will enroll adults with SCD and
      cognitive complaint.

    <description>Cognitive performance will be evaluated by a large neuropsychological assessment. The cognitive score will be interpreted as raw scores, z-score adjusted for level of education, age, and sex, according to the tests and binarized into two categories (normal versus pathological performances)</description>

    <description>BEARNI is brief screening tool initially validated for Alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments (Ritz et al., 2015). BEARNI tool detect impairment in visuospatial abilities, executive functions, verbal episodic memory, and verbal working memory.
The score of the test could be expressed as a global score, and also as subscores corresponding to each cognitive subtest. Normative data are available.</description>
