  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to assess the different effect on fat mass between fasting (intervention)
      group and not fasting (control) group after 8 weeks 5:2 intermittent fasting (IF) among obese
      male student aged 18-25. Female students are excluded because if they do any restriction
      intake during their menstruation period which is a lot of blood lost, it will be a risk for
      them.

      This study is designed as non-blinding randomized control trial. Subject who adhere with less
      than 85 percent fasting (14 out of 16) will be dropped out from this study. Total sample in
      this study is 62 students which are 31 students for each group.

    <textblock>
      5:2 intermittent fasting (IF) is eating pattern in which no or few calories are consumed for
      13 hours (for 5 am to 6 pm) done in two non-consecutive days days per week, followed by ad
      libitum intake on the remaining days, without any requirement of water restriction.

      Subjects will be distributed to each group by using randomization block of four.

      This study will use 8 forms consist of; informed consent, subject selection form,
      re-anthropometric measurement form, questionnaire, semi quantitative food frequency
      questionnaire (SQ-FFQ), international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ), food record
      book, and control and evaluation form. While the tolls are consist of food photograph book
      (to help in filling the food record book), body height scale, and bio-electrical impedance
      analysis (BIA) Seca medical body composition analyzer (mBCA) 515/514 (to measure body
      composition).
