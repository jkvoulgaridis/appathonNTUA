  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microorganisms in the human body (such as virus, bacteria, fungus) may have an important role
      in breast cancer side effects. In this study, microorganisms will be analyzed to determine
      which, if any,are present. It will then be determined if side effects from breast radiation
      are associated with these microorganisms. Understanding the association of microorganisms
      with side effects will allow the study team to look at strategies to reduce side effects for
      patients undergoing radiation to the breast.

      This study will prospectively enroll 50 participants with with biopsy proven Ductal carcinoma
      in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer 18 years of age or older, undergoing breast
      conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy at Cleveland Clinic.

      Each participant will have a post-surgery pre-radiotherapy stool and breast skin sample
      obtained, complete a medical record review for clinical data, and have complete an
      interview/questionnaire in order to learn about potential risk factors which will be included
      in the data collection form. Included information will include Stage (T, N, M, composite),
      receipt of chemotherapy, radiation fields and dose, BMI, hypertension (HTN), Diabetes
      Mellitus (DM), smoking status, history of breast infection yes/no (Data Collection Form).

      Breast skin and GI samples from participants with breast cancer following breast conserving
      surgery will be collected. These samples will then be analyzed using DNA extraction and 16S
      rRNA gene sequencing with an in-house bioinformatics group. Data will be used to define the
      microbiome profile for this subset of breast cancer patients.
