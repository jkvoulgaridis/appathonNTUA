      The hypothesis is to be tested that eating carbohydrate-reduced bread over three months leads
      to a significant weight difference compared to conventional, carbohydrate-rich bread.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrate reduction is an important element for weight loss or can also be used to keep
      weight constant. Since the majority of the carbohydrates consumed daily in industrialized
      countries come from bread and rolls, the present study will examine the effect of two
      different types of bread on the weight development of overweight bread consumers. The two
      types of bread differ in their carbohydrate content and the hypothesis is to be tested that
      eating carbohydrate-reduced bread over three months leads to a significant weight difference
      compared to conventional, carbohydrate-rich bread. The comparison of the two types of bread
      is carried out triple blinded. During two visits (before and after the bread consumption
      phase), the health status is determined with physical parameters and laboratory parameters
      from a blood test. The primary endpoint is body weight. Overall, this study will for the
      first time allow extensive statements to be made on the health value of the three-month
      consumption of two different types of bread.
