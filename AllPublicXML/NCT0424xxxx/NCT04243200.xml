  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness the &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; intervention on people
      with diabetes experiencing hypoglycaemia (or &quot;hypo&quot;, meaning low blood sugar). The
      intervention should help prevent recurrence of &quot;hypos&quot;, improve patients' future health,
      reduce calls to ambulance services and thus reduce NHS pressures and costs.

      Hypoglycaemia affects increasing numbers of people with diabetes. It is a side effect of
      treatment with insulin or certain tablets, where blood glucose (sugar) falls causing the
      brain to malfunction. In mild cases this can lead to sweating, drowsiness and confusion; in
      more severe cases, coma can occur needing medical assistance for recovery, and if prolonged
      can be fatal. It results in 1% of calls to ambulance services.

      The &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; intervention involves ambulance staff providing treatment to
      patients experiencing hypos and advising them to access follow-up care by their GP/specialist
      diabetes team. This is backed up by giving patients a &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; information
      booklet which they can read when they recover.

      Universities of Lincoln and Leicester are working with East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS
      Trust and patient groups on this study. The &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; intervention has now
      been implemented by ambulance services in Leicester, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire,
      Derbyshire and Lincolnshire from October 2018-May 2019.

      The investigators will analyse data from the ambulance services before, during and after the
      introduction of the 'Hypos can strike twice' intervention to evaluate the effect of the
      intervention on repeat ambulance calls and attendances for hypoglycaemia and the costs and
      consequences of implementing it. The investigators will also interview/survey ambulance staff
      who provided the intervention and patients who received it, to understand how and why it
      works (or does not) and how, if it works, it could be scaled up over a larger geographical
      area. The duration of this study is 1 year.

      Research question

      What is the effect on repeat ambulance calls and attendances for hypoglycaemia and what are
      the costs and consequences of implementing the 'Hypo's can strike twice' intervention to
      patients with diabetes and hypoglycaemia attended by East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS
      Trust in the East Midlands region of the UK?

      Background

      Severe hypoglycaemia (defined as cognitive impairment severe enough to require external
      assistance for recovery) frequently requires an ambulance resulting in Emergency Department
      attendance or hospital admission. Severe hypoglycaemia constitutes around 1% of 1.7 million
      emergency ambulance calls in England and Scotland resulting in 100 thousand paramedic
      attendances and estimated costs in England of Â£13.6 million annually. Hypoglycaemia is
      associated with adverse consequences including higher mortality, morbidity and health service
      costs due to hospital attendance/admission. It is also frightening for both patients and
      relatives and impairs quality of life and productivity, leading to poor long term control.

      Aims and objectives

      Aim: To evaluate the effect of implementing the 'Hypo's can strike twice' intervention to
      patients with diabetes and hypoglycaemia attended by East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS
      Trust in the East Midlands region. &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; is a complex intervention
      involving ambulance staff providing treatment and advice to people who have had a
      hypoglycaemic attack to access follow-up care by the GP or specialist diabetes team as
      detailed in national ambulance (JRCALC) clinical guidelines supported by the provision of a
      &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; booklet which the patient can read when they are fully recovered
      from the cognitive and other effects of the hypoglycaemic episode.

      Objectives

      To investigate the effect of implementing the 'Hypo's can strike twice' on:

        1. Repeat ambulance calls and attendances for hypoglycaemia

        2. Recorded referrals to an appropriate healthcare professional (e.g. GP, nurse).

        3. Completed care bundle for hypoglycaemia (proportion of patients with all of blood
           glucose recorded before treatment, blood glucose recorded after treatment and treatment
           given for hypoglycaemia.

        4. Costs of implementation 'Hypo's can strike twice' intervention vs costs of health
           service resource use.

        5. To conduct a process evaluation to explore how 'Hypo's can strike twice' exerts its
           effects and can be scaled up if effective by understanding implementation, mechanisms of
           impact, and contextual factors using interviews and surveys

      Methods

      Non-randomised stepped wedge design with mixed-methods process evaluation.

    <description>For our analyses of repeat ambulance calls and costs we will use routine anonymised data from routine call-and-dispatch and clinical records data from EMAS for 12 months before the intervention was first introduced (September 2017) to at least 6 months after the final step of the introduction in April 2019, i.e. October 2019. This is likely to involve the analysis of an estimated 11916 cases so that we can implement a stepped wedge (non-randomised control)design .</description>
