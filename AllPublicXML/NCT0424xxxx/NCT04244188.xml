  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total endovascular repair of the aortic arch represents a promising option for patients
      ineligible to open surgery. Custom-made design of stent-grafts (SG), such as the Terumo
      Aortic® RelayBranch device (DB), requires complex preoperative measures. Accurate SG
      deployment is required to avoid intraoperative or postoperative complications, which is
      extremely challenging in the aortic arch. In that context, our aim is to develop a
      computational tool able to predict SG deployment in such highly complex situations. Four
      patient-specific cases will be performed with complete deployment of the DB and its bridging
      stents in aneurysmal aortic arch. Deviations of our simulation predictions from actual stent
      positions will be estimated based on post-operative scan and a sensitivity analysis will be
      performed to assess the effects of material parameters. If good agreement between simulation
      and reality is obtained, numerical simulations will show their ability to successfully
      predict the DB deployment in complex anatomy. The results will emphasize the potential of
      computational simulations to assist practitioners in planning and performing complex and
      secure interventions.

      The process of numerical simulation of double-branched device in aortic arch aneurysm
      involves: (i) aortic arch segmentation with data from the preoperative CT-scan (ii) numerical
      modeling of the actual stentgraft used to treat the patient (iii) simulation of stentgraft
      deployment in aortic arch (iv) validation of simulation results based on post-operative CT
      scan images The goal of this study is to develop a numerical model of stentgraft deployment
      able to predict the actual deployement of the double branched device in aortic arch aneurysm.
