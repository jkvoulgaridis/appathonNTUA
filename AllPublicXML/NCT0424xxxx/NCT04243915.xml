  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is a common musculoskeletal condition affects the general population.
      Low back pain constitutes a major burden to health care system and society. Several authors
      have found that the deep abdominal muscles and multifidus are affected in low back pain. Dry
      needling has shown improve the cross-sectional area of the multifidus. Percutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation has shown reduce pain in several conditions. There are not
      studies that had investigated the impact of percutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation
      (PNMES) in the deep muscles in patients with chronic low back pain.

      Hypothesis: PNMES in the multifidus muscle plus motor control exercise program in patients
      with chronic low back pain is better than sham PNMES plus exercise and transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) plus exercise

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, using percutaneous neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation (PNMES). PNMES is technique to provide a transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation current throughout needling filaments place close to the nerve.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the short, medium and
      long-term of PNMES on muscle activation (increased cross-sectional area in activation) and
      the function of multifidus and abdominal transverse muscle in patients with chronic low back
      pain with random assignment to four treatments: PENS plus motor control exercise program or
      Sham PNMES (introducing the needle) plus motor control exercise program or Transcutaneous
      Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES
      (without inserting the needle) plus motor control exercise program.

      Aim #2: The secondary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the short, medium and
      long-term of PNMES on pain as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), chronic Pain Grade
      Questionnaire, pressure pain threshold (PPT), area and distribution of pain, conditioned pain
      modulation and temporal summation in patients with chronic low back pain with random
      assignment to four treatments: PNMES plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES
      (introducing the needle) plus motor control exercise program or Transcutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation (TENS) plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES (without inserting
      the needle) plus motor control exercise program.

      Aim #3: To compare the effect of the short, medium and long-term of PNMES on disability as
      measured by Oswestry Disability Index, strength and quality of life with random assignment to
      four treatments: PENS plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES (introducing the
      needle) plus motor control exercise program or Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation
      (TENS) plus motor control exercise program or Sham PNMES (without inserting the needle) plus
      motor control exercise program.

      Aim #4: To estimate the immediate effects of the PNMES technique after the first session.

      Aim #5: To determine if psychological factors (anxiety, depression, kinesiophobia and
      catastrophism) change with any of the treatments and if is related with the primary and
      secondary outcomes.

      Aim #6: To evaluate the change perceived by the patient measured with Global Rating of Change
      Scale (GROC).

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index or Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks from baseline, 18 weeks from baseline and 30 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a validated, self-reported instrument used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain.
The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

    <description>The SF-12 is a validated, health-related quality-of-life questionnaire consisting of twelve questions that measure eight health domains to assess physical and mental health. Physical health-related domains include General Health (GH), Physical Functioning (PF), Role Physical (RP), and Body Pain (BP). Mental health-related scales include Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH). The instrument has been validated across a number of chronic diseases and conditions. The response options of the SF-12 v2 form Likert-type scales that evaluate intensity or frequency. The number of answer options ranges from three to six, depending on the item, and each question is given a value which is then transformed into a scale from 0 to 100.</description>
