  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a hematopoietic
      cell-based gene therapy for patients with Fanconi anemia, subtype A (FA-A).

      Hematopoietic stem cells from mobilized peripheral blood of patients with FA-A will be
      transduced ex vivo (outside the body) with a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene. After
      transduction, the corrected stem cells will be infused intravenously back to the patient with
      the goal of preventing bone marrow failure.

      This is a pediatric open-label Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a
      hematopoietic gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a
      lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene in subjects with FA-A.

      Enriched CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells will be transduced ex vivo with the therapeutic
      lentiviral vector and infused via intravenous infusion following transduction without any
      prior conditioning.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Fanconi anemia as diagnosed by chromosomal fragility assay of cultured lymphocytes in
             the presence of DEB or a similar DNA-crosslinking agent

          2. Patients of the complementation group FA-A

          3. Minimum age: 1 year and a minimum weight of 8 kg

          4. At least 30 CD34+ cells/μL are determined in one bone marrow (BM) aspiration within 3
             months prior to CD34+ cell collection OR (see subsequent criterion)

          5. If the number of CD34+ cells/ μL in BM is in the range of 10-29, peripheral blood (PB)
             parameters should meet two of the three following criteria:

               -  Hemoglobin: ≥11g/dL

               -  Neutrophils: ≥900 cells/μL

               -  Platelets: ≥60,000 cells/μL

          6. Provide informed consent in accordance with current legislation

          7. Women of childbearing age must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the baseline
             visit, and accept the use of an effective contraception method during participation in
             the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with an available and medically eligible HLA-identical sibling donor.

          2. Evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia, or cytogenetic abnormalities other
             than those reported as variant(s) of normal in BM aspirate analysis. This assessment
             should be made by valid studies conducted within the 3 months before the subject
             commences the stem cell mobilization/collection procedures of the clinical trial.

          3. Subjects with somatic mosaicism associated with stable or improved counts in all PB
             cell lineages. (If T-lymphocyte chromosomal fragility analysis indicates potential
             mosaicism, a medically significant decrease (≥1 NCI CTCAE grade) in at least one blood
             lineage over time must be documented to enable eligibility, as should &lt;5% resistance
             of bone marrow colony forming cells (CFCs) to 10nM MMC; whenever possible potential
             mosaicism should also be evaluated by gene sequencing of MMC-resistant CFCs).

          4. Lansky performance status ≤60%.

          5. Any concomitant disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Principal

             NCI.

          7. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 5.0 × ULN or

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 5.0 × ULN

             For subjects with bilirubin, ALT or AST above ULN, a workup to identify the etiology
             of liver abnormality should be conducted prior to confirmation of eligibility as
             stipulated in exclusion criterion 5, including evaluation of viral hepatitis, iron
             overload, drug injury or other causes.

          9. Renal dysfunction requiring either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

         10. Pulmonary dysfunction as defined by either:

               -  Need for supplemental oxygen during the prior 2 weeks in absence of acute
                  infection or

               -  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry &lt;90%.

         11. Evidence of active metastatic or locoregionally advanced malignancy for which survival
             is anticipated to be less than 3 years.
