    <description>PAE will be performed as an inpatient or outpatient procedure by interventional radiologists who are familiar with the procedure and according to established techniques. A unilateral femoral sheath is placed in the right common femoral artery under local anaesthesia. The prostatic arterial supply is identified by selective internal iliac arteriography. Prostatic arteries are selectively catheterised and embolised by use of 250-600 μm microspheres . PAE is performed bilaterally if possible and considered successful in the absence of the normal blush of the prostate and stasis of flow in the prostate arteries on angiography after embolisation.</description>
