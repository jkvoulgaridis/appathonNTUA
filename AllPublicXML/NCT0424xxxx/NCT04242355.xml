    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)
      on neural and behavioral facets of social cognition in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
      Participant visits will include a baseline assessment of neuropsychological, cognitive and
      behavioral function, and an EEG (electroencephalogram) and eye-tracking session to measure
      neural and visual attentional social response before and after administration of TMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Broad ranging social cognition difficulties are hallmark areas of impairment in autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD), and they are subserved by specific neural systems underpinning
      social perception and processing that are recognized to be atypical in ASD. Considering the
      neurodevelopmental nature of the disorder, and the recent findings regarding aberrant
      neuroplasticity in ASD, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) holds promise to
      directly modulate brain activity in these systems. The objective of this research proposal is
      to utilize a multimodal approach to provide a proof-of-concept for the ability of rTMS to (a)
      influence functioning in the brain systems involved in social ASD symptomatology and (b)
      modify associated social cognitive behaviors in adults with ASD. Toward achieving this
      objective, we propose to assess critical aspects of social cognition using the
      electroencephalogram (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPS), eye-tracking (ET), and
      behavioral tasks prior to and following a single rTMS session to provide preliminary insight
      into the potential of rTMS as a tool to modify social brain function in cognitively able
      adults with ASD.
