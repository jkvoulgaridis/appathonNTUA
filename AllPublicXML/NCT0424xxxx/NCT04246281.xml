  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare standard of care treatments for back pain to
      electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation is delivering small amounts of electricity to
      the nerves in your low back. This study will use a device called the SPRINT Peripheral Nerve
      Stimulation (PNS) System. The SPRINT PNS System was cleared by the FDA for up to 60 days of
      use in the back and/or extremities for the management of acute and chronic pain.

    <measure>Reduction in pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months after SOT</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using question 9 from the Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form. This question asks the subject to rate the degree to which their pain has interfered with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 is &quot;completely interferes&quot; within the last week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months after SOT</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The ODI asks subjects to rate how their back pain impacts ten components of everyday life. For each section, the answers correlate to scale which ranges from 0 to 5, where 0 is no disability and 5 is maximum disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life</measure>

    <description>Measured using the EQ-5D survey. The EQ-5D is a five-level scale. Each level is coded from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates no problems and 5 indicates extreme problems. The EQ-5D also includes a 0 to 100 scale for health status, where 0 indicates &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 indicates &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>
