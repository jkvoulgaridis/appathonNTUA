  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of an experimental protocol that combines advanced
      multi-modal imaging of the brain with clinical and behavioural scales to characterise the
      neural, behavioural, and clinical effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      for rehabilitation in PDOC

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC) have very limited therapeutic
      options, and they often show little to no progress over time. Here, the investigators will
      assess whether transcranial direct current stimulation can improve patients' responsiveness.
      The investigators will use a protocol designed to target specific brain networks that have
      been shown to play a key role in explaining the lack of voluntary responses in PDOC. The
      study will focus on characterising the mechanisms of action of tDCS and the bases for
      potential individual differences in responsiveness to the stimulation across participants.
      This feasibility study is the first step towards developing personalised tDCS interventions
      to restore external responsiveness in PDOC patients. Its results will inform the design of a
      future trial fully powered for characterising neural, behavioural, and clinical effects of
      tDCS in PDOC as well as the mechanisms underlying individual differences in responsiveness.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a double-blind randomised crossover feasibility study of tDCS in a small cohort of PDOC individuals. The study is divided into two streams to accommodate differences in the resources available across recruitment sites: 1. MRI stream, which will include MRI and electrophysiology assessments; this is available to patients receiving care at the Wellington Hospital in London only. 2. Bedside stream, which will include electrophysiology assessments only, available to patients in specialist units at NHS (National Health Service) and non-NHS sites</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>In the MRI stream all participants will receive anodal, cathodal, and sham (placebo) tDCS sessions in a randomised order. In the Bedside stream participants will receive active tDCS (either anodal or cathodal) and sham sessions also in a randomised order. A researcher not involved in data collection or analyses will programme the stimulator to deliver the specific polarity needed in each session in a double-blind manner. Sham tDCS will be delivered according to published guidelines: this mimics the physical sensations of active stimulation but does not have a neuromodulatory effect</masking_description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial direct current stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>tDCS alters neural excitability in a polarity-specific manner via a weak direct electric current delivered through electrodes placed on the scalp. There are 3 types of stimulation: anodal, cathodal, and sham. In anodal tDCS, the positive electrode is placed over the target brain area to increase neuronal excitability. In cathodal tDCS, the negative electrode is placed over the target brain area to decrease neuronal excitability. Sham tDCS emulates the physical sensations of active (anodal/cathodal) tDCS but current is only delivered for a short period of time and is not enough to cause any neuromodulations</description>
