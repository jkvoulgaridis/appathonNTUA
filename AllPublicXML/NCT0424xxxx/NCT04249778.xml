      This study will be the first trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin
      treatment in preventing readmissions/ER visits/urgent clinic visits, and death in patients
      with and without T2D after admission for heart failure. Treatment with SGLT2-i has been shown
      to reduce both heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in patients with established
      heart disease. However, the time of initiation of SGLT2-i therapy has not been evaluated in
      patients with HF. In addition, the impact of treatment on HF symptoms quality of life,
      resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus placebo will be
      evaluated. The results of this study have great potential to impact and facilitate care and
      to change current clinical guidelines in the management of patients with heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of both heart failure and type 2 diabetes (T2D) or prediabetes are reaching
      epidemic proportions globally and in the United States. More than 40% of patients with
      established heart failure (HF) have diabetes.

      This study will be the first trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin
      treatment in preventing readmissions/ER visits/urgent clinic visits, and death in patients
      with and without T2D after admission for heart failure. Treatment with SGLT2-i has been shown
      to reduce both heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in patients with established
      heart disease. However, the time of initiation of SGLT2-i therapy has not been evaluated in
      patients with HF. In addition, the impact of treatment on HF symptoms quality of life,

      evaluated. The results of this study have great potential to impact and facilitate care and

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. In the KCCQ, an overall summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>

    <description>The Chronic Heart Failure Questionnaire (CHQ-SAS) assesses patients' perception of their HF and measures the impact of HF symptoms.
