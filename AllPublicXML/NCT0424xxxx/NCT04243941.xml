  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety of using PSMA-PET/mpMRI to define
      radiotherapy targets, while meeting all current planning criteria. This study also intends to
      determine the feasibility of performing stereotactic body radiation therapy with simultaneous
      integrated boost on the dominant intra-prostatic lesions while meeting all current planning
      criteria.

  <detailed_description>

      This study aims to determine if multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and
      prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging can help
      optimize the placement of the high dose inhomogeneity characterizing stereotactic body
      radiation therapy. All radiation plans have &quot;hot spots&quot; of radiation, and in current practice
      these regions are randomly located. This study will focus those hot spots on regions
      determined by mpMRI + PSMA-PET to have visible tumor.
