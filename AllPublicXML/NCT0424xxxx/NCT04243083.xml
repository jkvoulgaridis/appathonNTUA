  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TLL018 is developed for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including
      rheumatoid arthritis. The purposes of this study are (1) determining if and at what doses
      TLL018 is safe and can be tolerated when administered to humans, (2) assessing what TLL018
      does to the body and how the body responds to TLL018 when given as single and multiple doses,
      and (3) assessing potential food effect on TLL018.
