      A clinical trial comparing laser treatment and conventional mucosal flap surgery for
      treatment of peri-implantitis. The main aim of the study is to evaluate if treatment of
      peri-implantitis with 970 nm laser combined with scaling and root planning (SRP) is
      clinically comparable to conventional mucosal flap surgery in terms of pocket probing depth
      reduction.

      The present project aims to evaluate a novel method in treating peri-implantitis, with focus
      on decreasing the patient's suffering as well as disease progression. Peri-implantitis has a
      direct influence on both physical and psychological wellbeing and have been related to
      difficulty in chewing due to loss of implants, bad esthetic appearance as well as high costs.
      Therefore, it is of importance for the individual as well as for the society to thoroughly
      investigate any new treatment approaches.

      The study is a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing laser treatment (test group)
      and conventional mucosal flap surgery (active control group). Assessment of clinical
      variables at baseline and after 6 months. Patient reported outcomes at baseline, directly
      after treatment and after 10 days.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate if treatment of peri-implantitis with 970 nm laser combined with scaling and root
      planning (SRP) is clinically comparable to conventional mucosal flap surgery in terms of
      pocket probing depth reduction.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate other clinical and radiological variables connected to peri-implantitis and
           the inflammation surrounding the dental implant.

        -  To evaluate the patient experience of treatment of peri-implantitis.

        -  To evaluate the inflammatory and microbial response after laser treatment

    <description>Analysis of inflammatory meditators in stimulated saliva will be performed by commercially available ELISAs or multiplex assays at base line and 6 months. The analytes of interest to be tested are mainly inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and molecules related to bone remodeling such as for IL-1β, MMP 8, TIMP-1, CSF-1, elastase activity, and RANK-L/OPG ratio.</description>

    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) is used to record the patients pain, discomfort and satisfaction with the treatment. The patients mark their response on a 100 mm line, with low values being no feeling of pain, discomfort or satisfaction, and high values meaning maximum pain, discomfort or satisfaction.</description>
