    <textblock>
      The goal of this usability study is to pilot test the recruitment procedures, data
      acquisition methods, and text message program integration required to support the planning of
      a future clinical trial. Approximately 15 smokers who are patients of the Boston University
      Goldman School of Dental Medicine (BUGSDM) patient treatment center and have an upcoming
      dental prophylaxis or scaling and root planing (henceforth referred to as 'teeth cleaning')
      appointment will be recruited. During the dental cleaning, participants will watch a brief
      educational video that provides guidance and advice on smoking cessation.

      At the end of the dental appointment, participants will complete a survey about their
      experience watching the video and their attitudes towards smoking cessation. Participants
      will also receive other smoking cessation resources with instructions on how to access the
      services. Participants will then use the one-month text message program developed by the
      investigators to motivate and facilitate contact with the smoking cessation resources.

      At the end of the one-month text message program, participants will complete a survey about
      their experience during the text message program, their smoking habits, and attitudes towards
      smoking cessation. The duration of the study will be approximately six-weeks.

    <description>At a dental cleaning visit, participants will watch a brief educational video that provides guidance and advice on smoking cessation. Participants will then interact with a text program for a month to motivate them to use smoking cessation resources. Participants will also be required to make contact with the resources in order to demonstrate feasibility of study flow.</description>
