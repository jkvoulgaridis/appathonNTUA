      Examination of the accuracy of toric predictive power in patients with 1.5 diopters of
      astigmatism or less.

      Based on preoperative keratometry and using the Baylor Nomogram and a standard factor for
      surgically-induced astigmatism, the investigators will calculate &quot;keratometry-based total
      astigmatism&quot; for each patient. This will be compared to &quot;aberrometry-based total
      astigmatism&quot;, i.e. the total astigmatism measured by ORA in each case. With this information
      the investigators will determine in what portion of patients keratometry-based total
      astigmatism vs aberrometry-based total astigmatism predicts a need for astigmatism
      correction, (i.e., total astigmatism is greater than or equal to 0.5 D) during cataract
      surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who underwent conventional (non-femtosecond) cataract surgery and whose &quot;data
             to be collected&quot; are accessible and available from the ORA database.

          -  Patients whose medical records show they did not exhibit any significant ocular
             morbidity that would be expected to influence outcome measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with visually significant co-morbidities (corneal, retina, optic nerve
             disease) that could affect their visual outcome or ability to be refracted after.

          -  Patients with surgical complications either during or after surgery (capsule tears,
             iris trauma, decentered IOL, cystoid macular edema, etc.)

          -  Patients with previous refractive surgery.
