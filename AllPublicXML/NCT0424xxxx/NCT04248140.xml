      Introduction: Since several years Wireless Local Networks (WLAN, WiFi) are widely spread and
      operated in households. Many people feel that the presence of radiofrequency technologies
      impairs their health. Sleep problems are among the most often complained complaints. The
      present study aims to contribute to answer the question, whether biological effects of a WiFi
      exposure can be assessed by objective measures. The results of this study will expand the
      database on possible acute effects of WiFi exposure and thus qualitatively contribute to the
      discussion whether sleep is affected by exposure from radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.

      Methods: A double-blind, sham-controlled experiment in the sleep laboratory with exposure
      conditions delivered in a balanced randomized cross-over design. Subjective sleep quality of
      volunteers is assessed by questionnaires. Macro- and microstructure of sleep are measured by
      polysomnography. Furthermore, a possible impact on sleep related memory consolidation is
      tested. To do so declarative, procedural and emotional memory tasks are used. Exposure is
      delivered by a specially developed system, which simulates field strengths and signals
      occurring in a subject sleeping in the close proximity of a WiFi-access point. This exposure
      system is necessary to allow for a double-blind implementation and monitoring as well as for
      the realization of defined exposure parameters.
