  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury (SCI). The
      users will be their own controls. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability
      of the power assist device SmartDrive to increase the ability to be mobile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that the SmartDrive will enable the user to be more active,
      both in commuting longer distances with less strokes needed, and managing single difficulties
      stopping them from activity. The two assessments selected, distance travelled and the daily
      diary, should directly reflect the impact of the SmartDrive. In addition, the the
      International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS) pain data set, Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain
      Index (WUSPI) and Wheelchair Outcome Measure (WhOM) will be used. In WhOM, the participants
      will state some activities they perform in their wheelchair that are important to them, and
      how satisfied they are with their current level of performance of that activity. After the
      intervention period the satisfaction is reassessed. This will enable to capture the effect
      SmartDrive usage has on the participant's daily life (beyond distance commuted and pain
      level).

      After enrollment, the participants will be followed for two weeks using their wheelchair
      without SmartDrive. After attaching the SmartDrive, they will have three weeks to get into a
      use of the device on a regular basis in their everyday life, and then follows two consecutive
      weeks of study intervention and data collection. To capture the long-term effect and allow
      for season variability, follow-up data will be collected at three and six months after start
      of study intervention.

    <description>Wheelchair user shoulder pain index (WUSPI). WUSPI is a simple and effective self-report questionnaire for quickly measuring the functional cost of shoulder pain in wheelchair users. The WUSPI targets activity limitation resulting from shoulder pain (4 subsections), including wheelchair transfers, wheelchair mobility, selfcare and general activities.</description>
