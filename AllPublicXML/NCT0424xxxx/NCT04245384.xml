  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to investigate the effect of internet-based dietetic treatment (IDT) on
      patients, dietitians, and society.

      The project will show:

        -  If IDT is equivalent to traditional dietetic treatment with physical meetings

        -  Patients' attitudes to, and experiences of, meeting a dietician through video calls

        -  How the dietician's work environment and working methods are affected by IDT

        -  If there are subgroups of patients where IDT is more or less appropriate

        -  Health economic and environmental consequences of IDT The major shortage of dietitians
           leaves patients with non-communicable diseases (NCD) without qualified dietary
           treatment. In a pilot study, the investigators have shown that IDT has great potential
           to streamline healthcare and increase accessibility. In the project Dietitian online,
           the investigators will conduct an RCT with 400 NCD-patients allocated to either IDT or
           standard dietetic treatment to see if IDT affect treatment outcome and whether IDT is
           appropriate for everyone. Even though internet-based treatment (IT) increases rapidly in
           society, there is little knowledge about the patients' experiences and how healthcare
           personnel incorporates IT in their daily work. The investigators will conduct
           qualitative studies to meet this knowledge gap. General assumptions are that IT is
           beneficial for society, both economically and environmentally, but very few studies have
           been done. The project will incorporate a full health-economic evaluation, including
           environmental impact.
