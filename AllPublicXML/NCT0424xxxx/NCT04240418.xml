  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening at-risk subjects with low-dose computed tomography (CT) efficiently reduces lung
      cancer specific mortality. However screening efficiency relies on the at-risk population's
      criteria definition and its participation rate to the screening. In France, there are
      concerns regarding the participation rates to national cancer screening that are quite low
      (around 50% and 32% of the eligible population for breast cancer and colorectal cancer
      respectively). Before organizing national lung cancer screening it is then crucial to
      determine the factors impacting the at-risk subjects willingness to participate in lung
      cancer screening.

      The Lyon University Hospital is the second biggest hospital in France with more than 23,000
      employees distributed among more than 160 professions representing every level of education
      or working conditions. Its population is heterogeneous and wide enough to perform a
      prevalence study assessing the willingness to participate among the at-risk population.

      ILYAD is a prospective study performed by anonymous questionnaires that will be submitted to
      the 23,000 employees of the Lyon University Hospital. The study main objective is to evaluate
      the at-risk population presence in the Lyon University Hospital population, as defined by
      NELSON criteria and selection criteria for lung cancer screening (PLCOm2012 scoring), and its
      willingness to participate to a lung-cancer screening with low-dose CT. This might help
      further efficient national lung cancer screening campaign organization.
