    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, multicentre, parallel, controlled, and double-blind trial. It is a
      study with 2 groups with evaluation pre and post treatment with Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS)
      implantation of patients with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). The study has been
      designed to assess primarily non-inferiority and secondarily superiority of HD therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 18 years old patients, with leg with or without low back neuropathic pain (DN4 ≥4),
      previously undergoing low back surgery that, after an Evidence-Based (EB) medical therapy,
      can be eligible to SCS therapy following the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will be
      implanted of at least one lead in the epidural thoracic level with at least two poles
      (Medtronic Vectris) covering the T9-T10 interspace and, if the trial is positive, a Medtronic
      Intellis Internal Pulse Generators (IPG) will be implanted.

      The patients will be randomized to two groups to compare the improvement of pain control, the
      functional state and the quality of life of the patients by SCS Therapy across 12 months.

    <description>In this group, a conventional stimulation with low frequency will be tried. It will be programmed according to the usual clinical practice looking for one or more combinations of poles that allow a coverage of paraesthesia with a conventional stimulation of at least 80% of the painful area. This programming will be modified until getting not only 80% coverage but also a decrease of at least 50% of pain in that area.</description>

    <description>In this group, a high density stimulation will be applied on a dipole located over the interspace T9-T10 with a frequency of 1000Hz and a pulse width of 200μs, will be programmed. First, the patient must accomplish the condition of having at least two consecutive poles in the same electrode projected on the interspace T9-T10. A dipole programming with the HD characteristics will be carried out (stimulation of HD at 1000 Hz with a pulse width of 200 μs) and, if this does not obtain a satisfactory clinical result in the first 48-72 hours, it will be programmed with a superior dipole, always on the T9-T10 interspace and on the electrode closest to the midline if the patient has been implanted with two electrodes</description>

First, the patient must accomplish the condition of having at least two consecutive poles in the same electrode projected on the interspace T9-T10.
