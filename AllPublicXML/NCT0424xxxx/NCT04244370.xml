    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) must voluntarily sign and date the
             approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to collection of study-specific data or
             performance of study-specific procedures.

          2. Subject must be either male or non-pregnant female ≥18 years of age with an expected
             lifespan sufficient to allow for completion of all study procedures.

          3. Subject must be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements, including all
             study visits and procedures.

          4. Subject must require peripheral vascular occlusion at an arterial target embolization
             site(s) that can be treated with the Caterpillar™ Arterial Embolization Device
             according to the Instructions for Use (IFU). Note: Per Investigator discretion, up to
             five (5) Target Embolization Sites may be treated with up to ten (10) study devices
             per subject.

             Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          5. The target embolization site(s) must be located in a native arterial vessel(s) with
             the intended arterial vessel diameter ranges shown in the IFU, as assessed by the
             Investigator (via visual estimate).

          6. The target embolization site(s) must have a landing zone sufficient to accommodate the
             device implant lengths shown in the IFU.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject's access vessel(s) preclude safe insertion of the delivery catheter.

          2. The subject's target embolization site(s) is located within a vein.

          3. The subject's target embolization site(s) is located within the head, neck, heart or
             coronary vessels.

          4. The subject's target embolization site(s) is located across highly locomotive joints
             or muscle beds (e.g. elbow, hip, knee, shoulder, thoracic inlet/outlet).

          5. The subject's target embolization site(s) is located in a high-flow vessel where, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, there may be significant risk of migration and
             unintended (non-target site) occlusion.

          6. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to contrast media that cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated.

          7. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the device materials
             including: cobalt, chromium, nickel, titanium, platinum, iridium, polyurethane or
             polyethylene.

          8. The subject has planned use of anticoagulant (e.g. direct thrombin inhibitors, factor
             Xa inhibitors, vitamin K antagonists) or antiplatelet therapy before, during and/or
             after treatment with the study device, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would clinically interfere with the study endpoints.

          9. The subject has a known uncontrolled blood coagulation or bleeding disorder.

         10. The subject has an unresolved systemic infection.

         11. The subject's required pre-operative laboratory tests and/or physical examination
             indicate abnormal results, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would clinically
             interfere with the study endpoints.

         12. The subject has a connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome), arteritis
             (e.g. Takayasu's Disease) or another circulatory disorder, which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would clinically interfere with the study endpoints.

         13. The subject has another medical condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may cause him/her to be non-compliant with the protocol, may confound the data
             interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the
             completion of study procedures and follow-up.

         14. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device
             study that has not completed the study treatment or that clinically interferes with
             the study endpoints. Note: Studies requiring extended follow-up visits for products
             that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not
             considered investigational studies.
