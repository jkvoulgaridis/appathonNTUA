    <description>Pain scores in VAS score. Pain scores were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). Scores are based on self-reported measures of pain that are recorded with a single handwritten mark placed at one point along the length of a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between the two ends of the scale—&quot;no pain&quot; on the left end (0 cm) of the scale and the &quot;worst pain&quot; on the right end of the scale (10 cm).</description>
