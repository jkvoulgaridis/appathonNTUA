      Cancer awareness is a critical element of cancer prevention and control. Creating public
      awareness on risk factors, preventative strategies, and the importance of early screening is
      the foundation upon which a cancer control program must be constructed. The purpose of this
      study is to describe the sociodemographic and risk factor distribution of the Abuja, Nigeria
      &quot;World Cancer Day Walk&quot; participants according to their motive for participating in the event
      (free cancer screening versus fun/activities), and secondarily, to investigate the impact of
      the event on educating attendees from the general population about cancer prevention and
      screening, in particular the importance of being physically active and maintaining a healthy
      body weight. Obesity is a known risk factor contributing to the development of cancer and
      NCD's.

      Cancer awareness is a critical element of cancer prevention and control. Creating public
      awareness on risk factors, preventative strategies, and the importance of early screening is
      the foundation upon which a cancer control program must be constructed. Ideally, efforts
      should include knowledge of the problem and its solutions, a group of people who respect and
      care for the populations they want to serve, and importantly, resources.

      Nigeria is the most populous black nation in the world with a population of over 196 million,
      more than 500 ethnic groups, 380 languages, and a diverse range of cultural, traditional and
      religious beliefs. Nigeria constitutes approximately 20% of the population of Africa and
      slightly more than 50% of the West African population. Cancer is a critical public health
      problem in this population. Nigeria is a major contributor to the overall cancer burden on
      the continent with 72,000 cancer deaths in 2012 and 115,950 new cases of cancer and 70,327
      cancer deaths in 2018. Nigerians also have one of the world's poorest 5-year cancer survival
      rates.

      Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Nigerian women and the leading cause
      of cancer death in Nigeria, with an estimated 26,310 new cases and 11,564 deaths in 2018 (44%
      death rate). Breast cancer incidence in this population historically has been low but is now
      increasing. By comparison, in the United States (population 329 million) there were 30,700
      new breast cancer cases and 6,310 deaths in 2016. Another female cancer - cervical, is 99%
      preventable, however, it is the second leading cause of cancer death in Nigeria with over 26
      deaths every day. By comparison, in the United States between 2013-2017, the average annual
      death rate of cervical cancer was 2.3% per 100,000 (age adjusted to the 2000 US standard
      population). Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Nigerian men with
      13,078 new cases (which is 29.1%) and 5,806 deaths in 2018. The age-standardized incidence
      rates (ASR) for prostate cancer was 32.8 new cases per 100,000 men and mortality rate was
      about 16.3 per 100,000 men in 2018. On a daily basis, at least 15 men die of prostate cancer
      in Nigeria. By comparison, in the United States prostate cancer death rates in men declined
      52% from 1993 to 2017.

      Strategies for prevention and early detection are imperative in the reduction of cancer death
      rates globally; awareness campaigns (such as the annual &quot;World Cancer Day Walk&quot; in Abuja) are
      critical to educate the general population on cancer risk factors, the benefits of screening
      and early detection, and to offer free cancer screening to all populations.

      This study &quot;Step up to Health, Nigeria! Impact of World Cancer Day Walk on Health Behaviors
      Among Nigerians&quot; will describe the sociodemographic and risk factor distribution of the
      Abuja, Nigeria &quot;World Cancer Day Walk&quot; participants according to their motive for
      participation, and secondarily, to investigate the impact of the event on educating attendees
      from the general population about cancer prevention and screening, in particular the
      importance of being physically active and maintaining a healthy body weight. Obesity is a
      known risk factor contributing to the development of cancer and NCD's.

      The study will take place in Abuja, Nigeria on Feb 1, 2020 during the 6th Annual &quot;World
      Cancer Day Walk&quot; sponsored by Project PINK BLUE, a registered Nigerian nonprofit cancer
      organization, viz. Health &amp; Psychological Trust Centre (CAC/IT/NO 73960).

      The purpose of the &quot;World Cancer Day Walk&quot; is to create awareness and advocate for better
      cancer care for Nigerians. The event offers free breast, cervical, and prostate cancer
      screenings; heath education and information about cancer risk reduction; and group physical
      activities that include a 5km Walk, 10km Race, 20km Ride, 5km Skate, 50km Cycle, and
      Marathon.

      On the day of the event, the in-field research team will distribute a voluntary, one-page
      questionnaire to the anticipated 3,000 event participants to ascertain demographic
      information, cancer risk factors, motivations for attending the event, and lifestyle
      behaviors. Subjects will be recruited voluntarily onsite during the event following inclusion
      and exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be taken.

      The questionnaire is 27 questions. Part one (eight questions) captures basic demographic
      information. Part two (six questions) captures personal and family history of cancer and
      cancer screening. Part three (six questions) captures information about the motivation for
      attending the event (free screening vs. fun/activities) and preferred ways to receive healthy
      lifestyle and cancer risk reduction / prevention information. Part four (five questions)
      captures lifestyle behaviors. Part five is the validated seven question International
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) instrument that measures physical activity and reduced
      sedentary behavior over the last seven days.
