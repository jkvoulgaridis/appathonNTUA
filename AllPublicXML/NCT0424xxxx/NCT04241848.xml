  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans who suffer strokes often have disturbances in the ability to walk that reduces
      independence and quality of life. Alterations in gait combined with general decreased
      activity are associated with reduced muscle strength of the paretic leg. This leads to
      cardiovascular deconditioning and reduced quality of life. There is a new and novel battery
      powered device (Keeogo powered orthotic exoskeleton) that uses motors that assist knee
      movement while walking, sitting down, and standing up. The Keeogo monitors hip movement to
      assist the knee, making it simple to learn how to use. If successful, this project will show
      how this device will help improve the ability to walk and provide evidence to support larger
      clinical trials in a home and community setting to improve mobility, increase muscle mass and
      strength in the legs, as well as improve general health and quality of life. Lastly, this
      device could be used to increase motivation and confidence in a person to walk for longer
      periods of time and distance, providing the ability to walk in places that were previously
      inaccessible.

    <textblock>
      Ninety percent of stroke survivors have clinically significant gait impairments that lead to
      secondary medical complications, including cardiovascular deconditioning and reduced quality
      of life (QOL). Several rehabilitative interventions that increase the level of activity and
      mobility have been shown to be beneficial. Challenges posed by most of these locomotor gait
      training interventions require recurring visits to a rehabilitation center. The recent
      development of novel powered exoskeletons offers a potential mechanism for stroke survivors
      to improve mobility in the home and community. Although the predominant research using these
      devices have been in persons with spinal cord injury, there are currently two devices are
      commercially available for use in patients with stroke and additional devices are being
      developed. The Keeogo powered orthotic exoskeleton is a novel device intended for persons
      with stroke who can ambulate but have gait impairment. This device consists of a ridged
      orthotic structure placed over clothing on the legs and batteries to the power motors that
      assist both knees in gait movement. The system monitors hip movement driven by the user and
      interprets this movement to apply the appropriate assistance at the knee joint. This unique
      approach makes learning intuitive, enabling the user only to acclimate to the system rather
      than learning how to control the device to initiate the desired movement.

      This proposal is a randomized controlled pilot study. Fifteen veterans with chronic stroke
      (&gt;6months) and who retain some ability to take steps but have impaired gait will be
      recruited. Ten participants will be randomized into the exoskeleton group and 5 into the
      control group. Both groups will be asked to complete 36 one-hour sessions of ambulation
      training. The exoskeleton group will train using the Keeogo powered orthotic exoskeleton and
      the control group will train without using their own conventional aide.

      The primary aim is to determine the efficacy of training with this exoskeleton and its
      ability to improve transfers to standing and sitting as assessed by the five times
      sit-to-stand test. A secondary aim will be to assess effects of the device during overground
      ambulation. Outcome measurements to investigate changes of knee range of motion and loading
      of the paretic limb. An exploratory outcome of changes in energy expenditure during
      ambulation with and without the powered exoskeleton. Additional exploratory outcome measures
      of QOL will be determined.

    <intervention_name>Keeogo</intervention_name>
    <description>A new and novel type of robotic-device (Keeogo, B-temia, Inc.) was developed to provide powered assistance at the knee for persons with stroke. This device provides assistance for both knee extension and knee flexion during ambulation, transfers to standing and sitting, in addition to ascending and descending stairs. As this device isn't able to fully control the movement, it requires the ability of the patient to stand and initiate stepping. The approach the Keeogo uses to monitor the desired movement in order to appropriately provide assistance. This promotes intuitive learning for the user, minimizing the amount of instruction and practice needed to effectively ambulate allowing users to independently ambulate within one session. This device does not restrict leg movement, so the user can side-step and walk backwards. However, it does not provide assistance during these movements.</description>

    <description>Ambulation training will consist of mobility activities affecting daily life including: walking; squatting (or getting in and out of a chair); bending, kneeling or stooping (for picking an item up off of the floor); and ascending and descending stairs. Sessions will be monitored and tailored to the individual, based on their functional ability and to ensure their safety.</description>
