    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy of r-ESWT treatment with sham-ESWT on pain, walking
      speed, physical function, and isokinetic muscle strength in knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been increasingly used to help relieve pain and
      to remedy musculoskeletal disorders in recent years. ESWT seems to be an effective treatment
      modality many different musculoskeletal conditions, including rotator cuff tendinopathies,
      calcifying tendinopathy of the shoulder, lateral epicondylitis, greater trochanteric pain
      syndrome, patellar tendinopathy, achilles tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis, and bone
      disorders. ESWT seems to have chondroprotective, anti-inflammatory, neovascularization,
      anti-apoptotic, and tissue regeneration effect on tissues which could be relevant in the
      treatment of OA.

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain, joint stiffness, and physical functions were evaluated by the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68).</description>

    <description>Isokinetic muscle performance was measured using a calibrated isokinetic test device named HumacÂ®/NormTM Testing &amp; Rehabilitation System (Computer Sports Medicine Inc. Stoughton, MA, USA). The knee extensor/flexor muscle group isokinetic muscle strength [peak torque (PT)] of both groups was evaluated using a calibrated isokinetic dynamometer.</description>

    <description>All patients in both groups were applied with a hot pack for 40-minutes, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for 30-minutes (100 Hz frequency and 60 milliseconds pulse duration), and a home-based exercise program around the knee for 30-minutes per day for three weeks. Also, each patient in group 1 received shockwaves of continuous frequency and intensity (2000 shocks, 10 Hz, 2.0 to 3.0 bar), while the second group of patients received sham-ESWT. In group 1, for a total of 3 weeks, r-ESWT was undertaken with 2000 pulse each time at a week interval totaling 6000 pulse by using a radial shock wave therapy system (vibrolith ortho tip ESWT (ELMED Turkey)).</description>

    <description>The other group received sham-ESWT at 0.1 bar in the same area. The patients were placed supine with the affected knee at 90 degrees flexion at each treatment session. The shock wave probe was held stationary on painful points around the knee or at the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral borders of the target knee.</description>
