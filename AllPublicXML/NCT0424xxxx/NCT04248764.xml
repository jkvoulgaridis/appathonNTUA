  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is associated with the initiation of a new physical
      activity or a sudden increase in exercise volume and intensity. DOMS also occurs following
      eccentric exercises such as ballistic stretching, downhill running, weight training and
      plyometrics. DOMS might prevent performing sports and decreases the performance of
      professional or recreational athletes. Recently, different soft tissue mobilization
      applications (massage, foam roller) have been preferred by many athletes to prevent DOMS.
      However, there is no study comparing the effects of these techniques on DOMS. Therefore, the
      aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of different soft tissue mobilization
      practices on DOMS and sportive performance in recreational athletes. In order to achieve this
      goal, a total of 36 recreational athletes will be included and will be allocated to three
      groups as foam roller group (n=12), massage group (n=12) and control group (n=12).
      Demographic data, thermal camera measurements, fatigue level assessments, and performance
      measurements will be performed. All measurements will be carried out four times as before the
      application, immediately after the application, after 24 hours and after 48 hours.

      After being invited to the study, the demographic data of all participants who agreed to
      participate in the study will be recorded on a structured form. Participants will be randomly
      divided into three groups: Massage application group, Foam Roller application group and
      Control group. Afterwards, thermal imaging, perceived fatigue and pain level, blood lactate
      level measurements, and vertical jump assessments will be done for the quadriceps femoris
      muscle. Then, the fatigue protocol will be applied for the quadriceps femoris muscle and
      five-minute applications will be made according to the groups in which they are randomly
      separated. Evaluations made in the first applications will be made immediately after the
      applications, 24 hours and 48 hours later, as the 2nd, 3rd and 4th measurements. The assessor
      will not know which group the participants are from.

    <description>Tissue temperature change will be assessed by using thermal camera imaging which is a non-invasive method. By determining the temperature differences in the tissues with the thermal camera, it will be determined in which regions the circulation increases or decreases.</description>

    <time_frame>Four measurements will be performed as immediately before, immediately after, 24 hours and 48 hours later from fatigue protocol.</time_frame>
    <description>By using a 0-100 millimeter visual analog scale (0: none, 100: maximum), the participants will determine the fatigue and pain levels. Higher scores indicate worse fatigue and pain.</description>
