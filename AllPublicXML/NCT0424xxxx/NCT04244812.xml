  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to detect the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomena
      by using an objective assessment tool and investigate the site specificity for the
      meridian-visceral association and surface-surface association between two specific meridians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Lung and Heart meridians are chosen as two specific studied meridians. Participants of
      chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) and healthy volunteers will be enrolled.

      120 participants will be included and divided into the healthy control group, chronic stable
      angina pectoris (CSAP) group and healthy intervention group. Laser doppler flowmetry (LDF)
      will be used to assess the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomena for the
      Heart and Lung meridians. The site specificity for the meridian-visceral association will be
      investigated by comparing the microcirculatory difference between the Heart and Lung
      meridians in the healthy control group and CSAP group. Besides, participants in the healthy
      intervention group will receive two sessions of moxibustion in the Heart meridian and Lung
      meridian respectively to explore the site specificity for the surface-surface association.

    <description>Two sessions of moxibustion will be performed in the Heart meridian and Lung meridian successively.
Intervention in the Heart meridian: moxibustion will be performed above Shaohai (HT3) for 15 minutes. During moxibustion, the probes of laser doppler flowmetry will detect the microcirculatory characteristics of three measuring sites, which include the midpoint of the Heart meridian along the left forearm, Chize (LU5) of the Lung meridian, and the midpoint of the Lung meridian along the left forearm.
Intervention in the Lung meridian: moxibustion will be performed above Chize (LU5) for 15 minutes. During moxibustion, the probes of laser doppler flowmetry will detect the microcirculatory characteristics of three measuring sites, which include the midpoint of the Lung meridian along the left forearm, Shaohai (HT3) of the Heart meridian, and the midpoint of the Heart meridian along the left forearm.</description>
