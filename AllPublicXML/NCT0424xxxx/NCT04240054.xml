      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study with a safety lead-in phase.

      The study hypothesis is that the isatuximab plus bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and
      dexamethasone (VCD) combination is safe and highly effective even in those with renal
      insufficiency (RI) from myeloma. In this study, we seek to improve the efficacy of VCD by
      adding isatuximab in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem
      cell transplant (ASCT) irrespective of renal function.

      The primary objective is to determine if the addition of isatuximab to VCD will increase the
      proportion of subjects achieving very good partial response (VGPR), as defined by the
      International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and by the time of completion of
      post-ASCT consolidation treatment.

                  starting two weeks before first study drug(s) administration, while on therapy
                  and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study drug(s). A woman is considered
                  of childbearing potential, i.e., fertile, following menarche and until becoming
                  postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. The following highly effective methods
                  of contraception are accepted:

                    -  Established use of oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and
                       progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
                       ovulation.

                    -  Established use of oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen-only
                       hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.

                       system.

                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: male condom with either cap, diaphragm or
                       sponge with spermicide (double-barrier methods). The use of double-barrier
                       methods should always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. Female
                       condom and male condom should not be used together.

                    -  Male sterilization (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of
                       the patient and that the sterilized partner has received medical assessment
                       of the surgical success).

                    -  Sexual abstinence.

                    -  Female subjects must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the
                       purposes of assisted reproduction starting two weeks before first study
                       drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last
                       dose of study drug(s).

          8. Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), who:

               1. Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period from the time of signing the informed consent through and
                  through four months after the last dose of study drug(s) (female and male condoms
                  should not be used together), or

               2. Agree to practice true abstinence during the entire study treatment period from
                  the time of signing the informed consent through 16 weeks after the last dose of
                  study drug(s), when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides only, and
                  lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)
