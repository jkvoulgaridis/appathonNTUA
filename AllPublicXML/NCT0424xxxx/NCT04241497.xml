  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension has gone from a disease that causes rapid death to a more
      chronic condition. Yet, improved survival is associated with major challenges for clinicians
      as most patients remain with poor quality of life and limited exercise capacity. The effects
      of exercise training on exercise capacity have been largely evaluated and showed an
      improvement in 6-minutes walking distance (6MWD), peak V'O2. It is also known that exercise
      program improves quality of life. Maximal volitional and nonvolitional strength of the
      quadriceps are reduced in patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and correlated to
      exercise capacity. Moreover, on the cellular level, alterations are observed in both the
      respiratory as well as the peripheral muscles. Muscle fiber size has been reported to be
      decreased in some studies or conversely unaltered in human and animal models. Reduction in
      type I fibers and a more anaerobic energy metabolism has also been reported, but not in all
      studies. Likewise, a loss in capillary density in quadriceps of patients with Pulmonary
      Arterial Hypertension and rats has been reported, but could not be confirmed in other
      studies. While the impact of exercise training on clinical outcomes such as exercise capacity
      or quality of life is well known, this data highlight the fact that the underlying causes of
      peripheral muscle weakness as well as the mechanisms underlying the clinical improvements
      observed with exercise programs are not completely understood. Improvement of muscle cell
      metabolism in part via the enhancement of oxidative cellular metabolism and decrease in
      intracellular lipid accumulation may play a role in improving muscle function and exercise
      capacity.

      In this study, we intend to evaluate the impact of a 12 weeks home-based rehabilitation
      program on peripheral muscle function and metabolism, focusing on lipid infiltration,
      oxidative metabolism and epigenetic factors that can be involved in metabolic syndrome, in
      patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

      The 12 weeks home-based rehabilitation program is detailed as follows:

        -  1st sessions at the hospital, in the presence of a physiotherapist/kinesiologist

        -  3 weeks of supervised home-based rehabilitation (using a telemonitoring system) 3 times
           a weeks

        -  9 weeks of unsupervised home-based rehabilitation (one phone call a week)

      Patients will be evaluated at baseline and at endpoint (12 weeks)

    <description>Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) questionnaire. The CAMPHOR questionnaire contains 65 items in total, 25 relating to symptoms, 15 relating to activities, and 25 relating to QoL. It is negatively weighted; a higher score indicates worse QoL and greater functional limitation. Symptom and QoL items are both scored out of 25: &quot;yes/true&quot; scores 1 and &quot;no/not true&quot; scores 0. Activity items have three possible responses (score 0-2), giving a score out of 30. Each CAMPHOR assessment takes an average of 10 min</description>
