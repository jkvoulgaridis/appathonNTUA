    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the combination of SCO-101 to FOLFIRI for the treatment of metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients who have developed resistance to FOLFIRI treatment. The study is
      divided in two parts, where the first part evaluates the safety and toxicity of increasing
      doses of SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI at the same dose as the patient has previously
      developed resistance to. The second part of the study evaluates the safety and efficacy of
      the combination of FOLFIRI and SCO-101 at the dose level established in the first part.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, dose escalation, Phase 2 study of SCO-101 in combination
      with FOLFIRI in up to 50 mCRC patients. All patients included have previously had effect from
      treatment with FOLFIRI, but have now progressed (i.e. treatment failure due to acquired
      resistance).

      FOLFIRI is a key anti-cancer chemotherapeutic combination in the treatment of several solid
      tumor cancers, e.g. colorectal cancer. Cancer resistance to FOLFIRI exposure is a well known
      phenomenon and can often be attributed to upregulation of cellular efflux pumps, e.g.
      ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC)G2 and ABCB1, involved in the efflux of the chemotherapeutic agents
      from the cancer cells and resulting in treatment failure.

      SCO-101 is an inhibitor of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) efflux pumps and SRPK1 kinase which is
      responsible for phosphorylation of splicing factors, a key element involved in tumour growth.

      The combination of SCO-101 with FOLFIRI is expected to inhibit the active efflux of
      chemotherapy molecules from the cancer cell thereby re-sensitizing it to the chemotherapeutic
      agents.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, open label, dose escalation, Phase 2 study of SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI in up to 50 mCRC patients.
Cohorts of FOLFIRI-resistant mCRC patients will be treated with SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI . Patients to be enrolled should previously have had either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) (&gt;16 weeks) on FOLFIRI.
The study is separated in two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation part with a standard 3+3 design, designed to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of SCO-101 and FOLFIRI, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A maximum of 5 cohorts have been planned. Starting dose of SCO-101 is 150 mg (cohort 1) and maximum dose is 350 mg (cohort 5).
Part 2 is the efficacy part, where patients are treated with the MTD dose identified in the first part and evaluated for efficacy and safety of the combination SCO-101 plus FOLFIRI.</intervention_model_description>
