  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic metastases are common in solid cancers (up to 30% of patients with colorectal cancer
      and up to 50% of patients during their follow-up). The incidence of primary liver cancer
      increases due to the increase in chronic liver diseases induced by excessive alcohol
      consumption, hepatitis B and C viruses, and excess fat in the liver. Surgical excision of
      these liver lesions is the reference treatment but it cannot always be realised.

      Stereotactic radiotherapy is a recent technique proposed to hepatic metastases treatment from
      solid cancers and primary hepatic lesions (HCC or cholangiocarcinomas); it is possible to
      deliver high doses of radiation in the most conformational way possible in order to limit the
      irradiation of the non-tumor liver. The results of this stereotactic radiotherapy are
      currently very good with control rates of 75 to 80% at 1 and 2 years with acceptable rates of
      severe toxicities of 10%. However, the fear of hepatic, digestive (colon, esophagus, stomach)
      or even cardiac toxicities limits its using to the majority of patients because coupled with
      a conventional scanner it do not allow direct visualization of the lesion.

      Due to its non-irradiating nature, MRI guided stereotactic radiotherapy can generate
      continuous imaging, during the irradiation session, offering &quot; in live &quot; a visualization of
      the tumor target and organs at risk of proximity. In increasing the precision and safety in
      the delivery of irradiation, it allows to hope for several areas for improvement of
      treatment:

        -  reduced uncertainty margins

        -  an increase in the dose delivered

        -  the accessibility of tumor lesions near sensitive organs (esophagus, stomach, heart
           chambers, intestines, duodenum, right kidney).

      More, this accelerator allows a re-optimization of the initial dosimetric plan to the
      anatomical changes of the day to allow an MRI guided adaptive radiotherapy.

      The MRI guided stereotactic radiotherapy of hepatic lesions with an MRIdian® Linac tested in
      this study will allow:

        -  to see the tumor target in live with a non-irradiating imaging

        -  a reduction of the volume of non-tumor liver irradiated at high doses

        -  An progession of the dose delivered to the tumor lesion to allow tumor control to be
           increased.

        -  a new dosimetric plan adapted each day to the new contours to avoid a risk of severe
           digestive toxicity while ensuring optimal treatment, at an appropriate dose, of the
           tumor volume.
