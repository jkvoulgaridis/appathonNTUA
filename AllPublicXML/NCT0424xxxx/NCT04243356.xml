  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to learn more about the impact of a longitudinal encounter
      between critical care nurses and former intensive care unit patients. This study will enroll
      10 patients that had been admitted in an ICU to meet with a former nurse that had taken care
      of them in the ICU. The study will enroll 20 nurses that had taken care of these patients in
      the ICU. The study will randomize 10 nurses to be in the encounter group and 10 nurses to be
      assigned to the control group. Only nurses assigned to the encounter group will meet with the
      patients at their post-ICU clinic.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in medical ICU nurse fulfillment toward the ICU following an encounter with a former ICU patient in the post-ICU clinic using an adapted Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the follow-up ICU clinic visit for the encounter group (approximately 2-4 weeks after discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>The survey consists of 6 questions that are measured on a 5 point Likert scale (scored 0 to 4, with 4 representing higher fulfillment). The scores for all 6 fulfillment questions are then averaged for a composite score for fulfillment (also ranging from 0-4). The surveys will be administered at the time of enrollment for both the encounter and control nurse groups. The post-intervention survey will be administered only to the encounter group immediately following the post-ICU clinic encounter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in medical ICU nurse burnout following an encounter with a former ICU patient in the post-ICU clinic</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the follow-up ICU clinic visit for the encounter group (approximately 2-4 weeks after discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>The survey includes 2 questions and is adapted from Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and are single-item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.
The assessment of burnout are measured on a 7 point Likert scale (scored 0 to 6, with 6 representing higher burnout). The surveys will be administered at the time of enrollment for both the encounter and control nurse groups. The post-intervention survey will be administered only to the encounter group immediately following the post-ICU clinic encounter.</description>

    <description>Nurses in this group will meet with former ICU patients in a post ICU clinic visit. This will be a structured meeting for approximately 15 minutes with the nurse and former patient. The encounter will be observed by a member of the research team. Surveys will be completed before and after the visits. Additionally, nurses will be interviewed 4-7 days after meeting with their former patients.</description>
