  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot evaluation of the Healthy Pantry Program, a new behavioral
      economics-based training that allows pantry staff to learn how to implement nudges
      integrating traffic-light nutrition labeling and a healthy recipe database in the pantry
      environment. The hypothesis is that participation the Healthy Pantry Program will lead to
      increases in pantry purchases of healthy foods.

    <textblock>
      Food insecurity affects more than one in 10 Americans and is associated with poor nutrition
      and adverse health outcomes, including diabetes, hypertension, and mental health issues. Many
      food-insecure individuals use food pantries, which provide charitable food, to supplement
      household food needs. The emergence of client-choice food pantries, where individuals can
      select the foods they take home, provides a novel opportunity to intervene on the diets of
      food pantry clients.

      This study evaluates the Healthy Pantry Program (HPP) in a sample of 10 food pantries in the
      greater Boston area. Pantries will be matched on baseline characteristics and randomized 1:1
      into participation in HPP (intervention) or wait list (control). Outcomes data will be
      collected at the pantry and client level. The aims of the study are as follows:

      Aim 1: To evaluate whether HPP is associated with increased healthy food purchases from the
      food bank by intervention food pantries compared to control food pantries.

      Aim 2: To evaluate whether HPP is associated with increases in the availability of healthy
      food in intervention food pantries compared to control food pantries.

      Aim 3: To evaluate whether HPP is associated with an increase in healthy food selection and
      dietary intake by clients of intervention food pantries compared to clients of control food
      pantries, using a cross-sectional sample of 400 food pantry clients at baseline and 400 food
      pantry clients at 6-month follow up.
