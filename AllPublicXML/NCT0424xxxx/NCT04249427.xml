  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy of Erenumab in subjects with midfacial pain or pressure, without clinical or
      radiographic evidence of sinusitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants are randomized to receive either Erenumab or placebo by subcutaneous
      injection once monthly for 6 months. Study duration is eight months which includes a 30 day
      screening/lead-in period and 6 monthly treatment visits followed by a follow-up visit one
      month following the last dose of study drug administration. Participants will be expected to
      score on a scale of 1 to 10 their symptoms of facial pain/pressure, nasal congestion, and
      rhinorrhea as well well as any rescue medicines taken for pain each day via a mobile app.
