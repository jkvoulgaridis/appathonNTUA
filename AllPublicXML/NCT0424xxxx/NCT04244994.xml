      Objectives:

      To compare self-taken penile meatal swabs versus first-catch urine samples for the detection
      of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium from the penile urethra using nucleic acid
      amplification tests.

      To assess the acceptability of self-taken penile meatal swabs compared with first-catch urine
      samples.

      To assess the prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium in those with urethritis.

      To assess the prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium antimicrobial resistance.

      To evaluate the utility of using Mycoplasma genitalium resistance-guided therapy.

      To compare the cost of using self-taken penile meatal swabs versus FCU samples for the
      correct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium.

      Methods:

      Men and transwomen presenting for a sexual health screen will perform a self-taken penile
      meatal swab followed by a first-catch urine (FCU) sample. Both will be analysed using the
      Aptima Combo 2 test (Hologic, San Diego, California [CA], USA) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea.
      In those with urethritis they will also be analysed using Aptima MGen test for Mycoplasma
      genitalium. Details of demographics, past history, sexual history, clinical symptoms and
      signs will be collected. The acceptability of each sample will be assessed using a patient
      questionnaire. The samples of those infected with Mycoplasma genitalium will be tested for
      Mycoplasma genitalium macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance mutations by in-house
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Sanger sequencing to characterise mutants in the 23s
      gene for macrolide resistance and DNA gyrase subunit A (gyrA) and DNA topoisomerase IV
      subunit C (parC) genes for fluoroquinolone resistance. The result of this will be used to
      guide the therapy prescribed to treat the infection.

      Primary outcome:

      Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of self-taken penile meatal
      swabs compared with FCU samples for the detection of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma
      genitalium in the penile urethra.

      Secondary outcomes:

      Acceptability of self-taken penile meatal swabs compared with FCU samples for the detection
      of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium.

      Prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium in those with urethritis.

      Prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium antimicrobial resistance.

      Utility of using Mycoplasma genitalium resistance-guided therapy.

      Cost of using self-taken penile meatal swabs versus FCU samples for the correct detection of
      Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium.

      Study Methods The study population will be men and transwomen aged 18 and over presenting to
      Leeds Sexual Health who wish to be tested for chlamydia, gonorrhoea and M. genitalium (if
      symptoms of urethritis are present). Those who have taken antibiotics (except metronidazole)
      in the past 14 days will be excluded. Details of age, ethnicity, past sexually transmitted
      infection (STI) history, being in contact with a STI and symptoms suggestive of a bacterial
      STI (urethral discharge, dysuria, testicular pain and swelling) will be collected. Prior to
      any examination by the clinician the participant will be asked to perform a self-taken penile
      meatal swab following the written and diagrammatic instructions for self-collected penile
      meatal swabs using the technique recommended by Hologic. Those with genital symptoms will be
      examined and the presence of urethral discharge and testicular swelling and tenderness will
      be recorded. A urethral swab for microscopy and gonococcal culture will be taken by the
      clinician if there is any evidence of urethral discharge. Those who have no genital symptoms
      will not be examined and will not have a urethral swab for microscopy or gonococcal culture
      taken as in routine clinical practice. All men will then be asked to perform a FCU sample.
      The penile meatal swab and FCU will be tested for M. genitalium if there are symptoms of
      urethritis. The first 500 participants will be asked to complete a short questionnaire of six
      questions on how easy/difficult, and comfortable/uncomfortable, they found taking the penile
      meatal swab was compared to collecting the FCU and their overall sample preference.

      Consequently each participant will have two different samples taken:

      Meatal swab: Aptima Combo 2 assay; Aptima MGen assay (if symptoms of urethritis)

      First-catch urine sample: Aptima Combo 2 assay; Aptima MGen assay (if symptoms of urethritis)

      The self-taken penile meatal and the FCU samples will be tested for C. trachomatis and N.
      gonorrhoeae using the Hologic Aptima Combo 2 assay (AC2), and those from participants with
      symptoms of urethritis will be tested for M. genitalium using Aptima MGen assay, according to
      the manufacturer's instructions (Hologic, San Diego, CA, USA). Positive tests for C.
      trachomatis will be retested using the Aptima CT assay and positive tests for N. gonorrhoeae
      will be retested using the Aptima GC assay, both of which use a different target to the AC2.
      A test will only be categorised as clinically positive if the appropriate confirmatory test
      is also positive. Positive tests for M. genitalium will be tested for M. genitalium macrolide
      and fluoroquinolone-resistance mutations by in-house PCR using Sanger sequencing to
      characterise mutants in the 23s gene for macrolide resistance and gyrA and parC genes for
      fluoroquinolone resistance (as developed by the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit,
      Public Health England). The resistance test will also act as the confirmatory test if the
      amplification is successful. It is anticipated that amplification will not be successful in
      up to 20% of the positive Aptima Mgen assays, because of the better sensitity of the
      commercial assay, in which case these positive samples for M. genitalium will be frozen,
      batched and shipped to Hologic, San Diego, CA, for confirmatory testing. The participant will
      be managed as if M. genitalium positive whilst waiting for these confirmatory results in view
      of the high specificity of the Aptima MGen assay, and to avoid further morbidity and sexual
      transmission.

      All patients diagnosed as having chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea will be given treatment and
      managed with partner notification and follow up as per the clinic protocols and national
      guidelines. All patients tested for M. genitalium will have been diagnosed as having
      urethritis so will have been treated initially with doxycycline for seven days. Those who are
      positive for M. genitalium will be tested for M. genitalium macrolide and
      fluoroquinolone-resistance mutations. The result of this will be used to guide the therapy
      prescribed to treat the infection as per the United Kingdom (UK) and European guidelines. It
      is anticipated that about 50% of M. genitalium infections will be resistant to the first-line
      treatment of an extended regimen of azithromycin. These men will be treated with
      moxifloxacin. The men with both macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance will be treated with
      a guideline recommended third-line treatment. Those where the amplification to perform
      resistance testing was unsuccessful will have been treated initially with doxycycline for
      seven days. Following this they will be given an extended course of azithromycin. If there is
      no clinical resolution, and/or if they are still M. genitalium positive at test of cure, they
      will be treated with moxifloxacin. A test of cure will be performed at five weeks following
      the start of treatment using both a self-taken penile meatal swab and a FCU sample. The
      current sexual partners will be tested for M. genitalium and given the same antibiotic
      regimen if positive.

      Data from the Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be entered using the unique study number onto a
      secure computer system database which will be password protected. Data entry will be cross
      checked for errors and the database will contain alerts to identify if data being entered are
      illogical, inconsistent or incomplete. The master list of clinic unique identification codes
      and study numbers, and the CRFs will be kept in a secure locked cabinet, within a locked
      office, within Leeds Sexual Health.

      Determination of patient infected status Patients will be classified as infected or not
      infected based on one positive (confirmed) AC2 test for C. trachomatis; one positive
      (confirmed) AC2 test for N. gonorrhoeae or a positive culture for N. gonorrhoeae; and one
      positive Aptima Mgen test.

      The Department of Microbiology will perform the nucleic acid amplification assays and the M.
      genitalium macrolide and fluoroquinolone-resistance mutation assays.

      Power calculation and statistical analysis It is anticipated that the sensitivity of the
      self-taken penile meatal swabs will be similar to the Dize study rather than the Chernesky
      study as all participants will perform the penile meatal sample first. The investigators
      predict a sensitivity of 92% for chlamydia and 99% for gonorrhoea. It is anticipated that the
      sensitivity of the FCU samples will be similar to the Chernesky study rather than the Dize
      study as a urine collection device will not be used. The investigators predict a sensitivity
      of 83% for chlamydia and 85% for gonorrhoea. There is only one published study comparing
      penile meatal swabs and FCU for M. genitalium detection. This reported 100% sensitivity with
      penile meatal swabs and 83% with FCU.

      For the gonorrhoea analysis, 85 positive samples would detect a significant difference
      between a sensitivity of 85% and 99% with 80% power and 95% probability. For the chlamydia
      analysis, 260 positive samples would detect a significant difference between a sensitivity of
      83% and 92% with 80% power and 95% probability. For the M. genitalium analysis, 80 positive
      samples would detect a significant difference between a sensitivity of 85% and 99% with 80%
      power and 95% probability (slightly higher sensitivity of FCU and lower of penile meatal swab
      used as only one published study).

      The urethral gonorrhoea prevalence in the male population to be studied is at least 3.7%
      including asymptomatic men. Including 2400 symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, will
      give more than 85 positive individuals with 3.7% prevalence. The urethral chlamydia
      prevalence in the male population to be studied is at least 11%. 2400 participants will give
      260 positive individuals with 11% prevalence. The prevalence of M. genitalium in those with
      symptoms of urethritis in the population to be studied is not known as a European approved
      Conformité Européene marked (CE marked) commercial diagnostic test has only just become
      available. In 2017, 500 cases of male non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) were seen of which 100
      (20%) would be expected to be M. genitalium positive. All with symptomatic gonococcal
      urethritis will also be tested for M. genitalium, of whom up to 10 men per year may also be
      positive for M. genitalium. This means the sample size of 80 would be achievable within 15
      months with a 50-60% uptake in patients with symptoms of urethritis. It is expected that the
      uptake will be high, especially in those with symptoms of urethritis, as the study offers
      testing for M. genitalium which is not yet available in routine clinical practice as there is
      no funding for this service currently. The investigators have performed and published similar
      studies in order to identify the optimum sample for detection of chlamydia and gonorrhoea in
      females where 42 clinicians recruited almost 4000 females in 10 months which was shorter than
      the planned recruitment period.

      All data analysis will be performed using the study number. The overall sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value will be determined for
      self-taken penile meatal swabs and first-catch urine samples by comparing test results with
      the patient infected status. The comparison between self-taken penile meatal swabs and FCU
      samples will be by McNemar's test. The analyses for chlamydia and gonorrhoea detection will
      also be calculated in those with symptoms and those without symptoms.

      Utility of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)-guided therapy The utility of using AMR-guided
      therapy will be measured by the numbers that would have been given inappropriate antibiotics
      if the NGU guideline had been followed by giving doxycycline, then extended azithromycin,
      then moxifloxacin.

      Cost comparison The economic analysis will be a simple cost comparison and will focus on
      whether using self-taken penile meatal swabs gives a cost saving compared to FCU samples. The
      analysis will use the correct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and
      Mycoplasma genitalium as the primary endpoint and adopt the perspective of the UK National
      Health Service/Prescribed Specialist Services (NHS/PSS) in line with NICE recommendations
      (NICE 2013). Costs will be calculated from a sub-sample of 240 participants. NHS resource use
      and costs will be collected prospectively and will include costs of clinic time and resources
      and laboratory time and resources. Clinic staff will complete a specially designed data
      collection form for every trial participant during a 5-6 week period of the study.
      Information on unit costs or prices will be sourced to attach to each resource use item, to
      enable an overall cost to be calculated (e.g. Curtis &amp; Burns 2016). The final comparison will
      be based on cost per correct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and
      Mycoplasma genitalium using self-taken penile meatal swabs versus FCU samples.
