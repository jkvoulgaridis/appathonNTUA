  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, 3-period, single-sequence, crossover study to evaluate
      potential effects of olokizumab on pharmacokinetics (PK) of selected CYP450 substrates in
      subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Olokizumab (OKZ) has been shown to reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on the activity of
      Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 in vitro.

      The goal of this study is to examine whether olokizumab alters metabolism of following
      substrates selective for specific CYP450 activity: caffeine (CYP1A2), S warfarin (CYP2C9),
      omeprazole (CYP2C19), and midazolam (CYP3A4) in patients with RA.

      After 35-day screening period, 15 subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be
      administered a cocktail of 4 substrates alone during 7-day PK-sampling Period 1. A single
      subcutaneous dose of 128 mg OKZ will be administered (Period 2) approximately 2 weeks prior
      to the second administration of the cocktail in 7-day PK-sampling Period 3. After completion
      of the Period 3 patients will be followed for 19 weeks for safety evaluations.

      The duration of the study will be approximately 6.5 months.

      Approximately 3 Investigators and study centers are expected to participate in this study.

      12 evaluable subjects will be required to complete the study. It is estimated that 15
      subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will need be dosed in order to achieve this
      number. However, if necessary, additional subjects may be dosed to obtain the 12 evaluable
      subjects required.

                  consecutive months prior to first dosing, with a follicle stimulating hormone
                  level at screening of ≥40 mIU/mL.

          3. Body mass index of 18 kg/m2 to 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight of 60 kg to 110
             kg, inclusive, if male, and 50 kg to 100 kg, inclusive, if female.

          4. Subjects must have a diagnosis of adult onset RA classified by the American College of
             Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 2010 revised
             classification criteria for RA (Aletaha et al, 2010) for at least 12 weeks prior to
             Screening. If the subject was previously diagnosed according to ACR 1987 criteria, the
             Investigator may classify the subject per ACR 2010 retrospectively, based on medical
             history, and using available source data

          5. Must have received Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine for at
             least 12 weeks prior to Day 1 and in stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to Day 1
             without significant Adverse events (AEs). Stable doses of MTX should be 10 mg to 25 mg
             weekly with folic acid (at least 5 mg weekly or equivalent). No significant side
             effects based on the Investigator's judgment should be observed during treatment by
             these agents. The maximum allowed doses of sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine are:

               1. Sulfasalazine: 3 g per day

               2. Hydroxychloroquine: 400 mg per day Note: The doses should remain stable and not
                  be changed from the time of signing the ICF until the end of the treatment period

             blood pressure [BP] &gt;160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt;100 mm Hg, based on the mean of 3
             readings). If hypertension is not controlled, subjects should be excluded, and not
             allowed for rescreening.

         29. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (based on the Investigator's judgment).

         30. Subjects with a history or presence of any other cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,

             hematological, or immunologic/immunodeficiency disorder(s) or any other concurrent
             severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the Investigator's
             judgment, contraindicate subject participation in the clinical study, or clinically
             significant enough in the opinion of the Investigator to alter the disposition of the
             study treatment, or constitute a possible confounding factor for assessment of safety
             of the study treatment.

         31. Subjects with gastrointestinal (GI) resection (eg, partial or total gastrectomy)
             likely to interfere with absorption of study treatment.

         32. Subjects with any infection requiring any anti-infective therapy (eg, antibiotic,
             antiviral, or antifungal therapy) in the 4 weeks prior to Day 1, or serious or
             recurrent infection with history of hospitalization in the 6 months prior to Day 1 or
             active infection at Day 1.

         33. Subjects with evidence of disseminated herpes zoster infection, zoster encephalitis,
             meningitis, or other nonself-limited herpes zoster infections in the 6 months prior to
             Day 1.

         34. Subjects with planned surgery during the study (up to and including the EOT Visit,[Day
             29]) or surgery ≤4 weeks prior to Screening and from which the subject has not fully
             recovered, as judged by the Investigator.

         35. Subjects with diverticulitis or other symptomatic GI conditions that might predispose
             the subject to perforations, including subjects with a history of such predisposing
             conditions (eg, diverticulitis, GI perforation, or ulcerative colitis).

         36. History of chronic alcohol or drug abuse or consumption of more than 21 units (male
             subjects) or 14 units (female subjects) of alcohol a week (unit = 1 glass of wine [125
             mL] = 1 measure of spirits = ½ pint of beer) as judged by the Investigator.

         37. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous
             3 months prior to Screening.

         38. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any component of the
             cocktail drugs or OKZ.

         39. History of severe allergic monoclonal antibodies.

         40. Other medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that may increase
             potential risk associated with study participation and administration of study
             treatment, or that may affect study results interpretation and, as per the
             Investigator's judgment.

         41. Subject's unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the
             protocol.

         42. Employees or relatives of the Sponsor, Contract Research Organization, or the study
             center personnel.
