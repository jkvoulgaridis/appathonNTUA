    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, single center, open label, prospective study of BR55 to determine the
      optimal phase of the menstrual cycle for performing BR55 CEUS of the target ovary in
      premenopausal women scheduled to undergo preventative surgery because of high
      familial/hereditary or genetic risk for ovarian cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria: Enroll a subject in this study if the subject meets the following
        inclusion criteria:

          -  Is a female subject of at least 18 years of age;

          -  Is premenopausal;

          -  Is scheduled to undergo preventative salpingo-oophorectomy for high risk of ovarian
             cancer not earlier than 24 hours and not later than 5 days following the second BR55
             CEUS examination;

          -  Provides written Informed Consent and is willing to comply with protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria: Exclude a subject from this study if the subject does not fulfill the
        inclusion criteria, or if any of the following conditions are observed:

          -  Is a pregnant or lactating female. Exclude the possibility of pregnancy:

               -  by testing on site at the institution (serum Î²HCG) within 24 hours prior to the
                  start of investigational product administration,

               -  by surgical history (e.g., tubal ligation or hysterectomy),

          -  Has undergone prior systemic therapy for ovarian cancer;

          -  Has history of concurrent malignancy;

          -  Has history of any clinically unstable cardiac condition including class III/IV
             congestive heart failure;

          -  Has had any severe cardiac rhythm disorders within 7 days prior to enrolment;

          -  Has severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure &gt;90mmHg) or uncontrolled
             systemic hypertension and/or respiratory distress syndrome;

          -  Has open and/or non-healing wounds in the chest, abdomen and pelvis;

          -  Has other systemic vascular abnormalities associated with neovascularization that in
             the opinion of the investigator could significantly affect the ability to evaluate the
             effects of BR55;

          -  Is participating in a clinical trial or has participated in another trial with an
             investigational compound within the past 30 days prior to enrolment;

          -  Has previously been enrolled in and completed this study;

          -  Has any known allergy to one or more of the ingredients of the Investigational Product
             or to any other contrast media;

          -  Is determined by the Investigator that the subject is clinically unsuitable for the
             study;

          -  Has had major surgery, including laparoscopic surgery, within 3 months prior to
             enrolment;

          -  Has history of surgery to the ovaries or pelvic inflammatory disease.
