      This is a Phase II, multicenter，randomized, two arms, open-labeled, controlled clinical
      trial. This trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (Avastin®)
      plus mXELIRI compared with bevacizumab (Avastin®) plus FOLFIRI as first-line treatment in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

      This is a Phase II, multicenter，randomized, two arms, open-labeled, controlled clinical
      trial. This trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (Avastin®)
      plus mXELIRI compared with bevacizumab (Avastin®) plus FOLFIRI in not previously treated
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In experimental group, untreated patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer will receive Irinotecan 150 mg/m2 (D1, q2w) , Xeloda
      2000mg/m2 (D1-10, q2w) and bevacizumab 5mg/kg (D1, q2w) for 6-9 cycles as the first-line
      treatment. While in control group, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer will receive
      Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 (D1, q2w) , CF 300mg/m2 (D1 q2w), 5FU 400mg/m2, D1 2400 mg/m2, civgtt
      44h (q2w) and bevacizumab 5mg/kg (D1, q2w) for 6-9 cycles as the first-line treatment.The
      primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Overall survival, Objective Response rate,
      adverse event and life quality will be assessed as secondary outcomes.
