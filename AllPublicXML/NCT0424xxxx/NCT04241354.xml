  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of one 5 ml leukocyte-poor
      platelet-rich plasma (LP-PRP) injection to the intra-articular (IA) space in comparison to
      one 5 ml LP-PRP injection to the IA space with the addition of 3 ml injection into the
      surrounding extra-articular (EA) structures for the treatment of hip OA (Kellgren Lawrence
      Grades 1-3). Our hypothesis is that patients receiving both IA and EA LP-PRP injections will
      have equivalent improvements on HOOS JR and VAS scores over a 12-month period compared to
      those in the active comparator group (IA LP-PRP injection).

      A novel comprehensive approach through which the joint and its surrounding structures are
      treated as an integrated system may offer a clinically superior treatment to hip
      osteoarthritis (OA) compared to only an intra-articular (IA) infiltration. The efficacy of
      autologous leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma (LP-PRP) for the treatment of OA is a growing
      area of regenerative orthopedic research.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if a LP-PRP treatment to both the IA space and EA
      supporting capsular ligament and tendon structures provides a significant clinical benefit
      when compared to an IA treatment alone. In this clinical study of 84 patients, both study
      arms receive effective treatments that are supported by sound medical evidence, making this
      an ethically strong model to address our hypothesis.

      This is a multi-site, randomized, comparative study of LP-PRP treatment into the IA space
      versus the IA space and EA hip structures. This study is sponsored by Regenerative
      Orthopedics and Sports Medicine (ROSM) and EmCyte Corporation. Patients who meet the study
      criteria with at least mild pain as indicated by &gt;25/100 on a 100mm visual analogue scale
      (VAS) (Sanchez et al. 2011), or &lt;80/100 on HOOS JR with radiographic evidence of
      Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1-3 hip OA will be invited to participate in this study.

      The preparation of PRP is a simple tissue fractionation using centrifugation with EmCyte
      PurePRP Supraphysiologic SP kit [EmCyte Corp. Fort Myers FL]. Platelet quantification
      analysis is performed using the Horiba ABX Micros ES 60 [Plymouth Medical]. Primary outcome
      measures are indicated by overall hip pain severity by HOOS JR and VAS patient reported
      outcome measures.
