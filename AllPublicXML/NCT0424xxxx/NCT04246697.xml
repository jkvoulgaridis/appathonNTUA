  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be fashioned as a randomized, prospective study comparing Pain Management Arm
      A and Pain Management Arm B. Arm A will have scheduled Tylenol with opioids available as
      needed (PRN) in the peri-operative period. Arm B will undergo scheduled Gabapentin, Ketorolac
      and Tylenol as well as the Anesthesiology team managing regional nerve blocks, with opioids
      available PRN in the peri-operative period. The amount of pain medication used by all
      patients will be recorded as well as pain scores documented on a pain scale (0-10 with 0
      indicating no pain and 10 indicating worst pain ever) as well as ABC pain scale throughout
      the patients' hospital stay. Morphine equivalents for the opioids will be calculated for each
      arm while observing pain scores. Then, the investigators will compare these two groups to see
      if there is a difference in opioid pain medication used. The study team's hypothesis is that
      the use of Gabapentin, Ketorolac, and Tylenol in combination will significantly reduce (at
      least 30% of Mean Morphine Equivalents - MME) the use of opioid medication for patients
      undergoing head and neck free flap reconstruction with similar to improved pain scores.
