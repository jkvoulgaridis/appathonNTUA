    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of peripheral nerve stimulation on opioid withdrawal,
      craving, and use in participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are initiating treatment
      with buprenorphine/naloxone. This is a pilot investigation in which participants will
      randomized (1:1) to the active or sham treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use disorder (OUD) has become a public health emergency. Approximately 2.6 million
      Americans suffered from OUD in 2016. Evidence-based approaches for treating OUD include
      several medication-assisted treatments (MATs). While MATs are effective at reducing illicit
      opioid use and overdose deaths, it is well-established that withdrawal and craving are key
      contributors to treatment dropout, relapse, and overdose. Peripheral nerve stimulation via
      acupuncture has been shown to directly decrease drug withdrawal, craving, and
      self-administration. The investigators have developed the Empower Neuromodulation System, a
      non-invasive, portable transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device intended to
      stimulate peripheral nerves for the treatment of OUD. In this study, a randomized, controlled
      study will be conducted in participants with OUD who are initiating treatment with
      buprenorphine/naloxone. Participants will self-administer daily treatment with the Empower
      device. Endpoints will be evaluated for safety, effectiveness, and acceptability.
