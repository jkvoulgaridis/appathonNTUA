  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The literature is limited on whether BFR therapy provides improved return to function after
      acute rotator cuff or biceps rehabilitation in non-operative cases, and whether there is a
      clear mechanism of action in musculotendinous repair after BFR therapy. The purpose of the
      study is to 1) evaluate patient reported outcomes and return to play in baseball athletes
      undergoing rehabilitation with blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy for shoulder injury and
      2) evaluate changes in blood biomarkers to assess the mechanism of action of BFR therapy in
      injured athletes. Investigators will perform a randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial of
      2 separate study populations: 1) baseball players with biceps or rotator cuff tendinopathy
      undergoing non-operative treatment with BFR therapy incorporated into routine physical
      rehabilitation and 2) baseball players with biceps or rotator cuff tendinopathy undergoing
      non-operative treatment with routine physical rehabilitation alone.

      Primary outcomes will be functional outcomes and evaluation of return to sport. Functional
      outcomes will be evaluated using validated patient reported outcome surveys that are upper
      extremity-specific. Return to sport will be assessed by evaluating time to receiving
      clearance for returning to routine practices and reported level of physical performance and
      re-injury. Secondary outcomes will be measurement in muscle strength and blood biomarkers, as
      well as evaluation of 3D throwing motion. Strength will be measured using a biodex system at
      baseline prior to beginning physical rehabilitation, half-way through the rehabilitation
      protocol +/- BFR phase, and once cleared for return to play. Blood biomarkers GH, IGF-I, and
      IL-6 will be quantified at the same time points in order to investigate the mechanism of
      action of BFR on tissue repair. Patients will be followed longitudinally during this time for
      rates of reinjury.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of BFR therapy in physical rehabilitation for baseball
      athletes with non-operative biceps or rotator cuff tendinopathy. This will be directly
      measured by evaluation of upper extremity biomechanics measurements, strength testing,
      patient reported functional outcome scores, and identifying time required for clearance of
      return to sport. These outcomes in patients undergoing BFR therapy in addition to traditional
      rehabilitation will be compared to patients undergoing traditional rehabilitation only.
