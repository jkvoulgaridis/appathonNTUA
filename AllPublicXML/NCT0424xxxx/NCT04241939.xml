  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility and acceptability of a numberless behavioral digital scale
      (BDS) intervention combined with motivational interviewing (MI) to affect lifestyle changes
      to promote weight loss in adolescents who are obese. Half of the participants will receive
      this intervention, while the other half will use a digital scale along with the standard
      adolescent weight loss program.

      The proposed pilot project seeks to enhance motivation for lifestyle change in adolescents
      who are obese. It will test a novel intervention that combines modified MI-based counseling
      and BDS. We will test the feasibility of the intervention over a 12-week period, with 24-week
      follow-up compared to use of standard digital scale. All participants will undergo the
      standard adolescent weight loss program, which includes monthly clinic visits with dietary
      and physical activity counseling. The MI intervention will include modified MI, brief weekly
      telephone reinforcement, and use of a BDS. The BDS with its mobile app offers daily feedback
      through colors, daily missions to promote healthy habits, and weekly healthy tips from
      nutritionists. In addition to the primary outcome of feasibility (daily weighing)
      investigators will also explore the intervention's effect on motivation, psychological
      outcomes and various aspects of feasibility and acceptability.
