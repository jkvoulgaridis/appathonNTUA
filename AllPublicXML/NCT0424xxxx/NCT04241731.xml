  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintenance treatment can extend patient survival and improve patient quality of life.
      Bevacizumab alone or capecitabine combined with bevacizumab as a maintenance treatment have
      been widely used in clinical practice. In contrast, there are little datas of cetuximab as a
      maintenance treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of
      Raltitrexed plus Cetuximab as the maintenance treatment, and to provide a new choice for RAS
      wild-type colorectal cancer patients after advanced first-line chemotherapy.

      Maintenance treatment can prevent the toxicity and give patients a relative buffer period to
      alleviate the impact of follow-up treatment on the body without reducing efficacy.
      Bevacizumab alone or capecitabine combined with bevacizumab as a maintenance treatment have
      been widely used in clinical practice. There are little datas of cetuximab as a maintenance
      treatment ,some studies show that Cetuximab is effective in maintenance treatment, and some
      studies have reported adverse effects of Capecitabine combined with Cetuximab.So it is
      worthwhile to explore more suitable maintenance treatment options. Raltitrexed, a TS enzyme
      inhibitor, is an effective chemotherapy drug for colorectal cancer. We plan to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of Raltitrexed plus Cetuximab in maintenance treatment. Maybe we can
      provide a new choice for RAS wild-type colorectal cancer patients after advanced first-line
      chemotherapy.
