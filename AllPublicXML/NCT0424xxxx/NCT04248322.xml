  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study through the use of semi-structured interviews or focus groups will explore the
      lived experience with a Connected Catheter and usual customary care (UCC) of catheter users
      with Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction and their caretakers to generate user-defined
      themes regarding bladder function and catheter-related barriers and the daily impacts on
      one's life.

      Identify NLUTD user-defined themes regarding bladder function and catheter-related barriers
      and the daily impacts on one's life Specific Aim: Using iterative, semi-structured interviews
      or focus groups to explore the lived experience with CC and usual customary care (UCC) of
      catheter users with NLUTD and their caretakers to generate user-defined themes regarding
      bladder function and catheter-related barriers and the daily impacts on one's life.

        We will recruit a homogenous group of those with NLUTD, then stratify on usual bladder
        management and etiology (SB, MS, SCI, stroke, PD). These characteristics will create a 2
        (bladder management) x ~5 (etiology) = 10 cell matrix for recruiting for participant
        interviews. We plan to interview two individuals per cell (n=20) for participant
        interviews. Caregiver (n=20) interviews will be done for those who care for individuals
        with similar bladder managements and etiologies.
