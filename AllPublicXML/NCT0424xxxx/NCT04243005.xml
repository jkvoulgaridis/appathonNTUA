  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumor. Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV astrocytoma, is
      the most common subtype and unfortunately also the most aggressive subtype with median
      survival in population based cohorts being only 10 months. Extensive surgical resections
      followed by postoperative fractioned radiotherapy and concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide
      prolong survival and is the standard treatment.

      The investigators think there is significant potential in individualized surgical
      decision-making in glioblastoma management. The idea that some patients are amendable to
      radical surgery, while others should be treated more conservatively, is not controversial in
      other fields of oncology. The current concept in all patients with glioblastoma is &quot;maximum
      safe resection of the contrast enhancing tumor&quot;, but this may in selected cases be extended
      to simply &quot;maximum safe resection&quot; tailored to the patient and extent of disease at hand.

      Densely proliferating tumor cells have been found from at an average of 10 mm beyond the
      margins of contrast enhancement in high-grade gliomas. There are now several case series,
      using various definitions of supramarginal resection, but they have in common that they
      report a benefit of resection with a margin. This potential benefit also comes together with
      an associated neurological risk, making this approach unethical and simply not feasible in
      the patients with glioblastoma as a whole.

      Objective of this study is: To investigate if resection with a margin, that is significantly
      beyond the radiological contrast enhancement, improves survival in selected patients with
      glioblastoma.

    <description>Neurological assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) Scale is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a tumor within the central nervous system. The NANO is composed of 9 items. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NANO scale score. The maximum possible score is 23, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

    <time_frame>Early postoperative (i.e. prior to radiotherapy) to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <description>The QLQ-C30 is a cancer health-related quality-of-life questionnaire that has been widely used in clinical trials and investigations using PROs for individual patient management. It includes five function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive), eight symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality-of-life and financial impact. Subjects respond on a four-point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot; for most items. Most items use a &quot;past week&quot; recall period. Raw scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale with higher scores reflecting higher levels of function and higher levels of symptom burden.</description>

    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-BN20 is a quality of life assessment specific to brain neoplasms. Consists of 20 items that assess future uncertainty, visual disorder, motor dysfunction, and communication deficit. Items are presented as questions on a scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; Higher score means worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It examines functions including registration (repeating named prompts), attention and calculation, recall, language, ability to follow simple commands and orientation. Any score of 24 or more (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A suspected diagnosis of supratentorial glioblastoma by MRI.(A)

          2. Indication for surgical treatment and where supramarginal resection is considered
             possible according to the preoperative imaging. This consideration needs to be
             verified by two specialists in neurosurgery.

          3. Negative work-up for other primary tumor(B)

          4. Karnofsky performance status of 70 - 100.

        A) If randomized to supramarginal surgery, intraoperative frozen section must conclude with
        &quot;high-grade glioma&quot; to be able to proceed. Surgery in two sessions is also possible in
        supramarginal group if there is no intraoperative frozen section available or frozen
        section indicate another diagnosis, but final histopathology reveals a glioblastoma. In
        case of surgery in two session, there must be no more than 30 days between procedures. See
        flow-chart in attachment 1.

        B) No suspected primary tumor seen on CT chest, abdomen and pelvis. If relevant
        symptoms/clinical suspicion also supplement with mammography, dermatologist exam, relevant
        endoscopies etc.

          3. Contrast enhancement volume bilateral OR involving corpus callosum.

          4. Contrast enhancement along the ependymal lining of ventricles (contact is however not
             an exclusion criteria).

          5. Contrast enhancement involving several lobes.

          6. History of major psychiatric disorder such as psychosis, schizophrenia and/or mood
