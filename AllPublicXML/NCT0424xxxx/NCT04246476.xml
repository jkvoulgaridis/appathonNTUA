  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults, and particularly those with Parkinson disease (PD), may experience walking
      difficulties that negatively impact their daily function and quality of life. This project
      will examine the impact of music and mentally singing on walking performance, with a goal of
      understanding what types of rhythmic cues are most helpful. Our pilot work suggests that
      imagined, mental singing (i.e., singing in your head) while while walking helps people walk
      faster with greater stability, whereas walking to music also helps people walk faster but
      with reduced stability.

      In Aim 1, the investigators will compare walking while mentally singing to walking while
      listening to music, using personalized cues tailored to each person's walking performance.
      The investigators hypothesize stride time variability will be less in the mental singing
      condition compared to listening to music; and that mental singing and listening to music will
      improve gait speed similarly as compared to the uncued condition. The investigators will also
      test whether finger tapping, a rhythmic task similar to walking in many ways, responds
      similarly while mentally singing and listening to music.

      In Aim 2, the investigator will investigate the brain mechanisms underlying the enhancements
      in movement performance seen with mental signing or listening to music. The investigators
      will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain activity during finger tapping
      with and without various cues to understand which areas of the brain are more or less
      responsive to the cues. The investigators hypothesize individuals with PD will exhibit lesser
      activation of putamen and greater activation of cortical motor areas and cerebellum compared
      to controls in all tapping conditions; and internal, mental singing during tapping will
      elicit greater activation of the putamen and lesser activation of cortical motor areas in
      both groups compared to uncued tapping and tapping while listening to music.

      During this observational study, all participants will attend two visits 4-10 days apart. At
      the first visit, all participants (participants with PD and age-matched controls) will wear
      wearable sensors during the following tasks: walking with no cues; walking while listening to
      music; and walking while mentally singing. The wearable sensors will measure gait parameters
      including gait speed and stride time variability. All participants will also conduct the
      following tasks while finger tapping on a keyboard: tapping with no cues; tapping while
      listening to music; and tapping while mentally singing.

      At the second visit, all participants (participants with PD and age-matched controls) will
      perform the following tasks during imaging: uncued tapping; listening to music (no tapping);
      mentally singing (no tapping); listening to music and tapping; and mentally singing and
      tapping.

        Recruitment of participants with PD will primarily be through the Movement Disorders Clinic
        in the Department of Neurology at Washington University School of Medicine, flyers, social
        media, and the American Parkinson Disease Association St. Louis Chapter advertisements.

        Recruitment of age-matched controls will be primarily through the Washington University
        Older Adults Participant Pool from the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at
        Washington University in St. Louis, Washington University Research Participant Registry,
        Volunteers for Health, and community advertisements via flyers, social media, and
