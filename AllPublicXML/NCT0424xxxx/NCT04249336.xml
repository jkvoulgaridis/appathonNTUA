  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be multi-centered, triple blinded, randomized, four parallel treatments assigned
      study to compare clinical efficacy of commercially available dentifrices with placebo for
      immediate and sustained relief from Dentin Hypersensitivity after short term use.

      Condition or disease: Dentin hypersensitivity Intervention/Treatment: Product 1;
      Fluoro-Calcium-Phospho-silicate based BioMin F Product 2; Pro-Argin formula based Colgate
      Sensitive Pro-Relief Product 3; Strontium Acetate based Sensodyne Rapid Action Product 4;
      Sodium Fluoride based Colgate Total

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized controlled clinical trial with non invasive topical intervention in 140
      adult patients of 18 to 60 years age, that will be selected randomly after screening and
      diagnosis of dentin hypersensitivity, in dental Out Patient Department of Periodontology.
      Written informed consent will be obtained. Participants will be allocated randomly into four
      equal study arms for parallel treatment assignment with dentifrices named BioMin F, Colgate
      Sensitive Pro-Relief Trade Mark,Sensodyne rapid action Trade Mark and Colgate Total Trade
      Mark dentifrices. Colgate total Trade Mark dentifrices does not claim pain relief in Dentin
      Hypersensitivity. Interim efficacy will be assessed immediately after topical application on
      sensitive teeth, in one minute, after 5 minutes, on day three and week 4 respectively. Dentin
      hypersensitivity will be tested with mechanical stimulus, evaporative air blast stimulus and
      water jet stimulus. It will be measured on Visual Analogue Scale and Schiff cold air
      sensitivity scale (SCASS). Statistical analysis will be done using ANOVA in Statistical
      Package for Social Sciences software 21.
