  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an average of 21,000 diagnosed brain injuries each year among military personnel,
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major health concern for the United States Military
      Health System. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common type of brain injury
      sustained by military personnel and may result in chronic cognitive impairment.Unfortunately,
      many service members (SMs) have a history of multiple head injuries as well as psychological
      co-morbidities that negatively influence recovery. Advances in treatment options for
      cognitive rehabilitation following mTBI have been of increasing interest to the medical
      community and may increase treatment efficacy for injured SMs to ensure force readiness.

      Cognitive Rehabilitation (CR) for severe brain injury focuses on compensatory strategies for
      activities of daily living such as using lists to remember grocery items or reminders to take
      medications and attend medical appointments. Research has shown CR interventions to have
      considerable effectiveness in the acute and sub-acute phase of recovery after severe TBI. But
      there is insufficient evidence that they improve rates of individuals returning to work,
      independence in activities of daily living (ADL), community re-integration, or quality of
      life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Rehabilitation for mild brain injury has shown some modest evidence of
      effectiveness. CR interventions for mTBI typically focus on compensating for subjective and
      functional cognitive complaints. A number of recent studies have examined the use of
      compensatory CR approaches for individuals (primarily military veterans) diagnosed with mild
      cognitive impairment from a likely mTBI. These interventions taught individuals adaptive
      functional skills (e.g., cognitive mnemonics) and highlighted use of external aids such as
      smart phone scheduling/reminder applications. A randomized control trial that included 16
      veterans with TBI (mixed mild and moderate severity), found this compensatory CR intervention
      was effective at reducing overall symptoms, but did not impact cognitive performance or
      work-outcomes. In a secondary study, there was some evidence that the compensatory CR
      intervention improved memory at 6 months post-treatment and quality of life at 12 months but
      there was not a consistent pattern of improvement compared to controls.

      Generalizability from civilian and veteran communities to active duty SMs may pose some
      unique and unexplored factors as the goal of treatment is not remediation of common
      activities of daily living (e.g., remembering appointments) but in contrast, the goal is
      military readiness needed for worldwide deployability to potential wartime environments
      (e.g., &quot;cognitive readiness&quot;).

    <intervention_model_description>Primary Aim: Difference in Cognitive and Neurophysiological Function between SMART and TCR. Multilevel mixed-effect modeling will be conducted for Aim 1 with treatment modality (SMART vs. TCR) as the independent variable. This approach will take into consideration between-subject variance based on randomized group, as well as within-subject variance for repeated measures. Primary analyses will be based on intention to treat, and we will leverage the statistical power of multilevel modeling to handle missing follow-up data. Outcome will be assessed as change in GDS over time. A significant p-value of 0.05 will be used to assess the main effects.</intervention_model_description>
