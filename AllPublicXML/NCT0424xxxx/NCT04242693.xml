  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study used a two-group pre-posttest experimental design. After completing a background
      survey, participants used their smartphones to uploaded photos and/or descriptions of their
      meals to an online platform for three days. In addition, those in the intervention group were
      asked to use a checklist to count the number of times they ate red/orange vegetables and to
      set a goal to eat one more time the next day. The dependent variable was a measure of eating
      behavior—an estimate (number of times/day) of red/orange vegetable intake on that day based
      on review of uploaded photos and descriptions. Those in the intervention group, who were
      asked to use a checklist to count their red/orange vegetable intake and set a goal to eat one
      more the next day, improved their vegetable intake.

    <description>This intervention applied two constructs from the goal setting theory—self-monitoring and goal setting. Briefly, all participants were asked to take photos of all their meals and upload them with descriptions to an online platform. The participants in the experimental group were taken through two additional processes that represented these two constructs. Self-monitoring was operationalized by asking those in the experimental group to count the number of times they ate red/orange vegetables using a counting checklist. Goal setting was operationalized as asking them to set a goal to eat red/orange vegetables one more time tomorrow.</description>
