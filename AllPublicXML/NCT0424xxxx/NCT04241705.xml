  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reactive and proactive case detection measures are widely implemented by national malaria
      elimination programs globally. Similarly, the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health decided to
      include reactive case detection (RCD) and targeted mass drug administration (tMDA) approaches
      as part of their elimination strategy, along with rigorous evaluation. This study aims to
      evaluate the impact on annual parasite incidence (API) and cost-effectiveness of implementing
      tMDA and RCD within a 100-meter radius of passively detected index case, compared with
      standard of care in the control arm. In addition, cross-sectional surveys will measure the
      change in malaria prevalence over the two-year study intervention period. The aim is to
      generate evidence to inform Ethiopia's national strategy for malaria elimination.

      Study design: Cluster randomized controlled trial

      Primary aim: To compare the effect of targeted mass drug administration (tMDA) versus
      reactive case detection (RCD) on reducing malaria incidence

      Study site: Elimination targeted areas within East Hararghe Zones, Oromia Regional State,
      which is comprised of 24 woredas/districts

      Cluster or unit of randomization: Kebeles will be randomized to the control, RCD or tMDA arms
      using simple randomization

      Evaluation methods: The primary outcome measure of annual parasite incidence (API) will be
      obtained through routine surveillance data at all health facilities (health centers and
      health posts).

      Secondary outcomes will be measured through cross-sectional surveys and study monitoring
      data:

        1. Case investigation. At the time of diagnosis of the index case and enrollment of
           community members to the study, a short questionnaire will be administered to collect
           demographic data and assess malaria risk, including past malaria treatment and travel
           history, access to malaria interventions, occupation, etc.

        2. Cross-sectional surveys. At baseline and end of the study period (year 2),
           cross-sectional household surveys will be conducted to assess malaria prevalence,
           household and individual risk factors for malaria, including access to malaria
           interventions. It will also assess knowledge of, attitude towards, and participation in
           the study intervention.

        3. Longitudinal feasibility measurements: Coverage of RCD or tMDA in the target population,
           acceptability of RCD or tMDA in the target population, serious adverse event (SAE)
           reports, adherence measured by self-report and pill count, and cost data from all arms

        4. Laboratory testing: The conventional rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria will be
           used in the RCD arm. Dried blood spots (DBS) will be collected for molecular and
           serological testing during the cross-sectional surveys in all arms. DBS collected in
           incident cases as part of routine surveillance as well as during the RCD activities will
           also be utilized for antigen, antibody, and molecular testing. G6PD testing will be used
           in the RCD and tMDA arm to guide primaquine (PQ) treatment.

      Sample size: To measure the primary outcome, change in incidence, 16,000 Households (HH) (16
      clusters, 1,000 HH each) per arm will be included in the study. For the cross-sectional
      surveys, 320 randomly selected HHs per arm (16 clusters, 20HH/cluster) will be included.

    <measure>Change in malaria annual parasite incidence (API)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of RCD or tMDA will be defined as a change in malaria API among residents measured by microscopy/RDT through health centers and health posts. The malaria API will be defined as all passively detected RDT or microscopy confirmed cases over a period of 12 months, who are residents of the kebele divided by the estimated population in the intervention kebele multiplied by 1000. The primary effectiveness endpoint will therefore be API among residents of the kebele at baseline and year 2 of each intervention group of study clusters, compared with the control clusters.</description>

    <measure>Malaria burden, measured by antigen test</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>Testing for pan-Plasmodium antigens aldolase and LDH will determine active infection with malaria parasite, and, if the infecting species is Pf, by the presence of HRP2 antigen (Plucinski, Herman et al. 2018).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Malaria burden, measured by serology</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>Sero-prevalence will be determined using LUMINEX based multiplex assays. Age-specific sero-conversion and sero-reversion rates over the two years will be used to monitor changes in transmission and malaria exposure over time. Absence of antimalarial antibodies, particularly in children, will show the success of tMDA or RCD interventions. Antigen selection will be informed by recent studies by EPHI and CDC and a panel of antibodies characterized to indicate recent change in transmission will be included (Kerkhof, Sluydts et al. 2016).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Malaria burden, measured by molecular testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>Real-time quantitative (qPCR) for parasite detection will be performed by targeting the 18S small rRNA gene for Pf and Pv using primer and probe sequences. Pf parasites will be quantified using standard curves generated from a serial dilution of NF54 ring stage parasites. Pv parasite quantification will be done using plasmid constructs to infer copy numbers as described before. Blood samples in RNA protect buffers will be used for extraction of RNA using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) for gametocyte quantification, gametocyte commitment and maturation assays, sex ratio estimation, asexual stage parasites detection, and expression level of regulators of the balance between reproduction and replication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Costs</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the costs of RCD and tMDA. Costs will be calculated using an ingredients approach that involves enumerating both the quantity of specific inputs (e.g., hours spent, cost of treatment, number of RDTs used, etc.) and the time spent during the intervention. Quantity and time will be converted to a common monetary cost measure. Existing infrastructure and recurrent inputs that would be present in the absence of the intervention will not be included in cost analysis. The emphasis of the cost analysis is on determining the cost of RCD and tMDA alone.</description>
