  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, multi-center, single and cyclic ascending dose study of P-PSMA-101 autologous
      CAR-T cells in patients with mCRPC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 study that will follow a 3 + 3 design of
      dose-escalating cohorts of single and multiple doses of P-PSMA-101 to determine a Recommended
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Additional participants will be treated with P-PSMA-101 at the
      determined RP2D.

      Following consent, enrolled participants will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to obtain
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) which will be sent to a manufacturing site to
      produce P-PSMA-101 CAR-T cells. The cells will then be returned to the investigational site
      and administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen. Rimiducid may be administered
      as indicated.
