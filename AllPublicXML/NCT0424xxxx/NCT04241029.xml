      This study evaluates the safety of the probiotic compound IDOFORM TRAVEL® in patients with
      ulcerative colitis undergoing anti-TNF treatment with insufficient clinical response.
      Furthermore, the study aims to explore the composition of the bacteria of the gut as well as
      the immunological activity in patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing anti-TNF treatment,
      aiming to identify differences between groups of patients responding and not responding
      adequately to treatment.

      The project will explore whether probiotics have beneficial effects as adjuvant therapy in
      ulcerative colitis patients with insufficient response to anti-TNF treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of anti TNF agents has improved the medical treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC).
      However, one third of patients receiving such treatment will not reach remission. Studies
      have demonstrated that the gut microbiome influences the cytokine response and in particular
      the TNF production. In this study we aim to manipulate the gut microbiome in patients with
      ulcerative colitis not responding to anti-TNF therapy to evaluate potential beneficial
      effects.

      20 UC patients with insufficient response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy
      upon routine evaluation colonoscopy 6-12 months after start of treatment will receive
      intervention with the probiotic formula IDOFORM Travel®, 4 capsules daily for 8 weeks. A
      colonoscopy will be performed at baseline (week 0) and after intervention (week8). Gut
      biopsies, fecal samples and serological markers will, in addition to clinical examination and
      endoscopic results, be used to evaluate the safety and possible beneficial effects of the
      intervention.

      In a subsidiary cross-sectional study, 20 UC patients on anti-TNF therapy in remission upon
      evaluation colonoscopy will serve as controls. 20 individuals with no history of inflammatory
      bowel disease will be recruited as healthy controls.
