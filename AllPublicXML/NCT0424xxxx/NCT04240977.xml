  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a phone-intervention called HOBSCOTCH will
      improve health, daily functioning and quality of life among patients with refractory
      epilepsy. HOBSCOTCH stands for &quot;Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes
      Lives.&quot; This study will also help to find the best ways of integrating this telehealth
      intervention to routine clinic use.

      The proposed project will assess the efficacy of an 8-week phone-delivered, experimental
      treatment called &quot;Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives&quot;
      (HOBSCOTCH) on sixty patients with refractory epilepsy (PWRE). The investigators will employ
      a prospective, single blind randomized clinical trial design with wait-list controls to
      examine both objective and subjective measures of daily life, daily functioning, cognition,
      and emotional well-being. Investigators will also assess the impact of HOBSCOTCH on
      employment and work productivity using the Lam Employment absence and Disability Scale
      (LEAPS) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Lastly, the investigators will examine
      whether changes in these domains are maintained three months after completion of the
      intervention. The study will expand the efficacy literature for HOBSCOTCH and further refine
      its use in a busy clinical environment, and therefore has potential to benefit the patient
      population (PWRE), who currently lacks treatment options besides the pharmacological and
      surgical care currently available.

    <description>Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives (HOBSCOTCH) is a novel phone-based intervention that is enables acquisition of cognitive skills in line with problem solving therapy (PST), and is well suited for PWRE who have failed all other treatment alternatives. Sessions #2 through #7 focus on building patient's awareness for their own day-to-day memory problems, brainstorming, implementing and reviewing the outcomes of potential solutions they generate themselves using the PST framework. In each of these sessions, providers will assist patients in generating alternative solutions, in thinking through what the implementation of each strategy would entail, and in helping them review outcomes for adopted strategies to refine their approach for optimized adoption and generalization.</description>
