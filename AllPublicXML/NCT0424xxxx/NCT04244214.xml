  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the world's most common neurologic disorders of the young
      adults leading to severe disability. Fatigue is one of most common symptoms that persons with
      MS experience, having significant impact on their quality of life and limiting their activity
      levels. Self-management strategies are used to support them in the care of their health.
      Mobile health (mHealth) solutions are a way to offer persons with chronic conditions tools to
      successfully manage their symptoms and problems. User-centered design (UCD) is a design
      philosophy that proposes placing end-users' needs and characteristics in the center of
      software design and development and involving users early in the different phases of the
      software life cycle. More Stamina is an mHealth solution created following UCD principles to
      help persons with MS manage their fatigue.

      A mixed methods multicenter study will be used to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      usability of More Stamina. The study will take place during the first and second quarters of
      2020 (Q3-Q4 2020) in three locations: Argentina, Spain and Switzerland. A longitudinal cohort
      study will take place, along with think-aloud protocols, open-ended interviews and short
      answer questionnaires will be used. Persons with MS will be recruited from the different
      locations. This study seeks to enroll at least 20 patients that meet the criteria from each
      site for the longitudinal cohort study (total N=60).
