  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the fact that neoadjuvant therapy for malignant melanoma is in the exploratory
      stage, and the current data on neoadjuvant immunology are mainly from European and American
      populations, it is necessary to carry out clinical trials in the status of neoadjuvant
      immunotherapy for patients with melanoma in China. Toripalimab has been extensively studied
      in the field of malignant melanoma, and its effectiveness and safety have been proven.
      Therefore, the investigators initiated a single-arm exploratory study to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of Toripalimab in neoadjuvant treatment of patients with BRAF V600
      wild-type malignant melanoma.
