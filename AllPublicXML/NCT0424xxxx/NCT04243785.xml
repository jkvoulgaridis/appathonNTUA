  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) as well as preliminary efficacy of BTX-A51 capsules in participants
      with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS).

      The study will be done in two phases. Phase 1a of this study is designed to determine the
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of orally administered
      BTX-A51 in up to 35 participants who are evaluable for toxicity. Once the MTD is determined,
      it is planned that an additional 15 participants will be enrolled in Phase 1b of this study
      for additional experience with safety and efficacy, and to determine the recommended Phase 2
      dose (RP2D) which may or may not be different from the MTD.

      Continued treatment will be available under this study protocol for up to eight 28-day cycles
      (Continued Treatment Phase) if the Investigator judges the benefit outweighs the risk.

      Once BTX-A51 treatment has completed, participants will be contacted by telephone every 3
      months for up to 2 years after their last treatment for survival status and anticancer
      therapy (Overall Survival Follow-up).

    <description>Dosing in this phase of the study consists of the first cycle of therapy (i.e., 28 days consisting of 3 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week with no study drug). The BTX-A51 starting dose for Cohort 1 is 1 mg, to be given 5 days per week (maximum weekly dose of 5 mg). Beginning with Cohort 2, doses are intended to be administered 3 days per week. Barring dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), sequential dose escalation of BTX-A51 is planned with up to a total of eight dose levels to a maximum of 20 mg (60 mg/week); on the basis of these an MTD will be identified. The numbers of participants and actual doses administered will be determined using a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design to determine the DLTs and MTD of BTX-A51.</description>
