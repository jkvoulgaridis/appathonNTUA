      intervention delivered remotely via videoconferencing on adults with Parkinson's Disease and
      anxiety symptoms.

      A single group intervention study of adults (18-80 years-old) with Parkinson's Disease and
      anxiety symptoms undergoing a 6-week intervention of 30-minute yoga classes delivered
      remotely through videoconferencing 2-3 times per week. Subjects with symptoms of anxiety as
      indicated by their score on the Parkinson's Anxiety Scale will complete yoga classes
      delivered at-home with videoconferencing, receiving one-on-one yoga instruction including
      breathing, postures, and meditation/relaxation for two-three times a week. Data collection
      will occur remotely via videoconferencing at 0-weeks, 6-weeks after a waiting period,
      12-weeks after the intervention, and 6-weeks after the last lab visit. Data collection will
      include demographics, mental health questionnaires, motor assessments, enjoyment, usability,
      and follow-up yoga status. Each yoga session will be video recorded to aide in recording
      adherence, adverse events, and challenges.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single group intervention study of adults (18-80 years-old) with Parkinson's Disease and anxiety symptoms undergoing a 6-week intervention of 30-minute yoga classes delivered remotely through videoconferencing 2-3 times per week. There will be baseline testing, a 6-week waiting period, timepoint-two testing, a 6-week intervention, post-intervention testing, and 6-week follow-up testing.</intervention_model_description>

Persistent anxiety, episodic anxiety, and avoidance behavior. Participants answer questions on a scale from &quot;not or never&quot; (0) to &quot;severe or almost always&quot; (4) with a potential score range of 0-48. Higher score indicates greater symptoms of anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>follow-up (at 18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-item self-report PAS will be used to assess anxiety symptoms. It takes approximately 2-minutes to complete and is a 12-item scale with three sub-scales assessing 1. Persistent anxiety, episodic anxiety, and avoidance behavior.

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 weeks), timepoint-2 (6-weeks), post-intervention (12-weeks) and at follow-up (6-weeks after post-intervention testing)</time_frame>
    <description>The 21- item self-report BDI-II will be used to measure symptoms of depression. For each item the subject must choose one out of 4 statements of increasing severity regarding a specific symptom of depression. It is written approximately at a 5th grade reading level and takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. Potential scores range from 0-63 with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>The 50 item UPDRS will be used to assess motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease. It contains four sections 1. Mentation, Behavior, Mood; 2. Activities of Daily Living; 3. Motor Examination; and 4. Complications of Therapy. We will administer a modified version of this assessment in order to administer it remotely via videoconferencing.

    <description>The FTST, functional measure, will be administered to assess physical function. It will be administered using a chair in the participants' homes over a one-on-one Zoom videoconference. Participants will be encouraged to have another adult present during this portion of the data collection in case there is any loss of balance. Participants will be encouraged to use an armless chair approximately 63 centimeters from the ground and any deviation from this standard procedure will be documented. Time in seconds it takes the participant to raise from the chair 5 times will be recorded. Longer times will indicate poorer physical function.</description>
