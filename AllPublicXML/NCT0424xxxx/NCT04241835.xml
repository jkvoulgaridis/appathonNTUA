  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, 2-part, global, multicenter, open-label, PK, safety and tolerability study
      of oral tazemetostat in subjects with either advanced solid tumors, or hematological
      malignancies and normal hepatic function or moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts for subjects with advanced malignancies and either
      normal liver function, or advanced malignancies and moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.
      Subjects in Part 1 of the study will receive a single oral, 800 mg dose of tazemetostat on
      Day 1 and Day 15. In addition, the subjects will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose)
      tablets to be taken twice daily from Day 5 to Day 14. Blood samples for PK analysis will be
      obtained on Day 1 through Day 4 and again on Day 15 through Day 18. Part 1 ends on Day 18.

      Subjects continuing treatment in Part 2 will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose) tablets
      to be taken twice daily in repeated 28-day cycles beginning on Day 19 until
      Investigator-assessed clinical progression per standard practice, or unacceptable toxicity,
      or until another discontinuation criterion is met. Subjects must have an end of study visit
      after 30 days of the last dose of tazemetostat for safety assessment. Supplementary study
      conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the
      accompanying procedure manuals (i.e., laboratory, pharmacy, ECG manuals). Such manuals will
      provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does
      not impact subject safety.

          8. All subjects must have completed any prior chemotherapy, targeted therapy and major
             surgery, ≥ 28 days before study entry. For daily or weekly chemotherapy without the
             potential for delayed toxicity, a washout period of 14 days may be acceptable, and
             questions related to this can be discussed with the Medical Monitor.

          9. Has adequate hematologic (bone marrow [BM] and coagulation factors), and renal
             function.

         10. Able to swallow and retain orally-administered medication and without clinically
             significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that could alter absorption such as
             malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.

         11. Subjects with abnormal hepatic function will be eligible and will be grouped according
             to established criteria. Subjects with active hemolysis will be excluded.

             count (CBC) testing.

         13. Male subjects must refrain from donating sperm starting at least 7 days before the
             planned first dose of tazemetostat until 3 months following the last dose of
             tazemetostat.

         14. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must:

               1. Be vasectomized, or

               2. Remain abstinent or use a condom starting at least 7 days before the planned
                  first dose of IP until 3 months following the last dose of IP

         15. Female partners of male subjects who are of childbearing potential must also adhere to
             one of the following:

               1. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.

               2. Established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception
                  plus an additional barrier method.

               3. Progesterone-only oral contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the
                  primary mode of action.

                  last dose of IP

               2. Due to the potential of enzyme induction with tazemetostat, female subjects who
                  use hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of birth
                  control while on study treatment and for 6 months after discontinuation of study
                  treatment.

                  lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer).

               3. Subjects may take prophylactic antimicrobials, however subjects that are taking
                  specific antimicrobial drugs where there may be DDI or overlapping toxicities
                  should be excluded from study participation.

               4. Subjects should be on established anti-retroviral therapy for at least 4 weeks,
                  and have an HIV viral load of &lt; 400 copies/mL prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  treatment of osteoporosis.

               2. The concurrent use of all herbal supplements is prohibited during the study as
