      A randomized, multicenter, prospective PHASE II trial to assess the effect of short- versus
      long-term adjuvant ADT with high dose salvage radiotherapy on distant metastasis free
      survival in case of biochemical relapse (BR) after radical prostatectomy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy (RP) is one of the standard treatment options for localized and locally
      advanced prostate cancer. RP should be combined with an extended pelvic lymph node dissection
      (ePLND) when the risk of pelvic involvement becomes substantial, at least 7%. In case of
      node-negative disease (pN0), adverse pathological features at examination of the RP-specimen
      such as extra-capsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and positive surgical
      margins (PSM) increase the risk of biochemical relapse (BR) and/or isolated local relapse
      (LR). Both a BR and LR, if not adequately treated, can finally result in the development of
      distant metastasis.

      In case of BR and/or LR, salvage radiotherapy (SRT) is the only treatment option with
      curative intent. Several factors play a significant role in predicting the outcome after SRT:
      Gleason score, pre-SRT PSA, pre-SRT doubling time, SVI, SRT dose and duration of adjuvant
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) associated with SRT. The 2 latter variables have never
      been tested in a randomized controlled trial. The GETUG-AFU 16 trial randomized between no
      vs. 6 months ADT while patients received 66 Gy to the prostate bed and 46 Gy to the pelvis.
      Moreover, the pN0 status was not needed for inclusion. Also the RADICALS trial is currently
      running this comparison with a radiation dose of 66 Gy to the prostate bed and also no
      information on pN status is needed to be included in this study. In the LOBSTER study, the
      pN0 status is obligatory and the prescription dose is set at 70 Gy to the prostate bed and
      seminal vesicles. These conditions make this study unique compared to other already conducted
      and currently running trials.

      In previous work, it has been demonstrated that ADT, added for 6 months to SRT, significantly
      improved biochemical relapse free survival at 5 years. Added to this, there is recent
      evidence that using a longer schedule of adjuvant ADT might be beneficial when compared to a
      6-months schedule. Unfortunately, none of these suggestions are based on evidence coming from
      a randomized controlled trial.

      Therefore, this randomized phase 2 trial 'LOBSTER' is conducted, comparing 6 versus 24 months
      of adjuvant ADT together with high-dose SRT in case of BR after RP in pN0 prostate cancer
      patients

    <description>Time to appearance of M1a-b-c disease. In order to assess the absence/presence of M1a-M1c disease as early as possible, top-of-the-line imaging will be conducted in case of BR during follow-up after SRT and after agreement of the multidisciplinary uro-oncology team. Time point zero is the last day of radiotherapy (also applies for secondary endpoints). Top of the line imaging includes: CT thorax abdomen and bone scintigraphy (standard). PSMA PET-CT is allowed but not obligatory. Patients who are also included in the diagnostic imaging study are required to receive a PSMA PET-CT. Whole body MRI is allowed but not obligatory. BR is defined as any rise in PSA above the level of 0.2 ng/ml after a postradiotherapy nadir or a continued rise in the serum PSA despite salvage treatment (3). In case a BR is not accompanied by metastatic progression, PSMA PET/CT will be repeated every 6 months or earlier in case of prostate cancer-related symptoms.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of histologically proven prostate cancer, treated with RP and ePLND. All
             patients have to be pN0. The minimal template for ePLND is defined as the removal of
             the external iliac, internal iliac and obturator nodes (standard template). Removal of
             the presacral and common iliac nodes is left at the discretion of the treating
             urologist.

          -  Asymptomatic PSA-rise post-RP, defined as a value equal to or more than 0.2µg/l and at
             least confirmed once (interval ≥2 weeks, confirmation PSA level should be higher). In
             case of Gleason 8-10, pT3b or R1 resection, an asymptomatic PSA-rise post-RP starting
             from ≥0.15 µg/l is allowed for inclusion. If the PSA-level is less than 0.4 ng/ml, no
             additional staging for distant metastasis is required before inclusion in the trial.
             The patient will be offered the opportunity to participate in a diagnostic sub-study
             with investigational imaging with 18F PSMA PET CT. However in case of PSA-level &gt;0.4
             ng/ml, biological imaging using 18F-PSMA or 68Ga-PSMA is mandatory as this is not
             considered investigational anymore. Therefore the patient cannot anymore take part in
             the diagnostic sub-study and (un-blinded) PET-CT is obligatory to rule out lymph node
             (N) and /or distant metastasis (M1a-c) before inclusion.

          -  Testosterone levels within above 150 ng/dl.

          -  ECOG 0-1

          -  Life expectancy more than 5 years

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of pN1 disease at original surgical specimen.

          -  Presence of distant metastasis at time of referral (M1a-c). If PSA more than 0.4
             ng/ml, imaging with PET-CT is required to rule out distant metastasis (see above).
             Other additional imaging modalities (CT scan, bone scintigraphy...) are allowed but
             left at the discretion of the treating centre.

          -  Undetectable PSA (less than 0.2 ng/ml) at time of referral.

          -  Previous RT making new RT impossible (overlapping treatment fields).

          -  Known contraindications to irradiation (Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn Disease, Ataxia
             Teleangiectasia…)

          -  Active treatment with ADT or PSA modulating drugs (finasteride, dutasteride, high-dose
             corticoids…)

          -  Not able understanding treatment protocol or signing informed consent.
