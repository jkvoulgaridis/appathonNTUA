  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several surgical techniques and various adjunctive agents have been used to covered Gingival
      Recession (GR) and promote clinical outcomes. The treatment of the GR more used (gold
      standard) is the root coverage with surgical procedures and connective tissue graft, but it
      has limitations due to the conditions of the donor graft. Is necessary develop other
      biomaterials for these cases.

      The platelet rich fibrin is a autologous biomaterial that has gained tremendous momentum
      having been utilized for a variety of dental and medical procedures including periodontal
      surgeries. However, results remain contradictory and mainly focus on the hard and soft tissue
      healing, aesthetics and postoperative discomfort.

      The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of coronal advanced flap
      (CAF) and CAF + Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) on Root coverage (RC) over a period of 24 month.

    <description>Evaluation of the presence and absence of bleeding in the gingival margin through the gingival sulcus. The index is calculated after penetration of the sulcus by the periodontal probe, bleeding surfaces are noted and then counted. The index is calculated by dividing the number of surfaces that bleed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100 to reach the percentage of bleeding index.</description>
