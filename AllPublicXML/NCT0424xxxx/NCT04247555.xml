  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality despite of numerous advances and
      intensive research in perinatal medicine. Almost one million children die every year due to
      the complications of preterm birth and rates are on the rise. Of the 14 million survivors per
      year, most face a lifetime of disability, including learning disabilities, visual and hearing
      impairments. The majority of preterm birth happen spontaneously (SPTD) which is often a multi
      factorial event, precocious cervical softening, shortening and dilatation are a common
      underlying factor. In the scope of this project the investigators propose to develop and
      clinically validate a new device, Cervix Monitor (CM), for detecting cervix conditions
      leading to SPTD and its risk assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SPTD is closely related to a premature cervical ripening. The scientific basis for the
      proposed project is that the elasticity modulus of a cervix is a more sensitive parameter
      characterizing the stage of cervical ripening. The main component of the cervical tissue is
      collagen. Cervical ripening is the result of realignment of collagen, degradation of collagen
      cross-linking due to proteolytic enzymes. These processes affect the elasticity modulus of
      the cervical tissue. Therefore, assessment of cervix by a device (CM) measuring cervical
      elasticity (stiffness) and cervical length (effacement) appears to be an adequate approach
      for identifying pregnant women at high risk of SPTD. The CM is based on measuring applied
      pressure to the cervix by a tactile sensor array (stress data) and ultrasound measurement of
      cervix length (strain data). Tactile and ultrasound sensors are allocated on the tip of the
      measuring part of vaginal probe. The discovery of novel bio markers that could reliably
      identify women who will subsequently deliver preterm, may allow for timely medical
      intervention and targeted therapeutic treatments aimed at improving maternal and fetal
      outcomes.
