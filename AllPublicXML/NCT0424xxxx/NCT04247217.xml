  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is currently revolutionizing the field in oncology. However, prostate cancer
      until now fails to respond to classical IO, like PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Radiotherapy
      (RT) delivered to the primary tumor impacts both tumor cells and surrounding stromal cells.
      Radiation damage to cancer cells exposes tumor-specific antigens leading to increased
      visibility to the immune system by improved priming and activation of cytotoxic T cells.
      RT-induced modulation of the tumor microenvironment may also facilitate the recruitment and
      infiltration of immune cells by increasing the expression or T-cell attracting chemokines and
      by increasing T-cell docking molecules on the endothelial cells like VCAM-1. The
      main-hypothesis is that HDR-brachytherapy will turn an immunologically &quot;cold&quot; (no T-cell
      infiltrations) prostate cancer into an immunologically &quot;hot&quot; (CD4 and CD8-cell infiltrations)
      tumor, creating leverage points for different forms of IO.

      Prospective analysis of biopsies from 10 patients with local recurrence in the prostate
      selected for salvage HDR brachytherapy in MAASTRO Clinic, Maastricht. HDR treatment is
      standard in Maastro Clinic for local relapses of prostate cancer after previously irradiation
      (internal or external).

      Biopsies will be taken at 4 different time points (before and after the 1st fraction; before
      the 2nd and 3rd fraction of the salvage treatment).

      Several immunotyping (expression of PD-(L)-1, CXCL12, IL-23 receptor, etc.) and HLA class I
      expression will be performed on the biopsies. In addition, HLA genotypes will be determined
      on DNA isolated from pheripheral blood.

      The plasma and the biopsies will be stored for eventually additional research.
