    <textblock>
      This double-blind, randomized crossover trial assessed inflammation and fatigue following a
      fast-food-type meal (saturated fat) compared to a healthier meal (monounsaturated fat) in
      breast cancer survivors and benign controls (women who had an initial abnormal test for
      breast cancer).

    <measure>Fatigue at Follow-Up Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey was administered upon admission to the Clinical Research Center before the meal at both visits and at 18- and 30-month follow-up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-item Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short form assesses behavioral, cognitive, physical, and affective expressions of fatigue. It provides a very good measure of the multidimensional aspects of fatigue, allows for comparisons between fatigued and non-fatigued individuals, and has subscales measuring general, physical, emotional, mental, and vigor aspects of fatigue, as well as a total score.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We recruited a subset of a larger parent longitudinal observational study to
             participate in this study. Initially, participants were recruited following an
             abnormal mammogram, which resulted in either a malignant (cancer group) or benign
             (non-cancer control group) diagnosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of any prior cancer except basal or squamous cell, chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease, evidence of liver or kidney failure, symptomatic ischemic heart
             disease, significant visual or auditory problems, cognitive impairment, major medical
             conditions involving the immune system such as diabetes, autoimmune and/or
             inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, alcohol
             or drug abuse, marked and recurrent gastrointestinal problems, or regular use of
             medications with major immunological consequences, e.g., steroids.
