    <textblock>
      The Ageing in a Networked Society -Social Experiment study (ANS-SE) is a randomised
      controlled trial on older people residing in Abbiategrasso, a middle-size city located in the
      Milan area (Italy) and aims to assess the impact of SNS use on loneliness, that is the
      primary outcome of this study. The study is constituted of two stages, i.e. the baseline and
      the follow up. The experiment is structured into two treatment groups and a control group;
      the interventions are the attendance to a course on SNS use (T1) and lifestyle education and
      brain functioning (T2). The control group (C) is constituted of a waiting list. The study is
      part of the project &quot;Aging in a networked society. Older people, social networks and
      well-being&quot;, funded by the Italian Fondazione Cariplo.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the short-term and long-term impact of Facebook use
      on physical and mental health of older people. The experiment is carried out on 180
      participants of the Brain Aging in Abbiategrasso Study (InveCe).The InveCE study is a
      biannual cohort study of older people born between 1935 and 1939 and living in Abbiategrasso,
      a town near Milan, in northern Italy (NCT01345110, ClinicalTrials.gov). For more information,
      see http://www.golgicenci.it/en/studio-invece/.

      Participants are selected among those who agreed to take part in the 4th wave of the
      InveCe.Ab study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified in the Eligibility box below.
      The study is constituted of two stages, i.e. the baseline and the follow up. The experiment
      is structured into two treatment groups and a control group; the interventions are the
      attendance to a course on SNS use (T1) and lifestyle education and brain functioning (T2).
      The control group (C) is constituted of a waiting list. Participant are assigned to one of
      these three groups randomly. Before/after the intervention, researchers administered a
      questionaire to participants to measure levels of loneliness, depression and
      neuropsychological functioning (see the box &quot;Outcome Measure&quot; for the description of the
      scales and measures used), together with a medical examination. The same assessment will be
      performed after one year. Data collected will be analyzed using statistical techniques in
      order to evaluate the impact of Facebook use on well-being.

      The study is part of the project &quot;Aging in a networked society. Older people, social networks
      and well-being&quot;, funded by the Italian Fondazione Cariplo.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention consists of the attendance to two training courses. T1 study members attended a three week course (two classes per week) on smartphones and SNS use. T2 study members attended 5 interactive 90-min meetings on lifestyle education and brain functioning in older people. A goodbye tea was offered after T2 meetings. Throughout the duration of the intervention, we put C study members on a waiting list; at the end of the intervention, in June 2019, interested group C study members attended the SNSs course (held on June 2019). One year after the first intervention, i.e. in March 2020, we will carry out a follow up assessment on T1 and T2 participants. Note that, due to the constraints imposed by the ethical committee (i.e. we offered members of the C group the possibility to attend the SNS course during the first intervention), the members of the C group are excluded from the follow up.</intervention_model_description>
