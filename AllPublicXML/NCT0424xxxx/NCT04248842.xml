  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients admitted to the medical ward, it is often difficult to predict if their clinical
      condition will deteriorate, however subtle changes in vital signs are usually present 8 to 24
      hours before a life-threatening event such as respiratory failure leading to ICU admission,
      or unanticipated cardiac arrest. Such adverse trends in clinical observations can be missed,
      misinterpreted or not appreciated as urgent. New continuous and wearable 27/7 clinical vital
      parameter monitoring systems offer a unique possibility to identify clinical deterioration
      before patients condition progress beyond the point-of-no-return, where adverse events are
      inevitable. As part of the WARD-COPD project, this validation study aim to assess the
      accuracy of physiologic parameters derived from standard and wireless patient monitors
