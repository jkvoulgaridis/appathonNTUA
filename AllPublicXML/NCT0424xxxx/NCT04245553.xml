  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracentesis is a bedside procedure in which a needle is inserted into a patient's peritoneum
      in order to obtain ascitic fluid. This is a safe bedside procedure with very low risks of
      complications that is usually performed using physical exam maneuvers to determine the site
      of needle insertion. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) technology has improved the safety of
      central venous catheter insertion and thoracentesis, yet the data on safety in paracentesis
      is equivocal. In a practical study, we aim to determine if POCUS will change the needle
      insertion site over the traditional anatomic landmarking method. Operators will landmark for
      paracentesis using conventional physical exam and then utilize POCUS to determine if there is
      a more optimal site. The primary endpoint will be whether POCUS yielded a change in the
      needle insertion site, as defined by a location greater than 5cm from the anatomic site, at
      least 20% of the time. The results will further our understanding of POCUS in improving
      procedural safety, thereby adding to the currently limited literature on this topic.
      Furthermore, this study will inform residency training programs about the utility in POCUS
      training for paracentesis and may advocate for the availability of POCUS devices to
      physicians performing this procedure.

    <description>Does the clinician performing the procedure prefer the needle insertion site found using point of care ultrasound, or using the traditional anatomic method. A clinically significant difference in location is defined as greater than or equal to 5cm apart. If the difference in locations is not at least 5cm apart, this will be defined as no preference in land-marking methods.</description>

          -  Operators will be recruited on a volunteer basis and will include medical residents or
             subspecialty fellows with knowledge of POCUS for paracentesis purposes, either through
             core residency programs or more advanced training.
