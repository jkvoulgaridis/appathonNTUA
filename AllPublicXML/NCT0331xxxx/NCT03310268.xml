  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide evidence of clinical efficacy of an experimental
      dentifrice containing stannous fluoride (SnF2) compared to regular fluoride dentifrice in the
      reduction of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH). This study will be considered successful if
      there is a statistically significant difference in the primary efficacy variable, change from
      baseline in Schiff sensitivity score, after 8 weeks of treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, 3 treatment arm,
      parallel group design study, stratified by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score (of the
      two selected test teeth), with a treatment period of 8 weeks. DH will be assessed following
      an acclimatization period of 2-6 weeks at Baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks treatment. The
      study will be conducted in healthy participants with pre-existing self-reported and
      clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity at Screening. A standard fluoride dentifrice with no
      specific anti-sensitivity, anti-gingivitis and anti-plaque activity will be included as the
      negative control. A Chinese marketed positive control dentifrice with sensitivity benefits
      (containing stannous chloride (SnCl2)) will also be included in this study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score After 8 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows - 0: Participant did not respond to air stimulation; 1: Participant responded to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responded to air stimulus and requested discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responded to stimulus, considered stimulus to be painful, and requested discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score will be indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold After 8 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10 grams (g) and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score After 8 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows - 0: Participant did not respond to air stimulation; 1: Participant responded to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responded to air stimulus and requested discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responded to stimulus, considered stimulus to be painful, and requested discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score will be indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold After 8 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10 grams (g) and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population included those participants who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study treatment, and had at least 1 post baseline efficacy evaluation. This population was based on the treatment to which the subject was randomized. The primary population for assessment of efficacy was the ITT population.</population>
