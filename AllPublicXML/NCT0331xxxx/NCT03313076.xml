  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a safe, effective, and readily available treatment that
      will prevent chronic pain following Major Thermal Burn Injury (MThBI). Burn survivors are
      prone to develop chronic pain and there is an urgent unmet need for preventative treatments.
      The preventative treatments proposed for this study, Omega-3 Fatty Acids (O3FA) and Vitamin D
      have been selected given effectiveness across a range of painful musculoskeletal disorders
      and their wide availability and low cost. This study is a 2x2 factorial, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial test for the effectiveness of O3FA and Vitamin
      D to prevent chronic pain development. Burn survivors will be enrolled who have experienced
      thermal burns that cover less than 30% total body surface area that are severe enough to
      warrant surgical management, which represents the most common burn injury characteristics.
      Patients will be enrolled within 72 hours of their burn, and randomized via 1:1:1:1
      allocation to receive placebo, O3FA, Vitamin D or both. We will obtain blood samples on
      enrollment and at 6 weeks to assist in elucidating key mechanisms by which O3FA and Vitamin D
      reduce chronic pain following MThBI. Chronic pain severity, assessed with a 0-10 numeric
      rating scale at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year will be entered into a
      repeated-measures model. Model estimated contrasts will serve as the primary outcome.

      Patients will be screened daily. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be approached
      for participation. Patients interested in participating will proceed through informed
      consent. Once informed consent is obtained, an initial questionnaire will be administered, a
      blood draw will be performed to assess for baseline Vitamin D/O3FA concentration and immune
      profile. Then patients will be randomized into one of 4 treatment arms in 1:1:1:1 allocation.
      Patients will receive study drug for 6 weeks following burn injury. Adverse event monitoring
      will occur daily while inpatient and weekly once discharged from the hospital through 6
      weeks. Patient compliance with the study drug will be assessed via patient-reported reported
      missing doses, pill counts at the end of the study, and a 6-week blood draw in which Vitamin
      D/O3FA levels and immune profile will be assessed. Patient-reported outcomes will be
      collected via follow-up survey at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year following burn
      injury.s, and 1 year following burn injury.

    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>A primary objective of this pilot study is to ensure safety of both treatments as well as combined. A qualitative review of treatment related adverse events will be performed and a determination about the degree of relatedness of each adverse event with the intervention using CTCAE criteria will be made.</description>

    <description>The primary objective of this pilot study is to ensure that the investigators are able to make follow-up assessments on a majority of participants. The percent of participants who are compliant with follow-up will be determined over the year following major burn injury. &gt;80% of enrolled participants at 6 weeks following MThBI.</description>

    <measure>By group efficacy estimates over year following thermal burn injury.</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1 year following MThBI</time_frame>
    <description>Estimates of efficacy will be obtained via repeated measures analysis of pain severity over the 1 year following injury using mixed effects models. Pain will be assessed using a 0-10 numeric rating scale with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating pain as severe as you can imagine. Higher scores represent worse outcome. These values (collected in identical fashion over 1 year following burn injury) will be entered into a linear mixed model, and overall effect estimates (beta coefficients) among groups will be determined.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>Examines existence of gender-based treatment response differences in pain severity measured by a 0-10 numeric rating scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most severe pain. Higher scores reflect greater pain (poor outcome).</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of mental health will be determined by the SF-12 mental component score. The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12 item participant completed questionnaire to measure general health. It includes a mental component score (MCS): ranging from 0 to 100 points. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good mental health.</description>

    <description>Assessment of physical health will be determined by the SF-12 physical component score. The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12 item participant completed questionnaire to measure general health. It includes a physical component score (PCS): ranging from 0 to 100 points.

    <measure>Pain Interference by treatment group measured by the Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>The degree to which pain interferes with important life function will be determined by the Brief Pain Inventory. This is a validated, self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain based on the average pain experienced and assesses impact of pain across 7 domains of life function (e.g., enjoyment of life, relationships, normal work). The severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). Higher scores reflect greater pain interference.</description>
