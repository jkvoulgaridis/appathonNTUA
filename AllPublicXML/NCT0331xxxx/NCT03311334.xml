  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter study of DSP-7888 in combination with
      checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) in adult patients with solid tumors, that
      consists of 2 parts: dose search part of the study (Phase 1b) and the dose expansion part of
      the study (Phase 2). In Phase 1b of this study there will be 2 arms: Arm 1 and Arm 2. In Arm
      1, there will be 6 to 12 patients who will be dosed with DSP-7888 and nivolumab and in Arm 2
      there will be 6 to 12 patients who will be dosed with DSP-7888 and pembrolizumab. Once the
      recommended dose is determined in Phase 1b, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) patients
      will be enrolled in Phase 2 of the study with DSP-7888, exploring the combination with
      pembrolizumab (Arm 2). In Phase 2, approximately 40 patients with PROC will be initially
      enrolled.
