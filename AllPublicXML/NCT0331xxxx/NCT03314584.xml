      Persistent headache is one of the most common debilitating symptoms in military personnel
      suffering from mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). This study aims to assess the long-term
      effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in managing MTBI related
      headaches for up to 2-3 months by comparing the treatment effect of active-rTMS to sham-rTMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headache is one of the most common debilitating chronic pain conditions in either active or
      retired military personnel with MTBI. This high prevalence of persistent chronic headache is
      often associated with neuropsychological dysfunction in mood, attention, and memory, which
      casts a profound negative impact on patients' quality of life and increases stress in their
      caregivers. Unfortunately, as witnessed by the investigators in their clinical practices,
      conventional pharmacological treatments for MTBI related headache (MTBI-HA) has not been
      shown to be effective and drugs such as narcotics contain many long-term untoward
      psychosomatic and abusive side effects. This calls for an urgent need in developing alternate
      and innovative long-term headache management strategies for this rapidly increasing patient
      population.

      Coinciding with other published treatment protocols related to traumatic brain injury and
      pain, this initial clinical evidence provides compelling support for the current proposal
      aiming to assess the effect of a longer duration of rTMS protocol in managing MTBI-HA for up
      to 10 weeks after the initiation of the treatment. Given existing treatment options for
      MTBI-HA are limited, validating such a non-pharmacological and non-invasive treatment option
      will significantly enhance the capability of the VA healthcare system in caring for this
      rapidly increasing patient population.

        1. PRE-TREATMENT PHASE (weeks 1-2) consists of Visit 1 (Screening Visit) and Visit 2
           (Pre-treatment Assessments);

        2. TREAMENT PHASE (week 3-4) consists of Visits 3-12 (Neuronagvigation guided rTMS
           consisting of 10 weekday treatments at &gt;24 and &lt; 72 hours apart, weekends excluded,
           maximum 5 weeks for treatment completion) rTMS will take place in Building 23 Room 105
           at the VASDHS; and

        3. POST-TREATMENT PHASE (week 5-14) consists of two initial weekly visits (Visits 13&amp;14)
           and two additional biweekly visits (Visits 15&amp;16) and one monthly visit (Visit 17).

      Brain anatomical and functional MRI will be performed within 72 hours after Visits 2 and 13.
      Subjects will be required to fill out headache diary between assessment visits. Headache
      assessments along with quality of life, mood and functions assessments will be carried out at
      Visits 1,2, and 13--17. This frequency of treatment and duration of follow-up is in line with
      recently published rTMS articles related to TBI, headache and pain, and also in accordance
      with the 3-month post treatment initiation follow-up guideline/recommendation [32; 55; 80].

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment Quality of Life scores</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed at the Baseline visit, 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month and 3-month post-treatment follow up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the self-assessed short form impact on quality of life (SF-36). The SF-36 has eight scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0 - 100 where Lower scores = more disability and higher scores = less disability The sections include: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.</description>

    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the administered Hamilton Scale for Depression. This contains 17 items to be rated (HDRS-17), but four other questions are not added to the total score and are used to provide additional clinical information. Each item on the questionnaire is scored on a 3 or 5 point scale, depending on the item, and the total score is compared to the corresponding descriptor.</description>
