  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Work2Prevent will advance the science by adapting, tailoring, and pilot-testing a novel
      social and structural-level HIV intervention for YMSM and YTW of color ages16-24 aimed at
      increasing economic stability (i.e., employment) through youth empowerment and asset
      development, and decreasing HIV risk behaviors (i.e., sex work) associated with social and
      economic marginalization.

    <measure>Information Systems Success Model Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (up to 2 weeks after completion of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Information Systems Success Model will be used to assess for intervention acceptability and satisfaction. The 21-item scale measures four sub-domains: information quality, handbook quality, perceived usefulness, and overall satisfaction. Every item is scored on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 5 being &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. Responses are averaged within each sub-domain to produce four sub-domain scores. The four sub-domain scores are then averaged to produce an overall ISSM score (1-5; higher scores indicate higher acceptability/satisfaction). This scale has been adapted from Horvath et al. 2013.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Workshop Completion</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (up to 2 weeks after completion of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Workshop completion will be used to assess for intervention feasibility. Intervention completion will be defined as having attended at least two of the four workshop sessions and will be measured by tracking participant attendance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Job Seeking Self-Efficacy Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Job seeking self-efficacy is defined as one's perceived ability and confidence to perform job search and application activities. The 12-item Job Seeking Self-Efficacy (JSS) scale by Barlow et al. 2002 uses response values on a 1-10 score, with 1 being &quot;Not At All Confident&quot; and 10 being &quot;Very Confident&quot;. Reponses are averaged to yield a total score, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy. Change in JSS will be calculated by subtracting the JSS score at baseline (T1) from the JSS score at the 8-month follow-up (T3) (-9 to +9; negative change indicates decreased self-efficacy, while positive change indicates increased self-efficacy).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Protean Career Attitude Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Protean career attitudes (PCAs) are defined as having self-direction in the pursuit of success in one's work. PCAs have previously been found to be associated with positive career satisfaction and self-perceived success (Volmer &amp; Spurk 2011). The validated 7-item scale by Porter et al. 2016 measures two sub-domains: self-directed attitudes and values-driven attitudes. Every item is scored on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 5 being &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. Responses are averaged within each sub-domain to produce two sub-domain scores, which are then averaged as well to produce an overall PCA score. Change in PCA score will be calculated by subtracting the score at baseline (T1) from the score at the 8-month follow-up (T3) (-4 to +4; negative change indicates decreased PCAs, while positive change indicates increased PCAs).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported employment status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Employment status will be assessed using self-reported average number of hours worked each week. Change in hours worked per week will be calculated by subtracting the baseline (T1) value from the follow-up (T3) value (negative change indicates fewer hours worked per week, while positive change indicates more hours work per week).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported sexual risk behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual risk behaviors will be measured using 6 yes/no items assessing for engagement in the following behaviors during the past 6 months (this refers to the 6 months prior to the baseline visit for the first assessment and 6 months prior to the 8 month visit for the second assessment) for Phase 2, and the last 3 months for Phase 3:
condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with male partner of unknown HIV status
anal intercourse with 3+ males
sex with male partner with a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)
CAI with HIV+ male partner
anal intercourse with condom failure
transactional sex work involvement</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in chlamydia test result</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Chlamydia infections will be assessed at baseline and follow up using oral, anal, and urine samples. Each of the three tests yields a positive (1) or negative (0) result. Change in test result will be calculated by subtracting the baseline result from the follow-up result. Oral, anal, and urine tests will be treated as separate outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gonorrhea test result</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Gonorrhea infections will be assessed at baseline and follow up using oral, anal, and urine samples. Each of the three tests yields a positive (1) or negative (0) result. Change in test result will be calculated by subtracting the baseline result from the follow-up result. Oral, anal, and urine tests will be treated as separate outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reactive HIV Result</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>HIV infection will be assessed at follow up using reactive HIV testing. Test results yield: Reactive or Non-reactive. A reactive HIV result will be defined as those with a &quot;Reactive&quot; result.</description>
