  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The estrogen-dependent nature of breast cancer was first reported in 1896 with the
      publication of George Beatson's observations on the regression of breast cancer following
      oophorectomy. Endocrine therapy, targeting ER either directly by selective estrogen receptor
      modulators (SERMs) and pure antagonists or indirectly by aromatase inhibitors (AIs) that
      block estrogen production, remains the mainstay of treatment of hormone-sensitive breast
      cancer in the adjuvant and metastatic settings.

      Intrinsic (de novo) and acquired endocrine resistance constitutes an important clinical
      challenge in the treatment of breast cancer and multiple mechanisms are suspected to underlie
      the emergence of endocrine resistance.

      The role of the estrogen receptor (ER), encoded by the ESR1 gene, in normal mammary gland
      development and the progression of breast cancer is well established. ESR1 mutations,
      occurring in 10 to 30% of ER-positive metastatic breast cancer resistant to AIs, lead to
      ligand-independent activation of the ER.

      For patients treated with AIs, monitoring of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) for ESR1, PIK3CA
      and AKT1 mutations could permit early detection of resistance to AIs as recently reported
      during 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting.

    <description>ESR1, PI3KCA and AKT extensive exon sequencing will be performed using NGS (Miseq Illumina) at the Biopathology department, Institut de Cancérologie de Lorraine (ISO15189 certified lab). Samples taken at baseline (t0), at progression (tp) and 3 months before progression (tp-3) will be systematically analyzed. The intermediate samples will be stored and kept for additional studies. Follow up assessment will be performed according to prescriber's directions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patient aged 18 and older

          2. Histologically confirmed estrogen-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer

          3. Proven metastatic (AJCC stage IV) or loco-regionally advanced (AJCC stage III) breast
             cancer, not amenable to surgery or radiation with curative intent.

          4. Indication to treat with first-line endocrine therapy for palliative care.

               -  Patients already receiving first-line endocrine therapy can be enrolled up to 6
                  weeks after start of endocrine therapy.

               -  Endocrine therapy can be prescribed in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
