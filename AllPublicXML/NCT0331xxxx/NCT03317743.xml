  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the purpose of this open-label, dose escalation-dose expansion, Phase 1 clinical trial is to
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity and determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of NOV140101 (IDX-1197).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study of NOV140101 (IDX-1197) to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the anti-tumor efficacy of
      IDX-1197 in patients with advanced solid tumors after failure of standard of care. DLTs will
      be assessed as the primary endpoint in this trial.
