      Retrospective data collection on re-ablations performed within the FIRE AND ICE Trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective data collection on re-ablations performed in both treatment
      arms (Cryo arm and Radiofrequency arm) of the FIRE AND ICE Trial is to gain insight into
      re-occurrence of atrial arrhythmias resulting in a re-ablation after a performed index
      ablation procedure. Data to be collected from subject charts include pulmonary vein anatomy,
      documented atrial arrhythmias prior to re-ablation, pulmonary vein reconnection, pulmonary
      vein ablation lesion gaps and gap location, ablation lesions performed during the
      re-ablation, procedure parameters of the RF or cryo catheter utilized during the re-ablation,
      and success of re-ablations performed.

          <title>New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class</title>
          <description>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a way of classifying the extent of heart failure.
NYHA I - No limiation of phyiscal activity. NYHA II - Slight limiation of phyiscial activity. NYHA III - Marked limiation of physical activity. NYHA IV - Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Within FIRE AND ICE Re-Do the majorty of patients 69% does not have heart failure signs. If any signs of heart failure documented in the baseline, then only mild forms. No heart failure patients (NYHA III or IV) were seen/enrolled in FIRE AND ICE Re-Do.</description>

An anteroposterior left atrial diameter of more than 55 mm as measured by trans-thoracic echocardiography is an exclusion criteria within the inital FIRE AND ICE Trial (outcome of ablation in patients with significant atrial dilation &gt; 55 mm is lacking data but is seen as possible predictor for pulmonary vein isolation failure/atrial fibrillation recurrence).</description>

          <title>Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) [%]</title>
          <description>The ejection fraction (EF) is a measurement, expressed as percentage, of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction, e.g. an ejection fraction of 60% means that 60% of the total amount of blood in the left ventricle is pushed out with each heartbeat.
Therefore the ejection fraction is an indcation of how well the heart is pumping and may be an evidence of heart failure (under 40%) or cardiomyopathy.</description>

          <title>HATCH Score</title>
          <description>The HATCH score stratifies patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation according to their risk for progression of sustained atrial fibrillation within 1-year.
The HATCH score is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 7 points and is calculated based on the following formula: 1x (Hypertension) + 1 x (Age &gt;75years) + 2 x (Transient Ischemic Attack or Stroke) + 1x (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) + 2x (Heart Failure).
Higher HATCH score is seen in literature as increased risk for progression of sustained atrial fibrillation.</description>

          <title>CHA2DS2-VASc</title>
          <description>CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.
Score is between 0 and 9 points:
1 point - Congestive Heart Failure
1 point - Hypertension 2 point - Age &gt; 75 years
point - Diabetes mellitus
point - Stroke / Transient Ischemic Attach / Thromboembolic Event
1 point - Vascular Disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque)
1 point - Age 65 to 74 years
1 point - Sex category (i.e. female sex)
A high score is the same as a higher stroke risk, and a low score means the lower stroke risk.</description>
