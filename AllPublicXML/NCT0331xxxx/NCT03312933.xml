      This study evaluates the location, frequency and duration of secondary site pain relating to
      immobilization in a CAM walker boot.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients wearing a CAM walker boot for treatment of a foot or ankle injury were prospectively
      enrolled and evaluated for new or worsened secondary site pain. Surveys at four time points
      were completed to evaluate the presence of secondary site pain, its severity, and its impact
      on overall function.

    <description>The primary outcome was the presence of secondary site pain that developed or worsened during CAM walker boot wear. Surveys inquired about the presence of secondary site pain, defined as lower back, ipsilateral hip, contralateral hip, ipsilateral knee, contralateral knee, contralateral ankle, and contralateral foot. Severity of pain was assessed using a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS), with zero indicating no pain and 100 representing the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>All patients who were placed into a CAM walker boot for &gt;2 weeks were prospectively enrolled. Patients were placed by an orthopedic cast technician into either a tall or short CAM walker boot, based upon the appropriate boot type needed for treatment. Inclusion criteria included anticipated boot wear for at least two weeks, and weightbearing as tolerated weightbearing restrictions. Exclusion criteria included transitioning into a CAM walker boot as part of a postoperative protocol, injury requiring restricted weightbearing, or an additional acute injury to the lower back or lower extremity. Those who subsequently reported wearing the boot for less than two weeks or had a treatment plan change were removed from the study.</description>

        All patients who were placed into a CAM walker boot for &gt;2 weeks were prospectively
        enrolled. Patients were placed by an orthopedic cast technician into either a tall or short
        CAM walker boot, based upon the appropriate boot type needed for treatment. Those who
        subsequently reported wearing the boot for less than two weeks or had a treatment plan
        change were removed from the study.

        Demographic information was gathered, including age, sex, race or ethnicity, body mass
        index (BMI), history of lower extremity or lower back injury, history of chronic pain (e.g.
        fibromyalgia, chronic opiate use, chronic regional pain syndrome), and cigarette smoking
        history. The diagnosis was recorded for which the CAM walker boot was required.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients enrolled in the study must have an injury that requires wear of a CAM
             walking boot for at least two weeks and have ambulation ad libitum without other aids
             (e.g crutches, canes, scooters, wheelchairs, etc.).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they are a recent post-operative patient
             for lower extremity injury, have an additional acute injury to a lower extremity or
             back other than the foot or ankle injury being treated by the CAM walking boot at the
             time of initiation of treatment, have an ongoing or history of lower extremity joint
             injury, arthritis, or back pain or have restricted weightbearing as instructed by a
             physician (i.e. for ankle fracture that cannot weightbear).

          <description>All patients who were placed into a CAM walker boot for &gt;2 weeks were prospectively enrolled in the study. At the time of initiation of boot wear, patients were placed by an orthopedic cast technician into either a tall Aircast AirSelect Elite™ or short Aircast AirSelect™ CAM walker boot, based upon the diagnosis and appropriate boot type needed for treatment. Inclusion criteria included minimum age of 18 years, anticipated boot wear for at least two weeks, and weightbearing as tolerated weightbearing restrictions.

Those who subsequently reported wearing the boot for less than two weeks were excluded. Additionally, patients who had a treatment plan change, such as proceeding with lower extremity surgery during the study period, were removed from the study.</description>

        <title>The Presence and Severity of Secondary Site Pain</title>
        <description>The primary outcome was the presence of secondary site pain that developed or worsened during CAM walker boot wear. Surveys inquired about the presence of secondary site pain, defined as lower back, ipsilateral hip, contralateral hip, ipsilateral knee, contralateral knee, contralateral ankle, and contralateral foot. Severity of pain was assessed using a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS), with zero indicating no pain and 100 representing the worst pain imaginable.</description>

            <description>All patients who were placed into a CAM walker boot for &gt;2 weeks were prospectively enrolled in the study. At the time of initiation of boot wear, patients were placed by an orthopedic cast technician into either a tall Aircast AirSelect Elite™ or short Aircast AirSelect™ CAM walker boot, based upon the diagnosis and appropriate boot type needed for treatment. Inclusion criteria included minimum age of 18 years, anticipated boot wear for at least two weeks, and weightbearing as tolerated weightbearing restrictions. Exclusion criteria included transitioning into a CAM walker boot as part of a postoperative protocol, injury requiring restricted weightbearing, or an additional acute injury to the lower back or lower extremity. Those who subsequently reported wearing the boot for less than two weeks were excluded. Additionally, patients who had a treatment plan change, such as proceeding with lower extremity surgery during the study period, were removed from the study.</description>
