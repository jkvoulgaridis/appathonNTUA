      The computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy will be used to treat amphetamine-type
      stimulant (ATS) addiction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The deficits in executive functions related to prefrontal-striatal circuits play a vital role
      in ATS addiction and relapse, and proposed computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy as
      the novel interventions. Focused on evaluating and training executive functions including
      working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and congitive bias concerning
      prefrontal-striatal circuits, neuropsychological tests, electroencephalography tests,
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI will be used to evaluate the
      therapeutic effect of ATS addiction treatment as well as investigate the mechanisms. The
      study will be very helpful to develop novel interventions in clinical practice and decrease
      ATS-related harm for both the patients and their families.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Craving for ATS assessed by Visual Analog Scales (VAS) at 1 month , 3 month and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>evaluate all participants' craving for ATS by Visual Analog Scales (VAS): The scores of the VAS were 0-10 points. 10 points reflect the highest level of individual's craving, and 0 point reflect no craving in patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function assessed by CogState Battery (CSB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>evaluate all participants' cognitive function by the computerized CogState Battery (CSB) Chinese version: The five tasks listed below were examined. International shopping list task (ISLT, verbal learning and memory), the score is defined as the total number of correct responses. Continuous paired association learning task (CPAL) taps spatial working memory. Groton maze learning task (GML) taps problem solving/error monitoring. The scores of CPAL and GML tasks are the total number of errors. Social emotional cognition task (SEC, social cognition) asks the subjects to pick out the different facial expressions. Two back task (TWOB, working memory) requires subjects to decide whether a card is identical to the one shown just before. The scores of TWOB and SEC tasks are the proportion of correct responses, denoting the accuracy of performance. The higher values represent a better outcome in ISL, SEC and TWOB. The higher values represent a worse outcome in GML and CPAL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changing of response inhibition ablility assessed by Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>evaluate all participants' response inhibition function by Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART): Several indices were computed to represent the behavioral performance, including the ratio of all pumps to numbers of win trials, the ratio of pumps to numbers in win trials, and the number of win trials. The higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
