  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia for childbirth may fail to provide adequate pain relief. At NYULMC, to
      maximize the likelihood that epidural analgesia will work well, the gravity flow technique is
      used when performing epidural procedures.

      The gravity flow technique is not well known, and is therefore used in only a few hospitals.
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the reliability of the gravity flow technique to
      accurately validate the position of the epidural needle tip when performing lumbar epidural
      analgesia in laboring women.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify the reliability of the gravity flow technique to
      accurately validate the position of the epidural needle tip when performing lumbar epidural
      analgesia in laboring women. This gravity flow technique was first described 26 years ago in
      1991, and has been at NYU Langone for 15 years, since 2002. The technique has not been
      formally studied and this study is designed to enable assessment of the success rate of the
      gravity flow technique.
