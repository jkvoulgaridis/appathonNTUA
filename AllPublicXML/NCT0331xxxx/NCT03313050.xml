  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-stage, phase 1/2, randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded study with a
      2-arm parallel design in each stage.

      In Stage 1 healthy adults 50 to 64 years of age with no history of pneumococcal vaccination
      will be randomized equally to receive either a single intramuscular dose of multivalent
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or a licensed tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis
      combination vaccine (Tdap) (control group).

      In Stage 2 healthy adults 65 to 85 years of age previously vaccinated with Prevnar 13 &gt;=2
      months prior to investigational product administration will be randomized equally to receive
      either a single intramuscular dose of multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or the
      licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (control group).

    <measure>Stage 1: Percentage of Participants With Local Reactions Within 14 Days After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>within 14 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Local reactions included pain at injection site, swelling and redness recorded by participants in an electronic diary (e-diary). Redness and swelling were measured and recorded in measuring device units. 1 measuring device unit =0.5 centimeter (cm). Redness and swelling were graded as mild: greater than (&gt;) 2.0 to 5.0 cm, moderate: &gt;5.0 to 10.0 cm and severe: &gt;10.0 cm. Pain at injection site was graded as mild: did not interfere with activity, moderate: interfered with activity and severe: prevented daily activity.</description>
