      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ATI-50002 Topical Solution in patients with Alopecia Universalis and
      Alopecia Totalis. Concentrations of ATI-50002 in the blood and skin will be assessed after 28
      days of treatment with ATI-50002 Topical Solution.

    <description>The Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score is a physician administered scale measuring the amount of scalp without any terminal hair. Possible scores range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss). A negative change in the SALT score over time represents hair regrowth.</description>

    <measure>Open Label Extension: Change From Baseline in Alopecia Density and Extent Score (ALODEX) at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) score is a measurement of the amount of scalp with terminal hair loss assessed by the investigator. ALODEX breaks the scalp up into a grid of 1% scalp surface areas and assigns density rating in each area on a 10 point scale of hair loss (0= no hair loss to 10 = complete baldness). Summation of scores from each 1% scalp surface area provides an overall score which may range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete baldness). A negative change in the ALODEX score over time represents hair regrowth.</description>

        <description>The Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) score is a measurement of the amount of scalp with terminal hair loss assessed by the investigator. ALODEX breaks the scalp up into a grid of 1% scalp surface areas and assigns density rating in each area on a 10 point scale of hair loss (0= no hair loss to 10 = complete baldness). Summation of scores from each 1% scalp surface area provides an overall score which may range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete baldness). A negative change in the ALODEX score over time represents hair regrowth.</description>

        <description>The Subject Eyebrow Assessment (SEA) is the subject's assessment of the appearance of eyebrow hair present on the affected eyebrow(s) at a particular point in time. The SEA is a five-point VRS ranging from &quot;0 - No eyebrow hair&quot;, &quot;1 - A little eyebrow hair&quot;, &quot;2 - Some eyebrow hair&quot;, &quot;3 - Most eyebrow hair&quot;, and &quot;4 - Full eyebrow hair&quot; with a recall period of &quot;right now&quot;. A positive change over time represents eyebrow regrowth (better outcome).</description>

        <title>Open Label Extension: The Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) Scores, Relative Percent Regrowth (%) at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) score is a measurement of the amount of scalp with terminal hair loss assessed by the investigator. ALODEX breaks the scalp up into a grid of 1% scalp surface areas and assigns density rating in each area on a 10 point scale of hair loss (0= no hair loss to 10 = complete baldness). Summation of scores from each 1% scalp surface area provides an overall score which may range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete baldness). A positive percent change over time represents hair regrowth (better outcome).</description>
