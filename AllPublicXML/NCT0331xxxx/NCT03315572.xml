  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A range of devices has been developed to administer inhaled therapy for asthma, including dry
      powder inhaler (DPI) devices. ELLIPTA is a DPI that is preloaded with a drug therapy to treat
      asthmatic subjects. The objective of this study is to revise ease of use items developed for
      adults to be appropriate for completion by pediatric subjects in future clinical trials and
      to evaluate the newly developed items in subjects with asthma aged 5 to 11 years and their
      caregivers. This is a cross-sectional, qualitative study that will involve pediatric subjects
      with asthma who are currently using an asthma maintenance inhaler and their caregivers. Two
      rounds of repetitive cognitive interviews will be conducted with 16 subjects in each
      interview set. Each interview will last approximately 45 minutes. Data provided by pediatric
      subjects and their caregivers during interview will be collected as field notes and audio
      recordings which will be transcribed.

    <measure>Number of Pediatric Participants With Problems Understanding Item Wording-Round 1 Interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The items for pediatric participants were developed to assess the concepts of overall ease of use of ELLIPTA and ease of evaluating remaining doses in inhaler. Pediatric participants aged 5 to 7 years were required to complete the interviewer-administered version and participants aged 8 to 11 years were administered self-completed version. Round 1 of the interviews evaluated 3 items to evaluate ease of use of inhaler (Items 1a, 1b and 1c), 3 items to assess the ease in evaluating remaining doses (Items 2a, 2b, 2c) and one item to assess if the pediatric participants could compare different types of inhalers (Item 3). The number of participants who had problems in understanding the item wordings has been presented. No statistical analyses were conducted for this qualitative study.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Round 1 of the interviews evaluated 3 items to evaluate ease of use of inhaler (Items 1a, 1b and 1c) and 3 items to assess the ease in evaluating remaining doses (Items 2a, 2b, 2c). Three response options were developed for these two concepts: Item 1a/2a-a verbal response scale with four options (Very easy, easy, hard, very hard); Item 1b/2b-the same four verbal response options accompanied by illustrations of faces for each verbal response; and Item 1c/2c-a verbal response scale with two options (Yes, No). The number of participants who had difficulty in providing item responses has been presented.</description>

    <description>Round 1 of the interviews evaluated 3 items to evaluate ease of use of inhaler (Items 1a, 1b and 1c), 3 items to assess the ease in evaluating remaining doses (Items 2a, 2b, 2c) and one item to understand if the participants could compare different types of inhalers. Three response options were developed to assess ease of inhaler use and ease of evaluating remaining doses: Item 1a/2a-a verbal response scale with four options (Very easy, easy, hard, very hard); Item 1b/2b-the same four verbal response options accompanied by illustrations of faces for each verbal response; and Item 1c/2c-a verbal response scale with two options (Yes, No). Item 3 consisted of 3 response options (Yes, No, The same). The number of participants who had difficulty in distinguishing item responses has been presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Round 1 of the interviews for caregiver participants evaluated the concepts of ease of evaluating remaining doses (Item 1) and the likelihood of requesting inhaler from their child's physician (Item 2). A response scale with four options was developed for each item: Item 1 (Very easy, Easy, Difficult, Very difficult) and Item 2 (Very likely, Likely, Unlikely, Very unlikely). The number of caregivers who had difficulty in providing responses to caregiver items has been reported.</description>

    <description>Based on the results of Round 1 interviews, the four level verbal response scale (Item 1a and Item 2a) of the pediatric versions were selected for further evaluation of ease of use and ease in evaluating remaining doses in Round 2. The second set of interviews were conducted to test if any further revision is required to optimize the items. The items for evaluation in Round 2 included: Item 1 and Item 2 for ease of ELLIPTA use and ease of evaluating remaining doses with a verbal scale of four options (Very easy, Easy, Hard, Very hard) and Item 3 for evaluation of the ability of participants to differentiate between inhalers consisting of three options (Yes, No, The same).

        <title>Number of Pediatric Participants With Problems Understanding Item Wording-Round 1 Interviews</title>
        <description>The items for pediatric participants were developed to assess the concepts of overall ease of use of ELLIPTA and ease of evaluating remaining doses in inhaler. Pediatric participants aged 5 to 7 years were required to complete the interviewer-administered version and participants aged 8 to 11 years were administered self-completed version. Round 1 of the interviews evaluated 3 items to evaluate ease of use of inhaler (Items 1a, 1b and 1c), 3 items to assess the ease in evaluating remaining doses (Items 2a, 2b, 2c) and one item to assess if the pediatric participants could compare different types of inhalers (Item 3). The number of participants who had problems in understanding the item wordings has been presented. No statistical analyses were conducted for this qualitative study.</description>

The items for evaluation in Round 2 included: Item 1 and Item 2 for ease of ELLIPTA use and ease of evaluating remaining doses with a verbal scale of four options (Very easy, Easy, Hard, Very hard) and Item 3 for evaluation of the ability of participants to differentiate between inhalers consisting of three options (Yes, No, The same).
