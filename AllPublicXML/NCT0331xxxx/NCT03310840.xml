      Hospital acquired infection is an important cause of mortality and morbidity among infants in
      neonatal intensive care units. Surveillance cultures are performed routinely in many units to
      monitor infants at risk of sepsis.

      Mechanically ventilated babies face particular risk because artificial airways bypass the
      body's defenses against inhaled pathogens and offer new routes for non airborne pathogens.
      Intubation associated lesions of pharynx and trachea lead to bacterial colonization by the
      deterioration of the swallowing reflex and the ciliary functions. Subsequently, these babies
      may develop pneumonia and sepsis.

      cultures of aspirates obtained through endotracheal tubes from ventilated infants are
      monitored on the assumption that the organisms that are colonising the respiratory tract will
      be the same pathogens as those isolated from the blood during episodes of sepsis.

      introduction Neonatal sepsis is an invasive bacterial infection that occurs in newborns
      between first and nineteenth day of life. Neonatal sepsis is one of the most frequent causes
      of morbidity and mortality in newborns[1]. Worldwide, incidence of sepsis in newborns varies
      between 1- 10 cases per 1000 live births, and the mortality varies between 15-50%[2].
      Neonatal sepsis is usually classified as early or late sepsis. Early sepsis occurs within the
      first 72 hours of birth and late neonatal sepsis occurs after 72 hours of birth. Early
      neonatal sepsis is associated with acquisition of microorganism from mother (transplacental
      infection, ascending infection from cervix and the newborn can acquire the microorganisms as
      it passes through the birth canal at delivery). Late neonatal sepsis usually occurs due to
      the lack of aseptic working conditions . the occurrence of late sepsis is considered an
      important indicator of quality of care [3].

      Improvements in antenatal management and neonatal intensive care over the past 10 to 15 years
      have changed the prognosis for preterm infants. More than 85% of infants born at 25 weeks'
      gestation now survive their preterm birth.[4-5]

      Although advances in neonatal intensive care have led to improved survival of very low birth
      weight (VLBW) infants, late-onset sepsis continues to be an important cause of morbidity and
      mortality.[[1-10] The risk of late-onset sepsis increases with decreasing birth weight and
      age. Ongoing infectious disease surveillance is essential because increasingly immature
      neonates are being provided with intensive care, require prolonged hospitalization, and are
      surviving[6-7] .

      Hospital acquired infections (nosocomial infections) are the most common complications
      encountered in the neonatal intensive care units (NICU). They generally manifest 48 hours
      after hospitalization or in 48 hours after discharge. Especially preterm and low birth weight
      newborns are more vulnerable (20-33%) to nosocomial infections.[8-9] Mechanically ventilated
      babies face a particular risk because artificial airways bypass the body's defenses against
      inhaled pathogens and offer new routes for non airborne pathogens [5]. Intubation associated
      lesions of pharynx and trachea lead to bacterial colonisation by the deterioration of the
      swallowing reflex and the ciliary functions. Subsequently, these babies may develop pneumonia
      and sepsis[10] .

      Hospital acquired infection is an important cause of mortality and morbidity among infants in
      neonatal intensive care units. Surveillance cultures are performed routinely in many units to
      monitor infants at risk of sepsis.[1-10]

      Incidence&amp; Epidemiology A significant proportion of neonates admitted to NICU require
      mechanical ventilation; accounts for up to 30% of nosocomial infections Ventilator-associated
      sepsis in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [11,12] Mechanically ventilated neonates have a
      high fatality. Survival rate in artificially ventilated neonates is reported as 64% by
      Trotman[16] and 67.9% by Karthikeyan and Hossain[17] though survival of such neonates has
      been higher in developed countries.[18] The most common reasons for mechanical ventilation
      were respiratory distress syndrome (70%) and perinatal asphyxia (14%)[19]. None of the
      infants intubated had radiographic evidence of pulmonary infection at initiation of
      ventilatory support[20].

      Risk factor&amp; PATHOGENESIS For nosocomial respiratory tract infections to occur, the delicate
      balance between host defenses and microbial propensity for invasion must shift in favor of
      the capability of pathogens to establish pneumonia, sepsis .

      Risk for these infections is determined in part by the duration of exposure to the health
      care environment and in part by a number of host factors and treatment-related factors.

      Prematurity , Birth weights , Intubation and re-intubation , Duration of mechanical
      ventilation, Suction , Aspiration and nutrition, Modulation of colonization, Systemic
      antibiotics , Ventilator circuit-related factors. [21] AEtiology infants who developed sepsis
      pathogens isolated from blood were compared with the organisms isolated from ETA. the same
      strain of organism has been isolated from the blood and endotracheal tube aspirate
      cultures(full agreement). the organisms in the blood were found as one of the multiple
      isolates from the endotracheal tube(partial agreement). same organism was not found in the
      endotracheal tube aspirate and blood(no agreement )

           Scan) when indicated. complete blood count ,serum electrolytes(Na ,K ,Ca ,Mg),kidney
           function , liver functions, arterial blood gases , RBG confirmed by lab test ,they are
           non specific marker of inflammation. also very helpful in evaluating the infant with
           suspected infection.

           septic screening , Initial evaluation should include a blood culture, urine culture, and
           culture of bronchoalveolar lavage. These studies can provide a definitive source and
           causative organism in infected infants.

           ,inflammatory mediator (C-reactive protein ,others) when admitted negative neonate will
           be included bronchial aspirate for culture after the third day every three day then
           weekly until extubation [13,14] for neonate who clinically ,physically,chemically
           developing sign suggesting sepsis Antibiotic sensitivity test will be done to all
           culture[15].
