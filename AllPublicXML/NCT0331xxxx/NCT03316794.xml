  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study in participants with triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) to study the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of
      SC-005. This study consists of 2 parts: Part A (dose regimen finding) followed by Part B
      (dose expansion).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced TNBC that is relapsed, refractory,
             or progressive and not eligible for another standard therapy that would confer
             clinical benefit to the subject.

               -  Advanced disease is defined as metastatic disease or locally advanced disease
                  that is not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent

               -  TNBC is defined as:

          -  &lt;1% staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR)
             receptors, 0 or 1+ IHC for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), OR

          -  Negative for HER2 amplification by in situ hybridization (ISH) for 2+ IHC disease.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant medical condition including any suggested by Screening laboratory
             findings that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, may place the subject at
             undue risk from the study.

          -  Has ECG abnormalities that make QT interval corrected (QTc) evaluation difficult
             (e.g., severe morphologic abnormalities).

          -  Prior exposure to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine or indolino-benzodiazepine based drug, or
             known hypersensitivity or contraindication to SC-005 or excipient contained in the
             drug formulation.
