    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of Heavy Slow Resistance exercise (HSR) exercise in
      comparison with traditional supervised exercise as treatment for patients with subacromial
      shoulder pain. The purpose is to evaluate if HSR is feasible fir these patients, and compare
      its effect to traditional exercise at pain and function of the shoulder. One half will
      complete the heavy slow resistance exercise, the other will complete the conventional
      exercise.

    <measure>Change from Baseline SPADI score at 12- and 24 weeks.</measure>

    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. Both dimensions account for 50% of the overall score, and scores from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>DISABILITIES OF THE ARM, SHOULDER AND HAND (DASH) is a 30 points questionnaire about the disability of the shoulder. Answers from 0 to 5; 0 0 No problem completing the activity, 5 = Impossible to complete the activity. Total score is calculated by a summary of the scores, subtracted by 30 and divided by 1.2.</description>
