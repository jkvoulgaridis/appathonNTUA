  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by heterotopic ossification (HO) often associated with painful, recurrent
      episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that lead to ankyloses of major joints with
      cumulative and irreversible loss of movement and disability.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of palovarotene in decreasing new HO in
      subjects with FOP as assessed by low-dose, whole body computed tomography (WBCT), excluding
      head, compared to untreated subjects from Clementia's FOP natural history study (Study
      PVO-1A-001, NHS). The other primary objective is to evaluate the safety of palovarotene in
      subjects with FOP.

      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study. Eligible subjects will receive a
      chronic/flare-up dosing regimen of palovarotene for 48 months as follows:

        -  Chronic treatment: orally administered 5 mg palovarotene once daily for 24 months.

        -  Flare-up treatment: orally administered 20 mg palovarotene once daily for 4 weeks (28
           days) followed by orally administered 10 mg palovarotene once daily for 8 weeks (56
           days). Flare-up treatment may be extended until the Investigator determines that the
           flare-up has resolved.

      Note that all dosing will be weight-adjusted in skeletally immature subjects (those under the
      age of 18 years with less than 90% skeletal maturity on hand/ wrist x-rays performed at
      Screening).
