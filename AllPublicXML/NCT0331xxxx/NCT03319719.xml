      Demonstrate the effectiveness of Belotero Balance with lidocaine (Test group) for the
      reduction of injection-related pain in comparison to Belotero Balance without lidocaine
      (Control group) for the correction of NLFs.

      Identify and describe adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the
      course of the study. Additionally, common treatment site responses (CTRs) will be assessed.

    <description>Pain was assessed using a using a 10 centimeter (cm) VAS. It included 21-numbered circles at 0.5 cm increments, spanning 10 cm total, and was anchored by word descriptors. The VAS scores ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very severe pain).The level of pain was evaluated for each NLF independently immediately upon completion of injection (time zero) on Day 1.</description>

    <description>The Merz NLF scale was used to measure the aesthetic effectiveness of the study products. Each NLF was assessed separately. The Merz NLF scale is a 5-grade scale ranging from 0 (no folds) to 4 (very severe folds). Response was defined &gt;=1-point improvement on the Merz NLF Scale for each NLF compared to baseline.</description>

             intranasal/inhaled steroids) in the past 2 months or plans to receive such treatment
             during participation in the study.

             infections) or history of chronic or recurrent infection or inflammation with the
             potential to interfere with study results or increase the risk of AEs.

          9. Has a history of allergic/anaphylactic reactions, including hypersensitivity to
             lidocaine or anesthetics of the amide type, hyaluronic acid preparations, gram
             positive bacterial proteins, or any of the device components.

         10. Has a known bleeding disorder or has received or is planning to receive
             anti-coagulation, anti-platelet, or thrombolytic medications (e.g., warfarin),
             anti-inflammatory drugs (oral/injectable corticosteroids or NSAIDs [e.g., aspirin,
             ibuprofen]), or other substances known to increase coagulation time (e.g., vitamins or
             herbal supplements, i.e., Vitamin E, garlic, gingko) from 10 days before injection to
             3 days after injection.

         11. Has any other medical condition with the potential to interfere with study outcome
             assessments or compromise subject safety (i.e., increase the risk of adverse events).
