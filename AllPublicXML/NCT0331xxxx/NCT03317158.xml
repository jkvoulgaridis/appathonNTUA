  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) phase 1/2 study. Phase 1 will be conducted in BCG-unresponsive
      NMIBC patients to establish the safety of durvalumab monotherapy (cohort 1) and durvalumab in
      combination with BCG (cohort 2a) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) (cohort 2b).
      Provided safety is demonstrated and recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) are established in phase
      1, the study will proceed to phase 2 testing. Phase 2 will be conducted in the BCG-relapsing
      or persistent NMIBC population. In phase 2, BCG-relapsing or persistent NMIBC subjects will
      be randomized between treatment arms examining intravesical BCG in combination with novel
      immunotherapy agents (durvalumab), novel immunotherapy in combination with radiation
      (durvalumab + EBRT), or retreatment with intravesical BCG. In addition to providing
      additional safety data on the combination regimens studied, phase 2 will provide preliminary
      efficacy profiles for BCG-relapsing or persistent NMIBC subjects with and without CIS treated
      with each regimen. For regimens demonstrating a tolerable safety profile and encouraging
      clinical activity in this phase 1/2 design, a randomized phase 3 trial of experimental arm
      therapy versus re-treatment with intravesical BCG therapy would be considered.

      Patient Assignment in Phase 1

      Prior to commencing accrual, each study site will be required to self-identify their site as
      a site with (EBRT+) or without (EBRT-) the capacity to provide radiation therapy as specified
      in the durvalumab + EBRT arm. The radiation therapy status of each site will remain fixed
      throughout the course of the trial. In phase 1 of the protocol, patients will be assigned to
      study treatment cohorts based on patient slot availability and study site choice of radiation
      therapy arm participation.

      Patient Randomization in Phase 2

      In phase 2 of the protocol, subjects registered at self-identified EBRT+ study sites will be
      randomized 1:1 between all actively accruing study arms while subjects registered at
      self-identified EBRT- study sites will be randomized 1:1 between all actively accruing study
      arms except the durvalumab + EBRT arm.

      Papillary Subgroup Enrollment Cap

      As described further in the Section 12 enrollment in Phase 2 of patients with papillary only
      (Ta or T1) tumors with no evidence of concurrent CIS within each experimental study arm will
      be capped to ensure adequate representation of patients with CIS for planned efficacy
      analyses.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women. Women of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative urine or serum test ≤ 14 days prior to starting study drug.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, who are biologically able to conceive, and not
             employing two forms of highly effective contraception or abstinence. Highly effective
             contraception or abstinence must be used from the time of informed consent, throughout
             the trial and up to 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab (e.g. male condom with
             spermicidal; diaphragm with spermicide; intra-uterine device). Women of child-bearing
             potential are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy
             or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months
             (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). Women will
             be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an
             alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:

               -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

          -  Fertile males not willing to use contraception or abstinence, as stated above.
             Contraception or abstinence must be followed from screening through 180 days after
             receipt of the final dose of durvalumab therapy.

          -  Subjects unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP.

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug
             excipients.

        Exclusion Criteria (Phase 1 Only):

          -  In Phase 1 of the study, there are no additional exclusion criteria beyond those
             described of all patients in the section listed above.

        Exclusion Criteria (Phase 2 Only):

          -  In addition to the exclusion criteria described of all patients listed above, the
             following exclusion criteria apply to patients enrolling to Phase 2 of the study.

          -  Subjects with BCG-unresponsive disease defined by any of the following:

               -  Prior treatment with 2 or more adequate courses of BCG (at least 5 of 6 induction
                  installations and at least 2 of 3 maintenance installations for subjects on
                  maintenance therapy).

               -  Persistent T1 high-grade disease at the initial 3-month cystoscopy/TURBT
                  assessment in subjects who received 5 of 6 inductions BCG installations.

               -  Relapsed NMIBC within 6 months of last exposure to BCG.

               -  Prostatic urethra involvement of NMIBC.

          -  Subjects with concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis) non-invasive
             urothelial carcinoma.

        Exclusion Criteria (Phase 2 Patients with Persistent or Relapsed NMIBC who Cross-Over to
        Durvalumab Only):

          -  In addition to the exclusion criteria described of all patients listed above, the
             following exclusion criteria apply to patients enrolling to the cross-over to
             durvalumab portion of the Phase 2 study.

               -  Subjects with concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis)
                  non-invasive urothelial carcinoma.
