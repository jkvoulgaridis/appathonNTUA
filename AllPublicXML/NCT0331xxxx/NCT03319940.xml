  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, ascending, multiple dose, phase 1 study evaluating AMG 757 monotherapy
      and in combination with anti-PD1 therapy. AMG 757 will be administered as a short term
      intravenous (IV) infusion in subjects with small cell lung cancer. AMG 757 is a Half Life
      Extended (HLE) Bispecific T cell engager (BiTE®) targeting delta-like protein 3 (DLL3)

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, ascending, multiple dose, phase 1 study evaluating AMG 757 monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1 therapy in subjects with Small Cell Lung Cancer. The dose exploration phases of the study will estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of AMG 757 either as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. This will be followed by dose expansion phase to confirm RP2D and to obtain further safety and efficacy data.</intervention_model_description>

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement.
