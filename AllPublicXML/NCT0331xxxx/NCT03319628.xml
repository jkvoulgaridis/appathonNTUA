    <textblock>
      First-in-human, Phase 1b safety study of the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) XMT-1536
      administered as an intravenous infusion once every four weeks. Patients with tumor types
      likely to express NaPi2b were enrolled in dose escalation. Patients with platinum-resistant
      ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma subtype) are being enrolled in
      the expansion segment of this study. In addition to safety assessments, the pharmacokinetics
      of the drug will be assessed along with ADC activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study of XMT-1536 in patients with tumors likely to express NaPi2b,
      focusing on patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer,
      adenocarcinoma subtype. XMT-1536 will be administered as an intravenous infusion once every
      four weeks. The study consists of two segments: dose escalation (DES) and expansion (EXP).
      The DES segment studies small groups of patients who receive increased doses. A Safety Review
      Committee has been established to review the data from each dose level before moving to the
      next higher dose. Dose escalation will stop when a patient or patients experience 2 or more
      dose-limiting events. Enrollment into the EXP segment consists of 2 parallel cohorts of
      patients to confirm the dose that has been identified in DES and estimate the objective
      response rate in each patient population. All adverse events will be graded according to the
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria version (CTCAE v4.03). Throughout
      the study, pharmacokinetics will be measured using proprietary assays developed by Mersana.
      Anti-cancer activity will be measured via RECIST.
