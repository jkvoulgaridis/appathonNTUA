    <textblock>
      A study to assess the real-life management and use of healthcare resources during the
      initiation of:

        -  Venetoclax in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult
           participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one
           prior therapy.

        -  Venetoclax in participants with CLL with the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17
           (del[17p]) who have received at least 1 prior therapy or participants with CLL without
           del(17p) who have received at least 1 prior therapy and for whom there are no other
           available treatment options.
