  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes implementation science principles to culturally adapt a pre-existing
      web-based application (WebApp) for use with college students. The ADAPT-ITT process will be
      utilized to adapt the WebApp to a diverse (race, ethnicity, gender/sexual identity) college
      population with a focus on life skills and holistic self-care as reinforcement to currently
      available primary prevention programming available to incoming students. The study hypothesis
      is that the adapted WebApp will be usable, acceptable, and students will be willing to use it
      as a reinforcement to current university primary prevention programming. The study team will
      also monitor retention of participants over the academic year.

    <description>The 10-item System Usability Scale will be used to evaluate the usability of WebApp in the intervention group only. The System Usability Scale (Brook, 1996) includes 10 items that are rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). To get a final score the: 1) First, one is subtracted from the score of the odd items; 2) Second, the responses are subtracted from 5 for the even-numbered items; 3) Then the responses are summed and multiplied by 2.5 to get a range of 0-100. A score above 68 is considered above average.</description>

    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Sexual Experiences Survey will be used to measure participants' experiences of sexual violence victimization. The revised Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Victimization (Koss et al., 2007) includes 10 items that are used to assess the frequency of seven victimization behaviors and then uses three questions to explore the sex of the perpetrator and if the participant believes they were raped. We will be items 1-7 to assess the number of times an individual has experienced victimization over the last 3 months from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have experienced each individual behavior and the percentage who report that they have experienced a rape.</description>

        <title>3-Month Usability</title>
        <description>The 10-item System Usability Scale will be used to evaluate the usability of WebApp in the intervention group only. The System Usability Scale (Brook, 1996) includes 10 items that are rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). To get a final score the: 1) First, one is subtracted from the score of the odd items; 2) Second, the responses are subtracted from 5 for the even-numbered items; 3) Then the responses are summed and multiplied by 2.5 to get a range of 0-100. A score above 68 is considered above average.</description>
        <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
        <population>Only intervention participants were asked the items on the System Usability Scale.</population>

          <description>The 10-item System Usability Scale will be used to evaluate the usability of WebApp in the intervention group only. The System Usability Scale (Brook, 1996) includes 10 items that are rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). To get a final score the: 1) First, one is subtracted from the score of the odd items; 2) Second, the responses are subtracted from 5 for the even-numbered items; 3) Then the responses are summed and multiplied by 2.5 to get a range of 0-100. A score above 68 is considered above average.</description>

The revised Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Victimization (Koss et al., 2007) includes 10 items that are used to assess the frequency of seven victimization behaviors and then uses three questions to explore the sex of the perpetrator and if the participant believes they were raped. We will be items 1-7 to assess the number of times an individual has experienced victimization over the last 3 months from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have experienced each individual behavior and the percentage who report that they have experienced a rape.</description>

We will be items 1-7 to assess the number of times an individual has experienced victimization over the last 3 months from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have experienced each individual behavior and the percentage who report that they have experienced a rape.</description>

        <title>3-Month Sexual Violence Perpetration</title>
        <description>The 10-item Sexual Experiences Survey will be used to measure participants' experiences of sexual violence perpetration. The revised Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Perpetration (Koss et al., 2007) includes seven items that are used to assess the frequency of perpetration of sexual violence behaviors and three questions that explore the sex of the victims and if the individual believes they have perpetrated a rape. We will be using these to assess the number of times an individual has perpetrated sexual violence over the last 3 months from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have perpetrated each individual behavior and the percentage who believe they have perpetrated a rape.</description>

        <title>5-Month Sexual Violence Perpetration</title>
        <description>The 10-item Sexual Experiences Survey will be used to measure participants' experiences of sexual violence perpetration. The revised Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Perpetration (Koss et al., 2007) includes seven items that are used to assess the frequency of perpetration of sexual violence behaviors and three questions that explore the sex of the victims and if the individual believes they have perpetrated a rape. We will be using these to assess the number of times an individual has perpetrated sexual violence over the last 5 months from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have perpetrated each individual behavior and the percentage who believe they have perpetrated a rape.</description>

          <description>Fifteen items from the Relationship Control sub-scale of the Sexual Relationship Power Scale will be used to measure power dynamics within participants' sexual relationships at 5-months. The Relationship Control Sub-scale Items (Pulerwitz, Gortmaker, &amp; DeJong, 2000) are scored from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 4 (Strongly Disagree). Scores are summed with total scores ranging from 15-60. Higher scores represent higher sexual relationship power.</description>

        <title>3-Month Rape Myth Acceptance</title>
        <description>The 22-item modified Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance scale will be used to measure attitudes endorsing rape myths at 3-months. The modified Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (McMahon &amp; Farmer, 2011) is scored from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree). It includes four sub-scales (She asked for it, He didn't mean to, It wasn't really rape, and She lied). The items in each sub-scale can be summed for a total score and the scores for the entire scale can be summed for a cumulative score. Scores on the full scale range from 22-110. Scores on the She Asked For It and He Didn't Mean To sub-scales range from 6-30. Scores on the It Wasn't Really Rape and the She Lied sub-scales range from 5-25. Higher scores indicate greater rejection of rape myths.</description>
