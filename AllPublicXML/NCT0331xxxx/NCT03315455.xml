    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study with randomized and non-randomized arms is
      designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of emicizumab in
      participants with hemophilia A regardless of factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor status.
      Participants greater than or equal to (≥)12 years old who received episodic therapy with
      FVIII or bypassing agents prior to study entry and experienced at least 5 bleeds over the
      prior 24 weeks will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to the following regimens: Arm A:
      Emicizumab prophylaxis at 3 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) once every week (QW)
      subcutaneously (SC) for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg QW SC; Arm B: Emicizumab prophylaxis
      at 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4 weeks, followed by 6 mg/kg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) SC; and Arm C: No
      prophylaxis (control arm). In addition, pediatric participants less than (&lt;)12 years old with
      hemophilia A and FVIII inhibitors who received episodic therapy with bypassing agents prior
      to study entry will be enrolled to Arm D: Emicizumab prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4
      weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg QW SC.
