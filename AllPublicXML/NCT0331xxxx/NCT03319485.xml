      The goal of this prospective, two-arm, sham-controlled, randomized, multi-center pivotal
      study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of unilateral focused ultrasound pallidotomy
      using the ExAblate 4000 System in the management of dyskinesia symptoms or motor fluctuations
      for medication refractory, advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
