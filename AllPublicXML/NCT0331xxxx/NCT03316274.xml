    <textblock>
      There is no clear treatment for patients with limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma (KS).
      Radiation and injection of vinblastine both have side effects that may not be acceptable.
      Nivolumab has been used to treat more extensive KS when given intravenously. This is, to the
      investigators' knowledge, the first trial to see if nivolumab can be used as treatment in the
      form of an injection into KS lesion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV, or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)) causes
      Kaposi sarcoma (KS). These virally associated diseases occur more frequently in HIV-infected
      individuals, but can also be found in HIV-uninfected population. Evolution of
      immunosuppressive mechanisms presumably plays a permissive role in the development,
      progression and recurrence of these virus-associated cancers and pre-cancers. Currently,
      available treatment options for these lesions are imperfect.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether intra-lesional injections of nivolumab can
      enhance specific T cell responses in vitro and enhance activity against these
      virus-associated lesions. Chronic viral infections generate &quot;exhausted&quot; CD8+ T cells with a
      diminished capacity to produce cytokines and to lyse infected cells. The PD-1 (program
      death-1)/PD-L1 (program death ligand-1) pathway implicated in the balance between immune
      eradication and immune escape. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      potential benefits of injecting nivolumab into KS in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
      individuals every 2 weeks for total of 4 doses. The investigators believe this mode of
      treatment is feasible and tolerable by avoiding the systemic autoimmune adverse events caused
      by systemic injection of nivolumab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For screening: Patients must have histologically confirmed KS with active cutaneous
             disease and have less than 25 lesions.

             For enrollment: Patients must have histologically confirmed KS in the research skin
             biopsy performed during the screening visit.

          2. Patients must have measurable cutaneous KS disease, defined as: 1 or more marker
             lesion that is bi-dimensionally measureable, and &gt;=0.5cm in shortest dimension. These
             measurable lesions must not have received previous local radiation, surgical, or
             intralesional cytotoxic therapy that would prevent response assessment.

             Note: Patients may eligible even if some of their KS lesions that have previously been
             treated with local therapy, as long as they have other untreated KS lesions that are
             measurable as defined in the protocol.

          3. For the initial safety cohort (cohort A), patients have to be treatment-experienced,
             i.e. at least one of their KS skin lesions has been persisted despite having been
             treated with:

               -  systemic chemotherapy; OR

               -  1 or more topical therapy, local radiation, surgery, or intra-lesional cytotoxic
                  therapy.

             For the expansion cohort (cohort B), patients can be either treatment-experienced or
             treatment-naïve.

             For the extension cohort (cohort B-plus), patients are from the expansion cohort above
             (cohort B) who have achieved partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) in their
             injected KS lesion at week 26 or later.

          4. Age &gt;= 18 years.

          5. If human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, patients must have:

               -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any federally approved, licensed HIV rapid test
                  performed in conjunction with screening (or ELISA, test kit, and confirmed by
                  Western blot or other approved test). Alternatively, this documentation may
                  include a record demonstrating that another physician has documented the
                  participant's HIV status based on either: 1) approved diagnostic tests, or 2) the
                  referring physician's written record that HIV infection was documented, with
                  supporting information on the participant's relevant medical history and/or
                  current management of HIV infection

               -  CD4 &gt;= 350 cells/mm3

               -  HIV-1 viral load below the limit of detection by commercial assays (&lt;75
                  copies/mL).

               -  Participants MUST receive appropriate care and treatment for HIV infection,
                  including antiretroviral medications when clinically indicated, and should be
                  under the care of a physician experienced in HIV management. Participants should
                  be documented to be on an effective combination anti-retroviral (ART) regimen,
                  generally a 3-drug regimen based on Department of Health and Human Services
                  (DHHS) treatment guidelines by a licensed health care provider. Participants will
                  be eligible regardless of antiretroviral medication (including no antiretroviral
                  medication) provided there is no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has
                  been stable for at least 4 weeks with no intention to change the regimen within
                  12 weeks following enrollment.

          6. If HIV-uninfected, patients must have documentation of a negative HIV result by any
             federally approved, licensed HIV test within the last 12 months.

          7. Adequate organ function defined as follows:

             Adequate bone marrow function:

             leukocytes &gt; 3,000/microliter (mcL) absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;
             10 g/dL platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL

             Adequate hepatic function:

             total bilirubin within normal institutional limits aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST)/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit
             of normal (ULN) alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase
             (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN

             Adequate renal function:

             creatinine &lt; 1.5 X institutional ULN

          8. Participants must be purified protein derivative (PPD) negative. Alternatively, the
             QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay (Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Australia)
             can be used. An individual is considered positive for M. tuberculosis (TB) infection
             if the Interferon (IFN)-gamma response to TB antigens is above the test cut-off (after
             subtracting the background IFN-gamma response in the negative control). The result
             must be obtained within 12 months prior to enrollment. PPD positive (or QuantiFERON
             assay positive) participants are permitted if prophylaxis has been completed prior to
             enrollment.

          9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of &lt;=1 (Karnofsky &gt;=
             70%).

         10. The effects of nivolumab on the developing fetus are unknown. Therefore, only the
