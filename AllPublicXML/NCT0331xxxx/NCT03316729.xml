  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and initial effectiveness of
      DS-9231 when taken together with current standard of care. Evaluation will be done with low,
      medium and then high doses of DS-9231 versus placebo, in participants with medium-risk acute
      pulmonary embolism.
