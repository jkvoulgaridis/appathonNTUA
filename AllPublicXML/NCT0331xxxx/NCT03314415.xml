  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether robotic assistance can help facilitate
      adherence, engagement, and weight loss in participants enrolled in a behavioral weight loss
      program. All participants will be enrolled in the same Web-based weight loss program and take
      part in &quot;robotic assistance sessions&quot; either early or late in the five-week study. These
      robotic assistance sessions involve speaking one on one with a robot about diet-related
      progress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the start of the five-week study, all participants will be enrolled in a Web-based
      behavioral weight loss program. The weight loss program places particular emphasis on hunger
      reduction and craving control for both weight loss and prevention of weight regain. The
      program will consist of six videoconference sessions delivered by a qualified coach. Menus
      and other program materials will be available to the participants throughout the study
      period.

      Participants also will be assigned to attend one-on-one &quot;robotic assistance sessions&quot; either
      early or late in the five-week study. During each robotic assistance session, the participant
      will speak with the robot about his/her progress with the weight loss program. The robot is
      programmed to respond to specific issues raised by the participant, but a human operator with
      thorough knowledge of the weight loss program will be available in case the conversation goes
      &quot;off script.&quot; This human operator can initiate robot behaviors and prompt verbal responses
      through a text-to-speech interface.

      Data from this study will be used to refine the robot for future use and determine whether
      robotic help can improve a participant's experience in a previously tested weight loss
      program.

    <description>Participants will complete the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, consisting of 18 items, which will be used to assess eating behavior on a 4-point response scale (4=definitely true;3=mostly true;2=mostly false;1=definitely false). Responses to each of the 18 items are given a score between 1 and 4 and item scores are summed into scale scores for cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. Total scores will be reported and higher scores in the respective scales are indicative of greater cognitive restraint, uncontrolled, or emotional eating. Questionnaires are self-administered.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-reported food cravings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, once during with-robot phase, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Food Cravings Questionnaire - Trait, which will be used to assess food cravings on a 6-point response scale (1=Never or NA;2=Rarely; 3=Sometimes;4=Often;5=Usually;6=Always). Responses to each of the 39 items are given a score between 1 and 6 and item scores are summed into scale scores with higher scores being indicative of greater eating pathology, body mass index (BMI), low dieting success and increases in state food craving during cognitive tasks. Total scores will be reported. Questionnaires are self-administered.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete the RAND 36-Item Short Form Survey, which will be used to assess eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. Items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered.</description>
