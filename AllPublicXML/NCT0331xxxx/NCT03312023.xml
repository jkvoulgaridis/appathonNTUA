  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of therapy against chronic hepatitis B are to decrease the morbidity and mortality
      related to chronic HBV infection. Currently available antiviral therapy can suppress viral
      replication but only a small proportion attain functional cure, which is defined as HBV
      surface antigen-to-antibody seroconversion. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a marker
      of persistent hepatitis B infection.

      It has been observed that patients who had both hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and who were
      treated for their hepatitis C with 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for had a decline in
      HBsAg levels. This study hypothesizes that a similar decrease would be seen in mono-infected
      hepatitis B subjects over the course of 12 weeks treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.
