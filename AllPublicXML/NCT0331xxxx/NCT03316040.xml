  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Zambia, 13% of the 15 to 49 year old population lives with HIV. The highest number of new
      HIV infections is among young people. To counter the spread of the disease, developmental and
      governmental actors are increasingly relying on educational behavior change tools. A
      particularly widely used tool, implemented by the German Development Corporation (henceforth,
      GIZ), is the so-called &quot;Join-In-Circuit on AIDS, Love Sexuality&quot; (JIC). The tool aims to
      improve a) HIV and sexual reproductive health knowledge, b) HIV testing uptake, and c) demand
      for health services. Previous research has investigated the direct effect of the JIC on
      knowledge about Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) as well as self-reported sexual
      behavior in Zimbabwe, and has found positive effects in both domains.

      The research project evaluates the JIC in Zambia. The study randomly assigns 170
      participating schools to five different JIC treatment arms. The first two arms represent
      control schools. Here, no JIC will be implemented. The third arm implements the JIC among a
      random subset of students. The fourth arm implements the JIC among indegree central students.
      The fifth arm implements the JIC among edge betweeness central students. In each school, the
      JIC will be implemented in one pre-determined grade. Within each school at least 30 students
      will be selected. For larger schools, 20 percent of students in the selected grade are
      selected.

      The study's population is schools in the Choma and Livingstone provinces of Zambia (a final
      set of 170 schools). The schools were provided by the Zambian Ministry of Education. The
      schools are split between primary (grade 1 to 7) and secondary schools (grade 8 to 12). In
      order to not interfere with exam periods, the Ministry of General Education and GIZ decided
      to implement the JIC among children in grade 6 in primary schools, and grade 11 in secondary
      schools.

      On average, the schools have 80 students and 74 percent of the sample are in Choma. 88
      percent of schools are considered rural, i.e., they do not lie in a major town. 4 percent of
      the sample have received a JIC before.

      The 170 schools were randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions.

        -  Control 1 (No intervention) (34 schools)

        -  Control 2 (No intervention) (34 schools)

        -  Treatment 1 (Random selection) (34 of schools)

        -  Treatment 2 (Indegree centrality) (34 of schools)

        -  Treatment 3 (Betweenness centrality) (34 of schools)

      The Columbia University (CU) team advised GIZ on the design of the study, and the
      intervention will be solely run by GIZ. The CU team is not involved in the implementation of
      the study. Data will be collected by the American Institutes of Research (AIR). The CU team
      will only analyze fully de-identified data produced by the study.

    <description>The &quot;Join In Circuit on HIV, love and sexuality&quot; is a mobile learning system on the core topics of reproductive health and HIV and AIDS, targeting young people. JIC works with person-to-person communication in order to give an opportunity for discussion and for providing information in an open, engaging atmosphere. The JIC uses interactive exercises, pictorial aids and edutainment strategies to promote behavior change among young people aged 15 years and older.</description>
