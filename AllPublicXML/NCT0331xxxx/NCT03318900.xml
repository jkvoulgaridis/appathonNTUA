      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of utomilumab and how well it
      works with CD8-positive T-lymphocyte (T-cell infusion) and aldesleukin in treating patients
      with ovarian cancer that has come back. Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cells to kill
      ovarian cancer cells. Giving white blood cells (T-cells) that have been activated by a
      vaccine with aldesleukin may kill more tumor cells. Immunotherapy with utomilumab, may induce
      changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving T-cell infusion with aldesleukin and utomilumab may work better in treating
      patients with ovarian cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of adoptively transferred central memory-type CTL targeting
      ovarian cancer antigens administered alone, and in combination with, utomilumab, an agonistic
      anti-CD137 antibody, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

      II. Evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred central
      memory-type CTL with and without utomilumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the anti tumor effect of adoptively transferred central memory-type CTL targeting
      ovarian cancer antigens as measured by best overall response rate (BORR) and progression free
      survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of utomilumab.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on
      day -2, CD8-positive T-lymphocyte via infusion on day 0, and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC)
      every 12 hours for 14 days. Beginning 24 hours after CD8-positive T-lymphocyte, patients also
      receive utomilumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, and 141 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 3, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35,
      43, 49, 56, 64, 70, 77, 84, 112, and 140.

    <description>To evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred central memory-type CTL with and without Utomilumab, duration of in vivo persistence defined as the time between T cell infusion and last time point at which the transferred T cell DNA signature is detectable in peripheral blood. Transferred antigen-specific T cells will be tracked by tetramer analysis as well as by TCR tracking (Immunoseq assay, Adaptive Biotech), both assays, have been established in lab as reliable measures of T cell persistence.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>BORR is defined as the total number of participants who's BOR is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), divided by the total number of participants. Radiographic imaging and clinical assessment of residual disease will be compared with pre-infusion baseline assessment according to modified RECIST 1.1 for response: complete response (CR) defined as total regression of all tumor, a partial response (PR) as 30% or greater decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and progressive disease (PD) as 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions (modified world health organization criteria or mWHO). Assessment at 6 and 12 weeks following T cell infusion and then every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week) until disease progression or intervening therapy. The overall response rate (OR) will be after 1 cycle (12) weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the T cell infusion</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time between T cell infusion date and the date of progression or death. A participant who dies without reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. For those who remain alive and have not progressed, PFS will be censored on the date of last tumor assessment. For participants who have PD prior to Week 12 and a subsequent assessment of SD, PR or CR, the date of PD following response (where available) will be used in the analysis of PFS; otherwise these participants will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. PFS is estimated for each arm using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method.</description>

             prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid.

          -  {Turnstile 2} Any prior grade &gt;= 3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) while receiving
             any previous immunotherapy agent, or any unresolved irAE &gt; grade 1.
