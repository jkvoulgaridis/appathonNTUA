    <textblock>
      An investigator-blinded, prospective, 6 month study of subjects with persistent erythema
      associated with active rosacea will be conducted in 20 subjects aged 18 years and older. All
      subjects will receive standard-of-care brimonidine topical gel, 0.33% with instructions to
      apply it once daily per package insert. Adherence will be assessed using weekly internet
      surveys to document how often the medication is being used, as well as reminders about
      rosacea triggers and general use of brimonidine.

      rosacea triggers and general use of brimonidine.Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to be in the
      weekly internet survey group or the standard care non-survey group.

      At each visit, review of the internet survey use will be done to assess adherence to the
      medication. . Disease severity measures ((Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA), and Lesion
      counts will be obtained. QOL will be measured.
