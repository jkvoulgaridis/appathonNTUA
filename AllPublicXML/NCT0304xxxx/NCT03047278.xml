  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the influence of the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes
      (DM2) and of cetirizine (OCTs inhibitor) on gabapentin kinetics disposition and
      pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) in patients with neuropathic pain. Thus, non-diabetic patients
      (Control Group, n=10), patients with controlled diabetes (n=9) and patients with uncontrolled
      diabetes (n=10), all with neuropathic pain of intensity ≥ 4 in pain visual analog scale
      (0-10) were investigated.

    <textblock>
      Gabapentin (GBP), anticonvulsant used to neuropathic pain treatment, is mainly eliminated
      unchanged in urine. Renal active tubular secretion has been suggested to contribute on GBP
      excretion by renal excretion. Studies performed on rats with experimental diabetes suggest
      that hyperglycemia reduces the activity of organic cation transporters (Oct). Thus, the aim
      of the study was to investigate the role of OCTs on kinetic disposition and pharmacodynamics
      of GBP in patients with neuropathic pain and to verify the regulation of these transporters'
      activity by glycemic control in diabetes. A cross-over clinical study was performed in
      patients with neuropathic pain (n=10, Control) to evaluate the influence of CTZ on GBP
      kinetic disposition. To evaluate the effect of glycemic control, patients with controlled DM2
      (DC, n=9) and uncontrolled DM2 (DNC, n=10) were investigated. All participants investigated
      had neuropathic pain of intensity ≥ 4 evaluated by analogue visual scale (EVA) and were
      treated with oral single-dose of 300 mg of GBP (Phase 1) or cetirizine (20 mg/day) for 5 days
      and single-dose of GBP on the last day (Phase 2). Only participants of Control group
      participated of Phase 2. Serial blood and urine samples were collected up to 36 hours after
      GBP administration. The intensity of pain was evaluated at the same time of blood sampling,
      using the visual analog scale. GBP concentration in plasma and urine was validated by
      JPLC-UV. All participants were genotyped for polymorphisms SLC22A2 808G&gt;T and SLC22A4
      1507C&gt;T. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis.

    <description>Adult patients (18 - 59 years old) with neuropathic pain of score ≥ 4 that do not use gabapentin were recruited. All patients received oral single dose of gabapentin (300 mg) as capsules after 12 hour-fasting (phase I). To investigate GBP pharmacokinetics, blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes up to 36 hours after GBP administration. The urine of the patients was collected up to 36 hours after GBP administration. The intensity of pain was evaluated in each time of blood sampling through the visual analog scale (0-10). In phase II, after 15 days (wash-out) from phase I, cetirizine hydrochloride (10 mg) was administered orally, twice a day, as pills, for five days. On the last day of cetirizine treatment, an oral single dose of gabapentin (300 mg), as capsule, was administered. Serial blood and urine samples were collected up to 36 hours after GBP administration. The intensity of pain was evaluated in each time of blood sampling.</description>
