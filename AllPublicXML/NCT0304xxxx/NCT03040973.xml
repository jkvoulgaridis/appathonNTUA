      The rollover study will provide continued treatment and assessment of long-term safety
      follow-up in patients receiving capmatinib (INC280) as a single agent or in combination with
      EGF816 or Gefitinib in a Novartis sponsored study and in the opinion of the Investigator
      would benefit from continued treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patient is currently receiving INC280 treatment (within an INC280 Novartis-sponsored
             study which is eligible and approved to transition patients to rollover study) as
             single agent or in combination or is receiving a combination treatment alone*. Please
             refer to the list of parent studies in Appendix 14.

             *This includes all patients treated with INC280 in combination with other treatment
             that permanently discontinued INC280 for any reason but are still receiving the
             combination treatment as single agent. In order to receive the combination treatment
             as single agent in the rollover study, treatment need to be not accessible to the
             patient outside a clinical trial (e.g. commercially not available or reimbursed).

          2. Subject is currently deriving clinical benefit from study treatment as determined by
             the investigator.

          3. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other
             study procedures.

          4. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in the rollover study and
             receiving study medication. If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be
             formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients eligible for this study must not meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Patient is currently not receiving any study treatment due to unresolved toxicities
             for which study drug dosing has been interrupted or permanently discontinued in the
             parent protocol (Patients meeting all other eligibility criteria may be enrolled once
             toxicities have resolved to allow study drug dosing to resume).

          2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women

          3. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 7 days after stopping treatment. Highly effective contraception
             methods include:

             Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Female
             sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy)
             total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study
             treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male sterilization (at
             least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the study the vasectomized
             male partner should be the sole partner for that subject Use of oral, injected or
             implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device or
             intrauterine system, or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable
             efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
             contraception. In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on
             the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Women are
             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.,
             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or bilateral tubal ligation at least six
             weeks before study entry. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Sexually active males
             unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 7 days after
             stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required
             to be used also by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via semen.

          4. Concurrent participation in another clinical study other than a parent clinical study
