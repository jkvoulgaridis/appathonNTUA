      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of VAD Care App in an out-patient mechanical
      circulatory support program. The specific aim for this pilot study is to obtain preliminary
      efficacy data of the VAD Care App as a self-management tool for patients with long-term
      LVADs. A randomized control trial will be employed to establish preliminary estimates of the
      effects of the App on the following outcomes: self-efficacy and adherence to the LVAD care
      regimen; LVAD-related complications and health care utilization [e.g., hospital
      re-admission]; overall health status and quality of life. The duration of the study is 6
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 250,000 of 5.8 million Americans are suffering from an advanced or end-stage heart
      failure. Generally, these individuals require a heart transplant or a mechanical circulatory
      support such as a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD). LVAD is implanted to liberate
      patients from crippling symptoms of heart failure, or in some cases avert imminent death.
      However, maintaining health and improving quality of life (QOL) depend on a &quot;trouble-free&quot;
      LVAD. Despite the refinement in circulatory support technology, many patients and their
      family caregivers still face challenges in managing the LVAD in home settings. The LVAD
      home-care regimen comprise of complex technical and non-technical tasks and procedures that
      must be implemented frequently and consistently. During the first 6 months following hospital
      discharge, patients/caregivers generally exhibit low levels of confidence (i.e.,
      self-efficacy) in managing the tasks/procedures. This problem appears to contribute to low
      adherence to the regimen and poor outcomes. The current self-management processes include
      provision of instructional manuals and logs for vital signs, LVAD parameters, etc. To address
      this problem, the research team developed a mobile phone VAD Care App as a self-management
      tool. The app will aid and may ease patients/caregivers' problems in managing the complexity
      of the home-care regimen. The app offers patients/caregivers with (a) daily reminders about
      the tasks/procedures to be performed, (b) videoconferencing feature to communicate with
      healthcare providers about LVAD and health issues, and (c) on-line LVAD training/education.
      The prototype of the app was tested by 16 patients and caregivers. Results included ease of
      use and high acceptability and competency rates among users.The specific aim for the present
      study is to obtain preliminary efficacy data of the care app as self-management tool in
      patients with a long-term LVAD. This study will employ a randomized control trial to
      establish preliminary estimates of the effects of the care app on the following:
      self-efficacy and adherence to the LVAD home-care regimen; LVAD-related complications and
      healthcare utilizations; overall health status and QOL. A total of 40 patients (with
      caregivers) will be recruited. There will be 20 patients allocated in the control (usual
      care) and experimental (usual care + VAD Care App) groups. Data collection will be performed
      during pre-hospital discharge (baseline) and at 1, 3 and 6 months post discharge using
      self-administered questionnaires, chart reviews, interviews, and retrieval of historical data
      of the care app. Descriptive and inferential statistical procedures will be employed for data
      analysis. The outcome of this pilot will inform the next stages of investigations that are
      crucial for transforming LVAD self-management processes and improving outcomes.

    <ipd_description>Data sharing will be made available for research to those who request it once analyses of specific aims have been conducted and findings have been published. All data will be de-identified. Persons interested in using the data will need to submit a request in writing, stating their intended use. Data will be made available at cost. Requirements for sharing will include acknowledgement in all publications of the funding source and of the study authors. Data sets will be accompanied by a data dictionary for all study variables, both derived and raw data. We will consider the most cost-effective means for sharing data after a data-sharing agreement has been reached. For example, data may be copied to a CD or DVD, be posted on a password protected and secure web site, or made available through a third party data archive service. We will also share research findings through publications and presentations at scholarly research meetings.</ipd_description>

          <title>Control Group</title>
          <description>Participants in the control group (20 LVAD patients) will receive usual care over 6 months. Usual care consists of routine clinic visits/follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months post hospital discharge. A customary LVAD self-management/discharge education and training will be provided to patients and caregiver before hospital discharge and as need throughout the duration of the study. The control group will NOT receive the VAD Care App.
Usual LVAD Care: Routine clinic follow-up visits over 6 months. Patients and caregivers will both receive self-management education post discharge and as needed throughout the duration of the study.</description>

          <description>Participants in the experimental group (20 LVAD patients) will receive usual care plus VAD Care App. They will implement LVAD self-management as directed by VAD Care App. The app will be used daily by patients and/or caregivers for over 6 months. Their LVAD self-management competencies will be assessed at months 1 and 5 post hospital discharge with a review of LVAD self-management skills provided by the LVAD RN Coordinator.
