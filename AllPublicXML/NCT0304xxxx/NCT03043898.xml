  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the propagation of sound from a source in the chest to the chest
      wall.

      The methodology of the study will be to place a sound source at a known location in the chest
      and measure the acoustic response on the posterior chest wall with an acoustic sensor array.

      The sound source will be created by playing sound down the working channel of a bronchoscope
      and located anatomically using direct imaging.

      Subjects will be selected for the study by asking patients undergoing a bronchoscopy
      procedure whether they would be willing to take part in the experiment in addition to their
      standard procedure.

      Procedures will take place in the Bronchoscopy Unit at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge.
      The Unit runs regional speciality clinics in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
      asthma, lung cancer, bronchomalacia and interstitial lung disease and has a nationally
      significant interventional bronchoscopy service.

      A subsidiary part of the study (Part A) will collect sound recordings from healthy volunteers
      and patients with common respiratory diseases using the same acoustic sensor array. This is
      to create a database of lung sounds and quantify inter-subject variability.

      The study will last approximately 30 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two parts, A and B. Both parts are observational studies of the sounds heard at
      the chest as recorded by an acoustic array.

      In Part A, healthy volunteers and patients at Addenbrooke's hospital will have the chest
      sounds at their back recorded using an electronic-stethoscope array. This will be done in a
      single session lasting approximately 30 minutes. 50 healthy volunteers and 100 patients will
      be included.

      In Part B, 50 patients undergoing a bronchoscopy at Addenbrooke's hospital will have their
      bronchoscopy extended by 5-10 minutes so that sounds can be played through the working
      channel of the bronchoscope and recorded by a microphone array at the posterior chest. Part B
      will investigate 25 patients with structurally 'normal' lungs (for example patients with
      Chronic Cough) (Part B(i)), and 25 patients with lung disease that has resulted in an
      'abnormal' lung structure (Part B(ii)).

      The consultant bronchoscopist will assign the patient to the relevant group based on
      information from their medical history and their CT scan. For Part B of the study an existing
      CT scan is an inclusion criterion. CT scans will not be carried out specifically for this
      study.
