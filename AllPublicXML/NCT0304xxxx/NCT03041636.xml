  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate works in treating patients with
      previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Ruxolitinib
      phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of ruxolitinib phosphate (ruxolitinib) in patients with high-risk
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who do not require
      anti-neoplastic therapy according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 recommendations and were either previously untreated or treated with
      Ibrutinib for less than 3 months and were deemed Ibrutinib intolerant:

      Ia. On disease burden. Ib. The rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as
      assessed by the IWCLL 2008 response criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the time to next treatment of high-risk CLL/SLL who do not require
      anti-neoplastic therapy according to the IWCLL 2008 recommendations.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues for
      up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment
      beyond 3 years may be permitted after discussion with the principal investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
