  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This qualitative study seeks to assess whether mobile health technologies are helpful for
      older adults. It is the first in a series of four studies whose overarching goal is to
      conduct a program of pilot research aimed at developing and evaluating a technology-assisted
      wellness intervention for older adults with obesity who may or may not live in a rural area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed and conducted as a series of eighteen individual semi-structured
      interviews and four focus group discussions. There are three participant groups: 1) older
      adults (age ≥ 65 years) with diagnosed obesity, 2) primary care clinicians who care for older
      adults, and 3) community leaders. Focus group discussions are conducted with the older adult
      cohort only.

    <description>The investigators will record and transcribe each interview and focus group discussion for post-hoc evaluation. The investigators will then use the transcripts to identify themes related to the secondary outcome. Themes may include (but are not limited to) barriers and facilitators experienced by older adults when they want to lose weight or eat healthier, barriers and facilitators to joining wellness programs, and general availability of options and support.</description>

        Older adult participants screened and recruited primarily in local primary care setting
        (Department of Community and Family Medicine at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center), as
        well as through other marketing channels such as posters and radio advertising. Community
        leaders and clinicians recruited by invitation from the principal investigator.
