  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the impact of menopause-related sleep fragmentation on
      metabolic biomarkers of body fat gain. The investigators hypothesize that experimental sleep
      fragmentation will result in an adverse leptin response as a metabolic biomarker for body fat
      gain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While obesity is highly prevalent in midlife and older women, with rates increasing markedly
      after age 40 and body fat increasing in half of women during and after the menopause
      transition, factors causing these changes are not well understood. Reduced total sleep time
      has been shown to adversely impact biomarkers of obesity, but the effect of the highly
      prevalent menopause-related sleep fragmentation secondary to hot flashes on metabolism and
      eating behaviors in humans is not known. We will use experimental paradigms to isolate the
      impact of menopause-related sleep disruption, as well as that of hot flashes and estrogen
      withdrawal, metabolic biomarkers of body fat gain and on eating behaviors, results of which
      will inform strategies to prevent body fat gain and improve cardio-metabolic health outcomes
      in women.
