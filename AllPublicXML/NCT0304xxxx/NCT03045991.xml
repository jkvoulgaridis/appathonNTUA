  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the treatment effects of sequential combination of
      aerobic exercise and cognitive training on cognitive function, physiological markers, daily
      function, physical function, social participation and quality of life in stroke patients with
      cognitive decline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive decline after stroke is a common sequela and is highly associated with functional
      disability. Empirical evidence shows that exercise combined cognitive training may induce
      neuroplastic changes that modulate cognitive function. However, evidence about the effects of
      combined exercise-cognitive trainings on physiological biomarkers, cognitive and physical
      functions in stroke patients with cognitive decline is still less. The present study aim to
      investigate the effects of sequential combination of exercise-cognitive trainings on
      cognitive, physical, and daily function. In addition, the physiological mechanism of the
      combination training on cognitive function by several biomarkers including the brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), antioxidative marker, HbA1c, and plasma lipid level will be
      investigated. This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to SEQ group in which sequentially perform physical exercise and cognitive
      training or to CI group of control intervention.

    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>
