      regimen) in newly diagnosed Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-labeled , single arm, phase-II pilot study which aims to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and prednisone (TCP
      regimen) in newly diagnosed Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) patients.There would be
      two phases of the study. The treatment and the response evaluation phase will last from the
      time of enrollment up to 24 months (evaluation will be carried out every 3 months). The
      follow-up phase to assess for progression of disease will last from 24 months (2 years) to 4
      years after enrollment (evaluation will be carried out every 12 months).The total study
      duration will be 4 years after the last patient starts study medication.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Durable Tumor and Symptomatic Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to the time point when a patient achieves treatment response for 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Durable tumor and symptomatic response is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). CR: complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease (eg, pleural effusion) and resolution of baseline symptoms attributed to multicentric Castleman's disease, sustained for at least 18 weeks. PR: &gt;=50 percent decrease in sum of the product of the diameters of indicator lesion(s), with at least stable disease in all other evaluable disease in the absence of treatment failure sustained for at least 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time to death or treatment failure. Treatment failure is defined as: sustained increase in grade ≥2 disease-related symptoms persisting ≥12 weeks; new disease-related grade ≥3 symptoms; sustained &gt;1 point increase in ECOG-PS persisting for ≥12 weeks; radiological progression; or initiation of another treatment for MCD.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival, defined as the time to patients' death, is measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SF-36 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 24 weeks after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 score is a self-administered scoring system which reflects a patient's general health status. SF-36 contains 8 dimensions, including physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, vitality, mental health, social functioning, bodily pain, and general health. Each dimension ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores mean better outcome. SF-36 score at baseline was compared with SF-36 score at 24 weeks.</description>

          <title>Number of Patients With Durable Tumor and Symptomatic Response</title>
          <description>Durable tumor and symptomatic response is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). CR: complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease (eg, pleural effusion) and resolution of baseline symptoms attributed to multicentric Castleman's disease, sustained for at least 18 weeks. PR: &gt;=50 percent decrease in sum of the product of the diameters of indicator lesion(s), with at least stable disease in all other evaluable disease in the absence of treatment failure sustained for at least 6 months.</description>
