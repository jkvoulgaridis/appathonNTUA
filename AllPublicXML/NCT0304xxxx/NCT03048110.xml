    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in subject who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs that started or worsened after first administration of study medication up to 30 days after end of treatment with study medication were considered to be treatment-emergent (TE). AEs that occurred on study drug administration were termed as study drug related adverse events.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subject - as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee
             based on medical evaluations including medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

          -  Gender: Male.

          -  Age: 45 to 65 years (inclusive) at the screening visit.

          -  Race: White.

          -  Body mass index (BMI): ≥18.0 and ≤30 kg/m^2.

          -  Agree to use condoms as an effective contraception barrier method and refrain from
             sperm donation during the whole study (starting after informed consent) and for 3
             months after the end of treatment with ODM-201. In addition, participants must agree
             to utilize a second reliable method of contraception simultaneously. The second method
             which has to be used by a female partner of childbearing potential can be one of the
             following methods: diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide or intra-uterine device
             or hormone-based contraception.

          -  Results of alcohol tests are negative at screening and on Study Day -1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical and surgical history

          -  Existing relevant diseases of vital organs (e.g. liver diseases, heart diseases),
             central nervous system (for example seizures) or other organs (e.g. diabetes
             mellitus).

        Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases for which it can be assumed that the absorption,
        distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the study drugs will not be normal.

          -  Febrile illness within 1 week before the first study drug administration.

          -  A medical history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g. family history of Long
             QT Syndrome) or other arrhythmias.

          -  Known severe allergies, non-allergic drug reactions, or (multiple) drug allergies
             (excluding untreated, asymptomatic seasonal allergies like non-severe hay fever during
             the time of study conduct).

          -  Known history of hypersensitivity (or known allergic reaction) to itraconazole,
             rifampicin or ODM-201.

          -  Relevant hepatic disorders like cholestasis, disturbances of bilirubin metabolism, any
             progressive liver disease.

          -  Relevant renal disorders like recurrent glomerulonephritis, renal injury, and renal
             insufficiency. However, a history of a single episode of uncomplicated nephrolithiasis
             will not prevent participation.

          -  Subjects with porphyria.

          -  Subjects with diagnosed malignancy within the past 5 years except for cured skin basal
             carcinoma.
