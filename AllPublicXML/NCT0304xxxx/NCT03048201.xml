    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain long-term implant survivorship (out to 10
      years) and to assess clinical, patient-reported outcome measures, and radiographic data for
      the commercially available Physica system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market registry study; the study device is FDA cleared and used according to
      the intended use.

      This is a multi-centre, prospective, non-randomized study.

      Subjects will be implanted with one of the following configurations of the Physica system:
      Physica KR (Kinematic Retaining), Physica CR (Cruciate Retaining) or Physica PS (Posterior
      Stabilized). The assignment of any patient involved in the study is determined by the
      aetiology preoperatively evaluated by the Investigator and falls within current practice. The
      decision to use a specific prosthesis design is decided by the Investigators independently
      and clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study.

      Baseline measurements (pre-operative clinical analysis and radiographic analysis at 6-week
      FU) will serve as internal control term during the assessment of post-surgery data out to 10
      years.

      The primary objectives of this study are to obtain implant survivorship and to evaluate
      clinical, PROMs and radiographic outcomes for the commercially available Physica system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females of any race requiring a total knee replacement and suitable for the
             use of one of the configurations of the Physica system

          2. Age&gt; 22 (skeletally mature)

          3. Patients who are suffering from non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease (NIDJD):
             including knee osteoarthritis, post-traumatic knee arthritis; or patients who are
             suffering from inflammatory arthritis; or patients that need correction of a
             functional deformity

          4. Suitable candidates for TKR who have undamaged and functional collateral ligaments

          5. Suitable candidates for TKR with Physica KR and CR who have an undamaged and
             functional posterior cruciate ligament; or suitable candidates for TKR using Physica
