  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with
      bladder cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally
      advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic) with tuberous sclerosis (TSC)1 and/or TSC2
      mutations (changes in deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]). Sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR) and partial
      response (PR) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma
      (TCC) harboring a TSC1 mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sapanisertib (MLN0128) (TAK-228) in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic TCC harboring a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation.

      II. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ORR in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TCC harboring a TSC2
      mutation.

      II. To evaluate toxicity, PFS, and OS in TSC2 mutation patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and every 6 months
      thereafter.
