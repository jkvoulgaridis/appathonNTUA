  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For procedures involving proximity to the nerves responsible for eye movement, the need to
      monitor eye movement exists. The current solution is to place needles in the muscles
      surrounding the eye. The Investigators have invented a non-invasive electrode and software
      designed to monitor eye movements non-invasively. The electrode is placed on the skin on the
      corner of the eye and using the natural dipole of the eye, detects the horizontal and
      vertical movements of the eye. The Investigators would like to prove efficacy compared to the
      standard monitoring.

    <description>The current method of measuring eye movement is to place needles in the muscles surrounding the eye. For the non-invasive method, the electrode is placed on the skin on the corner of the eye and using the natural dipole of the eye, detects horizontal and vertical movements of the eye. The signal comparison for the two methods would be a biphasic dipole representing eye movements compared to the compound muscle action potential of the invasive method.</description>

    <description>The additional electrodes are modified EEG electrodes (used in clinical practice on the head already) placed in a silicone molding. These are placed lateral to the eye with the patient asleep. These are then wired to the same recording apparatus that is commonly used for recording.</description>
