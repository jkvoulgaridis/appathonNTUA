  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ProtonicsTM Knee brace has been suggested as an intervention for patients with patellofemoral
      pain syndrome (PFPS). However, the effectiveness of this knee brace compared to traditional
      conservative methods knee rehabilitation is lacking. The objective of this randomized
      controlled trial was to compare the effect of ProtonicsTM knee brace vs. sports cord on knee
      pain and function in patients with PFPS.

      The purpose of this graduate student research study was to compare the effect of ProtonicsTM
      knee brace vs. sports cord on knee pain and function in patients with PFPS.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial.

      Setting: Loma Linda University.

      Participants: Subjects with patellofemoral pain will participate in the study.

      Intervention: Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups, the ProtonicsTM
      knee brace or the sport cord to complete a series of resistance exercises over the course of
      4 weeks.

      Main Outcome Measures: Both groups will be evaluated according to the following clinical
      outcomes: Anterior pelvic tilt (APT), hip internal/external rotation, and iliotibial band
      flexibility. The following functional outcomes were also assessed: Global Rating of Change
      (GROC) scale, the Kujala score, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and the lateral step-down
      test.

    <measure>Anterior Pelvic Tilt</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior Pelvic Tilt: tilting of the pelvic will be measured with CHEK inclinometer. Tilting will be measured while subjects are in a standing position. The examiner will determine the two measure line marks, anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) to find the oblique angle of the pelvic.
Normative values from other study that we will be using to compare anterior pelvic tilt: Male = 9° and Female = 12° (from Nguyen study in 2007).
The CHEK inclinometer caliper has two arms; one arm will be placed on ASIS (front of pelvis) while the other on the PSIS (back of pelvis). The angle of the caliper will be determined to record the degree of anterior pelvic tilt.
Baseline measurement to Post-intervention measurement = Four (4) weeks.</description>

    <description>The Protonics system has been introduced to physical therapists as a potential treatment for PFPS. The system includes a brace set to resist knee flexion and a set of specific exercises to perform daily. Through resistance to knee flexion, the system is advertised to decrease retropatellar contact pressure due to changes in pelvis inclination and available hip rotation. Specifically, resistance to knee flexion is purported to increase hamstring activity and inhibit the activity of the tensor fasciae latae and psoas muscles. The manufacturer asserts that prolonged use of the system results in greater hamstring activation, which leads to permanent structural changes through reciprocal inhibition at the hip and pelvis. The warm-up consisted of the subject wearing the ProtonicsTM knee brace set at a moderate resistance level and flexing the knees while sitting, standing, and reclining in the supine and prone positions.</description>

    <description>Subjects assigned to the sport cord group were asked to do the same warm-ups and exercises using the sport cord in the supine, standing, sitting, and prone positions. prone. The only difference is that subjects were asked to only walk backwards instead of forwards in order to avoid activation of the hip flexor muscle. The appropriate level of resistance for each subject was calculated by multiplying their weight in pounds by 0.3. Subjects were then given either light, medium, or heavy resistance cords according to the following classification scheme: light (pink color) with resistance 3 (R3), 0-30 lbs.; medium (orange color) with resistance 5 (R5) 0-50 lbs.; heavy (yellow color) with resistance 7 (R7) 0-70 lbs. All subjects completed three study visits, and a total of four measurements were taken at baseline, immediately following the first session, at two weeks, and at 4 weeks.</description>

          <title>Protonics Knee Brace</title>
          <description>Subjects were fitted with a regular-sized Protonics knee brace with resistive settings to resist knee flexion.
Protonics Knee brace: Program was separated into three phases for a period of 4 weeks. Each phase the patients learned how to perform the Protonics neuromuscular repositioning technique, Protonics gait and open-chain exercise. Subjects asked to perform the exercise 3 times a week, 3 sets a day; every set is 10-15 repetitions for 4 weeks.
Phase one, Subjects performed Protonics Neuromuscular repositioning Techniques, walking for up to 5 minutes or as tolerated, and preform warming up exercise.
Phase two, subjects performed Protonics Neuromuscular repositioning Techniques, walking for up to 8 minutes or as tolerated, and preform three specific exercises in prone, supine and sitting position.
Phase three, the subjects performed Protonics Neuromuscular repositioning Techniques, walking for up to 10 minutes or as tolerated, and preformed exercise in standing position.</description>

        <title>Anterior Pelvic Tilt</title>
        <description>Anterior Pelvic Tilt: tilting of the pelvic will be measured with CHEK inclinometer. Tilting will be measured while subjects are in a standing position. The examiner will determine the two measure line marks, anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) to find the oblique angle of the pelvic.
Normative values from other study that we will be using to compare anterior pelvic tilt: Male = 9° and Female = 12° (from Nguyen study in 2007).
The CHEK inclinometer caliper has two arms; one arm will be placed on ASIS (front of pelvis) while the other on the PSIS (back of pelvis). The angle of the caliper will be determined to record the degree of anterior pelvic tilt.
Baseline measurement to Post-intervention measurement = Four (4) weeks.</description>

          <description>Anterior Pelvic Tilt: tilting of the pelvic will be measured with CHEK inclinometer. Tilting will be measured while subjects are in a standing position. The examiner will determine the two measure line marks, anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) to find the oblique angle of the pelvic. Approximate normally anterior pelvic tilt for male is 9° and for female is about 12° (Nguyen, 2007). The caliper has two arms; one arm will be placed on ASIP while the other on the PSIS. The angle of the caliper will be determined to record the degree of anterior pelvic tilt.</description>

Subjects with PFPS will be asked to step up and down on a 15-cm step for 15 seconds each with a cadence of 2 steps per second. The total number of step-ups during this time will be recorded. Subjects will be asked to report a verbal pain score during the step-up test at each test session. This test will be performed every two weeks to document any improvement in the functional performance. The test has shown to be reliable and valid, with test-retest reliability of (ICC = 0.90) (Ross et al, 1997).</description>

            <description>All subjects were fitted with a regular-sized Protonics knee brace with resistive settings to resist knee flexion.
Protonics Knee brace: Protonics Therapy Program is separated into three phases for a period of 4 weeks. In each phase the patients will learn how to perform the Protonics neuromuscular repositioning technique, Protonics gait and open-chain exercise. All subjects will be asked to perform the exercise 3 times a week, 3 sets a day; every set is 10-15 repetitions for 4 weeks In phase one, the subjects will perform Protonics Neuromuscular repositioning Techniques, Protonics gait through walking for up to 5 minutes or as tolerated, and preform warming up exercise.
In phase two, the subjects will perform Protonics Neuromuscular repositioning Techniques, Protonics gait through walking for up to 8 minutes or as tolerated, and preform three specific exercises in prone, supine and sitting position.

          <title>Lateral Step-Down Test</title>
          <description>Lateral step test: is a quick and simple practical clinical measure of functional. Subjects with PFPS will be asked to step up and down on a 15-cm step for 15 seconds each with a cadence of 2 steps per second. The total number of step-ups during this time will be recorded. Subjects will be asked to report a verbal pain score during the step-up test at each test session. This test will be performed every two weeks to document any improvement in the functional performance. The test has shown to be reliable and valid, with test-retest reliability of (ICC = 0.90) (Ross et al, 1997).</description>
