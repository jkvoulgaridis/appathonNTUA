      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria

        1. Written informed consent and any locally-required authorization (EU Data Privacy
        Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject prior to performing any protocol-related
        procedures, including screening evaluations.

        2. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
        including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up.

        3. Age ≥ 18 years at time of study entry. 4. ECOG performance status 0-1. 5. Patients with
        measurable disease (at least one uni-dimensionally measurable target lesion by CT-scan or
        MRI) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) are eligible.
        For patients in group A, non-measurable and measurable lesions may be chosen for
        irradiation. However, in order to allow for evaluation of abscopal effects, patients in
        group A must have at least one measurable lesion beside the lesion planned to be
        irradiated. Lesions planned to be irradiated may not be defined as a measurable target
        lesion. Radiographic tumor assessment must be performed within 28 days before initiation of
        study treatment.

        6. Target Lesions may be located in a previously irradiated field if there is documented
        (radiographic) disease progression in that site.

        7. Patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in 2nd-line and
        3rd-line treatment and

          1. no necessity of radiotherapy or

          2. the necessity of radiotherapy of a metastatic bone lesion or soft tissue lesion.

               -  Patients with intrathoracic metastases or intrathoracic progressive disease will
                  be included if radiotherapy of the lung parenchyma is NOT required

               -  Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been
                  treated and treatment has been completed at least 12 weeks before inclusion in
                  this study for group B and 2 weeks for group A. Moreover, there must be no
                  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression within 28 days prior to
                  the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement for
                  immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone
                  equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients
                  with stable/asymptomatic brain metastases that do not require local therapy with
                  irradiation (whole brain irradiation or stereotactic brain irradiation) can be
                  included. In ambiguous cases, consultation with the LKP or his/her delegate is
                  advised.

                  8. Patients who will receive study therapy after acceptable prior therapy as
                  specified below are eligible: i. Patients who will receive study therapy as
                  2nd-line or 3rd-line of treatment:

                    1. Patients must have experienced disease recurrence or progression during or
                       after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen for advanced or
                       metastatic disease.

                       First line therapy is defined as therapy used to treat advanced disease.
                       Each subsequent line of therapy is preceded by disease progression. A switch
                       of an agent within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the
                       start of a new line of therapy. Subjects must have received at least 2
                       cycles of platinum doublet based chemotherapy before discontinuation for
                       toxicity.

                       Experimental therapies when given as separate regimen are considered as
                       separate line of therapy.

                       Maintenance therapy following platinum doublet-based chemotherapy is not
                       considered as a separate regimen of therapy and could comprise continuation
                       of one or more of the agents used in the first-line therapy regimen or
                       switch to another non cross-resistant agent. The initiation of maintenance
                       therapy requires the lack of progressive disease with front-line therapy.

                       Treatment given for locally advanced disease is not considered as a line of
                       therapy for advanced disease. Subjects with recurrent disease &gt; 6 months
                       after platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation
                       therapy given for locally advanced disease, who also subsequently progressed
                       during or after a platinum doublet-based regimen given to treat the
                       recurrence, are eligible.

                    2. Patients who received platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or
                       definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease, and
                       developed recurrent (local or metastatic) disease within 6 months of
                       completing therapy are eligible.

                       Adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy (after surgery and/or
                       radiation therapy) followed by recurrent or metastatic disease within 6
                       months of completing therapy is considered as first line therapy for
                       advanced disease.

                  9. A formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block (archival or
                  recent) or a minimum of 15 unstained slides of tumor sample (2-3 µm sections,
                  slices must be recent and collected on slides provided by the sponsor) must be
                  available for biomarker (PD-L1) evaluation. Biopsy should be excisional,
                  incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is insufficient.

                  10. Prior therapies and surgeries are allowed if completed 2 weeks for minor
                  surgery (group A and B) or 12 weeks for any previous radiotherapy for group B,
                  respectively prior to start of treatment and patient recovered from toxic
                  effects. For group A, any prior radiotherapy not involving the lungs must be
                  completed 2 weeks prior to start of treatment. A prior radiotherapy involving the
                  lungs must be completed 12 weeks prior to start of treatment.

                  11. Subjects must have recovered from the effects of major surgery or significant
                  traumatic injury at least 14 days before the first dose of study treatment.

                  12. Adequate blood count, liver-enzymes, and renal function (obtained no later
                  than 14 days prior to start of treatment): WBC ≥ 2000/μL Neutrophils ≥ 1500/μL
                  Platelets ≥ 100 x103/μL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

             Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min (if using the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula below):

             Female CrCl = ((140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85) / (72 x serum creatinine in
             mg/dL)

             Male CrCl = ((140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00) / (72 x serum creatinine in
             mg/dL)

             AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome,
             who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

             13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30
             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last
             dose of nivolumab.

             14. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of
             nivolumab.

             15. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31
             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception).

             Exclusion criteria

               1. Previous malignancy (other than NSCLC), which either progresses or requires
                  active treatment.

                  Subjects with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and the
                  following in situ cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia,
                  endometrial, melanoma, or breast) are excluded unless a complete remission was

                  fatigue must have resolved to grade 1 (NCI CTCAE version 4) or baseline before
                  administration of study drug.

               8. Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune
                  disease. NOTE: Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I

                  examining, laboratory finding, altered mental status, or psychiatric condition
                  that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit a subject's ability to
                  comply with the study requirements, substantially increase risk to the subject,
                  or impact the interpretability of study results.
