    <description>A GH responder was defined as a subject with mean serum GH concentration ≤2.5 micrograms per litre (mcg/L) or &gt;50% reduction from mean baseline GH concentration after a 6-day titration and an 8-day treatment period with BIM23B065. The mean serum concentration of GH was measured over 6 hours at baseline (Day -1) and on Day 14. The number of subjects who were GH responders at Day 14 of the treatment period is presented.</description>

          -  Subjects will have a documented diagnosis of acromegaly.

          -  Subjects will have active acromegaly confirmed by a mean serum concentration of GH
             over 2 hours &gt; 2.5 µg/L at screening analysed by central laboratory.

          -  Subjects who have had pituitary surgery must be &gt;8 weeks post-surgery.

          -  18 to 75 years of age.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (female subjects).

          -  Female who is either of non-childbearing potential or who is not pregnant at screening
             and agrees to use highly effective contraception during whole duration of the study.
             Non-childbearing potential is defined as being postmenopausal for at least 1 year, or
             women with documented infertility (natural or acquired).

          -  Male subjects must agree that, if their partner is at risk of becoming pregnant, they
             will use a medically accepted, effective method of contraception (i.e. condom) for the
             duration of the treatment period of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has received long-acting Somatostatin Analogues (SSA) within 12 weeks
             prior screening (e.g.octreotide long acting release (LAR), lanreotide Autogel,
             pasireotide LAR).

          -  The subject has received short-acting SSA within 1 week (e.g. octreotide SC) prior to
             screening.

          -  The subject has received a dopamine agonist within 6 weeks (e.g., bromocriptine or
             cabergoline) prior to screening.

          -  The subject has received GH antagonist within 12 weeks prior to screening (e.g.,
             pegvisomant).

          -  The subject had undergone radiotherapy to the pituitary gland at any time prior to
             study entry.

          -  It is anticipated that the subject will undergo pituitary surgery or radiation to the
             pituitary gland during the study, or will require additional medical therapy for
             acromegaly (including SSA, pegvisomant, or dopamine agonists) during the study.

          -  The subject has unsubstituted/untreated adrenal insufficiency.

          -  If the subject has any history of postural hypotension or evidence of postural
             hypotension at screening (&gt;= 20 mm Hg decrease in Systolic blood pressure (SBP), &gt;= 10
             mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, or &gt;=30 bpm increases in pulse rate, after
             standing for 2 minutes from resting supine position of at least 10 min).

          -  Subject with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (presence of ketoacidosis or a
             glycosylated hemoglobin level &gt;10%).

          -  Subject with diabetes treated with insulin for less than 6 weeks prior to study entry,
             or with an unstable insulin dose in the 6 weeks prior to study entry or HbA1c&gt;10%.

             hypotensive episodes).

          -  Subject is being treated for hypertension and in the opinion of the investigator their
             antihypertensive medication puts them at increased risk of postural hypotension.

          -  Subject is hypotensive at screening as defined as systolic &lt; 90 mmHg and/or diastolic
             &lt;60 mmHg.

             laboratory results).

          -  Subject has a compression of the optic chiasm causing visual-field defects.

          -  Subject is receiving any oestrogen-containing Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).

        <title>The Number of Subjects Who Were Growth Hormone (GH) Responders at Day 14 of the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>A GH responder was defined as a subject with mean serum GH concentration ≤2.5 micrograms per litre (mcg/L) or &gt;50% reduction from mean baseline GH concentration after a 6-day titration and an 8-day treatment period with BIM23B065. The mean serum concentration of GH was measured over 6 hours at baseline (Day -1) and on Day 14. The number of subjects who were GH responders at Day 14 of the treatment period is presented.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The sponsor stopped the study early as the preliminary results in 3 subjects dosed with BIM23B065 showed an inadequate PD profile and efficacy. The enrolled subjects only received BID treatment. Only the primary endpoint results are reported.</limitations_and_caveats>
