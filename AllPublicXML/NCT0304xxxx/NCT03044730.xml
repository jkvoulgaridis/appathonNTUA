    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a combination of two different drugs -
      pembrolizumab and capecitabine - is safe, and if it might be effective in treating triple
      negative and hormone-refractory breast cancer. Pembrolizumab is a type of drug that contains
      an antibody. Antibodies are the part of your immune system that finds things that don't
      belong in your body, such as bacteria or viruses. The antibody in pembrolizumab finds and
      blocks a protein, which allows your immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.
      Pembrolizumab is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for other types of cancer. It is
      not approved for breast cancer, meaning that it is an &quot;experimental&quot; or &quot;investigational&quot;
      treatment. Capecitabine is a type of chemotherapy pill that is a standard treatment and
      FDA-approved for breast cancer. It stops the cancer cells from being able to multiply.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the median progression-free survival (median PFS) for participants receiving
      pembrolizumab with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone-refractory metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the objective response rate (ORR) for participants receiving pembrolizumab
      with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and
      hormone-refractory MBC.

      II. To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and
      capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and hormone-refractory
      MBC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Analysis of expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) through
      immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.

      II. To assess circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). III. To evaluate ORR and median-PFS using
      immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

    <description>To evaluate the median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) for participants receiving pembrolizumab with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and hormone-refractory MBC. PFS is defined as the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient does not experience progression.
Progressive Disease (PD) as defined per RECIST 1.1 is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
PFS was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier curve.
For PFS, assumptions were that the addition of pembrolizumab would increase PFS to 5 months compared to historical control of 3 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 Cycles (1 cycle = 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR is the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment. Objective response rate was calculated based on the number of patients who had a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR). CR and PR were measured according to RECIST v. 1.1 guidelines:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and Capecitabine by evaluating the incidence of adverse events. All adverse events will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 4.03 criteria (NCI CTCAE 4.03 criteria).</description>

          <description>This is a single-arm, phase II study of patients with triple negative (TN) or hormone receptor-positive endocrine-refractory (HR+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who were candidates for capecitabine. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously day 1 and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 by mouth twice daily on days 1–14 of a 21-day cycle. Patients continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After discontinuation of study drugs, patients were assessed every 3 months up to 2 years for PFS, with visits and/or phone calls.</description>

• Triple negative (TN), defined as estrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PR) negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative.
or
• HER2- negative hormone-refractory breast cancer which denotes progression on one or more endocrine therapies (e.g., tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant) unless contraindicated (referred to as Hormone Receptor Positive, or HR+).</description>

        <title>Median PFS (Median Progression-Free Survival)</title>
        <description>To evaluate the median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) for participants receiving pembrolizumab with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and hormone-refractory MBC. PFS is defined as the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient does not experience progression.
Progressive Disease (PD) as defined per RECIST 1.1 is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
PFS was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier curve.
For PFS, assumptions were that the addition of pembrolizumab would increase PFS to 5 months compared to historical control of 3 months.</description>
        <time_frame>Approximately 20 months</time_frame>
        <population>One patient was not evaluable due to non-compliance with capecitabine. Three patients were not evaluable because they did not reach 3 cycles of treatment (per Protocol).</population>

          <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
          <description>The ORR is the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment. Objective response rate was calculated based on percentage of patients who had a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR). CR and PR were measured according to RECIST v. 1.1 guidelines:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
          <population>One patient was not evaluable due to non-compliance with capecitabine. The analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of capecitabine and pembrolizumab.</population>

          <description>This is a single-arm, phase II study of patients with triple negative (TN) or hormone receptor-positive endocrine-refractory (HR+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who were candidates for capecitabine. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously day 1 and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 by mouth twice daily on days 1–14 of a 21-day cycle. Patients continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After discontinuation of study drugs, patients were assessed every 3 months up to 2 years for PFS, with visits and/or phone calls.</description>
