  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AirSense 10 platform is able to detect respiratory events at night and report these data
      via telemonitoring. The accuracy of the AirSense 10 will be compared with scoring with
      polysomnography (PSG). 100 patients will be observed in a sleep facility under PSG and
      AirSense treatment.

    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing is commonly assessed by calculating an Apnea-Hypopnea-Index AHI
      and a Hypopnea-Index HI to define how frequent breathing or breathing efforts stop during the
      night. The severity of sleep apnea (SA) is determined by the number of occurring apneas and
      hypopneas. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) captures these events and is calculated
      comprising an AHI but also RERAs via the flow signal. Polysomnography (PSG) is being used in
      the sleep laboratory as the Gold standard method to document a patient`s sleep behavior by
      tracking air flow, respiratory effort, blood oxygen and electrocardiac as well as
      electromyographic signals. This way a comprehensive sleep pattern analysis can be created and
      different forms of SA can be detected. However, the method is laborious and cost-intensive,
      so it could save time and costs to have events accurately scored by the device itself. Device
      data become important when tracking a patient`s sleep night by night and not only once.
      Reliable sleep data can be a valuable tool for tailoring sleep therapy to specific patient`s
      needs. Accurate device data also build the foundation for analysis of large amounts of data,
      which can help us understanding how sleep disorders develop.
