      The aim of the study is to determine the toxicity of Idronoxil (NOX66) when used in
      combination with palliative radiotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer

      Who is it for? Patient may be eligible for this study if they have late stage metastatic
      prostate cancer which is castrate resistant and have metastatic lesions that are suitable for
      radiotherapy.

      Study details There are two groups of patients in this study and no randomisation. The two
      groups will have two different doses of idronoxil (NOX66), representing a 2-step dose
      escalation. Both groups receive the same standard radiotherapy dose.

      Group 1 will receive the lower dose (400 mg) of idronoxil suppository daily and Group 2 800
      mg daily.

      Recruitment into Group 2 will only commence once all Group 1 patients have completed the
      13-day treatment course of idronoxil suppository without excessive unexpected toxicity. The
      total treatment duration will be 13-15 days for both groups depends on whether radiotherapy
      is given on consecutive days or over the weekend.

      Day 0: commence idronoxil (NOX66) Days 1-5: 1 or 2 lesions will receive 20 Gy (radiotherapy
      dose unit) radiotherapy in 5 daily fractionated doses and continue daily NOX66 Day 6-12:
      Continue NOX66 (the duration of NOX66 will be 13-15 days depends on whether radiotherapy is
      given on consecutive days or over the weekend).

      Both groups will have prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography
      (PSMA-PET) scans before starting treatment and three months after the last fraction of
      radiotherapy to assess treatment response.
