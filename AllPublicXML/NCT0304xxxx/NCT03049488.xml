  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      RSV is a virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages. Healthy adults who are infected
      generally have mild cold symptoms for a week or two. But it can also be serious, especially
      for infants and older adults. It can be spread by direct or indirect contact with respiratory
      secretions. Researchers want to study a new vaccine to prevent RSV.

      Objective:

      To see if a vaccine for RSV is safe and if it causes side effects.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults 18-50 years old

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in a different protocol.

      Participants will have 13 visits over 1 year.

      Some participants will receive just vaccine. Some will receive vaccine mixed with alum, which
      could make the body respond to the vaccine better.

      All will receive their dose by injection in the upper arm. They will receive two doses, one
      at the beginning of the study and another 12 weeks later.

      Participants will be watched for 1 hour after injection. They will be called 1 day after.

      They will keep track of their temperature and side effects for 7 days after.

      Participants will receive a ruler to measure any changes on their skin at the injection site.

      At all visits, participants will be checked for health changes or problems. They may have
      blood drawn.

      At some visits, participants will have samples taken from their nose and mouth.

      Study Design:

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-RSVRGP084-00-VP alone or with alum adjuvant in a
      2-injection regimen. The hypotheses are that the vaccine will be safe and tolerable for human
      administration, and will induce detectable immune response. The primary objective is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine at 3 dose levels
      administered alone or with alum adjuvant as a homologous boost in healthy adults. Secondary
      objectives relate to humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine
      regimen.

      Product Description:

      VRC-RSVRGP084-00-VP (DS-Cav1) was developed by VRC, NIAID and is composed of the respiratory
      syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) glycoprotein ectodomain assembled as a trimer stabilized in
      its prefusion native conformation with a foldon trimerization domain at the C-terminus and 4
      internal mutations designated DS-Cav1 (4.1DHFR_RSVAF). The sequence is based on the RSV A2
      strain from subtype A. The product is provided at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in 3 mL glass
      vials filled to 1.2 mL. Adjuvant is an aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum) provided in a
      sterile, pyrogenfree suspension at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in 3 mL glass vials filled to
      0.7 +/- 0.10 mL. The alum dose is 500 mcg and will be field mixed.

      Subjects:

      Healthy adult subjects ages 18-50.

      Study Plan:

      Subject will be randomized into DS-Cav1 or DS-Cav1 plus alum in each dose during the study.
      Dose continuation and dose escalation evaluations will occur to ensure the safety data
      support proceeding to the higher doses. Subjects will be evaluated for safety and immune
      responses through blood and mucosal sample collection at specified timepoints throughout the
      study.

      VRC 317 Study Schema:

        -  Group: 1; Subjects: 15; Dose: 50mcg; Day 0: DS-Cav1; Week 12 [1]: DS-Cav1

        -  Group: 2; Subjects: 15; Dose: 50mcg; Day 0: DS-Cav1 + alum; Week 12 [1]: DS-Cav1 + alum

        -  Group: 3; Subjects: 15; Dose: 150mcg; Day 0: DS-Cav1; Week 12 [1]: DS-Cav1

        -  Group: 4; Subjects: 15; Dose: 150mcg; Day 0: DS-Cav1 + alum; Week 12 [1]: DS-Cav1 + alum

        -  Group: 5; Subjects: 15; Dose: 500mcg; Day 0: DS-Cav;1 Week 12 [1]: DS-Cav1

        -  Group: 6; Subjects: 15; Dose: 500mcg; Day 0: DS-Cav1 + alum; Week 12 [1]: DS-Cav1 + alum

        -  Total = Subjects: 90*

             -  All DS-Cav1 vaccinations are administered with needle and syringe into the deltoid
                muscle.

             -  *Up to 100 subjects may be enrolled if needed to evaluate safety or immunogenicity.

             -  [1] This dose is optional for the last 5 subjects enrolled in each group that
                receive the Day 0 injection and any additional subjects needed to evaluate safety
                or immunogenicity.

      Duration:

      The study schedule requires 13 clinic visits and a telephone contact after each injection.
