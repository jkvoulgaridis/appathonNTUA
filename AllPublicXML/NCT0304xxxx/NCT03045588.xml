  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine the long-term effects of a combined training and diet
      intervention that, acutely, increases fat oxidation during exercise. This is done with a 4
      week intervention study with moderately trained cyclists. Performance is tested pre and post
      intervention and muscle biopsies are obtained.

    <description>This subjects in this group conducts all their morning exercise sessions with high fat oxidation (in a fasted condition). Thus, the subjects in this group after high intensity exercise in the evening do not get any carbohydrates to eat after training until the exercise session the following morning has been conducted.</description>

    <description>Both groups exercise 6 times per week in 4 weeks conducted as 3 evening and 3 morning sessions per week. Both groups receive dietary products to be consumed immediately before and after each evening and morning session, respectively. One group conduct morning sessions in a fasted state, the other conduct the morning sessions in a fed state. Performance pre and post is measured, and muscle biopsies are obtained.</description>
