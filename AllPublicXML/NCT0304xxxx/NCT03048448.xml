  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of QAW039 after a single oral dose of
      QAW039 in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy matched control subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the pharmacokinetic profile of Fevipiprant is
      different in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy matched volunteers to an
      extent that would require an adjustment of the dosage. Data from this study will be used to
      guide enrollment criteria in future clinical trials and to support regulatory submission and
      labeling information.

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether
             there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.

          -  Current symptoms or history of encephalopathy Grade III or IV within the past 6 months

          -  Primary biliary liver cirrhosis and biliary obstruction

          -  Emergency room visit or hospitalization due to liver disease within the preceding 3

             not exceed 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Any elevation above ULN of more than one parameter of ALT, AST, γ GT, alkaline
             phosphatase or serum bilirubin will exclude a subject from participation in the study

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C test result.
