      The primary study objective is to assess the safety and feasibility of perfluorooctylbromide

      (BPD).

    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to assess the safety and feasibility of perfluorooctylbromide
      (PFOB) partial liquid ventilation for up to ten days in infants with severe BPD as evaluated
      by: (1) no sustained oxygen desaturations (SpO2 ≤ 80%) for greater than ten minutes without
      response to increased oxygen therapy, (2) no persistent hypotension without response to
      volume expansion and/or inotropic therapy, (3) no major mucus plugging events (defined as
      events that are unresolved after two bronchoscopes), (4) no pneumothoraces or pleural
      effusion with PFOB, (5) and no evidence of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) retention, renal
      insufficiency, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained oxygen desaturations for greater than ten minutes without response to increased oxygen therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of sustained (greater than 10 minutes) oxygen desaturation events without response to increased oxygen therapy. These incidences will be measured by a continuous non-invasive percutaneous oxygen saturation monitor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Persistent hypotension without response to volume expansion and/or inotropic therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of persistent hypotension without response to volume expansion and/or inotropic therapy. Hypotension is a decrease in systolic blood pressure deemed significant by clinical staff. Measurement will be performed with a standard intensive care unit blood pressure cuff.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of major mucus plugging events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of airway obstruction of the endotracheal tube, as indicated by decreased chest movement during mechanical ventilation, need for increased ventilator pressure, and/or elevation of carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Mucus plugs are confirmed by endotracheal suctioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion with PFOB</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of pneumothorax in the child will be measured by transillumination of the chest and confirmed by chest x-ray.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with sustained hypercapnia (elevated carbon dioxide in the blood, greater than 95 mmHg, for over four hours).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Hypercapnia will be measured with blood tests and/or cutaneous carbon dioxide monitor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Fraction of inspired oxygen is the percentage of oxygen that the patient is receiving for his or her lung disease. An FiO2 of 0.21 is room air oxygen and 1.00 is 100% oxygen. The higher the FiO2, the more severe the respiratory disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ventilator mean airway pressure (MAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Mean airway pressure (MAP) is the average amount of airway pressure supplied to the lungs throughout a breath. Higher MAP indicates more severe disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Respiratory Severity Score (MAP x FiO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory Severity Score (RSS) is a scale computed as the Mean Airway Pressure (MAP) multiplied by the Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2). Clinically, the scale range will often lie between 1 and 10, with higher numbers indicating more severe disease. The RSS can theoretically reach a score as high as 30-35.</description>
