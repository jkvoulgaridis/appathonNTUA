  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Laparoscopic surgical procedures have become increasingly established in
      operative medicine. They require special motor, haptic, and spatial-visual skills to perform
      the interventions safely and effectively. These minimally invasive surgery (MIS) basic skills
      are often learned in the operating room (OR) on the patient. This is economically inefficient
      and can be improved with regard to patient safety. Against the background of this problem,
      various simulators and video-box trainer have been developed in order to train laparoscopic
      basic skills outside the OR. The Lübecker Toolbox (LTB) curriculum is a video-based trainer
      including standardized and validated exercises with defined targets, based on the skills of
      experts MIS. Conducting MIS training outside the OR prior to performing the first MIS
      procedures on patients could be a sensible and valuable contribution to effective surgical
      education. An evidence of effectiveness in the practice transfer could have a considerable
      relevance with regard to the integration of MIS training programs into surgical education
      programs.

      Aim of the study: The aim of the study is to investigate whether surgical residents without
      previous active experience in MIS are able to improve laparoscopic skills in MIS procedures
      in the OR, if they have successfully completed the LTB curriculum.

      In the multicentric prospective study, will be conducted with surgical residents (SR) without
      prior active experience in MIS (n=14). After the SR have completed their first laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy (CHE), they will be randomized into two groups: 1) The intervention group
      will perform the LTB-Curriculum, whereas 2) the control group will not undergo any MIS
      training. After 6 weeks, both groups will perform the second laparoscopic CHE. Improvements
      in operative performance (between CHE I and CHE II) will be evaluated according to the Global
      Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skill (GOALS) Score (primary endpoint).

    <description>The Lübeck Toolbox (LTB) curriculum has a structured training program, in which the laparoscopic basic skills are to be learned in six consecutive exercises. In doing so, the curriculum has precise targets for each of the six exercises based on the abilities of 15 MIS experts as a benchmark. The LTB curriculum is thus a structured training program with clear objectives that enable the technical learning of MIS basic skills comparable to the expert level.</description>
