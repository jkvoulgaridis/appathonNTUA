      Assessing the use of corneal confocal microscopy to evaluate for early neuropathy changes in
      subjects with Type 1 Diabetes.

      Rationale: Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is associated with microvascular
      complications, which includes peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy associated with
      diabetes is a painful condition. Its diagnosis is hampered by painful and long nerve
      conduction studies which fail to diagnose small nerve neuropathy. It is important to study
      methods of noninvasive methods of early detection, which are sensitive and specific in
      diagnosing early neuropathy and we propose a novel study that this can be detected in the
      cornea of the eye.

      Aims:

        -  Estimate corneal small nerve fiber damage in young T1DM subjects (corneal fiber density,
           nerve branch density, and fiber length) and compare the results to healthy controls
           using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM).

        -  Estimate corneal nerve fiber damage in subjects with diabetes, with peripheral
           neuropathy and subjects with diabetes without peripheral neuropathy, diagnosed by skin
           biopsies and nerve conduction studies

        -  Obtain much needed normative values for CCM in adolescents and intraepidermal nerve
           fiber density from skin biopsies in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

        -  As a secondary outcome measure, to compare serum biomarkers including leptin, TNF alpha,
           and fibrinogen in patients with diabetes in those with neuropathy Vs. without
           neuropathy.

    <description>Estimate corneal small nerve fiber damage in young T1DM subjects and compare the results to healthy controls using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). This will be done by examining the cornea via confocal microscopy and obtaining images. These images will be evaluated looking at how many nerves there are, how they branch, and how long they are).</description>
