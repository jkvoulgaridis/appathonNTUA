    <textblock>
      A double blind Randomized Controlled Trial with two arms will be used. Subjects with Alcohol
      use disorder and sleep problems will be recruited and assigned randomly to the active
      treatment Melatonin or Placebo arms. All subjects will be assessed at baseline for
      demographics. Sleeping problems will be the primary outcome of the study, and it will be
      measured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scale.

      A double blind Randomized Controlled Trial with two arms will be used. Subjects with Alcohol
      use disorder and sleep problems will be recruited and assigned randomly to either Melatonin
      or Placebo arms. All subjects will complete some forms on the REDCap system such as contact
      information list, concomitant medication, Time Line Follow Back (TLFB), Fagerstrom test for
      nicotine dependence (FTND), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI),
      AUD criteria, and Alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT). Sleeping problems will be
      the primary outcome of the study, and it will be measured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality
      index (PSQI) scale where score 5 or more indicated a sleeping problem. Women in child-bearing
      period will be asked to do a urine pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy. After verifying
      eligibility, the participants will come to pick up the medication (Melatonin or placebo)
      blister together with a sleep hygiene document and will start taking the medication for 4
      weeks. All subjects will then be followed-up at the end of 1 month of treatment and PSQI
      score will be measured. This step will be completed either online by sending an email link
      through or the participants can come to a personal visit to complete the second PSQI form.
      Also, this last visit/email will contain side effects questionnaire, TLFB, BDI, BAI. All the
      participants will be required to bring/send back the medication blister pack to do a pill
      count and check all the missing pills.

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of the study is PSQI score. This will be analyzed by the difference in the global score before and after the use of melatonin versus placebo. Score &gt; 5 indicates a sleep problem.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSQI subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures will include the subscales of PSQI: 1) subjective quality of sleep; 2) sleep onset latency; 3) sleep duration; 4) sleep efficiency; 5) presence of sleep disturbances; and 6) presence of daytime disturbances, as an indication of daytime alertness.
As according to previous studies, melatonin showed a significant decrease in sleep onset latency and an improvement in daytime alertness.</description>
