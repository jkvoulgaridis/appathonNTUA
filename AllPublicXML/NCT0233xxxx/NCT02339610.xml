  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the rate of recovery of the ATTUNE knee from
      the time of surgery through the 6 month endpoint in patients with severely painful and/or
      severely disabling Non-inflammatory Degenerative Joint Disease (NIDJD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-comparative,
      non-controlled study. A sample size of N=200 subjects will be implanted at up to 4 sites in
      the Netherlands. Each site is expected to implant approximately 50 Subjects (50 knees).

      This study allows the participating surgeon to choose the type of ATTUNE implant they would
      ordinarily use in standard practice. Both resurfaced patellae and non-resurfaced patellae are
      permitted in this investigation; consistent with the surgeons standard of care.

      Subjects will receive one of four available implants: cruciate retaining fixed bearing (CR
      FB), cruciate retaining rotating platform (CR RP), posterior stabilized fixed bearing (PS
      FB), and posterior stabilized rotating platform (PS RP).

    <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Physical Function Short Form (KOOS-PS) will be used to measure knee function as a means of evaluating the rate of recovery.
The (KOOS-PS) is a patient self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 7 questions to evaluate function with activities of daily living (ADL) and higher level functioning activities (sport and recreational). Each question has 5 Likert-like response options.
Scoring is a 0-100 point scale with 100 points considered best.</description>
