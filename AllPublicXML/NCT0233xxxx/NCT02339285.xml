    <textblock>
      Investigating the effects of non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
      on patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

      Central Hypothesis: Non-invasive brain stimulation that suppresses alpha oscillation reduces
      cortical hyperactivity and causes a clinical improvement

      Aim 1: To conduct a pilot clinical trial to establish feasibility and to collect first
      effectiveness data for the use of tACS to renormalize pathological alpha oscillations in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dl-pfc) of unmedicated patients with MDD by comparing MADRS
      scores from baseline and one month follow up.

      Aim 2: Compare alpha oscillation power from resting state EEG recordings on the first and
      last day of stimulation. Collect EEG data at the one month follow up visit using this data to
      analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to F2 (4 weeks after completion of the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale to measure the severity of depressive episodes, where each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 6. The MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60 with lower scores indicating less depressive symptoms. This measurement will be taken at baseline (Day 1 of Stimulation), Day 5 of Stimulation, 2 weeks after completion of the intervention (F1), and 4 weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). A comparison of MADRS scores between baseline and F2 is the primary outcome measure (measured as change from baseline). In these results, negative values will indicate a decrease in depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alpha Oscillation Power From Resting State EEG Recordings on the First and Last Day of Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 5 of Stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare alpha oscillation power from resting state EEG recordings on the first day of stimulation (baseline) and last day of stimulation. The investigators will also collect EEG recordings data at a visit four weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). The investigators will use each of the three EEG recordings as data to analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers. As the stimulation paradigm stimulates the frontal brain regions, the investigators will analyze alpha power change in all brain regions as well as frontal regions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alpha Oscillation Power From Resting State EEG Recordings on the First of Stimulation to 4 Weeks After Completion of Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to F2</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare alpha oscillation power from resting state EEG recordings on the first day of stimulation (baseline) and at the follow-up visit four weeks after completion of the intervention. The investigators will also collect EEG on the fifth day of stimulation. The investigators will use each of the three EEG recordings as data to analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers. As the stimulation paradigm stimulates the frontal brain regions, the investigators will analyze alpha power change in all brain regions as well as frontal regions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 5 of Stimulation; Baseline to F2</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS is a clinician-administered depression assessment and consists of 17 items with a total score range from 0 to 54. A higher score indicates a worse outcome. This measurement will be taken at baseline (Day 1 of Stimulation), Day 5 of Stimulation, 2 weeks after completion of the intervention (F1), and 4 weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). The investigators will compare the scores between baseline and F2, with negative values indicating a decrease in depressive symptoms.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to F2</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement will be taken at baseline (first day of stimulation) and four weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). Total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher values indicating better cognition. The investigators will compare the scores between baseline and F2. Reported values are the raw change (increase or decrease) from baseline.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 5; Baseline to F2</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement will be taken at baseline (Day 1 of Stimulation), Day 5 of Stimulation, 2 weeks after completion of the intervention (F1), and 4 weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. Total score is out of 63 possible. The investigators will compare the scores between baseline and F2. In these results, negative values indicate a decrease in depressive symptoms.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Raw Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5; F2 (4 weeks after completion of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement will be taken at baseline (Day 1 of Stimulation), Day 5 of Stimulation, 2 weeks after completion of the intervention (F1), and 4 weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). The investigators will compare the scores between baseline and F2.The reported values are from Item 1 &quot;Severity of Illness&quot; on a likert scale of 1 to 7, with 1=Normal, not at all ill and 7 = Among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited through advertisements (e.g., online, flyers) and self-identified with depression. Interested participants contacted the study team.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms: tACS (alpha), tACS (gamma), or sham stimulation. All conditions were delivered during awake, resting state for 40 minutes on 5 consecutive days. 98 participants signed consent, 40 did not meet criteria, 6 declined participation, and 20 were excluded for other reasons. 32 were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

The MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60 with lower scores indicating less depressive symptoms. This measurement will be taken at baseline (Day 1 of Stimulation), Day 5 of Stimulation, 2 weeks after completion of the intervention (F1), and 4 weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). A comparison of MADRS scores between baseline and F2 is the primary outcome measure (measured as change from baseline). In these results, negative values will indicate a decrease in depressive symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change in Alpha Oscillation Power From Resting State EEG Recordings on the First and Last Day of Stimulation</title>
        <description>The investigators will compare alpha oscillation power from resting state EEG recordings on the first day of stimulation (baseline) and last day of stimulation. The investigators will also collect EEG recordings data at a visit four weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). The investigators will use each of the three EEG recordings as data to analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers. As the stimulation paradigm stimulates the frontal brain regions, the investigators will analyze alpha power change in all brain regions as well as frontal regions.</description>

        <description>This measurement will be taken at baseline (first day of stimulation) and four weeks after completion of the intervention (F2). Total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher values indicating better cognition. The investigators will compare the scores between baseline and F2. Reported values are the raw change (increase or decrease) from baseline.</description>
