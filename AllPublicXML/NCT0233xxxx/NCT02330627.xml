  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project aims to test the efficacy and neural correlates of a behavioral
      treatment program comprised of positive activity interventions in a sample of individuals
      seeking treatment for anxiety or depression. Participants will be randomly assigned to an
      immediate or delayed treatment condition, and will be compared on measures of positive and
      negative emotions, brain responses to reward and punishment/loss, subjective well-being, and
      symptoms at baseline and post-treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment approaches for anxiety and depression emphasize the reduction of negative
      emotions and distress as the central goal of treatment. However, these conditions are also
      characterized by low levels of positive emotions, which, although fundamental for life
      satisfaction and well-being, have traditionally not been a focus of treatment. The proposed
      project aims to test the efficacy of an integrated treatment regimen designed to modulate
      functioning of core component processes of the positive emotion system. Specifically, we will
      implement positive emotion enhancement procedures, previously tested and validated in
      non-clinical samples (Huffman et al., 2011; Lyubomirsky et al., 2005), in a broad community
      sample of n=30 individuals seeking treatment for anxiety or depression. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to a multi-session positive valence system targeted treatment (n=15) or a
      waitlist control group (n=15). Participants will be assessed at baseline and post-treatment
      and compared on measures of positive and negative emotions, brain responses to reward and
      punishment/loss, subjective well-being, and symptoms. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
      participants assigned to the positive emotion enhancement intervention will display greater
      increases in positive affect and enhanced activity in neural systems that regulate responses
      to reward (e.g., nucleus accumbens) relative to participants in the waitlist control group.
      Aim 2 will explore whether the effects of the positive emotion system treatment generalize to
      parallel measures of the negative emotion system (i.e., negative affect and neural reactivity
      to aversive outcomes). We will also explore the effects of the intervention on subjective
      well-being and life satisfaction, and will examine the relationship between changes in
      subjective emotions and neural indices of positive and negative valence functioning with
      changes in well-being and life satisfaction.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; Modified Differential Emotions Scale; Composite)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measures positive affect. Items are answered on a 5 point scale, 1 (Very slightly or not at all) to 5 (Extremely). The positive affect scale ranges from 10-50 and higher scores indicate greater levels of positive affect.
The Modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES) measures positive emotions. Items are answered on a 5 point scale, 0 (Never/Not at all) to 4 (Most of the time/Extremely). Higher scores on the positive emotions sub-scale indicate higher levels of positive emotion.
Participants' scores on the PANAS and mDES were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of positive affect at each assessment point was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Higher z-scores indicate an increase in positive affect from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Negative Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; Modified Differential Emotions Scale; Composite)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measures negative affect. Items are answered on a 5 point scale, 1 (Very slightly or not at all) to 5 (Extremely). The negative affect scale ranges from 10-50 and lower scores indicate lower levels of negative affect.
The Modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES) measures negative emotions. Items are answered on a 5 point scale, 0 (Never/Not at all) to 4 (Most of the time/Extremely). Lower scores on the negative emotions sub-scale indicate lower levels of negative emotion.
Participants' composite scores on the PANAS and mDES were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of negative affect at each assessment point (i.e., pre assessment - at baseline, post assessment - 10 weeks after baseline) was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Lower z-scores indicate a decrease in negative affect from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life and Well-being (Composite of Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire; Satisfaction With Life Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) measures the degree of satisfaction experienced by participants in various areas of daily functioning. Items are rated on a 5 point scale, 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). The scale ranges from 14-70; higher scores indicate higher levels of life satisfaction.
The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) measures global cognitive judgments of one's life satisfaction. Items are rated on a 7 point scale, 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree). The scale ranges from 5-35; higher scores indicate higher levels of life satisfaction.
Participants' scores on the Q-LES-Q and the SWLS were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of quality of life and well-being at each assessment point was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Higher z-scores indicate an increase in quality of life and well-being from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Anxiety (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale; State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait Composite)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) measures frequency, severity, and functional impairment of anxiety symptoms. Items are rated on a 4 point scale, 0 (None) to 4 (Extreme). The scale ranges from 0-20 and higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety.
The State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait (STAI-T) measures general anxiety. Items are rated on a 4 point scale, 1 (Almost Never) to 4 (Almost Always). The scale ranges from 20-80 and higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety.
Participants' composite scores on the OASIS and the STAI were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of anxiety at each assessment point (i.e., pre assessment - at baseline, post assessment - 10 weeks after baseline) was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Lower z-scores indicate a decrease in anxiety from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Beck Depression Inventory-II Composite)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) measures depression symptoms. Items are rated on a 4 point scale, 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). The scale ranges from 0-27 and higher scores indicate higher levels of depression.
The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) measures the severity of depression. Participants choose 1 of 4 response options; a value of 0 to 3 is assigned to each response option. The scale ranges from 0-63 and higher scores indicate higher severity of depression.
Participants' composite scores on the PHQ-9 and the BDI-II were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of depression at each assessment point (i.e., pre assessment - at baseline, post assessment - 10 weeks after baseline) was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Lower z-scores indicate a decrease in depression from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; Modified Differential Emotions Scale; Composite)</title>
        <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measures positive affect. Items are answered on a 5 point scale, 1 (Very slightly or not at all) to 5 (Extremely). The positive affect scale ranges from 10-50 and higher scores indicate greater levels of positive affect.
The Modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES) measures positive emotions. Items are answered on a 5 point scale, 0 (Never/Not at all) to 4 (Most of the time/Extremely). Higher scores on the positive emotions sub-scale indicate higher levels of positive emotion.
Participants' scores on the PANAS and mDES were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of positive affect at each assessment point was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Higher z-scores indicate an increase in positive affect from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

        <description>The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) measures the degree of satisfaction experienced by participants in various areas of daily functioning. Items are rated on a 5 point scale, 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). The scale ranges from 14-70; higher scores indicate higher levels of life satisfaction.
The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) measures global cognitive judgments of one's life satisfaction. Items are rated on a 7 point scale, 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree). The scale ranges from 5-35; higher scores indicate higher levels of life satisfaction.
Participants' scores on the Q-LES-Q and the SWLS were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of quality of life and well-being at each assessment point was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Higher z-scores indicate an increase in quality of life and well-being from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life and Well-being (Composite of Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire; Satisfaction With Life Scale)</title>
          <description>The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) measures the degree of satisfaction experienced by participants in various areas of daily functioning. Items are rated on a 5 point scale, 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). The scale ranges from 14-70; higher scores indicate higher levels of life satisfaction.
The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) measures global cognitive judgments of one's life satisfaction. Items are rated on a 7 point scale, 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree). The scale ranges from 5-35; higher scores indicate higher levels of life satisfaction.
Participants' scores on the Q-LES-Q and the SWLS were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of quality of life and well-being at each assessment point was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Higher z-scores indicate an increase in quality of life and well-being from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Anxiety (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale; State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait Composite)</title>
        <description>The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) measures frequency, severity, and functional impairment of anxiety symptoms. Items are rated on a 4 point scale, 0 (None) to 4 (Extreme). The scale ranges from 0-20 and higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety.
The State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait (STAI-T) measures general anxiety. Items are rated on a 4 point scale, 1 (Almost Never) to 4 (Almost Always). The scale ranges from 20-80 and higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety.
Participants' composite scores on the OASIS and the STAI were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups. The composite index of anxiety at each assessment point (i.e., pre assessment - at baseline, post assessment - 10 weeks after baseline) was the mean of the Z scores for that occasion. Lower z-scores indicate a decrease in anxiety from baseline to post-treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Beck Depression Inventory-II Composite)</title>
        <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) measures depression symptoms. Items are rated on a 4 point scale, 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). The scale ranges from 0-27 and higher scores indicate higher levels of depression.
The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) measures the severity of depression. Participants choose 1 of 4 response options; a value of 0 to 3 is assigned to each response option. The scale ranges from 0-63 and higher scores indicate higher severity of depression.
Participants' composite scores on the PHQ-9 and the BDI-II were first standardized across assessment sessions by converting to Z scores (M=0, SD=1) across both groups.
