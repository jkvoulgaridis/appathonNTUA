  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study using pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) for first-line treatment of
      participants with advanced/unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic urothelial cancer who are
      ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy. The primary study objective is to determine the
      objective response rate (ORR) in all participants and by programmed cell death ligand 1
      (PD-L1) status.

      With Amendment 4, once a participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended,
      the participant will be discontinued from this study and will be enrolled in an extension
      study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants receiving pembrolizumab who attain a complete response (CR) may consider
      stopping trial treatment if they meet criteria for holding therapy. Participants who stop
      trial treatment after receiving 24 months of trial treatment for reasons other than
      progressive disease (PD) or intolerability, or participants who attain a CR and stop trial
      treatment may be eligible for up to one year of retreatment upon experiencing PD.

    <description>PD-L1 expression status was determined as the percent of disease tumor cells, from newly obtained tumor biopsies, demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 staining of any intensity using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. The assay uses a Combined Positive Score (CPS) as a measure of PD-L1 positivity. The CPS is calculated as the number of PD-L1-positive cells divided by the number of viable tumor cells analyzed multiplied by 100. A CPS of &lt;1% = negative; ≥1% = positive; and ≥10% = strongly positive. The number of participants categorized by PD-L1 CPS score is presented.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (Modified RECIST) in Participants With a Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Combined Positive Score (CPS) of ≥10%</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Database Cutoff Date of 26-Sep-2018 (up to approximately 41 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was determined in participants who had a PD-L1 CPS of ≥10% as measured by immunohistochemistry assay. ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR: complete disappearance of all lesions and no new lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per modified RECIST as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Modified RECIST differs from RECIST 1.1 in that progressive disease requires confirmation by a repeat radiological assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date of first documented progressive disease. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders. The percentage of participants who had a PD-L1 positive expression of ≥10% CPS and experienced a CR or PR per modified RECIST is presented.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in Participants With a Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Combined Positive Score (CPS) of ≥1%</title>
        <description>PFS was determined in participants who had a PD-L1 CPS of ≥1% as measured by immunohistochemistry assay. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of ≥1 new lesions was also considered PD. Time to scheduled tumor assessment visit rather than the actual tumor assessment visit was used in the analysis. Participants were censored at the date of their last assessment. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 for all participants who had a PD-L1 positive expression of ≥1% CPS is presented.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival Rate (PFS Rate) at Month 6 in Participants With a Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Combined Positive Score (CPS) of ≥10%</title>
        <description>The PFS rate was determined in participants who had a PD-L1 CPS of ≥10%, as measured by immunohistochemistry assay, at Month 6. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of ≥1 new lesions was also considered PD. Time to scheduled tumor assessment visit rather than the actual tumor assessment visit was used in the analysis. Participants were censored at the date of their last assessment. The PFS rate at Month 6 was calculated.</description>

        <description>PD-L1 expression status was determined as the percent of disease tumor cells, from newly obtained tumor biopsies, demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 staining of any intensity using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. The assay uses a Combined Positive Score (CPS) as a measure of PD-L1 positivity. The CPS is calculated as the number of PD-L1-positive cells divided by the number of viable tumor cells analyzed multiplied by 100. A CPS of &lt;1% = negative; ≥1% = positive; and ≥10% = strongly positive. The number of participants categorized by PD-L1 CPS score is presented.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented. These safety results are based on a 26-September-2018 data cutoff date.</description>

        <description>ORR was determined in all participants and was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR: complete disappearance of all lesions and no new lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per modified RECIST as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Modified RECIST differs from RECIST 1.1 in that progressive disease requires confirmation by a repeat radiological assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date of first documented progressive disease. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR per modified RECIST is presented.</description>
