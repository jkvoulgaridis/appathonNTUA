  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate a new combination of drugs, marizomib (MRZ)
      and bevacizumab (BEV; Avastin®), for the treatment of WHO Grade IV malignant glioma. The
      study population includes subjects who are in first or second relapse and who have not
      previously received any bevacizumab or other anti-angiogenic agent or proteasome inhibitor
      for treatment of malignant glioma. Part 1 Phase 1 evaluates the combination of MRZ and BEV,
      while Part 2 Phase 2 evaluates single-agent MRZ. Part 3 (Phase 2) includes a combination MRZ
      using intra-patient dose escalation, and BEV at a fixed dose. Part 4 Phase 1 evaluates MRZ
      through enteral administration, and BEV at a fixed dose. Part 5 Phase 1 evaluates the
      repeat-dose pharmacokinetics of MRZ administered IV with ECG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the few treatment options currently FDA approved for recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant
      glioma is BEV. Additional treatment options are needed for these subjects. Published
      literature indicates that targeting the proteasome in glioma cells has shown significant
      anti-tumor activity.

      MRZ is a novel, second generation proteasome inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of
      proteins involved in signal transduction which blocks growth and survival of cancer cells.
      In-vitro studies of multiple glioma cell lines were highly sensitive to MRZ. MRZ had
      relatively little effect on neural stem/progenitor cells suggesting minimal neurotoxicity
      while significantly affecting both malignant glioma stem cells and glioma cell lines.

      Parts 1 and 2 of this trial have been completed with the Recommended Part 3 (Phase 2) Dose
      established at 0.8 mg/m2. Part 3 of this trial is enrolling at the MRZ RP2D determined in
      Phase 1 to assess the combination of MRZ and BEV activity and safety.

      Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this trial have been completed with the Recommended Dose established
      at 0.8 mg/m2. Part 5 of this trial is enrolling.
