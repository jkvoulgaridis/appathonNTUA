      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TVP-1012 (0.5 mg or 1
      mg/day) as an add-on to levodopa in Japanese participants with Parkinson's disease with
      wearing-off phenomenon.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase
      2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TVP-1012 as an add-on to levodopa in
      Japanese participants with Parkinson's disease with wearing-off phenomenon.

      The study period consisted of a 28-week trial period. The participants who fulfilled the
      inclusion criteria and did not meeting any of the exclusion criteria were enrolled, and
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 0.5 mg of TVP-1012, the 1 mg of TVP-1012, or the placebo
      group. In each treatment group, participants received 0.5 mg of TVP-1012, 1 mg of TVP-1012,
      or placebo once daily in a double-blinded manner.

    <description>Reported change from baseline during treatment period which was calculated as follows: Mean for a total of 21 days, consisting of three separate 7-day periods preceding the visits at Week 6, 14 and 26 of the treatment period - Mean for the 7 days preceding the visit at the end of the run-in period. Off-time refers to times when levodopa is not working well, causing worsening symptoms.</description>
