    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, long-term, phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of long-term administration of TVP-1012 at 1 mg with levodopa in Japanese
      participants with Parkinson's disease.

      The study period consisted of a 2-week run-in period and a subsequent 52-week treatment
      period. Participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria and did not meet any of the exclusion
      criteria at the start of the run-in period (Week -2) and also at the end of the run-in period
      (Week 0) were enrolled in the study, and received 1 mg of TVP-1012 once daily for 52 weeks,
      in an unblinded manner, from the day after Week 0.
