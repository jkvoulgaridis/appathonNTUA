  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are patients who are planned to do percutaneous coronary intervention for coronary
      stenosis in the left circumflex artery without other stenosis in the left ascending artery
      and the right coronary artery, or a patient with normal coronary artery. Immediately after
      coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention, the investigators will evaluate
      for coronary hemodynamics by distribution of wave intensity which is calcurated by coronary
      pressure and flow velocity with Combowire in each coronary segment. Also, they will assess
      coronary morphology by View It in each coronary segment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combowire (Volcano Therapeutics Inc., CA, USA) is a 0.014 inch pressure/Doppler
      sensor-tipped-guidewire which can measure coronary pressure and flow velocity.

      View It (Terumo Co., Japan) is a guide catheter with intravascular ultrasound which can
      measure coronary morphology such as vessel diamter.
