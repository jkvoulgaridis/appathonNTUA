  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced tumour, neoadjuvant treatment has been proposed in various
      modalities as a way to decrease size and downstage the tumour leading to a re-sectable
      disease. The HybridTherm probe (HTP), (ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) combines
      bipolar RF-ablation with cryogenic induced cooling. A bipolar radiofrequency system creates
      ablation with less collateral thermal damage than standard monopolar systems but with the
      trade-off to lose overall efficiency.

    <textblock>
      About 40% of patients with pancreatic cancer have no metastasis at the moment of diagnosis,
      but in 20% of patients surgery is not feasible due to vascular invasion or poor general
      conditions. These patients with stage III pancreatic cancer (locally advanced or borderline
      resectable) may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The HybridTherm
      probe is a new, minimally invasive device that can be safely applied under EUS guidance to
      locally ablate the pancreatic tissue adding a local efficacy to the systemic activity offered
      by chemotherapy and could give these patients a bigger chance of survival. The present study
      is an interventional randomized controlled phase II/III trial (device), that assigns patients
      into two groups: patients receiving standard chemotherapy alone and those receiving
      chemotherapy plus EUS-guided HybridTherm ablation. The randomization is performed at the time
      of EUS diagnosis and staging.

    <description>To demonstrate the efficacy of the HybridTherm probe in the control of the tumour progression in terms of progression-free survival, measured at 6-month after ther-apy onset (PFS-6). PFS-6 takes in consideration the tumor growth in relation to the volume/size evaluated as a difference between the previous and the current examination. In practice, it is the time interval between the enrolment of the patient and the first radiological evidence of tumor progression.
For patients who were resected (R0 and R1) the PFS is the time until the first radio-logical evidence of tumor recurrence, regardless size.
For not resected patients the PFS is the time until the first radiological evidence of a growth of the lesion &gt; 20% in comparison to the previous exam.</description>

    <description>Patients receiving chemotherapy alone. These patients start standard chemotherapy right after the oncologist's evaluation according to accepted Guidelines of the Italian Association of Medical Oncologists (AIOM). Restaging is performed 2, 4 and 6 months after chemotherapy onset, with MDCT scan and DW-MRI.</description>

    <description>Patients receiving chemotherapy plus EUS-guided Cryothermal Ablation with HybridTherm probe. These patients are first treated by cryothermal ablation and one week after they start with chemotherapy. Cryothermal ablation can be performed up to three times, with interval of 4 +/- 1 weeks. Restaging is performed 2, 4 and 6 months after chemotherapy onset, with MDCT scan and DW-MRI.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cryothermal ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>Procedures are performed with patients sedated by anaesthesiologists. Device setting and application time are set and recorded on a computer, that analyzes the changes of the tissue's properties. The setting of the maximal application time is based on the results of our previously described ex-vivo and in-vivo studies and is adjusted to the tumour's size, thus ensuring a reduction of procedure-related complications. Application of Power Doppler makes the procedure safer. The HybridTherm probe is guided under real-time EUS into the tumour, and the success of its placement is an index of the treatment's feasibility. The system analyzes the effects on the tissue and EUS records the changes of the tissue, the growing edema around the treated area, and the tissue devitalization.</description>
