  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common and potentially debilitating late effect of childhood cancer treatment is
      neurocognitive impairment, frequently in the domain of executive dysfunction, which can limit
      educational attainment, employment, and quality of life. Among the survivors of childhood
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the SJLIFE cohort, the frequency of executive function
      impairment has been shown as high as 58.8%, with moderate to severe impairment as high as
      33.5%, and risk for impairment increased with time from diagnosis. Given the potential of
      pervasive impact of neurocognitive impairment on daily life, interventions directed at
      reducing neurocognitive dysfunction among childhood cancer survivors with long-term follow-up
      are needed. This study examines the potential feasibility and efficacy of a novel
      intervention to improve executive function.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of a home-based intervention using Transcranial Direct
           Current Stimulation (tDCS) and cognitive training in adult survivors of childhood ALL
           participating in the SJLIFE protocol at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate the efficacy of a tDCS intervention paired with cognitive training.

        -  To explore the short-term effect of tDCS on measures of executive function among adult
           survivors of childhood ALL participating in the SJLIFE protocol
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tDCS is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation and is a potentially useful tool to enhance
      cognitive function. This study uses an at-home intervention of tDCS and cognitive training
      and examines its potential usefulness at improving executive function in ALL survivors.

      Investigators will use tDCS to apply a low electrical current to the participant's scalp in
      the area of the brain associated with fluent and flexible thinking. The current may make that
      area of the brain work better for a short period of time. During this time, the participant
      will play computer games designed to train the brain to work more fluently flexibly.
      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to see if pairing the electrical
      stimulation with the brain games at home is a feasible method to improve cognitive abilities
      in long-term survivors of childhood ALL.

      In the first part of this study, the short-term effect of tDCS intervention will be evaluated
      in the clinical setting using a randomized cross-over trial. The survivors will be randomized
      to receive either the tDCS intervention or Sham on day 1, with the other treatment given on
      day 2. Neurocognitive testing will be conducted within two hours of completing stimulation
      each day.

      In the second part of this study, the feasibility and potential efficacy of
      self-administration of the tDCS intervention paired with cognitive training will be evaluated
      over 5 weeks. Research participants will be taught to use the mobile tDCS device and will be
      provided one to take home. The device will be programmed by the investigators in advance to
      control the intensity and duration of the stimulation. The research participants will use the
      device twice per week as directed. Within two hours of completing each tDCS session
      participants will complete 20 minutes of cognitive training using a mobile app installed on
      an iPad. Neurocognitive testing will be conducted pre- and post- intervention.

    <description>transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) involves modulation of cerebral cortex excitability by the application of weak direct current to the scalp. tDCS is a technique that applies safe, low level direct current through large pads on the scalp to stimulate the underlying brain region, with current level &lt; 0.10 C/cm2. Direct current is transferred by a pair of saline-soaked sponges from the anode to the cathode.</description>

Participant responses range from 1-3 for each item with higher score indicating more problems. Domain scores are created by summing the relevant item scores for each domain. Score ranges:
NCQ Task Efficiency: 9-27.
NCQ Emotional Regulation: 3-9.
NCQ Organization: 3-9.
NCQ Memory: 4-12.</description>

      <desc>PRISE assesses presence of side effects for several biological systems. For each organ/function system, the participant indicates the presence of a side effect, and if present, the tolerability of the side effect (tolerable or distressing). FISER and GRSEB assess side effect impact: frequency, intensity, and burden. Each domain is rated on a 7- point Likert scale.</desc>
