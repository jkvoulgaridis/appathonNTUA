      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of isatuximab when given together
      with carfilzomib with or without dexamethasone and lenalidomide in treating patients with
      multiple myeloma that has returned after a period of improvement or has not respond to
      previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as isatuximab, may block cancer growth in
      different ways by targeting certain cells. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      dexamethasone and lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving isatuximab and carfilzomib with or without dexamethasone and lenalidomide
      may be a better treatment for patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of isatuximab (SAR650984) in combination
      with carfilzomib, carfilzomib and dexamethasone, and with the combination of carfilzomib,
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety, including immunogenicity, of SAR650984 in several combinations
      with carfilzomib, and carfilzomib and lenalidomide, in relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma after receiving 1+ prior lines of therapy.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR650984 and carfilzomib when administered in
      ARM 1.

      III. To assess the relationship between clinical (adverse event [AE] and/or tumor response)
      effects and pharmacologic parameters (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic), and/or biologic
      (correlative laboratory) results.

      IV. To estimate the activity (overall response rate [ORR]) using International Myeloma
      Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria of SAR650984 plus carfilzomib, carfilzomib and
      dexamethasone and with the combination of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

      V. To describe progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and 1-year overall
      survival (OS) in patients treated with SAR650984 plus carfilzomib, carfilzomib and
      dexamethasone, and with the combination of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

      VI. To assess the ability to give SAR650984 as a rapid infusion over 105 minutes in patients
      who have received at least 6 doses and 4 consecutive doses with no infusion associated
      toxicity.

      VII. To further estimate safety, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD) and to estimate the anti-tumor
      activity (ORR) using IMWG criteria of study therapy (SAR650984 with carfilzomib, carfilzomib
      and dexamethasone and with the combination of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone) in
      several expansion cohorts at the MTD of each regimen. (Expansion phase cohort) VIII. To
      describe TTP, PFS, and 1-year OS in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma treated with
      these combinations. (Expansion phase cohort)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of isatuximab. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3
      arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive isatuximab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22
      of course 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent courses and carfilzomib IV over 10 minutes on
      days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue treatment after 8 courses
      if clinical benefit is present at the investigator's discretion (carfilzomib may be switched
      to days 1, 2, 15, and 16 per investigator discretion).

      ARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone IV or orally (PO) on days 1, 2, 8, 9 15, 16, 22, and
      23, isatuximab IV over 4-6 hours on 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and days 1 and 15 of
      subsequent courses, and carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue treatment after 12 courses if clinical benefit
      is present at the investigator's discretion (carfilzomib may be switched to days 1, 2, 15,
      and 16 per investigator discretion).

      ARM III: Patients receive dexamethasone IV or PO on days 2, 8, and 16 of course 1, isatuximab
      IV over 4-6 hours on 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent courses,
      carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, and lenalidomide PO on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue treatment after 12 courses if clinical benefit
      is present at the investigator's discretion (carfilzomib may be switched to days 1, 2, 15,
      and 16 per investigator discretion).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 60 days and 1, 2, and
      3 years.

             patient has completed antibiotics and symptoms of infection have resolved to &lt; grade
             2, they are then considered eligible from an infection standpoint

          -  Serious psychiatric illness, active alcoholism, or drug addiction that may hinder or
             confuse follow-up evaluation

          -  Any medical conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, would impose excessive
