    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TVP-1012 in Japanese participants with early
      Parkinson's disease.

      The study period consisted of a 28-week trial period. The participants who fulfill the
      inclusion criteria and not meeting any of the exclusion criteria were enrolled, and
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the 1 mg of TVP-1012 or the placebo group. In each
      treatment group, participants received either 1 mg of TVP-1012 or placebo once daily in a
      double-blinded manner.

    <description>Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscale; (Part I; 13 items) non-motor experiences of daily living, (Part II; 13) motor experiences of daily living, (Part III; 34) motor examination, and (Part IV; 6) motor complications. Each items had 0-4 ratings, where 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) and score for each was summed to calculate the total scores. The scale range for Part II+III Total Score was 0-188, with higher scores reflecting greater severity.</description>

          <description>Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscale; (Part I; 13 items) non-motor experiences of daily living, (Part II; 13) motor experiences of daily living, (Part III; 34) motor examination, and (Part IV; 6) motor complications. Each items had 0-4 ratings, where 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) and score for each was summed to calculate the total scores. The scale range for Part II+III Total Score was 0-188, with higher scores reflecting greater severity.</description>
