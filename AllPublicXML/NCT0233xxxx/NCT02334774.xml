  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pre-and post-intervention study enrolled adult Intensive Care Unit(ICU) patients (≥50
      years) successfully extubated after ≥48 hours endotracheal intubation and without preexisting
      neuromuscular disease or swallowing dysfunction.

      All participants received by a trained nurse-administered, hospital-based (up to 14 days)
      Swallowing and Oral Care(SOC) intervention comprising toothbrushing/salivary gland massage,
      oral motor exercise, and advice on safe-swallowing strategies.

      All participants' daily intake status (21 days) and oral health status, oral
      sensation(stereognosis, light touch and two-point discrimination), tongue and lip strength,
      salivary secretion, body weight) were assessed at 2, 7, 14 days post-extubation by a blinded
      research nurse.

      Feasibility was evaluated as time spent providing SOC, patients adherence to SOC components,
      and adverse event(i.e., coughing, wet voice, or decreased oxygen saturation) during SOC
      intervention.

    <textblock>
      With rapid growth of medical technology, patients receiving oral endotracheal intubation have
      increased. Although endotracheal intubation is a life-sustaining procedure, its presence can
      deteriorate the structure and function of oropharynx, which may contribute to the
      difficulties in swallowing and subsequent oral intake. Estimated 62% of patients who had been
      intubated ≥48 hours will experience post-extubation dysphagia. Clearly, intervention is
      needed but studies are lacking in this regard. Thus, the objective of this pilot trial is to
      evaluate effects of an Oral Swallowing Care Program on swallowing and oral intake status in
      patients following prolonged endotracheal intubation.

      This study employs a pre-and post-intervention design. The investigators were enrolled 63
      post-extubated adult patients (50 years old and older) who had prolonged (≥48 hours) oral
      endotracheal intubation from six medical intensive care units at a medical center in Taipei,
      Taiwan.

      Participants were assessed within 48 hours post-extubation for the baseline data, then a
      14-day, daily Swallowing and Oral Care (SOC) Program involves toothbrushing/salivary gland
      massage, oral exercise(i.e., active/resistive range-of-motion[ROM] exercises for tongue,
      lips, and jaw), and advice on safe-swallowing strategies.

      Outcome were assessed on 2nd, 7th, 14th, and 21st day post-extubation including oral health
      status, oral sensation (stereognosis, light touch and two-point discrimination), tongue and
      lip strength, salivary secretion, body weight. In addition, Three-Step Swallowing Screen
      (3-SSS) and Functional Oral Intake Scale(FOIS) were assessed daily. The data were analyzed by
      SPSS 12 software package.

    <description>Evaluation by using Three-Step Swallowing Screen(3-SSS). Participants were first assessed for prior history of dysphagia/feeding-tube dependence and signs of consciousness change, poor oxygen saturation (i.e., SaO2&lt;90%; oxygen-mask dependence; reintubation), obvious drooling, or frequent choking on saliva. If negative, participants were then asked to swallow 3mL of water. If laryngeal elevation was identified with no signs of choking or wet voice, participants were asked to swallow 50mL of water; those without any signs of choking, wet voice, or slow swallowing were considered to pass the 3-SSS.</description>
