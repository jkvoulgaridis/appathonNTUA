    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, long-term, extension, phase 3 study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of long-term administration of TVP-1012 at 1 mg for another 26 weeks in
      participants with early Parkinson's disease who have completed the preceding TVP-1012/CCT-001
      (NCT02337725) study.

      Among participants of the TVP-1012/CCT-001 study, those consenting to participate in this
      study prior to complete the preceding study and fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled in this study. From the day after the Visit 8 of the preceding study, participants
      will receive 1 mg of TVP-1012 once daily for 26 weeks in an unblinded manner.

    <description>MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The scales are now titled; (Part I) non-motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part II) motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part III) motor examination (18 items), and (Part IV) motor complications (six items). Each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The scale range for Part II+III Total Score was 0-188, with the higher score reflecting the greater severity. Timeframe was 52 weeks that was total duration of both this study (26 weeks) and the preceding study (TVP-1012/CCT-001: NCT02337725; 26 weeks).</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

          <description>Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) retained the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales: (Part I) non-motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part II) motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part III) motor examination (18 items), and (Part IV) motor complications (6 items). Each subscale had 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The scale range for Part II+III Total Score was 0-188, with the higher score reflecting the greater severity.</description>

        <description>MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The scales are now titled; (Part I) non-motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part II) motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part III) motor examination (18 items), and (Part IV) motor complications (six items). Each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The scale range for Part II+III Total Score was 0-188, with the higher score reflecting the greater severity. Timeframe was 52 weeks that was total duration of both this study (26 weeks) and the preceding study (TVP-1012/CCT-001: NCT02337725; 26 weeks).</description>
