    <textblock>
      Immune-tolerant patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) awaiting assisted reproduction (AR)
      are required to initiate antiviral therapy due to laboratory safety. Additionally, rapid
      virus elimination is suggested to faciliate timely performance of AR. However, no consensus
      is reached regarding the antiviral therapy in this group. This study aimed to explore the
      efficacy and safety of tenofovir (TDF) and telbivudine (LdT) in this population.
