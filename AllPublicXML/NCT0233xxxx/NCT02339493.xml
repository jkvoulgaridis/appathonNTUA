  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most preventable cause of stroke. CHADS and CHA2DS2VASc
      scores predict the likelihood of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. Atrial flutter
      confers a similar risk of stroke as atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin,
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban is effective for prevention of thromboembolic
      stroke in most patients with AF. However, despite widely available risk stratification tools,
      five options for anticoagulation, and evidence-based practice guidelines, thromboprophylaxis
      for stroke prevention in AF is under-prescribed in the U.S., Europe, and worldwide. The
      investigators have previously demonstrated the efficacy of an alert-based computerized
      decision support (CDS) strategy for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
      at-risk hospitalized patients not receiving any thromboprophylaxis. The investigators' goal
      is to create and evaluate an alert-based CDS strategy for stroke prevention in patients with
      nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter in a randomized controlled trial.

      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most preventable cause of stroke. CHADS and CHA2DS2VASc

      confers a similar risk of stroke as atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin,

      stroke in most patients with AF. However, despite widely available risk stratification tools,
      five options for anticoagulation, and evidence-based practice guidelines, thromboprophylaxis
      for stroke prevention in AF is under-prescribed in the U.S., Europe, and worldwide. The
      investigators have previously demonstrated the efficacy of an alert-based computerized
      decision support (CDS) strategy for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
      at-risk hospitalized patients not receiving any thromboprophylaxis. The investigators' goal
      is to create and evaluate an alert-based CDS strategy for stroke prevention in patients with
      nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter in a randomized controlled trial. The investigators have the
      following specific aims:

      Aim #1 (Primary Efficacy Endpoint)- To assess whether an alert-based computerized decision
      support strategy increases prescription of anticoagulation during hospitalization, at
      discharge, and at 90 days from enrollment.

      Hypothesis #1- An alert-based computer decision support (CDS) strategy will increase
      prescription of prescription of anticoagulation during hospitalization, at discharge, and at
      90 days from enrollment.

      Aim #2 (Secondary Efficacy Endpoint)- To determine the potential impact of an alert-based
      computerized decision support strategy on the frequency of a composite of major adverse
      cardiovascular events at 90 days, defined as cerebrovascular accident, systemic embolism,
      myocardial infarction (MI), and all-cause mortality at 90 days from enrollment.

      Hypothesis #2- This study will provide proof-of-concept data, including event rates, from
      which to design a larger randomized control trial to assess whether an alert-based CDS
      strategy will reduce the frequency of a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events at
      90 days, defined as cerebrovascular accident, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction (MI),
      and all-cause mortality at 90 days from enrollment.

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>An acute stroke was defined as a new, focal neurologic deficit of sudden onset, lasting at least 24 hours, not due to a readily identifiable nonvascular cause (e.g., brain tumor, trauma), as confirmed by a neurologist. All strokes required confirmation by imaging or autopsy. TIA was defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by suspected focal cerebral, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without evidence of acute infarction and confirmed by a neurologist.</description>

    <measure>Frequency of acute myocardial infarction at 90 days</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Acute MI was defined as the detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers (cardiac troponin T), with at least one value being elevated above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and with at least one of the following: 1) symptoms of myocardial ischemia; 2) new (or presumably new) significant ST-segment/T-wave changes or left bundle branch block; 3) development of pathological Q waves on ECG; 4) new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality by imaging; or 5) identification of intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.</description>

Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but associated with medical intervention, surgical intervention, or interruption of the study drug.</description>
