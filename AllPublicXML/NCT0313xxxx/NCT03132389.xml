  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators seek to register the prevalence of sexually transmitted
      infections (STI) among people attending the Sexual Assault Centre in Oslo, Norway. The main
      aim of this study is to gather representative data on STIs after sexual assaults.
      Consequently, if the attendance for medical follow up turns out to be good/sufficient,
      prophylactic (antibiotic) treatment can potentially be omitted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who attend sexual assault centres are often concerned about being infected with
      STIs. Therefore, the patients attending sexual assault centres are offered examination and
      often receive prophylactic treatment against some STIs (e.g. chlamydia trachomatis, HIV and
      hepatitis B).

      In this study, the investigators seek to register the prevalence of STI among people
      attending the Sexual Assault Centre in Oslo, Norway. The primary aim of the study is to
      gather representative data on STIs after a sexual assault. Furthermore, the investigators
      want to evaluate if there are any variables that can predict transmission after a sexual
      assult. Results from this study will also be compared with findings of STI in the general
      population.

      At the Sexual Assault Centre in Oslo, Norway, patients are routinely offered three medical
      follow up consultations. Consequently, if the attendance at follow up visits turns out to be
      adequate, prophylactic (antibiotic) treatment can potentially be omitted.

      Since victims of assault are in a vulnerable situation, it would be useful to be able to
      inform them more precisely about infection risk and provide adequate prophylactic treatment.
      More knowledge about the incidence of infection after abuse will increase patient safety and
      improve the quality of treatment for these patients.
