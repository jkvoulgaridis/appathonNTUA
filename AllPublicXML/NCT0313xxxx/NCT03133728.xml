      The purpose of the study is to test the effect of the Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect (diagnostic
      assay) on uptake of HIV testing among HIV-exposed infants and young children, and health
      outcomes for HIV-infected infants and young children using a novel POC EID Community Model in
      Zambia. The study will also assess the feasibility of field implementation of this novel
      diagnostic tool and its acceptability among HIV-infected mothers and frontline health
      workers.

      The purpose of the study is to test the effect of the Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect (diagnostic
      assay) on uptake of HIV testing among HIV-exposed infants and young children, and health
      outcomes for HIV-infected infants and young children through a novel POC EID Community Model
      in Zambia. The study will also assess the feasibility of field implementation of this novel
      diagnostic tool and its acceptability among HIV-infected mothers and frontline health
      workers. The knowledge generated from this study will enable the Zambia Ministry of Health
      (MOH) to make informed policy decisions about the implementation and scale up of point of
      care (POC) diagnostic tools for early infant diagnosis and pediatric HIV treatment programs
      in Zambia and the region.

    <description>The Investigators will visit each of the selected 3 clusters (i.e. 6 primary health clinics) to construct a retrospective cohort of high-risk HIV-infected women who entered the national PMTCT program and received the SOC between June 1, 2017 and May 31, 2018. Using existing data through the electronic health record information (SmartCare and LIMS), the investigators will gather individual-level retrospective data on high-risk Mother-Infant Pairs (MIPs) from PMTCT enrolment through the child's ART enrolment, initiation, and retention rate at 3 months.</description>

    <description>Study Research Assistants (RA) will review routine patient files and registers, augmented by existing electronic health record information, to identify a new cohort of high-risk Mother-Infant Pairs (MIPs) at each study site. The outreach team will include, at a minimum, the study RA, a study peer, and an HIV counselor from the health facility, who will carry the Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect with them. When the outreach team contacts a high-risk MIP at community level, the team will approach the MIP for study screening, consent, and enrolment procedures. Study staff will ask the parent/guardian if the parent/guardian would like the IYC to be tested at their home, at a community health post, or other private space in the community. The IYC will be tested using both the Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect platform and a reflex DBS PCR test to evaluate performance of the POC platform in a mobile setting against the gold standard.</description>

    <description>Infants of intervention clinics will have heelprick-obtained blood tested by standard of care method (SOC) and Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect Test Point of Care testing onsite (i.e. community, household, or facility level). Point-of-care (POC) testing results will be available in 52 minutes. HIV-infected infants, based on the Alere Q test result, will start ART as soon as possible and start routine SOC visits at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and 48 post ART-initiation. Study data will be obtained on first 4 routine visits after ART initiation (3 months). Infants will return for results of DBS-based DNA PCR testing. Positive SOC infants remain on ART/study follow-up. Negative POC test/negative SOC infants will attend only routine care visits and continue on HIV prophylaxis per national guidelines. Discordant results require DNA PCR test, with positive results continuing ART, negative results being repeated for confirmation before discontinuation.</description>

          4. With a parent/guardian ≥18 years of age, and willing and able to provide written
             informed consent in a study language (English, Nyanja, or Bemba).

        Exclusion criteria include IYCs:

          1. With documented age-appropriate, guideline-adherent receipt of DBS-based EID HIV PCR
             testing;
