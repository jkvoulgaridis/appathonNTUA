    <textblock>
      CACIES is a descriptive study conducted in two hospital centers in France to assess nurses
      internal contamination by antineoplastic drugs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increase of cancer incidence contributes to a growing number of administered
      chemotherapies in care services. These antineoplastic drugs are not selective in their
      mechanisms of action, affecting noncancerous as well as cancerous cells, leading to several
      known side effects in treated patients. Health care professionals are increasingly exposed to
      antineoplastic drugs and can be potentially contaminated by these molecules. This is a key
      concern as part of assessment and occupational risk management in healthcare settings.

      Occupational Health and Safety Department, in collaboration with Clinical and Toxicology
      Laboratory of university Hospital Bordeaux, developed analytical tools to assess this
      contamination in health care professional's urines, and the new acquisition of a
      high-sensitivity measurement equipment (LC-MS/MS) improved assays methods in terms of
      sensitivity and detection limits.

      The main objective of the study is to assess internal contamination prevalence by the studied
      antineoplastic drugs (5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide,
      methotrexate) in nursing staff who administers these chemotherapies or is in charge of
      patients treated by these chemotherapies, in two French hospital centers: University Hospital
      Bordeaux and IUCT-Oncopole of Toulouse (Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse),
      including about fifteen services selected on their use of these specific chemotherapies.

      The secondary objectives of the study are on the one hand, to describe for each of the five
      studied antineoplastic drugs the internal contamination prevalence in nursing staff, and
      concentration level associated to this contamination in contaminated nursing staff, and on
      the other hand, to identify contamination-associated factors in exposure characteristics and
      personal protective equipment use.

      This is a descriptive, multicentre, transverse and prospective study.
