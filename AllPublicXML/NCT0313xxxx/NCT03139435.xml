    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well ultrasound works in detecting taxane-induced
      neuropathy in patients with breast cancer. Ultrasound may work better in diagnosing and
      detecting neuropathy in breast cancer patients treated with the chemotherapy drug called a
      taxane.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare tibial motor nerve ultrasound cross-sectional area (CSA) between taxane-induced
      peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) patients and historical data among healthy adults.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare sural sensory nerve ultrasound CSA between TIPN patients and historical data
      among healthy adults.

      II. To determine if the above changes in nerve CSA correlate with NCS changes in the same
      TIPN patients.

      III. To determine if the above changes in nerve CSA correlate with changes on a self-reported
      neuropathy scale (Quality of Life Questionnaire - Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
      20 [QLQ-CIPN20]) in the same TIPN patients.

      IV. To determine if the above changes in nerve CSA correlate with intraepidermal nerve fiber
      (IENF) density changes on skin biopsy in the same TIPN patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess activated mast cells in skin biopsies in TIPN patients in relation to severity
      of symptoms and above findings.

      II. To assess serum inflammatory markers in TIPN patients in relation to severity of symptoms
      and above findings.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo peripheral nerve ultrasound. Patients also undergo skin biopsy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>Will be determined by ultrasound in the tibial nerve. Will be compared to the historical data from healthy patients using two-sample t-test (two-sample t-test selected as primary data from the historical control patients is available and will be used for analysis). Will also compare the nerve cross-sectional area in our study sample to that in the historical diabetic neuropathy patients and historical oxaliplatin neuropathy patients using one-sample t-test. The general linear model will be used to evaluate any factors (e.g., age) that may be associated with the nerve cross-sectional area. Due</description>
