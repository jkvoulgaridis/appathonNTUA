  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Speech is an important indicator of motor function and movement coordination and can be
      extremely sensitive to involvement in the course of neurologic diseases. The aim of this
      project is to discover for the first time using simple speech recording and high end pattern
      analysis preclinical stages of disabling central nervous system disorders including
      Parkinson's disease and other alpha-synucleinopathies in &quot;at high risk&quot; patients with REM
      sleep behavior disorder and thus provide one essential prerequisite for trials on REM sleep
      behavior disorder with preventive therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seven centers of excellence in sleep research will investigate speech and other clinical
      symptoms in more than 100 subjects with REM sleep behavior disorder. Analyses of a number of
      unique speech dimensions based upon three fundamental categories of simple speaking tasks
      will be used to search for specific prodromal alterations in speech patterns in REM sleep
      behavior disorder, compared to age- and gender-matched patients with early Parkinson's
      disease and healthy control subjects. Robust algorithms allowing automated speech analysis
      will be developed and optimized through English, German, French, Czech and Italian languages.
      Early motor dysfunction strongly predicts Parkinson's disease and other
      alpha-synucleinopathies. In this regard, vocal assessment has intriguing potential advances
      as is non-invasive, inexpensive, simple to administer and scalable to large population with
      possibility to perform recordings remotely, even by telephone from patients' home. Speech
      analysis may serve as a simple tool to screen large populations for the risk to develop
      Parkinson's disease. If speech impairment appears to be a strong biomarker of early motor
      dysfunction, the screening of speech changes may improve stratification for future
      neuroprotective therapies for Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies.
