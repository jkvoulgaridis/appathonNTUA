  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of pembrolizumab-based therapy in previously treated extrapulmonary
      poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts of the study. In Part A, subjects are treated with pembrolizumab alone,
      and in Part B with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (physician's choice, paclitaxel or
      irinotecan). Adaptive Simon's two-stage design is used. The overall plan hinges on the
      activity of single agent pembrolizumab in the first stage of Part A. If there is sufficient
      activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will expand to the second stage of Part A
      and forgo Part B. If there is insufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study
      will proceed to the first stage of Part B (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis population who demonstrated complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) radiographically according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as assessed by investigator. The analysis will include all subjects treated (ITT) who received at least one dose of the study treatment. If the final study consists of both Part A and Part B, the analysis will be done separately for each part.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the duration of the study, which is estimated to be approximately 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment with protocol therapy to the date of death due to any cause. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to summarize OS. Median OS and its 95% confidence interval will be obtained for Part A and B (if available) separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the duration of the study, which is estimated to be approximately 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Response is defined as the time from the date of first response (CR or PR) until the date of disease progression or death. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to summarize DOR. Median DOR and its 95% confidence interval will be obtained for Part A and B (if available) separately. Only patients who have a demonstrated response will be used in final analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the duration of the study, which is estimated to be approximately 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment with protocol therapy to the date of documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by The immune-related response criteria (irRC) for the immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS) and RECIST v1.1 for PFS. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to summarize progression free survival; median irPFS and PFS will be estimated with 95% confidence interval for Part A and B (if available) separately.</description>

                  any extrapulmonary site (and poorly differentiated NEC, not otherwise specified)

               2. Includes neuroendocrine prostate cancer (de novo or treatment-emergent) of
                  prostate if small cell or large cell histology (histologic evidence of both
                  adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma may be present in same patient)

               3. Other mixed tumors, e.g. mixed neuroendocrine neoplasms (MINENs) with NEC plus
                  adenocarcinoma, squamous or acinar cell component are allowed if the high grade
                  (small or large cell) NEC component comprises &gt;50% of the original sample or
                  subsequent biopsy

          4. Have progressed during or after completion of first line systemic chemotherapy

               1. No limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens

               2. Early progression on/after adjuvant chemotherapy counts as firstline therapy

          5. Have at least one measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1

          6. Patients must agree to have a biopsy of primary tumor or metastatic tissue at
             baseline, and there must be a lesion that can be biopsied with acceptable clinical
             risk (as judged by the investigator).

               1. Patients with unsuccessful baseline biopsies may undergo an additional biopsy
                  attempt (at the same or a different site, determined by the investigator).

               2. For patients with an intact primary and no metastatic site that can be safely
                  biopsied, biopsy of the primary is acceptable, but must be approved by the
                  principal investigator.

               3. Baseline tumor biopsy may be omitted if the tumor is inaccessible and/or a biopsy
                  is not thought to post exceptionally high procedural risk due to location or
                  other factors

          7. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Scale.

         10. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference
             Section 5.7.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been
             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         12. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

               -  Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
                  replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not
                  considered a form of systemic treatment.

         14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis

         15. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         18. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

         20. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         21. Has known active Hepatitis B virus (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C virus
