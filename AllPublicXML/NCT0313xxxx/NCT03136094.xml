  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of a program to detect and manage suicide risk among
      American-Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth. Half of the participants will receive caring
      text messages to reduce suicidal thoughts, attempts, and hospitalizations and to increase
      engagement, social connectedness, and resilience in at-risk youth. The other half will
      receive usual care that does not include the caring text messages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study, &quot;Suicide in Urban Natives: Detection and Networks to Combat Events,&quot; builds on
      Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to treatment (SBIRT), carried out through the
      primary care setting, to detect and manage suicide risk. This approach is multilevel,
      targeting both the healthcare system and the individual, and links screening to existing
      mobile phone technologies shown to promote resilience and to tap the protective benefits of
      social connectedness. This Collaborative Hub will conduct a randomized control trial that
      compares the effectiveness of enhancing these SBIRT programs by sending caring text messages
      to reduce suicidal ideation, attempts, and hospitalizations, and to increase engagement,
      social connectedness, and resilience. The Investigators' long-term goal is to disseminate and
      translate the lessons learned into practical policy, organizational changes, and preventive
      innovations that optimize patient-centered health outcomes and ultimately reduce or eliminate
      the dramatic and tragic suicide-related health disparities among urban AI/AN youth and young
      adults.

    <masking_description>Patients will not be given details about how text messaging differs for the 2 study groups. Instead, patients will be told that the clinic is testing a program to support people who are having hard times, and that they will receive periodic text messages from the Site Coordinator for the next 12 months.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Suicidal Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 15-item Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Jr. assesses frequency of suicidal thoughts in the past month. Item content ranges from general thoughts of death and wishes that one were dead to specific thoughts of self-injurious behavior. Responses are on a 7-point scale ranging from never to almost daily. Items are summed for a total score (range 0-90).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Reported Suicide Attempts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the interviewer-administered Suicide Attempt and Self-Injury Count to assess the method, intent, treatment received, and lethality for all suicide attempts over the respondent's lifetime.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hospitalizations and Behavioral Health Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess self-reported hospitalizations over the previous 12 months with a measure of health service use previously applied to AI/ANs. It captures information on inpatient and outpatient medical care, emergency room visits, and use of traditional practices.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Social Connectedness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess social connectedness with the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, a validated measure of feelings of connectedness to others and of being a burden on others.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SBIRT Retention and Uptake of Referral to Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retention will be measured as binary indicators of complete participation in the appropriate level of intervention determined during the initial in-person session with the behavioral therapist before enrollment in the study, and as uptake of therapy services for people who are referred to this level of care. For each participant, we will create a 3-category indicator of retention (full, partial, none).</description>
