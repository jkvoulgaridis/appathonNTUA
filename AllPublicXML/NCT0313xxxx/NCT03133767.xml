  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of intravascular (IV) fluid is the most common emergency department (ED)
      procedure. IV fluids are integral to increasing effective blood volume and ensuring organ
      perfusion in patients with volume depletion and dehydration. There are many options of IV
      fluids providers can use when treating ED patients. Surveys show physicians do not cite an
      evidence-based reason for selecting the crystalloid IV fluid used; the decision was likely to
      be influenced by type and location of practice. A gap exists in the current literature, as
      there is no evidence for the optimal IV fluid choice for the ED patient requiring IV fluid
      before discharge.

      Normal saline (NS) is commonly used as an IV fluid replacement in ED patients. However, NS
      has been associated with increased risk of acidosis and acute kidney injury. This study will
      use a novel approach of a patient-centered outcome in a non-critically ill population to
      ascertain the optimal IV fluid for patient quality of recovery. The results of this study
      will inform provider's IV fluid decisions between NS and LR. More importantly, the results of
      this study will have the power to improve patient's quality of recovery following IV fluid
      administration and subsequent ED discharge.

      ED patients will be recruited, and participants will be randomized to receive one of two IV
      solutions (Lactated ringer's or normal saline). Participants will answer a survey before and
      after the intervention to assess their quality of recovery. The post-survey will be
      administered by phone after ED discharge. Participants will also be contacted by text message
      one week following their ED visit to gather information on their healthcare utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center randomized, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial testing
      superiority of LR compared to NS in patients receiving IV fluid before discharge.

      The study site is the University of Iowa Emergency Department (annual patient volume is
      60,000 patients/year).

      The study population will include adult ED patients presenting with chief complaints
      associated with volume depletion. Figure 1 outlines the enrollment flowchart for the study
      with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Research assistants (RAs) are available in the ED from
      9am - 10pm every day, and an automated paging system will alert the team when patients
      qualify, as the study team has done previously. All participants will receive 2 liters of
      blinded IV fluid as part of the study. The intervention group will receive lactated ringer's,
      and the control group will receive normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride). Nursing staff will
      establish the peripheral IV access, and subjects will be blinded to group.

      The primary outcome, Quality of Recovery-40, will be analyzed using a t-test (if parametric)
      or Mann Whitney U Test (non-parametric) in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Normality
      will be assessed with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and visualization of data. Due to the nature
      of time-critical emergency department research, an additional analysis will be done by
      treatment received and compared to the primary ITT analysis as a sensitivity analysis.
      Secondary outcomes will be reported as a relative risk with 95%CI in an ITT analysis. A
      safety analysis of secondary outcomes will be performed by treatment received (see page 37).
      Baseline characteristics will be reported with summary statistics as appropriate (mean, SD,
      median, IQR) and differences in characteristics will be conducted using a t-test and
      chi-square test, as appropriate. The following variables will also be assessed: actual fluid
      administered(mL), pre-intervention QoR-40 score, and time from intervention to primary
      outcome. If differences in these characteristics exist between the control and intervention
      groups, multivariate linear regression and multivariate logistic regression (primary and
      secondary outcomes, respectively) will be used.

    <description>The Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) is a validated instrument that quantifies patient's self-assessment of functional recovery, symptoms, and physical comfort. The QoR-40 scores range from 40 to 200 with a 200 representing a better recovery outcome. The survey consists of 40 questions scored from one to five with a Likert scale, and the total score is the sum of each question.</description>

        <description>The Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) is a validated instrument that quantifies patient's self-assessment of functional recovery, symptoms, and physical comfort. The QoR-40 scores range from 40 to 200 with a 200 representing a better recovery outcome. The survey consists of 40 questions scored from one to five with a Likert scale, and the total score is the sum of each question.</description>
