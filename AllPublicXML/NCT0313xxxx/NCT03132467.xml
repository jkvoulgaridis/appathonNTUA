      This early phase I trial studies the side effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab before
      surgery in treating patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative stage II-III
      breast cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab,
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of enrolling patients with hormone receptor positive
      (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor negative (HER2-) breast cancer onto a trial
      evaluating investigational agents prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab plus durvalumab in patients with
      HR+/HER2- breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses to tremelimumab and durvalumab in patients with
      HR+/HER2- breast cancer who receive the combination therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pathologic response in patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer receiving
      tremelimumab plus durvalumab prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo a biopsy and receive standard of
      care neoadjuvant chemotherapy before undergoing surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up until the time of surgery.
