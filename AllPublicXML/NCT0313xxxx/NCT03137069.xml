    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days (UAS7) at Day 57</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS is a composite diary-recorded score with numeric severity ratings (0=none to 3=intense) for the number of wheals (hives) per 24 hours and the intensity of the pruritus (itch). The total daily score (sum of the wheal and pruritus scores) ranges from 0 to 6. Because of variations in chronic urticaria disease intensity, assessment of disease activity was based on a weekly (7 days) UAS score called UAS7, that is, the sum of the daily UASs, ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. A negative change score (Day 57 score minus Baseline score) indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 weeks after the last dose (Up to Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory values or abnormal clinical test results), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Area under the Concentration-time Curve from Time 0 to Time t (AUC0-T)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose Day 1, pre-dose Day 8 and on Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-t) is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated time (0-t). AUC is a measure of the plasma concentration of GDC-0853 over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose Day 1, pre-dose Day 8 and on Day 57</time_frame>

    <measure>Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose Day 1, pre-dose Day 8 and on Day 57</time_frame>

    <measure>Plasma Terminal Half-Life (t1/2) of GDC-0853</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose Day 1, pre-dose Day 8 and on Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma terminal half-life is the time measured during drug elimination phase for the plasma drug concentration to decrease by one half.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) of GDC-0853</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose Day 1, pre-dose Day 8 and on Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
