    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, prospective, observational study to realize the current situation of
      COPD patients in China. About 5000 COPD patients will be enrolled from 50 participating sites
      around China and followed up for one year. During this study, patients will undergo clinical
      assessments and receive medical care as determined by their treating physician.

      This is a multi-centre, prospective, observational study. This study aims to observe the
      general situation in clinical practice, and the evolution and outcome of current usual care
      of COPD in China.This is an observational study. It will be carried out under routine
      clinical practice and the treatment will be determined by patients' treating physicians.
      Information about exposure to treatments as part of routine care will be collected (dose,
      frequency and duration).

      A multi-stage, stratified and cluster sampling method will be used to select a nationally
      representative sample from the tertiary and secondary hospitals with respiratory department
      in six geographic regions around China as the study sites. Approximately 5000 patients with
      COPD will be enrolled from 50 selected study sites in order to recruit a nationally
      representative study population and followed up for one year.
