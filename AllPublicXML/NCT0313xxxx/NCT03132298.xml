  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to test whether a single-session intervention teaching incremental
      theories of personality, or the belief that one's personality is malleable, can strengthen
      recovery from social stress and reduce the development of anxiety and depression during early
      adolescence. Results may suggest a scalable, cost-effective approach to improving youths'
      coping capacities and preventing adverse mental health outcomes over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efforts to prevent and reduce mental health problems in youths have advanced greatly in
      recent years. However, these advances have not reduced rates of youth mental illness on a
      large scale. Thus, a great need exists for novel, scalable, and low-cost approaches to
      reducing mental health problems in youth. Ideally, such approaches would be
      mechanism-targeted: that is, they would act on specific developmental processes that underlie
      psychological disorders. The proposed research aims to address this need by testing whether a
      single-session intervention teaching incremental theories of personality, or the belief that
      one's personality is malleable—as opposed to entity theories of personality, or the belief
      that one's personality is fixed and unchangeable—can strengthen recovery from social stress
      and prevent the development of anxiety and depression during early adolescence. Compared to
      incremental theories, entity theories of personal traits have demonstrated cross-sectional
      and prospective relations with greater anxiety and depression in youths. Further, a
      single-session incremental personality theories intervention reduced the development of
      depressive symptoms in a community sample of adolescents, supporting these theories as
      powerful intervention and/or prevention targets, even when taught in a brief format.
      Specifically, this project has two aims. Aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of the implicit
      theories intervention on two candidate mechanisms of action, or targets, identified by prior
      research: arousal (measured via physiological reactivity following social stress) and loss
      (here, perceived loss of behavioral control) in youths 12-15 years of age. Following a
      lab-based social stress induction, I hypothesize that participants receiving the intervention
      will recover from stress more rapidly, as indicated by measures of arousal (heart rate
      variability; electrodermal activity levels) and self-reported loss (increased self-reported
      perceived control) compared to participants who do not receive the intervention. Aim 2 is to
      evaluate the effects of the single-session incremental theories intervention on anxiety and
      depression over a nine-month follow-up period. I will test whether the intervention, compared
      to a control protocol, reduces symptoms of anxiety an depression the development of anxiety
      and depression; I will also assess whether this change is a direct result of shifts in the
      two aforementioned targets (arousal; loss). I predict more positive trajectories in anxiety
      and depression for youth receiving the intervention, relative to those who do not receive the
      intervention, across nine months. I will also test whether these trajectories are mediated by
      changes in the targets described in Aim 1. Finally, regardless of outcomes for Aims 1 and 2,
      baseline, postintervention, and 9-month measures will be used to map links among implicit
      theories, interventions targeting those theories, social stress recovery, and youth anxiety
      and depression over time. Findings may suggest a cost-effective, scalable intervention that
      improves youth resiliency and mental health.

    <description>the Children's Depression Inventory, a 27-item self-report questionnaire that measures cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms of depression. Items are scored from 0-2, and scores range from 0 to 44; higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. The CDI is reliable and valid. It can distinguish youths with more or less severe depressive symptoms, as well as youths at risk for depression from non-depressed youths. Suicide- and self-harm related questions were removed for the purposes of this study.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 3-, 6-, and 9-month (final) follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline and at each follow-up point using the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders - Child and Parent versions (SCARED-C/SCARED-P). The SCARED-C and SCARED-P are child and parent versions of the same 41-item questionnaire measure of pediatric anxiety. Both differentiate between clinically anxious and nonanxious psychiatrically ill youth. Youths/parents respond to items using a 3-point Likert scale describing the degree to which statements are true about them; scores range from 0 to 82. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the SCARED are strong (Hale, Raaijmakers, Muris, &amp; Meeus, 2005; Myers &amp; Winters, 2002). In this study, the SCARED-C/P Total Scores were used and derived by summing all 41 items, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Primary Control Scale for Children (PCSC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3-, 6-, and 9-month (final) follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PCSC is a 24-item scale measuring perceived ability to exert primary control: to influence or alter objective events or conditions through personal effort. Participants rated agreement with statements about their ability to exert primary control, with half the items worded in a positive direction (e.g., &quot;I can do well on tests if I study hard.&quot;) and half in a negative direction (e.g., &quot;I cannot get other kids to like me no matter how hard I try.&quot;). Responses range from &quot;very true&quot; to &quot;very false&quot; on a four-point Likert scale. Scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating higher (more adaptive) levels of perceived primary control.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3-, 6-, and 9-month (final) follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SCSC is a 20-item scale measuring perceived ability to exert secondary control: to influence the personal psychological impact of objective conditions on oneself, by adjusting oneself to fit those conditions. Item content reflects response patterns associated with various kinds of secondary control, such as finding a silver lining (&quot;I can usually find something good to like, even in a bad situation.&quot;) and adjusting cognition (&quot;When something bad happens, I can find a way to think about it that makes me feel better.&quot;). Respondents rate agreement with each item on a 4-point Likert scale from &quot;very false&quot; to &quot;very true.&quot; Scores range from 0-60, with higher scores corresponding to higher (more adaptive) levels of perceived secondary control.</description>

    <measure>Electrodermal Activity (EDA) Recovery Slope</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at immediate post-intervention only</time_frame>
    <description>EDA was assessed continuously during the laboratory baseline (5 min prior to the social stress induction), social stress induction, and recovery period (5 min following the social stress induction) using Biopac MP150 hardware at a sampling rate of 1000 readings persecond and a 0.5e1 Hz bandpass filter. EDA was measured with a Biopac GSR100C amplifier and two EDA isotonic gel electrodes placed on the thenar and hypothenar eminences of the child's nondominant hand. EDA data were acquired and analyzed using AcqKnowledge 4.1 Software. Research assistants trained by the first author manually identified and removed artifacts. Averages (expressed in micro-Siemens) for EDA during the baseline, speech preparation, speech, and recovery periods were calculated for each participant. Slopes of EDA change during the recovery were calculated, expressed in microSiemens per second.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Recovery Slope</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at immediate post-intervention only</time_frame>
    <description>HRV was assessed; specifically, the time-based root-mean square successive difference of normal-to-normal (N-to-N) intervals (rMSSD). RMSSD equates to mean shifts in the time elapsed between consecutive heartbeats, in milliseconds. It reflects parasympathetically mediated, short-term changes in HRV. More rapid post-stressor increases in rMSSD (during the 5-min post stressor recovery period) indicated a more adaptive recovery trajectory following stress. Here, rMSSD was computed using the Acqknowledge automated time-series HRV analysis function.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3-, 6-, and 9-month (final) follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Parental depressive symptoms were measured at baseline at 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up assessments using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The BDI is one of the most widely used and evaluated self- report measures of adult depressive symptoms. For each of its 21 items, respondents select among four alternative responses reflecting the increasing levels of symptom severity (0 = no symptom present to 3 = severe symptom present). The total score was used in this study, with a possible score range of 0 to 63 at each assessment point. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3-, 6-, and 9-month (final) follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Parental anxiety symptoms were measured at baseline at 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up assessments using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck &amp; Steer, 1993), a widely-used self-report measure of anxiety in adults for use in clinical, community, and research settings. Respondents report the extent to which they have been bothered by each of 21 symptoms over the preceding week. Each item has four possible answer choices: Not at All; Mildly; Moderately, and Severely. Because the BAI's 21 items (each rated 0 to 3, for a total possible scores ranging from 0 to 63 - higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety) describe the emotional, physiological, and cognitive symptoms of anxiety but not depression, it can discriminate anxiety from depression in adults.</description>

    <measure>Brief Family Assessment Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3-, 6-, and 9-month (final) follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The BFAM is a 14-item parent report questionnaire assessing perceptions of family functioning during the previous 2 weeks. This instrument was created to provide an operational definition and means of measuring the seven constructs in the Process Model of Family Functioning; it includes two items relating to each construct. Items such as &quot;We take the time to listen to each other&quot; and &quot;When things aren't going well it takes too long to work them out&quot; are scored on a 5-point scale. Items are summed to create a total score (range: 0-70), with higher scores indicating greater familial dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Implicit Personality Theory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Implicit Personality Theory Questionnaire asks participants to indicate on a 1 (really disagree) to 6 (really agree) scale the extent to which they endorse three statements: &quot;You have a certain personality, and it is something that you can't do much about&quot;; &quot;Your personality is something about you that you can't change very much&quot;; and &quot;Either you have a good personality or you don't, and there is really very little you can do about it.&quot; Numerical scores are summed to yield a single, total implicit theory of personality score (score range=0-18); higher scores indicate a stronger entity theory of personality, and lower scores indicate stronger incremental theories of personality.</description>

    <description>The Control Program is a computer-based session of supportive therapy (ST), designed to encourage youths to identify and express feelings. ST does not teach specific skills or beliefs and has been shown to be less effective than cognitive-behavioral interventions in reducing youth internalizing distress. Here, ST was designed to control for nonspecific intervention elements (eg. completing an interactive computer program) and to encourage youths to share emotions with others. ST included the same number of reading/writing activities as the experimental program and took the same amount of time (30 mins.) to complete.</description>

          <description>This program is self-administered, computer-based, and 30 minutes in length. Content is designed to maximize relevance for youths with internalizing distress. The program includes 5 elements: 1. An introduction the concept of neuroplasticity; 2. Testimonials from older youths describing beliefs that people’s traits are malleable, given the brain’s capacity for change; 3. Further vignettes by older youths describing times when they used “growth mindsets” to cope with peer rejection, hopelessness, and feared embarrassment; 4. A worksheet describing strategies for applying these principles to participants’ lives; 5. An exercise wherein participants write notes to younger children, using newly-gleaned information about the malleability of personal traits to help them to cope with setbacks.</description>

          <title>Control Program</title>
          <description>The Control Program is a computer-based session of supportive therapy (ST), designed to encourage youths to identify and express feelings. ST does not teach specific skills or beliefs and has been shown to be less effective than cognitive-behavioral interventions in reducing youth internalizing distress. Here, ST was designed to control for nonspecific intervention elements (eg. completing an interactive computer program) and to encourage youths to share emotions with others. ST included the same number of reading/writing activities as the experimental program and took the same amount of time (30 mins.) to complete.</description>

        <title>Change in Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders - Child (SCARED-C) From Baseline to 9-month Follow-up</title>
        <description>Anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline and at each follow-up point using the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders - Child and Parent versions (SCARED-C/SCARED-P). The SCARED-C and SCARED-P are child and parent versions of the same 41-item questionnaire measure of pediatric anxiety. Both differentiate between clinically anxious and nonanxious psychiatrically ill youth. Youths/parents respond to items using a 3-point Likert scale describing the degree to which statements are true about them; scores range from 0 to 82. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the SCARED are strong (Hale, Raaijmakers, Muris, &amp; Meeus, 2005; Myers &amp; Winters, 2002). In this study, the SCARED-C/P Total Scores were used and derived by summing all 41 items, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of anxiety.</description>

Testimonials from older youths describing beliefs that people’s traits are malleable, given the brain’s capacity for change; 3. Further vignettes by older youths describing times when they used “growth mindsets” to cope with peer rejection, hopelessness, and feared embarrassment; 4. A worksheet describing strategies for applying these principles to participants’ lives; 5. An exercise wherein participants write notes to younger children, using newly-gleaned information about the malleability of personal traits to help them to cope with setbacks.</description>

            <title>Control Program</title>
            <description>The Control Program is a computer-based session of supportive therapy (ST), designed to encourage youths to identify and express feelings. ST does not teach specific skills or beliefs and has been shown to be less effective than cognitive-behavioral interventions in reducing youth internalizing distress. Here, ST was designed to control for nonspecific intervention elements (eg. completing an interactive computer program) and to encourage youths to share emotions with others. ST included the same number of reading/writing activities as the experimental program and took the same amount of time (30 mins.) to complete.</description>

          <title>Change in Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders - Child (SCARED-C) From Baseline to 9-month Follow-up</title>
          <description>Anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline and at each follow-up point using the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders - Child and Parent versions (SCARED-C/SCARED-P). The SCARED-C and SCARED-P are child and parent versions of the same 41-item questionnaire measure of pediatric anxiety. Both differentiate between clinically anxious and nonanxious psychiatrically ill youth. Youths/parents respond to items using a 3-point Likert scale describing the degree to which statements are true about them; scores range from 0 to 82. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the SCARED are strong (Hale, Raaijmakers, Muris, &amp; Meeus, 2005; Myers &amp; Winters, 2002). In this study, the SCARED-C/P Total Scores were used and derived by summing all 41 items, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of anxiety.</description>

        <description>The PCSC is a 24-item scale measuring perceived ability to exert primary control: to influence or alter objective events or conditions through personal effort. Participants rated agreement with statements about their ability to exert primary control, with half the items worded in a positive direction (e.g., &quot;I can do well on tests if I study hard.&quot;) and half in a negative direction (e.g., &quot;I cannot get other kids to like me no matter how hard I try.&quot;). Responses range from &quot;very true&quot; to &quot;very false&quot; on a four-point Likert scale. Scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating higher (more adaptive) levels of perceived primary control.</description>

Respondents rate agreement with each item on a 4-point Likert scale from &quot;very false&quot; to &quot;very true.&quot; Scores range from 0-60, with higher scores corresponding to higher (more adaptive) levels of perceived secondary control.</description>

EDA was measured with a Biopac GSR100C amplifier and two EDA isotonic gel electrodes placed on the thenar and hypothenar eminences of the child's nondominant hand. EDA data were acquired and analyzed using AcqKnowledge 4.1 Software. Research assistants trained by the first author manually identified and removed artifacts. Averages (expressed in micro-Siemens) for EDA during the baseline, speech preparation, speech, and recovery periods were calculated for each participant. Slopes of EDA change during the recovery were calculated, expressed in microSiemens per second.</description>

        <description>HRV was assessed; specifically, the time-based root-mean square successive difference of normal-to-normal (N-to-N) intervals (rMSSD). RMSSD equates to mean shifts in the time elapsed between consecutive heartbeats, in milliseconds. It reflects parasympathetically mediated, short-term changes in HRV. More rapid post-stressor increases in rMSSD (during the 5-min post stressor recovery period) indicated a more adaptive recovery trajectory following stress. Here, rMSSD was computed using the Acqknowledge automated time-series HRV analysis function.</description>

The BDI is one of the most widely used and evaluated self- report measures of adult depressive symptoms. For each of its 21 items, respondents select among four alternative responses reflecting the increasing levels of symptom severity (0 = no symptom present to 3 = severe symptom present). The total score was used in this study, with a possible score range of 0 to 63 at each assessment point. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

        <description>Parental anxiety symptoms were measured at baseline at 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up assessments using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck &amp; Steer, 1993), a widely-used self-report measure of anxiety in adults for use in clinical, community, and research settings. Respondents report the extent to which they have been bothered by each of 21 symptoms over the preceding week. Each item has four possible answer choices: Not at All; Mildly; Moderately, and Severely. Because the BAI's 21 items (each rated 0 to 3, for a total possible scores ranging from 0 to 63 - higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety) describe the emotional, physiological, and cognitive symptoms of anxiety but not depression, it can discriminate anxiety from depression in adults.</description>

Because the BAI's 21 items (each rated 0 to 3, for a total possible scores ranging from 0 to 63 - higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety) describe the emotional, physiological, and cognitive symptoms of anxiety but not depression, it can discriminate anxiety from depression in adults.</description>

        <title>Brief Family Assessment Measure</title>
        <description>The BFAM is a 14-item parent report questionnaire assessing perceptions of family functioning during the previous 2 weeks. This instrument was created to provide an operational definition and means of measuring the seven constructs in the Process Model of Family Functioning; it includes two items relating to each construct. Items such as &quot;We take the time to listen to each other&quot; and &quot;When things aren't going well it takes too long to work them out&quot; are scored on a 5-point scale. Items are summed to create a total score (range: 0-70), with higher scores indicating greater familial dysfunction.</description>

            <description>This program is self-administered, computer-based, and 30 minutes in length. Content is designed to maximize relevance for youths with internalizing distress. The program includes 5 elements: 1. An introduction the concept of neuroplasticity; 2. Testimonials from older youths describing beliefs that people’s traits are malleable, given the brain’s capacity for change; 3. Further vignettes by older youths describing times when they used “growth mindsets” to cope with peer rejection, hopelessness, and feared embarrassment; 4. A worksheet describing strategies for applying these principles to participants’ lives; 5. An exercise wherein participants write notes to younger children, using newly-gleaned information about the malleability of personal traits to help them to cope with setbacks.</description>

ST does not teach specific skills or beliefs and has been shown to be less effective than cognitive-behavioral interventions in reducing youth internalizing distress. Here, ST was designed to control for nonspecific intervention elements (eg. completing an interactive computer program) and to encourage youths to share emotions with others. ST included the same number of reading/writing activities as the experimental program and took the same amount of time (30 mins.) to complete.</description>
