    <textblock>
      This will be a 2 period one-day, double-masked, randomized, repeated measures,
      non-dispensing, cross-over study where the main purpose of this study is to compare the
      performance of a new daily disposable silicone hydrogel lens with that of an existing similar
      lens.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Both the investigator and the subjects are masked to the identity of the study lenses. Lenses were over-labelled and coded to mask the lens foil. Over-labelling was carried out by the study sponsor following specific SOPs (see ICH GCP guidelines Section 5.13).</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Fit Acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes after lens settling</time_frame>
    <description>Overall lens fit acceptance was assessed by the investigator based on lens fitting characteristics and graded on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0=should not be worn and 5=perfect fit. The score ranges from 0 to 5, where higher scores indicate better fitting. The number of eye for each Grade was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Power Requirement</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes after lens settling</time_frame>
    <description>The lens power requirements (aka sphere requirements) for each lens type was calculated by summing the lens power and the spherical over-refraction. Then the difference of lens power requirement between the Test and Control lenses was calculated (Test-Control).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Comfort at Lens Insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately upon lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective comfort on insertion was assessed by the subject on an 11-point scale (0 to 10) where 0=painful and 10=can't be felt. The score ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate better comfort. The average comfort score for each lens was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Comfort After Lens Settling</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes after lens settling</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective comfort on setting was assessed by the subject on an 11-point scale (0 to 10) where 0=painful and 10=can't be felt. The score ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate better comfort. The average comfort score for each lens was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Vision Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes after lens settling</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective vision quality was assessed by the subject on an 11-point scale (0 to 10) where 0=extremely blurred and 10=perfect. The score ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate better vision quality. The average vision quality score for each lens was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Handling</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately upon lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective handling was assessed by the subject on an 11-point scale (0 to 10) where 0=extremely difficult and 10=very easy. The score ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate better handling. The average handling score for each lens was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Monocular High Contrast Visual Acuity (VA)</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes after lens settling</time_frame>
    <description>Monocular high contrast distance VA with the study lenses was collected to the nearest letter using computer generated logMAR charts. 0.02 logMAR is equivalent to 1 letter. Negative logMAR values indicate better lens performance. The average visual acuity was reported for each lens type.</description>
