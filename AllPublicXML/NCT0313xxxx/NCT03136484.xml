  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America. The aim of the
      trial is to compare the effect of once-weekly (OW) dosing of subcutaneous semaglutide (1.0
      mg) versus once-daily dosing of oral canagliflozin (300 mg) on glycaemic control in subjects
      with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on a background treatment of metformin

    <measure>Change in Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36): Sub-domains</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) to week 52 in the sub-domain scores is presented. A positive change score indicate an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 52 in short form 36 v2.0 acute domain PCS. SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. It consists of 2 component summary measures that further summarize 8 health domain scales. The PCS measure is derived from domain scales of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population.

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ): Treatment Satisfaction Summary Score (Sum of 6 of 8 Items) and the 8 Items Separately</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in DTSQ was evaluated at week 52. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

    <measure>Change in Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ): Domains</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The CoEQ comprised 19 items to assess the intensity and type of food cravings, as well as subjective sensation of appetite and mood, with the 4 domains: 'craving control', 'craving for sweet', 'craving for savoury' and 'positive mood'. The 19 items were scored on an 11-point graded response scale ranging from 10 to 0, with items relating to each of the 4 domains being averaged to create a final score. A low score in the domains 'craving for sweet and 'craving for savoury' represents a low level of craving; whereas a high score in the domains 'craving control' and 'positive mood' represents good control and a good mood, respectively. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36): Sub-domains</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) to week 52 in the sub-domain scores is presented. A positive change score indicate an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36: Physical Component Summary (PCS)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 52 in short form 36 v2.0 acute domain PCS. SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. It consists of 2 component summary measures that further summarize 8 health domain scales. The PCS measure is derived from domain scales of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ): Treatment Satisfaction Summary Score (Sum of 6 of 8 Items) and the 8 Items Separately</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in DTSQ was evaluated at week 52. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ): Domains</title>
        <description>The CoEQ comprised 19 items to assess the intensity and type of food cravings, as well as subjective sensation of appetite and mood, with the 4 domains: 'craving control', 'craving for sweet', 'craving for savoury' and 'positive mood'. The 19 items were scored on an 11-point graded response scale ranging from 10 to 0, with items relating to each of the 4 domains being averaged to create a final score. A low score in the domains 'craving for sweet and 'craving for savoury' represents a low level of craving; whereas a high score in the domains 'craving control' and 'positive mood' represents good control and a good mood, respectively. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>

          <title>Change in CoEQ: Individual Items</title>
          <description>The CoEQ comprised 19 items to assess the intensity and type of food cravings, as well as subjective sensation of appetite and mood, with the 4 domains: 'craving control', 'craving for sweet', 'craving for savoury' and 'positive mood'. The 19 items were scored on an 11-point graded response scale ranging from 10 to 0, with items relating to each of the 4 domains being averaged to create a final score. A low score in the domains 'craving for sweet and 'craving for savoury' represents a low level of craving; whereas a high score in the domains 'craving control' and 'positive mood' represents good control and a good mood, respectively. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period.</description>
