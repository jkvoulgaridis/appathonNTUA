      This is a non-randomized, un-blinded feasibility study project comparing the Length of Stay
      (LOS) of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) infants diagnosed with Neonatal Abstinence
      Syndrome (NAS) treated with methadone with historical data and a comparison group of NICU NAS
      infants treated with a different narcotic agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the time frame July 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, 300 infants with NAS have been
      cared for in the JHACH NICU with an average length of stay of 30 days. Such a prolonged
      length of stay has a negative impact on maternal/infant bonding. In addition, infants
      suffering from NAS have poor regulatory mechanisms and are invariably hard to care for and
      difficult to console, and they provide an emotional challenge to their caretakers. This
      challenge becomes even more significant when the caretaker is the mother who is suffering
      from addiction and is already emotionally compromised by feelings of depression, anxiety,
      guilt or insecurity. Attachment is an ongoing process and the quality of the relationship
      between mother and her infant directly influences the structure of the child's affective ties
      and overall organization of responses to environment. This mother-infant bond sets the stage
      for understanding and identifying the infant's needs and reciprocal parental response to
      those needs. Maternal emotional unavailability has potentially serious effects on the long
      term mother-child relationship, and on the child's development.

      This project provides a novel approach and an alternative care plan for infants with NAS. It
      is funded by the State of Florida and allows to: 1) educate and empower a specified
      population of mothers who are undergoing institutionalized rehabilitation and whose infant
      needs treatment for NAS; 2) safely transition the infants home for final wean of their
      pharmacologic treatment; 3) provide regular developmental follow up for these infants through
      our NICU follow up clinic, hence identifying and quickly responding to neuro-developmental
      delays.

    <measure>Maternal Bonding Measured With The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>inpatient and at 6-8 weeks of age</time_frame>
    <description>The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) is a self-rating questionnaire designed to detect disorders of the mother-infant relationship. The questionnaire has 25 statements, each with six alternative responses ranging from 0 (always) to 5 (never). For the PBQ, scores are summated for each factor, with a high score indicating concern for bonding. The PBQ yields a total score between 0 to 125. Positive responses are scored from 0 ('always') to 5 ('never'). Negative responses, are scored from 5 ('always') to 0 ('never').
Factor 1 (impaired bonding) is based on 12 questions, with a score range 0-60 (0-11=normal; 12 &amp; above=high).
Factor 2 (rejection &amp; anger) is based on 7 questions with a score range 0-35 (0-16=normal; 17 &amp; above=high).
Factor 3 (anxiety about care) is based on 4 questions with a score range 0-20 (0-9=normal; 10 &amp; above =high).
Factor 4 (risk of abuse) is based on 2 questions, with a score range 0-10 (0-2=normal; 3 &amp; above =high).</description>

    <measure>Maternal Depression Measured With The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>While inpatient and at 6-8 weeks of age</time_frame>
    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was developed for screening postpartum women in outpatient, home visiting settings, or at the 6-8 week postpartum examination. The EPDS is a 10-item questionnaire with responses scored 0, 1, 2, or 3 according to increased severity of the symptom. The maximum total score is 30 while the minimum score is 0. A score of 10 or greater, as well as any answer choice other than &quot;never&quot; on question #10 (suicidal thoughts) of the EPDS are indicative of depressive symptomatology.</description>

    <description>Assess the age appropriate infant development at 4, 8 and 12 months of age among the methadone treatment group using the Ages and Stages-based questionnaires (ASQ). The questionnaires are screening tools designed to identify infants at risk for developmental delays through caregivers' provision of quantitative information regarding their infant's development. In the ASQ, higher scores indicate more positive outcomes. The ASQ covers 5 areas of development: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal-social. Scores for each area should fall between 0-60.
Scoring:
0-30 = further assessment with a professional may be needed 30-40 = learning activities &amp; monitoring are indicated 45-60 = child development appears to be on schedule</description>

        <title>Maternal Bonding Measured With The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ)</title>
        <description>The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) is a self-rating questionnaire designed to detect disorders of the mother-infant relationship. The questionnaire has 25 statements, each with six alternative responses ranging from 0 (always) to 5 (never). For the PBQ, scores are summated for each factor, with a high score indicating concern for bonding. The PBQ yields a total score between 0 to 125. Positive responses are scored from 0 ('always') to 5 ('never'). Negative responses, are scored from 5 ('always') to 0 ('never').
Factor 1 (impaired bonding) is based on 12 questions, with a score range 0-60 (0-11=normal; 12 &amp; above=high).
Factor 2 (rejection &amp; anger) is based on 7 questions with a score range 0-35 (0-16=normal; 17 &amp; above=high).
Factor 3 (anxiety about care) is based on 4 questions with a score range 0-20 (0-9=normal; 10 &amp; above =high).
Factor 4 (risk of abuse) is based on 2 questions, with a score range 0-10 (0-2=normal; 3 &amp; above =high).</description>
        <time_frame>inpatient and at 6-8 weeks of age</time_frame>
        <population>Data analysis was not completed. Results shown below are means for each group, note that many participants replied on the extremes of the answer range (e.g. always or never), which yields very low total scores for each factor.</population>

        <title>Maternal Depression Measured With The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)</title>
        <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was developed for screening postpartum women in outpatient, home visiting settings, or at the 6-8 week postpartum examination. The EPDS is a 10-item questionnaire with responses scored 0, 1, 2, or 3 according to increased severity of the symptom. The maximum total score is 30 while the minimum score is 0. A score of 10 or greater, as well as any answer choice other than &quot;never&quot; on question #10 (suicidal thoughts) of the EPDS are indicative of depressive symptomatology.</description>

        <title>Infant Development</title>
        <description>Assess the age appropriate infant development at 4, 8 and 12 months of age among the methadone treatment group using the Ages and Stages-based questionnaires (ASQ). The questionnaires are screening tools designed to identify infants at risk for developmental delays through caregivers' provision of quantitative information regarding their infant's development. In the ASQ, higher scores indicate more positive outcomes. The ASQ covers 5 areas of development: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal-social. Scores for each area should fall between 0-60.
Scoring:
0-30 = further assessment with a professional may be needed 30-40 = learning activities &amp; monitoring are indicated 45-60 = child development appears to be on schedule</description>
