      The primary objectives of Phase 1A are to evaluate the safety of KITE-718, determine a
      recommended Phase 1B dose, and to evaluate the efficacy of KITE-718 in Phase 1B.

      Participants found to be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DPB1*04:01 positive and whose tumors
      are MAGE-A3 and/or MAGE-A6 positive can participate if all eligibility criteria are met.
      Other tests required to determine eligibility include a physical exam, electrocardiogram
      (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) of the heart, CT or MRI scans, and blood draws. Eligible
      participants have white blood cells collected by leukapheresis. These cells are genetically
      modified to make the experimental treatment KITE-718. The desired outcome is that the
      genetically modified T cells will target tumor cells that express MAGE-A3 and/or MAGE-A6,
      which are proteins that can be expressed by cancer cells. Participants receive chemotherapy
      prior to the KITE-718 infusion. After the KITE-718 infusion, participants will be followed
      for side effects and have scans performed to see any potential impact on their cancers. Study
      procedures may be performed while hospitalized and/or in the outpatient setting.
