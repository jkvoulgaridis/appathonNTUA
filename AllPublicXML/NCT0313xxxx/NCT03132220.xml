  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed over 10 years ago, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) synergistically
      combines mindfulness training and cognitive behavioral therapy and can increase resiliency.
      In this study, the investigators proposed two aims: Aim #1: To adapt and optimize a MBCT
      resiliency program specifically for ICU nurses. For this aim, the investigators will engage
      multiple stakeholder groups to assist the protocol adaptation. Aim # 2: To conduct a pilot
      clinical trial to determine acceptability of the MBCT resiliency program and the control
      intervention. In this aim, the investigators will also identify the most feasible
      randomization level to minimize contamination between the control and intervention groups.
      Collectively, this proposal will pave the way for a properly designed large multi-center
      trial of a MBCT resiliency program (MBCT-ICU) to determine its ability to decrease BOS
      symptoms; and allow nurses to more effectively care for patients in the challenging ICU
      environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a stressful environment for all critical care healthcare
      providers. In the United States, there are more than 500,000 critical care (ICU) nurses that
      treat the most seriously ill patients. These ICU nurses have especially challenging and
      sometimes overwhelming jobs due to high patient mortality and morbidity, and frequent
      encounters with ethical dilemmas. The repetitive exposure to these extreme stressors and the
      inability to adjust to their difficult work environment may cause significant psychological
      stress. The investigator's multidisciplinary research team was one of the first to identify
      that ICU nurses have significantly high rates of psychological distress including: symptoms
      of anxiety and depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS).

      Work-induced distress initiates a negative cycle that contributes to the unacceptably high
      ICU nursing turnover rate. Nationally, nursing turnover rates range between 17-20% per year.
      In the ICU, the growing nursing shortage is particularly concerning. Presently, there are no
      interventions to reduce BOS in ICU nurses. Many stresses on ICU nurses are inherent to the
      critical care environment such as performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the death of a
      patient. Therefore, the investigators multidisciplinary research group has focused on
      enhancing the ability of ICU nurses to adapt to their work environment.

      Resiliency enables one to thrive in the face of adversity. Humans respond to stress and
      trauma in a variety of ways. Some people are resilient; defined as the ability to succeed, to
      live, and to develop in a positive way despite the stress or adversity that would normally
      involve the real possibility of a negative outcome. In practice, resilient individuals
      believe that what they do can have a positive impact on a situation, that some components of
      the 'system' can be controlled or influenced by one's own actions, that persistent effort is
      worthwhile, and that setbacks or potentially threatening events are inevitable and
      surmountable. A variety of qualities are associated with resiliency including the ability to
      engage the support of others, the belief that stress can be strengthening, and overall
      optimism. Though some individuals are inherently resilient; resiliency can be learned.
      Developing resiliency may be one strategy to prevent and treat symptoms of BOS. The
      investigators have demonstrated that resilient ICU nurses were less likely to have symptoms
      of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and BOS. The investigators also identified methods used by ICU
      nurses to promote resiliency and emotional wellness. The investigators ICU nursing pilot
      program also increased resiliency and decreased symptoms of BOS.

      From the investigators prior studies, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) are two modalities currently used by resilient ICU nurses. In the
      investigators most recent national survey, ICU nurses were eager to learn MBSR and CBT
      techniques to help reduce symptoms of BOS. Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
      combines the best of MBSR and CBT, and may build resiliency and reduce BOS symptoms. MBCT was
      developed by integrating the framework and practices of MBSR and CBT. Classically
      incorporated into an 8 week course, MBCT uses mindfulness skills to help individuals become
      aware of negative thoughts and feelings that are activated by stress. MBCT also incorporates
      CBT techniques to develop a different relationship to those thoughts and feelings, and
      interrupt the negative thought patterns.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Connor Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Once before the study intervention; one time immediately following the study intervention at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the pre-post changes in the CD-RISC scores in intervention and control subjects. The CD-RISC scale assesses resiliency in individuals. There are 25 items in the survey, each item is scored from 0-4, and the total ranges from 0-100. Higher scores indicate increased resiliency. Any individuals who score above 81 points on this survey will not qualify for this study as they are too inherently resilient. The study intervention will typically last 4 sessions, one session per week at a total of 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) - Emotional Exhaustion Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Once before the study intervention and once immediately after intervention at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will also complete pre and post-intervention MBI surveys to assess changes in burnout symptoms. This survey is composed of 22 items. Each item is scored from 0-6. There are three questions domains: emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5 items), and decreased person accomplishment (8 items). The items fall into one of these three categories and there are three domain scores. Higher values in each domain indicate increased burnout in that respective category.
Scores for each item in the Emotional Exhaustion subscale are summed to obtain an overall score. Overall scores for the Emotional Exhaustion subscale can range between 0-54.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS-5) - Intrusion Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Once before the study intervention and once immediately after the intervention at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete pre/post-intervention PDS-5 surveys to assess post traumatic symptoms. This survey includes a pre-screen and 24 items. Each item is placed into the respective PTSD symptom category (as defined by the Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5) and scored. Higher scores in each symptom domain indicate increased chance of PTSD diagnosis. The domains are: intrusion (5 items), avoidance (2 items), changes in mood/cognition (7 items), and arousal/ hyperactivity (6 items). 2 items address &quot;distress and interference&quot; and 2 items address &quot;symptom onset and duration.
Scores for each question range from 0 to 3. The 5 items that contribute to the Intrusion score are summed to yield a possible range of PDS Intrusion scores of 0-15, with higher scores indicating greater intrusion.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome is the pre-post changes in the CD-RISC scores in intervention and control subjects. The CD-RISC scale assesses resiliency in individuals. There are 25 items in the survey, each item is scored from 0-4, and the total ranges from 0-100. Higher scores indicate increased resiliency. Any individuals who score above 81 points on this survey will not qualify for this study as they are too inherently resilient. The study intervention will typically last 4 sessions, one session per week at a total of 4 weeks.</description>

            <description>The subject will participate in 16 hours that are broken into sessions for the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy intervention. The intervention will be facilitated by 1-2 instructors who are trained in clinical psychology/ social work and are also trained in MBCT. This intervention will include mindfulness activities, didactic learning, homework assignments and group dialogue. This adapted MBCT intervention will follow the empirically-based MBCT intervention for depression structure with fidelity.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Connor Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC) Scores</title>
          <description>The primary outcome is the pre-post changes in the CD-RISC scores in intervention and control subjects. The CD-RISC scale assesses resiliency in individuals. There are 25 items in the survey, each item is scored from 0-4, and the total ranges from 0-100. Higher scores indicate increased resiliency. Any individuals who score above 81 points on this survey will not qualify for this study as they are too inherently resilient. The study intervention will typically last 4 sessions, one session per week at a total of 4 weeks.</description>

There are three questions domains: emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5 items), and decreased person accomplishment (8 items). The items fall into one of these three categories and there are three domain scores. Higher values in each domain indicate increased burnout in that respective category.
Scores for each item in the Emotional Exhaustion subscale are summed to obtain an overall score. Overall scores for the Emotional Exhaustion subscale can range between 0-54.</description>

Each item is placed into the respective PTSD symptom category (as defined by the Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5) and scored. Higher scores in each symptom domain indicate increased chance of PTSD diagnosis. The domains are: intrusion (5 items), avoidance (2 items), changes in mood/cognition (7 items), and arousal/ hyperactivity (6 items). 2 items address &quot;distress and interference&quot; and 2 items address &quot;symptom onset and duration.
Scores for each question range from 0 to 3. The 5 items that contribute to the Intrusion score are summed to yield a possible range of PDS Intrusion scores of 0-15, with higher scores indicating greater intrusion.</description>

The domains are: intrusion (5 items), avoidance (2 items), changes in mood/cognition (7 items), and arousal/ hyperactivity (6 items). 2 items address &quot;distress and interference&quot; and 2 items address &quot;symptom onset and duration.
Scores for each question range from 0 to 3. The 5 items that contribute to the Intrusion score are summed to yield a possible range of PDS Intrusion scores of 0-15, with higher scores indicating greater intrusion.</description>

            <title>MBCT Intervention</title>
            <description>The subject will participate in 16 hours that are broken into sessions for the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy intervention. The intervention will be facilitated by 1-2 instructors who are trained in clinical psychology/ social work and are also trained in MBCT. This intervention will include mindfulness activities, didactic learning, homework assignments and group dialogue. This adapted MBCT intervention will follow the empirically-based MBCT intervention for depression structure with fidelity.
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive therapy is a 16 hours intervention. The intervention in this population is designed to reduce symptoms of PTSD and BOS and increase resiliency scores.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in PDS-5 Arousal Scores</title>
          <description>Participants will also complete pre/post-intervention PDS-5 surveys to assess post traumatic symptoms. This survey includes a pre-screen and 24 items. Each item is placed into the respective PTSD symptom category (as defined by the Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5) and scored. Higher scores in each symptom domain indicate increased chance of PTSD diagnosis. The domains are: intrusion (5 items), avoidance (2 items), changes in mood/cognition (7 items), and arousal/ hyperactivity (6 items). 2 items address &quot;distress and interference&quot; and 2 items address &quot;symptom onset and duration.
Scores for each question range from 0 to 3. The 6 items that contribute to the Arousal score are summed to yield a possible range of PDS Arousal scores of 0-18, with higher scores indicating greater arousal.</description>

        <description>Participants will also complete pre and post-intervention HADS surveys to assess changes in depression symptoms. This survey has 14 items that fall into either the anxiety domain (7 items) or the depression domain (7 items). Items are scored 0-3 and scores, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes, and 11+ in each domain indicating abnormal cases.
Scores for the 7 items in the depression domain are summed to yield a possible range of 0-21, with higher scores indicating more depression.</description>
