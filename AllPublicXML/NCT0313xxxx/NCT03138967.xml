  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to determine whether using sugammadex, given with
      a standard muscle relaxation drug during bladder surgeries, improves anesthesia conditions
      and recovery time.

      During some bladder operations, your muscles must be completely relaxed. Muscle relaxation
      drugs cause the muscles to relax, including the respiratory muscles, and as a result
      artificial ventilation is needed to help you breathe. Sugammadex and other standard drugs
      reverse the effect of the muscle relaxation drugs, allowing you to breathe on your own after
      the operation.

      Study Groups:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a
      coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better,
      the same, or worse than the other group:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive sugammadex to reverse the muscle relaxation.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive the standard of care
           (neostigmine/glycopyrrolate) to reverse the muscle relaxation.

      You and the surgeon will not know which group you have been assigned to. However, the
      anesthesiologist and study staff will know.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for up to 1 week after the cystoscopy. If you are unable to have the
      procedure performed, you may be taken off study early.

      This is an investigational study. Sugammadex and neostigmine/glycopyrrolate are all FDA
      approved and commercially available to reverse muscle relaxation. The comparison of these
      drugs is investigational.

      Up to 50 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Procedures:

      Before the cystoscopy, we will collect your basic information and medical history. We will
      take your vital signs and the anesthesiologist will perform routine assessments. This will
      take about 30-60 minutes to complete.

      Before the cystoscopy, you will be given rocuronium to relax your muscles. After the
      procedure, you will receive either sugammadex or the standard of care to reverse the
      relaxation.

      After you are extubated (the tube is removed from your throat), we will assess how fast the
      relaxation drugs the anesthesiologist gave you wear off (stop working), using a small
      monitoring device that will be attached to your wrist. This is the only research test that
      will be done right after surgery.

      If you are still in the hospital 1 day after the cystoscopy, a member of the staff will ask
      you the series of questions. If you have been sent home, you will be called and you will
      complete them by phone.

      Researchers will also collect information about your cystoscopy procedure and recovery from
      your medical record. This collection will continue for up to 1 week after surgery.
