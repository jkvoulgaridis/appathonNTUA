  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is enrolling newly diagnosed breast cancer patients about to start chemotherapy and
      age-matched control participants. The investigator is trying to better understand the
      prevalence of cognitive difficulties in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to
      the general population as well as what biological mechanisms may play a role in the
      development of these difficulties. Patients will be asked to complete six assessments over
      the course of approximately 5 months. Assessments 1,3, 4.5 and 5 include computerized and
      paper and pencil cognitive testing as well as blood draws. Assessments 2 and 4 only involve
      the collection of a blood sample. An optional sub study is offered after Assessment 1. It
      involves a research brain MRI at Assessment 4.5 and cognitive testing and another research
      brain MRI at Assessment 6.
