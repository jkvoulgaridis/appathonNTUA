      This is an observational, non-interventional study that will include two cohorts of patients
      with schizophrenia who initiated maintenance treatment during a schizophrenia-related
      hospitalisation or during the immediate three months after hospital discharge: patients who
      initiated maintenance treatment with AOM and patients who initiated maintenance treatment
      with any daily oral atypical AP.

      This is an observational, non-interventional study that will include two cohorts of patients
      with schizophrenia who initiated maintenance treatment during a schizophrenia-related
      hospitalisation or during the immediate three months after hospital discharge: patients who
      initiated maintenance treatment with AOM and patients who initiated maintenance treatment
      with any daily oral atypical AP.

      The date of maintenance treatment initiation will be considered the index date (see
      definition of maintenance treatment initiation in Section 3.1). Baseline data will be
      collected immediately after the inclusion of the patient in the study (including
      retrospective data from the index date to the date of informed consent and from the past 5
      years). From the index date, each patient will be followed up until discontinuation of the
      maintenance treatment of interest and up to a maximum of 12 months. Especially after the
      implementation of the Global Amendment nº1, it is possible that the complete follow-up of the
      patient took place in the past (retrospective data), i.e. before the inclusion of the subject
      in the study. Data will be collected from the patient file and from information obtained
      during routine visits scheduled according to clinical practice.

        Eligible patients will include adult patients (≥18 years) with recent-onset (≤35 years old)
        schizophrenia who initiated maintenance treatment with AOM or an oral atypical AP during an
        inpatient stay due to an acute schizophrenia episode or during the immediate three months
        after hospital discharge and which treatment was initiated before the study start at the
        site and up to a maximum of 6 months after the launch of AOM in the country. Prescription
        of the maintenance treatment had to be done in the usual manner in accordance with the
        terms of the marketing authorisation.

    <sampling_method>Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients between ≥18 and ≤35 years of age

          2. Diagnosis of schizophrenia confirmed by the current investigator.

          3. Initiation of maintenance treatment with AOM (at least one injection) or with daily
             oral atypical AP before the study start at the site and up to a maximum of 6 months
             after the launch of AOM in the country, during an inpatient stay due to an acute
             schizophrenia episode or during the immediate three months after hospital discharge,
             and prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing
             authorisation.*

             Patients treated in the daycare hospital will be considered:

               -  Eligible to be included, if the patient was admitted in the hospital (full time
                  inpatient stay) for an acute psychotic episode and then discharged to a day care
                  hospital in order to achieve stabilization and initiate maintenance antipsychotic
                  treatment. The initiation of the maintenance antipsychotic treatment (index date)
                  must occur before discharge from day care hospital or during the immediate
                  following three months after discharge.

               -  NOT eligible, if the patient was treated exclusively in the day care hospital
                  since the first day (i.e. not spending any night at all in the hospital) as these
                  patients are very likely to be subacutely psychotic.

                    -  The date of initiation of maintenance therapy will be considered the index
                       date. For AOM, it is the date of the first injection. For the oral AP, this
                       date is defined by the physician when patients are believed to be stable
                       enough to be considered &quot;in maintenance treatment&quot;.

          4. Willingness to participate in the study; subjects must give their written consent to
             participate unless: they have discontinued treatment or have finished the 12 months
             follow up period before study inclusion (retrospective assessment only) and a) written
             consent not required by local regulations, or b) it would take a non-reasonable
             effort† or c) the source patient is deceased or untraceable.

               -  A reasonable effort is defined as 3 contact attempts separated by 3 weeks. All
                  efforts to obtain the informed consent, reasonable or not, shall be registered in
                  the medical history of the patient to be used as documental source.

        If allowable by local regulations/Ethics Committees, provision of oral (e.g., by phone)
        instead of written consent is also possible for patients with retrospective assessment
        only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a psychiatric disorder other than schizophrenia which is established
             as the primary diagnosis

          2. Chronically hospitalized patients (defined as more than 3 months).

          3. Participation in an interventional clinical trial since AOM or daily oral atypical AP
             were initiated as maintenance treatment or within the previous 6 months to this
             initiation.
