  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the vaccination coverage of seniors is clearly deficient. It seems to be a
      cultural specificity, dating back more than 100 years, and which does not exist in
      Scandinavia, nor in much of the Anglo-Saxon world. Only influenza vaccination is a success
      for seniors. The high public health council sets the objective of immunization coverage in
      patients over 65 years of age to 80% whether or not the patient is benefiting from an
      exonerative ALD. The data collections carried out with the various pension funds objective
      have a lower immunization coverage with a rate ranging from 48.8 to 64%. Thus any medical
      consultation should be an opportunity to update the vaccination schedule of adults and the
      elderly.
