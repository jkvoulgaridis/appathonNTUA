  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study consisting of Part A (dose regimen finding) followed by Part B (dose
      expansion). Part A (dose regimen finding) will allow definition of the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) through dose escalation and possible dose interval modification. In Part B (dose
      expansion), potential therapeutic doses may be studied with SC-004 as monotherapy and SC-004
      in combination with ABBV-181 in disease-specific cohorts.

    <description>PFS time is defined as the time from the subject's first dose of study drug (Day 1) to either the subject's disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Under the situation that neither event occurs, the PFS time will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment. Subjects lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose of study treatment will have their event time censored at Day 1.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed advanced malignancy defined as any of the following tumors

               -  Epithelial ovarian cancer, including fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal
                  cancer, of high-grade serous histology, with platinum refractory or resistant
                  disease after prior treatment with at least one platinum-based chemotherapeutic
                  regimen. In Part B (dose expansion), subjects may have received no more than 3
                  lines of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy.

                    -  Note, the line of therapy limit does not apply to the biopsy substudy
                       cohorts.

               -  Metastatic or advanced endometrial carcinoma previously treated with at least 1
                  platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with prior exposure to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine or indolinobenzodiazepine
             based drug.
