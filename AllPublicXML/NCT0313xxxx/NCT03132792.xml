  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first time in human study is intended for men and women between 18 and 75 years of age
      who have advanced liver cancer which has grown or returned after being treated or another AFP
      expressing tumor. Those who did not tolerate or refused other therapies may also participate.
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of genetically changed T cells that target
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with liver
      cancer or other AFP expressing tumor types. This study is for subjects who have a blood test
      positive for appropriate HLA-A*02 P Group and have adequate AFP protein in blood or tumor,
      and whose noncancerous liver tissue has very little AFP protein (Liver only).

      The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the
      blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study
      will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of
      attacking and destroying cancer cells.

      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back
      to the subject through an intravenous infusion after 3 days of chemotherapy. The study will
      evaluate three different cell dose levels in order to find out the target cell dose. Once the
      target cell dose is determined, additional subjects will be enrolled to further test the
      safety and effects at this cell dose.

      Subjects will be hospitalized for at least 1 week after receiving their T cells back and then
      seen frequently by the Study Physician for the next 6 months. After that, subjects will be
      seen every three months. If subjects have disease progression or withdraw from the study,
      they will then be entered into a long-term follow up for safety monitoring. In long-term
      follow up, subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5
      years after the T cell infusion and annually for the next 10 years.
