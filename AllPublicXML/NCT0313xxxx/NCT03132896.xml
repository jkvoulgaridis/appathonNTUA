  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ROSETTA is a multi-centre study evaluating the time course of diaphragm thickness and
      function following exposure to neuromuscular blockade or control in patients with acute
      respiratory distress. ROSETTA is an ancillary study to the Re-evaluation of Systemic Early
      Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial (NCT02509078). It is designed to (1) test the feasibility
      of a multi-center evaluation of the diaphragm structure and function by ultrasound during
      mechanical ventilation and (2) determine whether neuromuscular blockade accelerates atrophy
      and dysfunction of the diaphragm in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that mechanical ventilation injures the
      respiratory muscles, particularly the diaphragm. Due to the deleterious effects of diaphragm
      inactivity on diaphragm function, there are important concerns about the risk of diaphragm
      weakness and difficult liberation from mechanical ventilation following neuromuscular
      blockade. Sonographic measurements of diaphragm thickness provide a potentially useful window
      for studying diaphragm injury and function during mechanical ventilation.

      Patients enrolled in the ROSE trial (randomizing patients with moderate-severe acute
      respiratory distress syndrome to receive neuromuscular blockade or control for 2 days) will
      be eligible for participation in this study. Study patients will undergo regular diaphragm
      ultrasound to assess diaphragm thickness and activity during the first week of the study.
      Diaphragm function will be assessed by ultrasound on study days 7, 14, 21, and 28.

      ROSETTA is designed to:

        1. Test the feasibility of a multi-center evaluation of the diaphragm structure and
           function by ultrasound during mechanical ventilation;

        2. Determine whether neuromuscular blockade accelerates atrophy and dysfunction of the
           diaphragm in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome; and

        3. Evaluate whether patients with greater diaphragm dysfunction exhibit worse functional
           outcomes compared to patients without diaphragm dysfunction.
