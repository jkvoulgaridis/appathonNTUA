  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if light sedation with spinal anesthesia reduces
      the incidence of delirium compared to receiving general anesthesia during spinal surgery in
      older adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative delirium is a common occurrence in older adults. Post -operative delirium has
      been associated with cognitive decline after hospitalization. Developing perioperative
      management strategies to prevent delirium may also reduce potential cognitive decline in
      older adults after surgery. The choice and dose of anesthetic and sedative drugs are known
      risk factors in the development of delirium. Excessive doses of anesthetic and sedation drugs
      during surgery have been associated with poor outcomes that occur after surgery. Currently
      depth of anesthesia can be measured by an additional monitoring technique called Bispectral
      Index (BIS).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if light sedation with spinal anesthesia reduces
      the incidence of delirium compared to receiving general anesthesia during spinal surgery in
      older adults. Previous studies have shown that using light sedation and spinal anesthesia
      during surgery may reduce the incidence of delirium up to 50%.

    <description>In this group patients will receive general anesthesia. Anesthetic induction will occur with propofol (generally 1-2 mg/kg), maintenance with a volatile anesthetic, muscle paralysis with a muscle relaxant, and pain control with fentanyl (generally 2-5 mcg/kg titrated). Patients on baseline opioids may receive additional opioids (such as dilaudid) based on clinical criteria. The anesthetic provider will be blinded to BIS values. Discretionary use of intrathecal morphine may be used.</description>

    <description>In this group patients will receive light sedation with propofol and a spinal anesthetic. Spinal anesthesia will be obtained by injecting approximately 10-15 mg of bupivacaine into the subarachnoid space. Up to 2 mg of midazolam may be given during spinal needle insertion. Although spinal anesthesia is sufficient for surgery, sedation is routinely administered using a propofol infusion, titrated to a BIS&gt;60-70. Discretionary use of intrathecal morphine may be used.</description>
