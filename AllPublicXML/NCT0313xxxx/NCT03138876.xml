  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Altered mental status (AMS) is one of the most common reasons for inpatient neurology
      consultation. Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is frequently on the differential
      diagnosis of the patient with AMS. NCSE becomes more refractory to treatment after one hour
      of seizure activity, making rapid identification and treatment of NCSE of great clinical
      importance. Currently, an electroencephalogram (EEG) technologist must be called in from home
      during non-workday hours in order to obtain a stat EEG. The investigators propose the time
      required for diagnosis of NCSE at Mayo Clinic can be significantly decreased with rapid
      placement of an EEG cap by the onsite neurology residents.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the completion of neurology evaluation, if NCSE is in the differential diagnosis according
      to institution best practice, then consented participants will undergo placement of a large
      size, 20-channel EEG cap from Electro-Cap International with a Natus E-2-2520-26 electrode
      board adapter with initiation of recording. The placement of the EEG cap will be restricted
      to residents formally trained in its placement by an EEG tech. This study will only be
      performed during times when EEG techs are not available onsite for rapid placement of
      standard 21-channel EEG electrodes, such as during night-call shifts.

      Prior to placement of EEG cap, evaluating staff member will request immediate
      standard-electrode EEG. The investigators will record time from neurology consultation
      request to placement of EEG cap as well as time from consultation request to obtaining a
      standard EEG. The investigators will also record time to confirmation or exclusion of NCSE.
      Initial diagnosis or exclusion of NCSE will be performed by on call resident, if the resident
      received prior training regarding EEG cap placement, and attending. Secondary quality
      assessment will be performed by two independent EEG interpreters blinded to clinical history.
      Secondary assessment will be qualified as acceptable or inacceptable interpretation based on
      whether greater or less than 50% of the recording is judged interpretable. Secondary
      assessment will also include interpretation of NCSE by a third independent reader if there is
      disagreement between first two. The number of patients excluded from the study will also be
      recorded, including the reason for exclusion.

    <description>An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test used to find problems related to electrical activity of the brain. An EEG tracks and records brain wave patterns. Small metal discs with thin wires (electrodes) are placed on the scalp, and then send signals to a computer to record the results.</description>
