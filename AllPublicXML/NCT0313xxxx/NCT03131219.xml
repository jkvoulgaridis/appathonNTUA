  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of ALXN1210 to control disease activity in
      children and adolescents with aHUS who have not previously used a complement inhibitor, as
      well as in complement inhibitor experienced adolescent patients.
