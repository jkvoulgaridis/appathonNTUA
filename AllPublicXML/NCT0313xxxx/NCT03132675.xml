    <textblock>
      Keynote 695 will be a Phase 2 study of intratumoral tavokinogene telseplasmid (tavo; pIL-12)
      Electroporation (EP) plus IV Pembrolizumab. Eligible patients will be those with pathological
      diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma who are progressing or have progressed on
      pembrolizumab or nivolumab.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of a screening period, a treatment period (up to 2 years) and a
      long term follow-up.

      Eligible patients will be treated with intratumoral tavo-EP to the accessible lesions on Days
      1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks and with IV pembrolizumab (200mg) on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for
      17 tavo-EP cycles and 33 pembrolizumab cycles (from baseline) of continued treatment
      (approximately 2 years), or until disease progression. As many accessible lesions may be
      treated as deemed feasible by the treating physician assuming the size of each lesion is
      greater than 0.3 cm x 0.3 cm.

      Long-term Follow-up: All subjects will be followed after End of Study (EOS) visit for SAEs
      (through 90 days from last dose of study drug) and long term survival status. EOS visit will
      occur 4 weeks after last study treatment administration.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible for participation in this study, the subject must meet all of the
        following:

          1. Pathologically documented unresectable melanoma, American Joint Committee on Cancer
             (AJCC) version 8, Stage III or IV. Subjects must have histological or cytological
             confirmed diagnosis of unresectable melanoma with progressive locally advanced or
             metastatic disease.

          2. Subjects must be refractory to anti PD 1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (pembrolizumab or
             nivolumab either as monotherapy or in combination with other approved checkpoint
             inhibitors or targeted therapies according to their approved label) and subjects must
             meet all of the following criteria:

               1. Received treatment of FDA-approved anti PD1 mAb (dosed per label of the country
                  providing the clinical site) for at least 12 weeks.

               2. Progressive disease after anti PD1 mAb will be defined according to RECIST v1.1.
                  The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment, no less
                  than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of rapid
                  clinical progression. For cases of rapid clinical progression, patients may be
                  allowed to enroll without a confirmatory scan after discussion with the sponsor.
                  (This determination is made by the Investigator; the Sponsor will collect imaging
                  scans for retrospective analysis. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD
                  documentation will be considered the date of disease progression).

               3. Documented disease progression within 12 weeks of the last dose of anti PD1 mAb.
                  Subjects who were re treated with anti PD1 mAb and subjects who were on
                  maintenance with anti PD1 mAb will be allowed to enter the study as long as there
                  is documented PD within 12 weeks of the last treatment date (with anti PD1 mAb).

          3. Resolution/improvement of anti PD1 mAb related AEs (including immune related AEs;
             irAEs) back to Grade 0 1 and ≤10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent dose) for irAEs for
             at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug:

             d. No history of common toxicity criteria adverse events (CTCAE) Grade 4 irAEs from
             anti PD1 mAb.

             e. No history of CTCAE Grade 3 requiring steroid treatment (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone or
             equivalent dose) for &gt;12 weeks or CTCAE Grade 2 pneumonitis regardless of steroid
             treatment.

             f. Minimum of 4 weeks (washout period) from the last dose of anti PD1 mAb

          4. BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma could have received standard of care targeted
             therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (eg, BRAF/MEK inhibitor, alone or in
             combination) prior to enrolling on this study; however they do not need to have
             progressed on this treatment.

          5. Age ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          6. Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale, collected within 7
             days of initial treatment.

          7. Have measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1, with at least one anatomically distinct
             lesion. Lesion or lesions must meet all the following baseline criteria:

             g. Accessible for electroporation; h. Must be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded Note: Tumor
             lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if
             progression has been demonstrated in such lesions

          8. Demonstrate adequate organ function. All screening laboratories should be performed
             within 10 days of treatment initiation.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first study drug administration. If the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required.

         10. For women of childbearing potential, must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception from 30 days prior to the first study drug administration and 120 days
             following last day study drug administration (either tavo or pembrolizumab).
             Acceptable methods include hormonal contraception (oral contraceptives - as long as on
             stable dose, patch, implant, and injection), intrauterine devices, or double barrier
             methods (e.g. vaginal diaphragm/ vaginal sponge plus condom, or condom plus
             spermicidal jelly), sexual abstinence or a vasectomized partner. Women may be
             surgically sterile or at least 1 year post last menstrual period.

         11. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use adequate method of
             contraception during the study and at least 120 days following the last day of study
             drug administration.

         12. Able and willing to provide written informed consent and to follow study instructions.
