  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adequate nutritional support after a cardiac surgery enhances the morbidity and mortality.

      After a cardiac surgery, the energy expenditure is estimated to be around 55 kcal/kg/d. The
      caloric intake is not the only important nutritional variable in PICU. The protein intake
      objective is around 1,5g/kg/d in order to reduce muscular catabolism.

      The aim of this study is to compare the impact of an isocaloric enteral diet, either
      fortified by milk concentration (in order to increase the protein intake) or by a supplement
      of maltodextrin and oil in children from 0 to 2 years, after surgery for congenital heart
      disease.
