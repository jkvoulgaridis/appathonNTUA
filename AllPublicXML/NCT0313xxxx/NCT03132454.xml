    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of palbociclib when given alone and
      in combination with sorafenib, decitabine, or dexamethasone in treating patients with
      leukemia that has come back (recurrent) or that does not respond to previous treatment
      (refractory). Palbociclib, sorafenib, and decitabine may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      palbociclib alone and in combination with sorafenib, decitabine, or dexamethasone may work
      better in treating patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      various combinations with palbociclib in patients with relapsed and refractory leukemias.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pharmacodynamic effects of palbociclib on the Cyclin-CDK-Rb axis in leukemic
      blasts of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) leukemias.

      II. To explore the efficacy (complete response [CR], complete remission without platelet
      recovery [CRp], complete remission without blood count recovery [CRi], partial response [PR],
      or clinical benefit [CB]) of palbociclib as a single-agent and in combinations in patients
      with R/R leukemias.

      III. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance in patients with R/R leukemias treated
      with palbociclib.

      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of one cycle of single-agent palbociclib in
      patients with R/R leukemias.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sorafenib, decitabine, and dexamethasone.
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients also
      receive sorafenib PO QD on days 1-28 beginning on cycle 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive palbociclib as in Arm I. Beginning cycle 2, patients receive
      palbociclib PO QC on days 1-7 and decitabine intravenously (IV) QD over 1 hour on days 8-17
      of cycle 2 and days 8-12 of cycles 3-8. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive palbociclib as in Arm I. Patients also receive dexamethasone PO QD
      or IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-4 and 15-18 beginning on cycle 2. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 3 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN) or =&lt; 5 x ULN if related to leukemic involvement

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  Known cardiac ejection fraction of &gt; or = 45% within the past 3 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2

          -  A negative urine pregnancy test is required within 1 week for all women of

          -  Patient must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and signed
             informed consent. A signed informed consent by the patient or his legally authorized
             representative is required prior to their enrollment on the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agent used in this study has
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA]
             class III or IV), unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Patient with documented hypersensitivity to any of the components of the therapy
             program

          -  Patients with active, uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) leukemia will not be
             eligible

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential who do not practice contraception. Women of
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use contraception prior to study entry

          -  Patients with known history of serous retinopathy will not be eligible

          -  Prior treatment with palbociclib
