  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the safety and tolerability, and to assess the preliminary clinical
      benefit of NKTR-214 when combined with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®).

      The study is comprised of two groups; dose optimization and dose expansion cohorts.

      Dose Optimization will include first-line and second-line melanoma, non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) regardless of PD-L1 expression status. This cohort will
      include patients enrolled in a 3 + 3 dose escalation and intra-patient step-up dose schemas.

      The dose expansion cohort will include first-line NSCLC patients regardless of PD-L1
      expression status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NKTR-214 is a cytokine (investigational agent) that is designed to target CD122, a protein
      which is found on certain immune cells (known as CD8+ T Cells and Natural Killer Cells) to
      expand these cells to promote their anti-tumor effects. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death
      receptor -1 (PD-1) blocking, fully humanized, engineered monoclonal antibody of IgG1 isotype
      that promotes anti-tumor effects.

      The study will evaluate the clinical benefit, safety and tolerability of combining NKTR-214
      with pembrolizumab and will enroll approximately 100 new patients.

      Dose Optimization: will evaluate an every three-week dose regimen (q3w) of NKTR-214 in
      combination with pembrolizumab in approximately 40 patients given that the optimal dose and
      dosing schedule of NKTR-214 in combination with pembrolizumab remains unknown. The previously
      established recommended Phase 2 dose (0.006 mg/kg) of NKTR-214 was studied in combination
      with nivolumab. Tumors to be studied include first-line and second-line melanoma, non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NKTR-214 will be administered at a starting dose
      of 0.008 mg/kg q3w. Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg q3w. Patients will
      undergo a fixed 3+3 dose escalation followed by intra-patient step-up dose escalation at a
      dose determined by the safety review committee after reviewing the data in the fixed 3+3 dose
      escalation.

      Dose Expansion: NKTR-214 in combination with pembrolizumab in approximately 58 patients will
      be evaluated in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The NKTR-214 dose to be
      studied is 0.006 mg/kg q3w. This dose is based on the recommended phase 2 dose noted in the
      monotherapy trial with NKTR-214 (Study 15-214-01, NCT02869295) and an ongoing combination
      trial (16-214-02, NCT02983045). Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200mg q3w.
      Following data review for safety and efficacy, additional patients may be dosed using the
      findings from the dose optimization cohorts.
