  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to evaluate whether the study drug, LIK066, causes glucose
      excretion in urine in patients with varying degrees of decreased kidney function and in
      subjects with normal kidney function. Blood samples were collected to measure the
      concentrations of LIK066 and to study the pharmacokinetics of LIK066. Pharmacokinetics is
      meant to study how LIK066 is absorbed, distributed and eliminated, in other words what the
      body does to the drug. The results of this study may be used to help determine whether LIK066
      can be used to treat people with reduced kidney function and the proper dosing regimen.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 24-hour Urinary Glucose Excretion (UGE) on Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline , Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Urine was collected over 24 h to measure Urinary Glucose Excretion (UGE) at baseline (Day -1), following a single dose (Day 1) and at the end of the 7-day treatment (Day 7) to assess the effect of a 7 day treatment with LIK066 in subjects with decreased renal function compared to those with normal renal function.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for LIK066</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 7 (0 hour predose and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 12.0 hours post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS). The method will have an LLOQ of at least 5 ng/mL for LIK066. Concentrations were expressed in mass per volume units and refered to LIK066 plasma concentrations.
Cmax was determined using the actual recorded sampling times and non-compartmental method(s) to assess the effect of a 7 day treatment with LIK066 in subjects with decreased renal function compared to those with normal renal function. Only descriptive analysis done.</description>

    <description>Plasma PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS). The method will have an LLOQ of at least 5 ng/mL for LIK066. Concentrations were expressed in mass per volume units and refered to LIK066 plasma concentrations.

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the End of the Dosing Interval Tau (AUCtau) for LIK066</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 7 (0 hour predose and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 12.0 hours post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS). The method will have an LLOQ of at least 5 ng/mL for LIK066. Concentrations were expressed in mass per volume units and refered to LIK066 plasma concentrations.
AUCtau was determined using the actual recorded sampling times and non-compartmental method(s) to assess the effect of a 7 day treatment with LIK066 in subjects with decreased renal function compared to those with normal renal function. Only descriptive analysis done.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) for LIK066 on Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 (0 hour predose and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 12.0 hours post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS). The method will have an LLOQ of at least 5 ng/mL for LIK066. Concentrations were expressed in mass per volume units and refered to LIK066 plasma concentrations.
AUClast was determined using the actual recorded sampling times and non-compartmental method(s) to assess the effect of a 7 day treatment with LIK066 in subjects with decreased renal function compared to those with normal renal function. AUClast is similar to AUCtau on Day 1 since the Tlast for Day 1 = 24hrs (tau = 24hrs); therefore AUClast is not reported for Day1, it is however reported for Day 7 since the Tlast is different from 24 hours. Only descriptive analysis done.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUCinf) for LIK066 on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (0 hour predose and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 12.0 hours post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS). The method will have an LLOQ of at least 5 ng/mL for LIK066. Concentrations were expressed in mass per volume units and refered to LIK066 plasma concentrations.
AUCinf was determined using the actual recorded sampling times and non-compartmental method(s) to assess the effect of a 7 day treatment with LIK066 in subjects with decreased renal function compared to those with normal renal function. AUCinf is a single dose parameter and therefore is presented on Day 1 only, after the first dose of LIK066. Only descriptive analysis done.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Terminal Elimination Half-life (T1/2) for LIK066 on Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 (0 hour predose and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 12.0 hours post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS). The method will have an LLOQ of at least 5 ng/mL for LIK066. Concentrations were expressed in mass per volume units and refered to LIK066 plasma concentrations.
T1/2 was determined using the actual recorded sampling times and non-compartmental method(s) to assess the effect of a 7 day treatment with LIK066 in subjects with decreased renal function compared to those with normal renal function. T1/2 is only reported at Day 7 only, since there was sampling out to ~5 half-lives after the Day 7 dose of LIK066. Only descriptive analysis done.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Systemic (or Total Body) Clearance From Plasma Following Extravascular Administration (CL/F) for LIK066 on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (0 hour predose and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 12.0 hours post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS). The method will have an LLOQ of at least 5 ng/mL for LIK066. Concentrations were expressed in mass per volume units and refered to LIK066 plasma concentrations.
CL/F was determined using the actual recorded sampling times and non-compartmental method(s) to assess the effect of a 7 day treatment with LIK066 in subjects with decreased renal function compared to those with normal renal function. Since Day 7 represented steady state of LIK066 in the study, the appropriately calculated steady-state clearance parameter computed was CLss/F and was presented. Only descriptive analysis done.</description>

    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution During the Terminal Elimination Phase Following Extravascular Administration (Vz/F) for LIK066 on Day 1</measure>

    <description>Urine PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS).

        <title>Apparent Systemic (or Total Body) Clearance From Plasma Following Extravascular Administration (CL/F) for LIK066 on Day 1</title>
        <description>Plasma PK samples were collected at Day 1 and Day 7 and assayed for LIK066 concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC MS/MS). The method will have an LLOQ of at least 5 ng/mL for LIK066. Concentrations were expressed in mass per volume units and refered to LIK066 plasma concentrations.
CL/F was determined using the actual recorded sampling times and non-compartmental method(s) to assess the effect of a 7 day treatment with LIK066 in subjects with decreased renal function compared to those with normal renal function. Since Day 7 represented steady state of LIK066 in the study, the appropriately calculated steady-state clearance parameter computed was CLss/F and was presented. Only descriptive analysis done.</description>
