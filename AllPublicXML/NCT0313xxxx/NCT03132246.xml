      A prospective trial conducted at Shock Trauma of patients between 18 years of age and older
      who have sustained a fracture with metal implanted. The investigators will be collecting
      between 1-3 routine blood draws for the purpose of laboratory analysis to assess biofilm
      growth. Patients may be infected or non-infected at the time of blood draw; they will be
      selected at random for purposes of this study. All patients will be followed as standard of
      care by their treating physician for all their follow up visits.

    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection in the orthopaedic surgery population is a significant public health
      issue. Wound infections result in both increased length of hospital stay and total cost of
      care.

      Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common preventable adverse outcome after a major
      operation. The economic costs to the US healthcare system are enormous estimated to be in
      excess of $1.8 billion per year. For patients who develop an SSI, the cost may be even higher
      with length of stay and risk of death doubled. Thus the benefits of any intervention
      decreasing the risk of SSI are very tangible.

      A biofilm is a layer of bacteria that adheres to a surface; in Orthopaedics, this often means
      adherence to implanted metal after fracture surgery. The test that has been designed by one
      of the investigators on the study has been shown in an animal model to detect the formation
      of a biofilm up to 1 month prior to clinical detection. Having a blood assay such as this
      would allow earlier antibiotics and potentially prevent the need for further surgeries to
      remove metal implants and clean out the biofilm.

    <description>Trauma patients that were considered at risk for infection after fracture fixation. Inclusion criteria included open fractures, proximal tibia fractures, pilon fractures, and calcaneus fractures treated with surgical fixation. Each patient enrolled in the study provided 1-3 blood samples. These blood samples were tested using basic science techniques to determine the level of exposure to a staphylococcal biofilm each patient has experienced over a period of time.
The only intervention patients experience are non-standard of care blood draws. The blood is then tested in a basic science laboratory.
Patients were enrolled if presented as high risk but later separated into the Infected Group or the Not Infected Group based on whether or not they went on to develop an infection post surgery. All patients in this group went on to develop an infection.</description>

        <population>One to three blood sample tests were taken for each participant prior to the one-year post-operative clinical follow-up. Clinical cultures will also be monitored for the one-year post-operative period and compared to the blood sample test results to determine if the test is able to identify patients with positive staphylococcal infection cultures.</population>

Inclusion criteria included open fractures, proximal tibia fractures, pilon fractures, and calcaneus fractures treated with surgical fixation.

These blood samples are to be tested using basic science techniques to determine the level of exposure to a staphylococcal biofilm each patient has experienced over a period of time.
Blood draw: The only intervention patients experience is a non-standard of care blood draw. The blood is then tested in a basic science laboratory.</description>

Inclusion criteria included open fractures, proximal tibia fractures, pilon fractures, and calcaneus fractures treated with surgical fixation. Each patient enrolled in the study provided 1-3 blood samples. These blood samples were tested using basic science techniques to determine the level of exposure to a staphylococcal biofilm each patient has experienced over a period of time.
The only intervention patients experience are non-standard of care blood draws. The blood is then tested in a basic science laboratory.
Patients were enrolled if presented as high risk but later separated into the Infected Group or the Not Infected Group based on whether or not they went on to develop an infection post surgery. Group assignment is unknown for patients that did not complete the study and therefore this group is representative of those patients that were enrolled but did not complete the study.</description>
