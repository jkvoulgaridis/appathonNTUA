      (glucagon-only bionic pancreas) in subjects that have undergone post-bariatric surgery that
      are experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia.

    <masking_description>Glucagon and placebo were blinded by the research pharmacy. Subjects were given bags of blinded medication labeled with which day they were to be used, and then were asked to label the bags with which day the medication was actually used. The contents of the bags were verified with the research pharmacy's blinding key upon completion of the study.</masking_description>

    <measure>Area Over the Curve and &lt;60 mg/dl (CGM) Measured in mg/dl *Min</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The measure for area over the curve is used when an integrated assessment (e.g., a measurement of something over a specific amount of time) is more useful in understanding a phenomenon. To calculate this measure, a method of approximation is often used. One way would be to estimate the curve via curve-fitting techniques. For this outcome, using area over the curve and &lt;60mg/dl provides a more robust method of calculating amount of hypoglycemia (by including more severe degrees of hypoglycemia in the product of mg/dl*min as opposed to percentage of time below 60mg/dl.</description>

    <description>MARD is computed using the difference between the CGM readings and the values measured at the same time by the reference measurement system. The mean (or average) of all the absolute relative deviations produces the MARD. In this study, the reference measurement system was the StatStrip Xpress meter, to which the CGM values were compared.</description>

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. We used a simple VAS is a straight horizontal line of fixed length measuring 0-100mm with subscale markings every 10mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (nausea) orientated from the left (least severity or 0) to the right (most severity or 100mm). Subjects can mark their response anywhere from 0 to 100mm. The mean severity of nausea for the group in each arm was calculated by averaging all responses in either arm.</description>

        <title>Area Over the Curve and &lt;60 mg/dl (CGM) Measured in mg/dl *Min</title>
        <description>The measure for area over the curve is used when an integrated assessment (e.g., a measurement of something over a specific amount of time) is more useful in understanding a phenomenon. To calculate this measure, a method of approximation is often used. One way would be to estimate the curve via curve-fitting techniques. For this outcome, using area over the curve and &lt;60mg/dl provides a more robust method of calculating amount of hypoglycemia (by including more severe degrees of hypoglycemia in the product of mg/dl*min as opposed to percentage of time below 60mg/dl.</description>

        <description>MARD is computed using the difference between the CGM readings and the values measured at the same time by the reference measurement system. The mean (or average) of all the absolute relative deviations produces the MARD. In this study, the reference measurement system was the StatStrip Xpress meter, to which the CGM values were compared.</description>

        <title>Severity of Nausea on Daily E-mail Survey</title>
        <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. We used a simple VAS is a straight horizontal line of fixed length measuring 0-100mm with subscale markings every 10mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (nausea) orientated from the left (least severity or 0) to the right (most severity or 100mm). Subjects can mark their response anywhere from 0 to 100mm. The mean severity of nausea for the group in each arm was calculated by averaging all responses in either arm.</description>
