  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is conducted in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The aim of the study
      is to compare the effect of liraglutide 1.8 mg/day versus placebo as add-on to an SGLT2
      inhibitor with or without metformin on glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

    <measure>Change in HbA1c</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 26 in glycosylated haemoglobin was evaluated for 2 different observation period 'in-trial' observation period and 'on-treatment without rescue medication&quot; observation period. The 'in-trial' observation period represents the time-period where subjects were considered to be in the trial, regardless of whether or not the subjects had initiated rescue medication or prematurely discontinued trial product. The 'on-treatment' observation period is the part of the in-trial observation period during which subjects were treated with the trial product, that is the time from the first dose to the last dose of trial product. The 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period is a part of 'on-treatment' observation period during which subjects were considered treated with trial product and had not initiated any rescue medications.</description>

          <description>Eligible subjects were given liraglutide subcutaneously (s.c.), once daily (OD) for 26 weeks. Subjects received 0.6 mg dose of liraglutide in week 1, dose was escalated to 1.2 mg in week 2 and 1.8 mg in week 3. Subjects remained on the stable dose of 1.8 mg liraglutide from week 3 to 26. Subjects continued their pre-trial SGLT2 inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with metformin at stable pre-trial dose. Any one of three SGLT2 inhibitors were allowed as pre-trial therapy: Invokana®, Farxiga®/Forxiga® and Jardiance®. Stable pre-trial treatment with metformin was defined as ≥1500 mg/day or at the maximum tolerated dose. Any fixed dose combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin was also allowed in this trial as background medication.
A follow-up visit was scheduled one week after the end of treatment.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 26 in glycosylated haemoglobin was evaluated for 2 different observation period 'in-trial' observation period and 'on-treatment without rescue medication&quot; observation period. The 'in-trial' observation period represents the time-period where subjects were considered to be in the trial, regardless of whether or not the subjects had initiated rescue medication or prematurely discontinued trial product. The 'on-treatment' observation period is the part of the in-trial observation period during which subjects were treated with the trial product, that is the time from the first dose to the last dose of trial product. The 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period is a part of 'on-treatment' observation period during which subjects were considered treated with trial product and had not initiated any rescue medications.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were given liraglutide subcutaneously (s.c.), once daily (OD) for 26 weeks. Subjects received 0.6 mg dose of liraglutide in week 1, dose was escalated to 1.2 mg in week 2 and 1.8 mg in week 3. Subjects remained on the stable dose of 1.8 mg liraglutide from week 3 to 26. Subjects continued their pre-trial SGLT2 inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with metformin at stable pre-trial dose. Any one of three SGLT2 inhibitors were allowed as pre-trial therapy: Invokana®, Farxiga®/Forxiga® and Jardiance®. Stable pre-trial treatment with metformin was defined as ≥1500 mg/day or at the maximum tolerated dose. Any fixed dose combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin was also allowed in this trial as background medication.
A follow-up visit was scheduled one week after the end of treatment.</description>

          <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 26 in glycosylated haemoglobin was evaluated for 2 different observation period 'in-trial' observation period and 'on-treatment without rescue medication&quot; observation period. The 'in-trial' observation period represents the time-period where subjects were considered to be in the trial, regardless of whether or not the subjects had initiated rescue medication or prematurely discontinued trial product. The 'on-treatment' observation period is the part of the in-trial observation period during which subjects were treated with the trial product, that is the time from the first dose to the last dose of trial product. The 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period is a part of 'on-treatment' observation period during which subjects were considered treated with trial product and had not initiated any rescue medications.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were given liraglutide subcutaneously (s.c.), once daily (OD) for 26 weeks. Subjects received 0.6 mg dose of liraglutide in week 1, dose was escalated to 1.2 mg in week 2 and 1.8 mg in week 3. Subjects remained on the stable dose of 1.8 mg liraglutide from week 3 to 26.

Any one of three SGLT2 inhibitors were allowed as pre-trial therapy: Invokana®, Farxiga®/Forxiga® and Jardiance®. Stable pre-trial treatment with metformin was defined as ≥1500 mg/day or at the maximum tolerated dose. Any fixed dose combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin was also allowed in this trial as background medication.

Subjects received 0.6 mg dose of liraglutide in week 1, dose was escalated to 1.2 mg in week 2 and 1.8 mg in week 3. Subjects remained on the stable dose of 1.8 mg liraglutide from week 3 to 26. Subjects continued their pre-trial SGLT2 inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with metformin at stable pre-trial dose. Any one of three SGLT2 inhibitors were allowed as pre-trial therapy: Invokana®, Farxiga®/Forxiga® and Jardiance®. Stable pre-trial treatment with metformin was defined as ≥1500 mg/day or at the maximum tolerated dose. Any fixed dose combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin was also allowed in this trial as background medication.
A follow-up visit was scheduled one week after the end of treatment.</description>

Subjects received 0.6 mg dose of liraglutide in week 1, dose was escalated to 1.2 mg in week 2 and 1.8 mg in week 3. Subjects remained on the stable dose of 1.8 mg liraglutide from week 3 to 26.

Any one of three SGLT2 inhibitors were allowed as pre-trial therapy: Invokana®, Farxiga®/Forxiga® and Jardiance®. Stable pre-trial treatment with metformin was defined as ≥1500 mg/day or at the maximum tolerated dose. Any fixed dose combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin was also allowed in this trial as background medication.
