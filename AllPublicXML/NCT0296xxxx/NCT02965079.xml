  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will aim to conduct an observational study in order to assess very thoroughly
      all patients implanted by Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) in 10 critical care
      units of Paris and its surburb (APHP, Assistance Publique des hôpitaux de Paris).

      Secondary objectives will be:

        1. to assess efficacy and safety of ECCO2R,

        2. to compare the data issue from the registry to others studies assessing the same
           population and to other centers and

        3. to compare the different ECCOR devices in terms of efficacy and adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry will be conducted prospectively during 2 years in 10 ICUs of l'APHP on behalf on
      the CEDIT. The 10 centers are : (1) ICU of l'hôpital europeén Georges Pompidou, (2) ICU of
      l'Hôpital Louis Mourier, (3) ICU of l'Hôpital de Bicêtre, (4) ICU of GHPS, (5) Respiratory
      ICU of GHPS, (6) ICU of l'Hôpital Lariboisière (7) ICU of l'Hôpital Cochin (8) ICU of
      l'Hôpital Saint-Antoine (9)ICU of l'Hôpital Henri Mondor and (10) ICU of l'Hôpital Tenon.

      The primary outcome will be the number of patients implanted by ECCO2R monthly in each center
      during the 2 years period study.

      Secondary outcomes will be ICU-mortality, invasive ventilation duration, non invasive
      ventilation duration, ICU duration, modalities of ventilation at the ICU discharge,
      hemorragic complications due to the ECCOR device, thrombotic complications due to ECCO2R
      device, intravascular hemolysis due to ECCO2R device, duration of ECCO2R, adjunct therapy to
      ECCO2R and reasons of ECCO2R discontinuation.

    <description>The ECCO2R system was developed from the principle of ECMO systems by underscoring the importance of carbon dioxide elimination rather than direct improvement of oxygenation in some patients. The circuit of the ECCO2R system can be set up in venovenous (VV) or arteriovenous (AV). For VV setup, a low flow pump is used to maintain a low extracorporeal flow rate using only 20-30 % of cardiac output. The ECCO2R system does not provide complete pulmonary function as it can achieve only limited oxygenation but provides predominantly carbon dioxide removal. As neither VV nor AV circuit allows full cardiopulmonary bypass, the system provides respiratory function but no cardiac support</description>
