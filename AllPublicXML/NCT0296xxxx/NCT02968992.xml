  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) which is
      a partially iron saturated form of lactoferrin produced and purified from rice grain may
      improve mobility and memory in older adults with chronic inflammation. Lactoferrin, is a
      known multifunctional protein, and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. A
      recombinant human version of this protein was recently developed and produced from rice. This
      is now available from the Ventria Bioscience Company in a controlled, pharmaceutical grade
      capsule. As part of this double blinded and randomized study, participants will take daily
      dosages of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) or its matched placebo; to measure the
      effects of rhlactoferrin on chronic inflammation and its association with improving mobility
      and memory over a 6 month time period. During the study all participants will be asked to
      provide blood samples and will have physical and cognitive tests administered to them. By
      measuring biomarkers in the blood as well as changes in physical and cognitive measures, the
      investigators will gain an understanding of how rhlactoferrin may safely improve measures of
      chronic inflammation in older adults. As well as a better understanding of whether it has the
      potential to meaningfully influence important measures of physical and cognitive function
      known to be influenced by Chronic Inflammation (CI).

      The primary objective of this study is to examine in a double blinded and randomized trial
      the efficacy of Recombinant Human lactoferrin (rhLF) in reducing chronic inflammation as
      measured by IL-6 and sTNFR1 in the bloodstream. The primary end point is to gather
      information about the tolerability of and adherence to oral rhlactoferrin (rhLF) among older
      adults with CI over a six-month period. The exploratory objective is to assess the efficacy
      of rhlactoferrin (rhLF) in attenuating cognitive decline as measured by the Digit Symbol
      Substitution Test and Trail Making Test, as well as improving physical mobility as measured
      by performance on 4 meter and six-minute walk tests. Further physical and functional
      measurement data will be gather using an Acti-graph link Activity monitor, the raw data
      collected will be used to : (i) characterize cumulative daily activity, (ii) assess daily
      circadian patterns of activity, (iii) assess physical activity variability, (iv) model
      patterns of daily activity, and (iv) estimate walking speed. This additional data will
      complement mobility measures by describing function enacted in daily life

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of rhlactoferrin on serum levels (picogram/milliliter) of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) will be assessed as a measure of the percentage change of IL-6 serum levels from baseline</description>

    <measure>Attenuating Cognitive Decline as Measured by the Digital Symbol Substitution Test</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test taker is given a key consisting of numbers 1-9 that are paired with a unique symbol. The test taker is allowed 90 seconds to assign the correct symbol to the number on the list. The test administrator then scores the number of correct answers over the 90 second test time, and assigns a total score based on one point for each correct answer and therefore a higher score is a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Attenuating Cognitive Decline as Measured by the Trail Making Test A and B.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For test A, the test taker is given a sheet of paper that has the numbers 1-25 within individual circles randomly distributed on the page. The test taker is asked to connect the numbers sequentially over a period of 4 minutes (240 seconds). The score is recorded as the time it takes to complete the task in seconds. For test B, the test taker is given a piece of paper that has numbers 1-13 and letters A-L. Each letter or number is inside of a circle. The test taker must then draw a line from one circled number to the next circled letter (ie. 1 to A to 2 to B to 3 to C etc.) over a period of 6 minutes (360 seconds). The time it takes to complete this task is recorded in seconds.</description>

    <measure>Physical Mobility as Measured by 4 Meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A standard measurement of 4 meters is marked on a flat, long floor surface. The test taker is asked to walk the length at their usual pace while the test giver is recording the time with a stop watch. This test is repeated twice, and the average of the two recorded times is used as the data point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Mobility as Measured by 6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A measured course is set up in an open area on a hard flat surface. The test taker walks on this measured course for 6 minutes, and the test administrators calculates the distance traveled over 6 minutes. The test taker is allowed to rest as is needed.</description>

          <description>A standard measurement of 4 meters is marked on a flat, long floor surface. The test taker is asked to walk the length at their usual pace while the test giver is recording the time with a stop watch. This test is repeated twice, and the average of the two recorded times is used as the data point.</description>

          <title>Log Total Activity Count</title>
          <description>Log total activity count was determined using the Acti-Graph® Link Activity monitor which generates a comprehensive assessment of daily free-living activity. Participants wore the monitor for 7 days. Activity counts are proprietary units generated by the Actigraph company software, Actilife. Counts are unitless quantities of physical activity compiled into one-minute intervals across three planes of movement. The vector magnitude of the sum of square of these counts generate the total activity per minute, per hour and per day.</description>

          <title>Attenuating cognitive decline as measured by the trail making test A and B</title>
          <description>For test A, the individual is given a sheet of paper that has the numbers 1-25 within individual circles randomly distributed. The individual is asked to connect the numbers sequentially. The score is recorded as the time it takes to complete the task in seconds. For test B, the individual is given a piece of paper that has numbers 1-13 and letters A-L. Each letter or number is inside of a circle. The test taker is instructed to draw a line from one number to the next letter (ie. 1 to A to 2 to B etc.). The score is the seconds it takes to complete the task.</description>
          <population>A total of 36 participants entered the study. One participant in the placebo group later dropped out and therefore was not included in the analysis of test A and test B data. One additional participant in the placebo group was unable to complete Trail Making Test B, so they were not included in the analysis.</population>
