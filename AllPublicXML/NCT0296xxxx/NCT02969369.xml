      A study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEP363856 in subjects with Parkinson's
      Disease Psychosis This study is accepting male and female participants 55 years of age and
      older who have been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. This study will be conducted in 24
      study centers in the United States. The study will last approximately 21 weeks

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of double-blind SEP-363856 flexibly dosed at 25, 50, or 75
      mg/day for 6 weeks followed by 12 weeks of open-label extension of SEP-363856 flexibly-dosed
      at 25, 50, or 75 mg/day in male and female subjects ≥ 55 years of age with a clinical
      diagnosis of PDP. The study will randomize approximately 36 subjects to 2 treatment groups in
      a 2:1 ratio (approximately 24 subjects to SEP-363856 and 12 to placebo). The study will
      consist of 4 periods: Screening/Washout Period (up to 14 days prior to Double-blind
      Treatment), Double-blind Treatment Period (6 weeks), Open-label SEP-363856 Treatment Period
      (12 weeks), and Follow-up Period (1 week after last dose) as shown in the following figure.
      All postBaseline clinic visits will have a window of ± 2 days relative to the date of the
      Baseline visit (Visit 3).

      Treatment with SEP-363856 in subjects with PDP will result in a significant reduction in the
      Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms - Parkinson's Disease (SAPS-PD) total score at Week
      6 when compared to placebo. Let μSEP and μPBO represent the mean changes from Baseline at
      Week 6 in SAPS-PD total score for the SEP-363856 and placebo arms, respectively. The
      following hypothesis will be tested to compare the mean change values between the SEP-363856
      group and placebo group at Week 6: H0: μSEP = μPBO versus H1: μSEP ≠ μPBO

    <measure>Change from Double Blind (DB) Baseline in total Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms - Parkinson's Disease ( SAPS-PD) Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0-week 6</time_frame>
    <description>There are seven items assessing individual symptoms (four items for hallucinations and three items for delusions), a global hallucinations item and a global delusions item. Separate items are rated from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). Total score will be equal to the sum of the seven items plus the global hallucinations, plus the global delusions. Therefore a total possible score on the SAPS-PD ranges from 0 to 45.
Higher values represent a worse outcome: 0 (absent) to 5 (severe).
Ttotal score will be equal to the sum of the seven items plus the global hallucinations, plus the global delusions.</description>

    <measure>Change from from Double Blind (DB) Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI S) at Week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0-week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S score is a single value, clinician-rated assessment of illness severity and ranges from 1= 'Normal, not at all ill' to 7= 'Among the most extremely ill patients'. A higher score is associated with greater illness severity.</description>

    <measure>Change from from Double Blind (DB) Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0-week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a 12-item behavior rating scale composed of a structured interview of the caregiver, which assess psychiatric disturbance. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. NPI score is obtained by summing all the 12 sub-domain scores.</description>

    <measure>Change from Double-blind (DB) Baseline in Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0-Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for Cognition is a brief instrument, used to assess cognitive function, consisting of 11 tests including orientation, memory (recent and immediate), concentration, language, and praxis. Scores range from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. MMSE, the total score will also be summing scores of all 11 tests.</description>
