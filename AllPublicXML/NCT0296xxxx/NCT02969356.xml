    <measure>Percentage of Responder Participants at Week 6 After the Second Injection, According to Composite Active Range of Motion (AROM) in the Primary TT Limb</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 6, Cycle 2</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of responder participants according to AROM was measured by goniometer in the primary TT limb, using zero as the theoretical position of minimal stretch for the muscle assessed. Participants were asked to perform the active movement as far as possible against that muscle and the angle was measured. A participant was considered a responder if he/she achieved at least the predefined improvement threshold - larger or equal to 35 degrees in UL or 5 degrees in LL - in the primary TT limb (based on the composite AROM individual change from baseline to Week 6 after the second injection).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in AROM Against 10 Prespecified Muscle Groups at Week 6 and Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle, Reinjection Cycle Visit and Last Study Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 and Week 12 of each treatment cycle, reinjection cycle visit and last study visit</time_frame>
    <description>The AROM was measured by goniometer in the primary TT limb, using zero as the theoretical position of minimal stretch for the muscle assessed. Participants were asked to perform the active movement as far as possible against that muscle and the angle was measured. The angle of joint movement was measured in 10 prespecified muscle groups (injected or noninjected); UL: shoulder extensors (SE), elbow flexors (EF), wrist flexors (WF), extrinsic finger flexors (FF) and pronator teres (PT), LL: soleus (Sol), gastrocnemius (GN), gluteus maximus (GM), hamstrings (HS) and rectus femoris (RF). The reinjection cycle visit corresponds to Week 12, 16 or 20 of injection Cycle 1. The last study visit corresponds to the last post-baseline visit performed by the participant (including the early withdrawal visit).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Full Composite AROM Against 5 UL or 5 LL Muscle Groups, Regardless of Whether the Muscle Groups Were Injected or Not at Week 6 and Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle, Reinjection Cycle Visit and Last Study Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 and Week 12 of each treatment cycle, reinjection cycle visit and last study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Full composite AROM, regardless of whether the muscle groups was injected or not was measured by goniometer in the primary TT limb. Full Composite AROM in the UL was calculated as the sum of the AROM in the 5 UL muscle groups (SE+EF+WF+FF+PT). Full Composite AROM in the LL was calculated as the sum of the AROM in the 5 LL muscle groups (Sol+GN+GM+HS+RF).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Modified Frenchay Scale (MFS) Overall Score Evaluated Locally and Centrally at Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle and Last Study Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 of each treatment cycle and last study visit</time_frame>
    <description>The MFS was used to measure active function in the UL. The MFS consists of 10 tasks, each of which was evaluated locally by the site investigator and centrally by a blinded central reviewer at the coordinating investigators' site, on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from &quot;No movement&quot; to &quot;Normal&quot;. Higher score indicates a better outcome. The MFS overall scores were obtained by averaging all individual task scores, provided that at least 8 out of the 10 were not missing. The mean change from baseline was calculated for the local and central assessments and a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in active function.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Maximal Walking Speed Barefoot at Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle and at Last Study Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 of each treatment cycle and last study visit</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-meter walking speed test (WST) was used to measure active function in the LL. The participant performed the WST barefoot without a walking aid. If it was absolutely necessary that the participant used a cane, this may have been permitted provided that the same cane was used at baseline and all other walking speed assessments for that participant. The participant was given instructions to walk at his/her maximum speed. The time taken for the participant to walk from the start to the end of the 10 meters was recorded.</description>

    <measure>Participant Satisfaction With the GSC at Week 6 and Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle, Reinjection Cycle Visit and Last Study Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (for participants who had GSC previously only), Week 6 and Week 12 of each treatment cycle, reinjection cycle visit and last study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant received a personalised rehabilitation programme. The physiotherapist taught each participant the stretching postures and exercises to perform on a daily basis throughout the study. These were tailored to the individual participant's needs and formed the GSC therapy. The main focus was on the primary TT limb and then the other limb. Participant satisfaction was determined by asking the question &quot;How satisfied are you TODAY regarding the GSC?&quot; Responses were recorded using a 5-level Likert scale, as follows: completely satisfied (+2), rather satisfied (+1), neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (0), rather dissatisfied (-1), and completely dissatisfied (-2).</description>

    <measure>Global Assessment of Benefits of the Study Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>At reinjection cycle visit (Week 12, 16 or 20) and last study visit (Week 24 or 40)</time_frame>
    <description>A global assessment of the benefits of the study therapy was made by the investigator and the participant (or the caregiver). The participant's caregiver performed the global assessment only in those cases when the participant was not capable to do this. Participants were asked the following question: &quot;How would you rate the overall response to study therapy since baseline?&quot; Responses on the global assessment were recorded on a 5-level Likert scale, as follows: much better (+2), a bit better (+1), the same (0), a bit worse (-1), and much worse (-2).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Satisfied With a Longer Interval Between 2 Treatment Cycles</measure>
    <time_frame>At reinjection cycle visit (Week 16 or 20) and last study visit (Week 24 or 40)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who were not reinjected at Week 12 of a given cycle, recorded their satisfaction with a longer interval between 2 injections collected at the corresponding reinjection visit or the last cycle visit (Week 16 or Week 20 for each cycle). To assess this, the participants were asked the following question: &quot;Are you satisfied with a longer interval between 2 injections?&quot;. The possible answers were: Yes, No or No opinion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) Scores at Last Study Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>At last study visit (Week 24 or 40)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to complete EQ-5D-5L questionnaire to assess their current health status. The EQ-5D-5L was a generic, preference-based measure of health-related quality of life (QoL). Questions were answered based on how the participant was feeling &quot;Today&quot;. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 parts: EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system included questions for each of the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The VAS recorded participant's self-rated health on a vertical 20-centimeter VAS where the endpoints were labelled &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire scores range from 0-100, where 0= worst self-perceived health and 100= best self-perceived health. Positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in QoL.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Form 12 (SF-12) Scales at Last Study Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>At last study visit (Week 24 or 40)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 was a short form questionnaire survey consisting of 12 questions, which were a subset of the SF-36 health survey. Most of the questions were answered based on how the participant had felt over the previous 4 weeks. The SF-12 covers 8 domains, including physical functioning, role-physical, body pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. The SF-12 questionnaire survey scale ranges from 0-100, where 0= lowest level of health and 100= highest level of health. Positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in QoL.</description>

          -  Subjects with hemiparesis due to acquired brain injury (ABI) presenting with muscle
             overactivity impeding motor function based on investigator's judgement including, but
             not limited to, at least one of the following requiring botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)
             treatment: typical clenched fist; flexed wrist; flexed elbow; or plantar flexed foot
             pattern.

          -  At least 12 months since the ABI (i.e. stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI)).

          -  Naïve or non-naïve to BoNT treatment; if non-naïve, at least 4 months after the last
             BoNT injection, of any serotype.

          -  Upper limb active function with an overall score between 2 and 7, as assessed by
             Modified Frenchay Scale (MFS), if the primary TT limb is the upper limb (UL).

             lower limb (LL). Maximal WS barefoot will be performed without walking aids. However,
             a cane may be permitted if absolutely necessary (although this may prevent detection
             of treatment-induced improvements). In this case, the same aid will have to be used
             for all WS assessments during the study.

          -  Subjects must provide written informed consent to participate in the study prior to
             any study-related procedures.

             postmenopausal) must use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree
             to continue use of this method for the duration of the study until the last visit of
             the subjects and for at least 12 weeks post injection. Acceptable methods of
             contraception include total abstinence, male partner has had a vasectomy, double
             barrier method (e.g. male condom plus spermicide, or female diaphragm plus

             treatment with any drug that interferes either directly or indirectly with
             neuromuscular function (for example, aminoglycosides).

          -  Major neurological impairment other than spastic paresis (including major
             proprioceptive ataxia or apraxia on the paretic side) that could negatively impact on
             the functional performance of the subject.

          -  Known disease of the neuromuscular junction (such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome
             or myasthenia gravis).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This multicenter, single-arm study was conducted in 18 centers in 4 countries between 22 December 2016 and 18 July 2018 in participants with spastic hemiparesis due to acquired brain injury. Study had 2 treatment cycles separated by at least 12 (maximum 20) weeks and combined with Guided Self-Rehabilitation Contract (GSC) for whole study duration.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 157 participants were treated in this study. At baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1), the primary treatment target (TT) limb (upper limb [UL] or lower limb [LL]) was defined by the investigator, following discussion with the participant. If the primary TT limb was the UL, the secondary TT limb was the LL (and vice versa).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Dysport</title>
          <description>Dysport (AbobotulinumtoxinA) 1500 units (U) intramuscular (IM) injection, was administered as a split dose, in both the UL and LL on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. The dose given in each limb was based on which was considered the primary TT limb at baseline. At least half the total dose must have been injected in the primary TT limb and a maximum of 1000 U could be injected in an UL (even if it was the primary TT limb). There was no maximum dose that could have been injected in a LL, provided that some out of the 1500 U total was used for the UL injection.
The second Dysport injection (Cycle 2) may have been given in a different split to the first injection (Cycle 1), at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same minimal/maximal rules applied. The primary TT remained the same for both Dysport injections.
Participants were also asked to perform daily GSC therapy throughout the study.</description>

The dose given in each limb was based on which was considered the primary TT limb at baseline. At least half the total dose must have been injected in the primary TT limb and a maximum of 1000 U could be injected in an UL (even if it was the primary TT limb). There was no maximum dose that could have been injected in a LL, provided that some out of the 1500 U total was used for the UL injection.
The second Dysport injection (Cycle 2) may have been given in a different split to the first injection (Cycle 1), at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same minimal/maximal rules applied. The primary TT remained the same for both Dysport injections.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in AROM Against 10 Prespecified Muscle Groups at Week 6 and Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle, Reinjection Cycle Visit and Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>The AROM was measured by goniometer in the primary TT limb, using zero as the theoretical position of minimal stretch for the muscle assessed. Participants were asked to perform the active movement as far as possible against that muscle and the angle was measured. The angle of joint movement was measured in 10 prespecified muscle groups (injected or noninjected); UL: shoulder extensors (SE), elbow flexors (EF), wrist flexors (WF), extrinsic finger flexors (FF) and pronator teres (PT), LL: soleus (Sol), gastrocnemius (GN), gluteus maximus (GM), hamstrings (HS) and rectus femoris (RF). The reinjection cycle visit corresponds to Week 12, 16 or 20 of injection Cycle 1. The last study visit corresponds to the last post-baseline visit performed by the participant (including the early withdrawal visit).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Composite AROM Against Injected Muscle Groups (Any of the 10 Prespecified Muscles) at Week 6 and Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle, Reinjection Cycle Visit and Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>Composite AROM (XA) was measured by goniometer in the primary TT limb (either UL or LL, depending on which one has been selected as the primary TT limb), composite AROM in the UL injected muscle groups was calculated as the sum of the AROM in the EF, WF and FF. Composite AROM in the LL injected muscle groups was calculated as the sum of the AROM in Sol and GN.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 6 and Week 12 of each treatment cycle, reinjection cycle visit and last study visit</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population included all participants who were injected at least once with the study treatment, who received at least 1 day of GSC therapy during the study and for whom a primary TT limb had been defined. Only participants with data available at each time point are presented.</population>

            <title>Dysport</title>
            <description>Dysport 1500 U IM injection, was administered as a split dose, in both the UL and LL on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. The dose given in each limb was based on which was considered the primary TT limb at baseline. At least half the total dose must have been injected in the primary TT limb and a maximum of 1000 U could be injected in an UL (even if it was the primary TT limb). There was no maximum dose that could have been injected in a LL, provided that some out of the 1500 U total was used for the UL injection.
The second Dysport injection (Cycle 2) may have been given in a different split to the first injection (Cycle 1), at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same minimal/maximal rules applied. The primary TT remained the same for both Dysport injections.
Participants were also asked to perform daily GSC therapy throughout the study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Full Composite AROM Against 5 UL or 5 LL Muscle Groups, Regardless of Whether the Muscle Groups Were Injected or Not at Week 6 and Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle, Reinjection Cycle Visit and Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>Full composite AROM, regardless of whether the muscle groups was injected or not was measured by goniometer in the primary TT limb. Full Composite AROM in the UL was calculated as the sum of the AROM in the 5 UL muscle groups (SE+EF+WF+FF+PT). Full Composite AROM in the LL was calculated as the sum of the AROM in the 5 LL muscle groups (Sol+GN+GM+HS+RF).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 6 and Week 12 of each treatment cycle, reinjection cycle visit and last study visit</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population included all participants who were injected at least once with the study treatment, who received at least 1 day of GSC therapy during the study and for whom a primary TT limb had been defined. Only participants with data available at each time point are presented.</population>

            <title>Dysport</title>
            <description>Dysport 1500 U IM injection, was administered as a split dose, in both the UL and LL on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. The dose given in each limb was based on which was considered the primary TT limb at baseline. At least half the total dose must have been injected in the primary TT limb and a maximum of 1000 U could be injected in an UL (even if it was the primary TT limb). There was no maximum dose that could have been injected in a LL, provided that some out of the 1500 U total was used for the UL injection.
The second Dysport injection (Cycle 2) may have been given in a different split to the first injection (Cycle 1), at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same minimal/maximal rules applied. The primary TT remained the same for both Dysport injections.
Participants were also asked to perform daily GSC therapy throughout the study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Modified Frenchay Scale (MFS) Overall Score Evaluated Locally and Centrally at Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle and Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>The MFS was used to measure active function in the UL. The MFS consists of 10 tasks, each of which was evaluated locally by the site investigator and centrally by a blinded central reviewer at the coordinating investigators' site, on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from &quot;No movement&quot; to &quot;Normal&quot;. Higher score indicates a better outcome. The MFS overall scores were obtained by averaging all individual task scores, provided that at least 8 out of the 10 were not missing. The mean change from baseline was calculated for the local and central assessments and a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in active function.</description>

            <description>Dysport 1500 U IM injection, was administered as a split dose, in both the UL and LL on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. The dose given in each limb was based on which was considered the primary TT limb at baseline. At least half the total dose must have been injected in the primary TT limb and a maximum of 1000 U could be injected in an UL (even if it was the primary TT limb). There was no maximum dose that could have been injected in a LL, provided that some out of the 1500 U total was used for the UL injection.
The second Dysport injection (Cycle 2) may have been given in a different split to the first injection (Cycle 1), at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same minimal/maximal rules applied. The primary TT remained the same for both Dysport injections.
Participants were also asked to perform daily GSC therapy throughout the study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Maximal Walking Speed Barefoot at Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle and at Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>The 10-meter walking speed test (WST) was used to measure active function in the LL. The participant performed the WST barefoot without a walking aid. If it was absolutely necessary that the participant used a cane, this may have been permitted provided that the same cane was used at baseline and all other walking speed assessments for that participant. The participant was given instructions to walk at his/her maximum speed. The time taken for the participant to walk from the start to the end of the 10 meters was recorded.</description>

        <title>Participant Satisfaction With the GSC at Week 6 and Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle, Reinjection Cycle Visit and Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>Each participant received a personalised rehabilitation programme. The physiotherapist taught each participant the stretching postures and exercises to perform on a daily basis throughout the study. These were tailored to the individual participant's needs and formed the GSC therapy. The main focus was on the primary TT limb and then the other limb. Participant satisfaction was determined by asking the question &quot;How satisfied are you TODAY regarding the GSC?&quot; Responses were recorded using a 5-level Likert scale, as follows: completely satisfied (+2), rather satisfied (+1), neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (0), rather dissatisfied (-1), and completely dissatisfied (-2).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physiotherapist's Beliefs That the GSC Will Help to Improve Functional Capacity at Week 6 and Week 12 of Each Treatment Cycle, Reinjection Cycle Visit and Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>Physiotherapists were asked the following question: &quot;Do you believe that GSC will help to improve your patient's arm and leg function?&quot; Responses were recorded on a 5-level Likert scale, as follows: very true of what I believe (+2), somewhat true of what I believe (+1), no opinion/don't know (0), somewhat untrue of what I believe (-1), and very untrue of what I believe (-2).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 6 and Week 12 of each treatment cycle, reinjection cycle visit and last study visit</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population included all participants who were injected at least once with the study treatment, who received at least 1 day of GSC therapy during the study and for whom a primary TT limb had been defined. Only participants with data available at each time point are presented.</population>

            <title>Dysport</title>
            <description>Dysport 1500 U IM injection, was administered as a split dose, in both the UL and LL on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. The dose given in each limb was based on which was considered the primary TT limb at baseline. At least half the total dose must have been injected in the primary TT limb and a maximum of 1000 U could be injected in an UL (even if it was the primary TT limb). There was no maximum dose that could have been injected in a LL, provided that some out of the 1500 U total was used for the UL injection.
The second Dysport injection (Cycle 2) may have been given in a different split to the first injection (Cycle 1), at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same minimal/maximal rules applied. The primary TT remained the same for both Dysport injections.
Participants were also asked to perform daily GSC therapy throughout the study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Satisfied With a Longer Interval Between 2 Treatment Cycles</title>
        <description>Participants who were not reinjected at Week 12 of a given cycle, recorded their satisfaction with a longer interval between 2 injections collected at the corresponding reinjection visit or the last cycle visit (Week 16 or Week 20 for each cycle). To assess this, the participants were asked the following question: &quot;Are you satisfied with a longer interval between 2 injections?&quot;. The possible answers were: Yes, No or No opinion.</description>
        <time_frame>At reinjection cycle visit (Week 16 or 20) and last study visit (Week 24 or 40)</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population included all participants who were injected at least once with the study treatment, who received at least 1 day of GSC therapy during the study and for whom a primary TT limb had been defined. Results are presented for participants who were not reinjected at Week 12 of the given cycle.</population>

            <title>Dysport</title>
            <description>Dysport 1500 U IM injection, was administered as a split dose, in both the UL and LL on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. The dose given in each limb was based on which was considered the primary TT limb at baseline. At least half the total dose must have been injected in the primary TT limb and a maximum of 1000 U could be injected in an UL (even if it was the primary TT limb). There was no maximum dose that could have been injected in a LL, provided that some out of the 1500 U total was used for the UL injection.
The second Dysport injection (Cycle 2) may have been given in a different split to the first injection (Cycle 1), at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same minimal/maximal rules applied. The primary TT remained the same for both Dysport injections.
Participants were also asked to perform daily GSC therapy throughout the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) Scores at Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to complete EQ-5D-5L questionnaire to assess their current health status. The EQ-5D-5L was a generic, preference-based measure of health-related quality of life (QoL). Questions were answered based on how the participant was feeling &quot;Today&quot;. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 parts: EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system included questions for each of the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The VAS recorded participant's self-rated health on a vertical 20-centimeter VAS where the endpoints were labelled &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire scores range from 0-100, where 0= worst self-perceived health and 100= best self-perceived health. Positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in QoL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form 12 (SF-12) Scales at Last Study Visit</title>
        <description>The SF-12 was a short form questionnaire survey consisting of 12 questions, which were a subset of the SF-36 health survey. Most of the questions were answered based on how the participant had felt over the previous 4 weeks. The SF-12 covers 8 domains, including physical functioning, role-physical, body pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. The SF-12 questionnaire survey scale ranges from 0-100, where 0= lowest level of health and 100= highest level of health. Positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in QoL.</description>
        <time_frame>At last study visit (Week 24 or 40)</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population included all participants who were injected at least once with the study treatment, who received at least 1 day of GSC therapy during the study and for whom a primary TT limb had been defined. Only participants with data available at each time point are presented.</population>

            <title>Dysport</title>
            <description>Dysport 1500 U IM injection, was administered as a split dose, in both the UL and LL on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. The dose given in each limb was based on which was considered the primary TT limb at baseline. At least half the total dose must have been injected in the primary TT limb and a maximum of 1000 U could be injected in an UL (even if it was the primary TT limb). There was no maximum dose that could have been injected in a LL, provided that some out of the 1500 U total was used for the UL injection.
The second Dysport injection (Cycle 2) may have been given in a different split to the first injection (Cycle 1), at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same minimal/maximal rules applied. The primary TT remained the same for both Dysport injections.
Participants were also asked to perform daily GSC therapy throughout the study.</description>
