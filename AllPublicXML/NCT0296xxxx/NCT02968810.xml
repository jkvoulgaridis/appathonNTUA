    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well simvastatin works in preventing liver cancer
      in patients with liver cirrhosis. Simvastatin may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo on the change in serum
      AFP-L3% from baseline to 6 months following treatment initiation in patients with liver
      cirrhosis who have a current model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) =&lt; 20.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline on the change in serum AFP.

      II. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline on the change in serum IL-6.

      III. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline on the change in serum bile acid levels.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline on the change in liver stiffness.

      V. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline on the change in fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4) score.

      VI. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline on the change in MELD score.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD).

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD.

      In both groups, treatment continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days.

    <description>Will use descriptive statistics and graphics at baseline and 6 months, as well as study random effects regression trends from baseline to 6 months for further hypotheses generation. Results from routine clinical tests into these regression analyses, specifically those that have been shown to be strongly predictive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis in prospective cohorts of cirrhosis including higher alkaline phosphatase, lower platelets, lower albumin, and lower prothrombin activity will be incorporated. Incorporated into these models will be variables representing important HCC risk factors captured through the epidemiological questionnaire, including body mass index, current alcohol use, and current dietary fat, carbohydrate, fiber, coffee, and antioxidants. Analyses will begin with univariate cross-sectional statistics for profiling the study population and bivariate tabulations as a preliminary step to possible model building.</description>
