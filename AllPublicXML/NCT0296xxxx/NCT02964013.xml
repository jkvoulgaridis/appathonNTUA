  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) study of vibostolimab (MK-7684) as
      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) or pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed
      and carboplatin in adults with metastatic solid tumors for which there is no available
      therapy that is expected to convey clinical benefit. Part A of this study is a dose
      escalation and confirmation phase to estimate the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) for
      vibostolimab monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin.
      Part A will also evaluate the anti-tumor activity of vibostolimab in combination with
      pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin in participants with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and vibostolimab (at two dose levels) in combination with pembrolizumab in Japanese
      participants with gastric cancer. Part B will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of
      vibostolimab at the RPTD when used as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in
      participants with advanced solid tumors in a non-randomized study design. Part B will also
      evaluate 2 doses of vibostolimab in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with
      programmed death 1 (PD-1) treatment na√Øve cancer using a 1:1 randomized study design. Part B
      is expanded with Amendment 11 to include an additional arm that will compare the safety and
      PK of a fixed dose of MK-7684A, a co-formulated product of vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab,
      to vibostolimab in combination with pembrolizumab administered as separate intravenous
      infusions. The primary hypotheses are that vibostolimab administered as monotherapy or in
      combination with pembrolizumab is safe and tolerable when administered at the RPTD and that
      MK-7684A is safe and tolerable when administered as a fixed dose.
