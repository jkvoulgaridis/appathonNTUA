      This study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of post-transplantation
      cyclophosphamide with myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      -  Conditioning regimen A) Busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day i.v. daily For 4 days (days -7 to -4) in
           patients aged &lt; 55 years For 2 days (days -7 and -6) in patients aged ≥ 55 years B)
           Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day i.v. daily on days -7 to -2 (for 6 days)

        -  Harvest and infusion of donor hematopoietic cells Harvested peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells of donors via leukapheresis will be infused to recipients on day 0. Additional
           infusion on day 1 can be made based on the judgement of attending physician.

        -  GVHD prophylaxis A) Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day i.v. daily on days 3 and 4 (for 2
           days) B) Cyclosporine: 1.5 mg/kg i.v. every 12 h hours beginning on day 5 and changed to
           oral dosing when oral intake is possible. If there is no evidence of GVHD, the dosage
           will be tapered beginning on day 90 and discontinued on day 180. C) MMF: 15 mg/kg p.o. 3
           times daily with a maximum daily dose of 3.0 g beginning on day 5

      If there is no active GVHD, Cyclosporine and MMF will be discontinued without taper at day
      180 and 35, respectively.
