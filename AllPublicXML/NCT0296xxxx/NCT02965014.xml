  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-arm cross-over randomized trial will develop, test, and compare the efficacy of
      two delivery formats of the Young Women's CoOp (YWC), which is designed to provide risk
      reduction and empowerment skills, as well as linkages to healthcare services for women who
      use substances. The current study will develop a revised version of the YWC and evaluate the
      relative efficacy of a face-to-face (face-to-face YWC), mobile Health application (mHealth
      YWC) delivery format, and HIV counseling and testing (HCT) as a control to reduce risky
      sexual behaviors and reduce substance use among young (18-25) African American women who use
      substances and are sexually active and have not recently been tested for HIV in three NC
      counties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use the seek, test, treat, and retain framework to develop
      and test the efficacy of a clinic-based, age-appropriate, woman-focused HIV risk-reduction
      intervention to reduce sexual risk among up to 700 young sexually active African American
      women aged 18 to 25 who use drugs in three North Carolina counties. The researchers will test
      the delivery of the woman-focused intervention conducted in two formats, face-to-face YWC and
      mHealth YWC, using a three-arm cross-over randomized design in which counties are randomized
      to (1) HCT as the control, (2) face-to-face YWC; and (3) mHealth YWC that will be delivered
      on tablets using an interactive app. The researchers will fulfill the purpose of this study
      through the following aims: (Aim 1) To develop a new YWC intervention and recruitment
      strategies using formative methods to engage young African American women who use substances
      and have not recently been tested for HIV, clinic staff, and stakeholders to ensure age
      appropriateness, to identify barriers to reaching these young women and the challenges in
      conducting the intervention in the clinics, and to develop the mHealth YWC; (Aim 2) To test
      the efficacy of two formats of the woman-focused intervention program (face-to-face YWC and
      mHealth YWC) relative to HCT with up to 700 young women aged 18 to 25 in three North Carolina
      county health departments for primary outcomes at 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments;
      (Aim 3) To estimate the total costs of implementing the face-to-face YWC and mHealth YWC
      interventions, and to assess the resource components that drive these costs; and (Aim 4) To
      examine the extent to which the face-to-face YWC and mHealth YWC are perceived by
      collaborating health clinic staff and participants as being acceptable and sustainable.

    <ipd_description>Analytic data sets will be prepared in accordance with the &quot;Privacy Rule&quot; of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/) as &quot;limited data sets&quot; in which names and other personal health identifiers are removed, birthdays have been converted to age at intake, and other dates have been changed to be days before or after the date of intake. Because there are fewer than 20,000 people in the data set, HIPAA says we cannot ensure that it is completely &quot;de-identified&quot;; consequently, HIPAA requires that we treat it as a &quot;limited data set&quot; and that we have a data sharing agreement (DSA) in place before giving anyone access to the client-level data. After the main findings are published, we will welcome other researchers who want to analyze the data in other ways. Requesting access to data will involve drafting an abstract, checking the feasibility relative to the available data, and seeking the permission of the PI and her team.</ipd_description>
