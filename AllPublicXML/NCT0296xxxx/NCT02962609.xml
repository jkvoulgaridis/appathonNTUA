      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Semielevated Side-Lying (ESL) and
      Semielevated Supine Position (ESU) positions used in bottle-feeding of very preterm infants
      upon their physiological characteristics and feeding performances.

    <textblock>
      Semielevated supine position (ESU) is a position frequently used in neonatal intensive care
      units. In this position, infant is laid and fed on its back and the head is elevated to an
      angle of 45-60° in order to reduce the respiratory load of lungs. The ESL position, head of
      the infant is elevated to an angle of 45-60° and the infant is fed in the side-lying
      position. Since this position mimics the breast-feeding position, very preterm infants are
      supported to utilize the advantages of breast-feeding. A randomization was provided in the
      sample group consisting of totally 80 infants and while 38 infants were included in the ESL
      (experimental) group, 42 infants were included in the ESU (control) group.In the power
      analysis repeated at the end of the study, the power of the study was determined as 87% at a
      reliability of 95%.

    <description>Preterm infants feed in the ESL position. In the ESL position, infant's head and trunk were elevated to an angle of 45-60° with the help of a pillow prepared by the researcher from the beds that were previously used in the unit and infants were held in side-lying position as in the breast-feeding position where their right ear faced the ceiling and the other ear faced the arms of the researcher. Their knees and hip were leaned against the researcher's arms and both the head and the neck were held at the same level by the researcher, whereas the chin was held in the flexion posture mildly facing the floor.</description>

The feeding was continued in case of the cues showing that they were ready to be fed again as well as physiological stability.</desc>
