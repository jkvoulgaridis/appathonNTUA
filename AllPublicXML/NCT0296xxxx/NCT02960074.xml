    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral encapsulated fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of peanut allergy. In this research the
      investigators would like to learn more about ways to treat peanut allergies. There is
      currently no known cure for peanut allergy. The primary aim is to assess safety and
      tolerability of oral FMT in patients with peanut allergy aged 18-40 years.

      This is a study of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of peanut allergy.
      The primary aim is to assess safety and tolerability of oral encapsulated FMT in patients
      with peanut allergy aged 18-40 years. A total of 15 patients with peanut allergy will be
      enrolled after they fail a screening food challenge to peanut. 10 patients will be given oral
      encapsulated frozen FMT over 1-2 days. 5 additional patients will receive antibiotics prior
      to being given oral encapsulated frozen FMT over 1-2 days. Patients will undergo a second and
      third food challenge after receiving FMT. The expected duration of the study for each subject
      will be one year. Stool collection, skin testing and blood samples will be done serially.

             PRACTALL (Practical Issues in Allergology, Joint United States/European Union
             Initiative) guidelines at 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, or 100 mg peanut protein.

          2. Has a positive SPT to peanut (≥5mm) and/or a positive peanut-specific IgE &gt;0.35kU/L.

          3. Has a Spirometry or Peak Flow with Measurement of FEV1&gt;=80% of predicted
