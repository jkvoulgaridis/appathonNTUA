  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the shoulder is a disease resulting from the wearing down of cartilage
      over time. OA can produce pain and dysfunction at the affected joint and is a growing
      occurrence in an aging population. Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is a surgical treatment
      used to treat patients with shoulder OA which involves replacing the worn-out ball and socket
      shoulder joint with prosthetic components. TSA is performed today with high success rates,
      however, complication rates associated with TSA remain prevalent particularly when the
      arthritis is associated with bone erosion on the glenoid (socket).

      Given the high rate of revisions associated with TSA treatment in the setting of glenoid bone
      erosion, a number of surgical strategies have been developed. These surgical techniques
      include eccentric reaming which involves removing bone from the front of the socket,
      augmented glenoid component implantation, and posterior bone grafting to compensate for
      glenoid bone loss, and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Few research studies have compared
      these different surgical techniques to one another. Previous studies have been limited to
      case series with small sample sizes and respective designs. This study is being conducted to
      determine which approach produces better outcomes. For the purpose of this study we will be
      comparing total shoulder arthroplasty techniques a) augmented glenoid component and eccentric
      reaming and b) augmented glenoid component and bone grafting in participants with advanced
      glenohumeral osteoarthritis.

      Patients who have 10-15 degrees of retroversion will be randomly assigned to one of two
      standard of care treatment groups: TSA with eccentric glenoid reaming or TSA with augmented
      glenoid component implantation.

      Patients whose condition involves &gt; 15 degrees of retroversion will be randomly assigned to
      one of two standard of care treatment groups: TSA with augmented glenoid component
      implantation or posterior glenoid bone grafting.

      The primary objective will be measured by the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder
      Index (WOOS) score pre-operatively and at post-operative time intervals (i.e. 3, 6, 12 and 24
      months).

      Secondary Objectives: i) To determine the survivorship of the components as measured by the
      degree of radiographic lucencies and component alignment determined by a CT scan at 1 and 5
      years post-surgery between study arms in both age groups.

      ii) To determine the difference in disease specific quality of life between treatment
      allocations in both age groups as measured by the Constant score, the American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment form (ASES) and the EuroQol Group EQ-5D-5L
      score pre-operatively and at post-operative time intervals (i.e. 3, 6, 12 and 24 months), as
      well as adverse events, and health care utilization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patient Population The target population is both men and women of any age with advanced
        osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint who are considered by the treating surgeon to be a
        candidate for shoulder replacement. The type of arthritic process will not be considered a
        deciding factor. The arthritis must be amenable to treatment using either a humeral head
        replacement (stemmed or stem-less), or a standard total shoulder replacement.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patients who have failed standard non-surgical management of their shoulder
             osteoarthritis who would benefit from a shoulder arthroplasty. Failed medical
             management will be defined as persistent pain and disability despite adequate standard
             non-operative management for 6 months. Medical management will be defined as:

               1. The use of drugs including analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

               2. Physiotherapy consisting of stretching, strengthening and local modalities
                  (ultrasound, cryotherapy, etc.)

               3. Activity modification

          2. Patients will present with a glenoid retroversion between 10-26 degrees.

          3. Imaging, and intra-operative findings confirming advanced humeral head cartilage loss,
             with or without glenoid cartilage loss.

          4. Age 18 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. &lt; 10 degrees / &gt; 27 degrees of glenoid retroversion

          3. Rotator cuff arthropathy

          4. Significant muscle paralysis

          5. Charcot's arthropathy

          6. Major medical illness (life expectancy less than 1 year or unacceptably high operative
             risk)

          7. Unable to understand the consent form/process

          8. Pregnancy

          9. Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent
