  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III, multicenter, multi-country trial to assess the efficacy, safety,
      tolerance and pharmacokinetics of SOF-RDV for the treatment of HCV infection, across
      genotypes 1,2,3,6, among non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic with CTP class A, interferon/ribavirin
      naïve or experienced, HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected subjects.

      It will also study the pharmacokinetics of RDV and, in HCV/HIV co-infected subjects, possible
      drug-drug interactions with antiretrovirals.

      The treatment duration will be 12 weeks for subjects with no cirrhosis (Metavir F0 to F3) and
      24 weeks for subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Metavir F4, CTP class A).

      The study is performed in 2 stages. Stage 1 has been completed. Efficacy and safety results
      from Stage 1 were reviewed and approved by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board
      (DSMB) which provided the recommendation to proceed with the study stage 2. On-going stage 2
      aims to supplement Stage 1 results and provide additional information on the performance of
      SOF-RDV in the main genotypes found in Malaysia and Thailand.
