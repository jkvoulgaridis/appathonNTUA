  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3117391 has the potential to complement existing therapies in the treatment of chronic
      inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study will evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral GSK3117391 (Dose A) administered to subjects with
      severe RA despite treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). This is a
      randomised, double-blind (sponsor open), multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study. The total maximum study duration is approximately 10 weeks. Following a screening
      period of up to 28 days, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to placebo or GSK3117391 (Dose A)
      administered orally for a period of 28 days. Subjects will be followed up for 7 to 14 days
      post final dose. Approximately 40 subjects with severe RA will be randomised into the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score for 28 Different Joints With (DAS28) C-reactive Protein (CRP) at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose, Day 1) and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a derived measurement with differential weighing given to each component as: Tender/Painful Joint Count (TJC28) and swollen joint count (SJC28) both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), CRP measured in milligrams per liter and Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis (PtGA) (visual analogue scale with values from 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). The formula used to calculate DAS28 score was 0.56 multiplied by square root of TJC28 plus 0.28 multiplied by square root of SJC28 plus 0.36 log of (CRP plus 1) plus 0.014 multiplied by PtGA plus 0.96. DAS28 scores ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). A negative change from Baseline value indicated improvement. Baseline was defined at Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was post-baseline value minus the value at Baseline. Safety Population consisted of all participants who received at least one dose of study medication. Individual participant data at Day 28 has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score for 28 Different Joints With (DAS28) C-reactive Protein (CRP) at Day 28</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a derived measurement with differential weighing given to each component as: Tender/Painful Joint Count (TJC28) and swollen joint count (SJC28) both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), CRP measured in milligrams per liter and Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis (PtGA) (visual analogue scale with values from 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). The formula used to calculate DAS28 score was 0.56 multiplied by square root of TJC28 plus 0.28 multiplied by square root of SJC28 plus 0.36 log of (CRP plus 1) plus 0.014 multiplied by PtGA plus 0.96. DAS28 scores ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). A negative change from Baseline value indicated improvement. Baseline was defined at Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was post-baseline value minus the value at Baseline. Safety Population consisted of all participants who received at least one dose of study medication. Individual participant data at Day 28 has been presented.</description>

The number of participants with abnormal ECG findings were reported and categorized as clinically significant and not clinically significant. Any value for ECG parameters out of the following normal range was considered as clinically significant abnormality; for PR interval &lt;110 or &gt;220 milliseconds, for QRS interval &lt;75 or &gt;110 milliseconds and for QT corrected interval &lt;450 milliseconds.</description>

          <description>Twelve-lead ECGs were performed during the study using an automated ECG machine, after 5 minutes of rest. The number of participants with abnormal ECG findings were reported and categorized as clinically significant and not clinically significant. Any value for ECG parameters out of the following normal range was considered as clinically significant abnormality; for PR interval &lt;110 or &gt;220 milliseconds, for QRS interval &lt;75 or &gt;110 milliseconds and for QT corrected interval &lt;450 milliseconds.</description>

The following 28 joints were taken into account for SJC28: Shoulder (2 joints), Knee (2), Elbow (2), Wrist (2), Fingers (Joints for proximal interphalangeal [PIP] and metacarpophalangeal [MCP]: 20). No missing observations were considered. Individual participant data has been presented. Only data available at specified visit with respect to the participant has been presented.</description>

        <description>The total number of joints ranging from 0 to 28 joints with a present tenderness were assessed. The following 28 joints were taken into account for TJC28: Shoulder (2 joints), Knee (2), Elbow (2), Wrist (2), Fingers (PIP and MCP: 20). No missing observations were considered. Individual participant data has been presented. Only data available at specified visit with respect to the participant has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DAS28-CRP Over Time</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a derived measurement with differential weighing given to each component as: TJC28 and SJC28 both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), CRP measured in milligrams per liter and PtGA (visual analogue scale with values from 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). The formula used to calculate DAS28 score was 0.56 multiplied by square root of TJC28 plus 0.28 multiplied by square root of SJC28 plus 0.36 log of (CRP plus 1) plus 0.014 multiplied by PtGA plus 0.96. DAS28 scores ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). A negative change from Baseline value indicated improvement. Baseline was defined at Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was post-baseline value minus the value at Baseline. Only data available at specified visit with respect to the participant has been presented.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were planned to be collected for GSK3117391, and its acid metabolite GSK3339189, at the specified timepoints. Accumulation ratio was planned to be determined from the ratio of AUC from time zero to time of next dosing (AUC [0-tau]) following single dose administration /AUC (0-tau) on repeat dose administration. This analysis was planned but was not performed as the sample size was too small and study was terminated pre-maturely, by the sponsor following internal review.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline, was defined as the post-Baseline value minus the value at Baseline. Baseline was defined as the value from the Day 1 (pre-dose). Blood samples were planned to be analyzed by flow cytometry for cell markers to determine any changes after treatment with GSK3117391. This analysis was planned but the assay was not performed due to sample size being too small at the time of early study termination.</description>
