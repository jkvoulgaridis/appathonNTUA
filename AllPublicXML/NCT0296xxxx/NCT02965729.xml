    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to examine the influence of step goals with pedometers to
      improve children's weight loss, physical activity, and psychosocial health during behavioral
      treatment. Children with overweight or obesity were assigned to receive the behavioral
      treatment alone, plus pedometers, or plus pedometers with step goals.

      A total of 105 overweight and obese children ages 8 to 17 years participated in a 10-week
      family-based weight management intervention focusing on physical activity, nutrition, and
      behavioral modification. A quasi-experimental design was used to group cohorts into three
      conditions: two cohorts had no pedometer (n=24); two cohorts had pedometer only (n=25); and
      four cohorts had pedometer with step goals (i.e. 500 steps/day weekly increase above
      baseline; n=56). Height and weight were measured at baseline and week 10 and used to
      calculate body mass index (BMI). Analysis of covariance was performed to examine difference
      by condition for change in weight, BMI, and BMI z-score, controlling for age and baseline
      value. Differences in steps/day and psychosocial health were compared between the two
      pedometer conditions.

    <measure>BMI Z-score Change</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Height was measured at sessions 1 and 10 using a stadiometer. Weight was measured at each session using a calibrated scale. BMI z-score was calculated from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention macro program based on the sex, height, and age of the child. Change was calculated as difference between baseline and end of 10-week study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BMI Change</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BMI was calculated as weight in kg divided by height in meters squared. Change was calculated as difference between baseline and end of 10-week study.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Kidscreen-10 Index Change</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life was measured using the Kidscreen-10 Index. Change was calculated as difference between baseline and end of 10-week study. the scale ranged from 0 to 15, with higher values indicating a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Enjoyment Change</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity enjoyment was measured using the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES). Change was calculated as difference between baseline and end of 10-week study. The scale ranged from 0 to 32, with higher values indicating a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Health Change</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective health was measured using a 1-item Likert scale (&quot;In general, how would you say your health is?&quot;). Change was calculated as difference between baseline and end of 10-week study. The scale ranged from 0 to 4, with higher values indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Change</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity was measured in the pedometer only and pedometer plus goals groups using an Omron pedometer (Omron HJ-324U, Omron Healthcare, Lake Forest, IL). Change was calculated as difference between baseline and end of 10-week study.</description>

        <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Pedometers were not worn in the &quot;No Pedometer&quot; cohorts and so data were not collected.</population>

Participants were asked to wear the pedometer every day for the entirety of the program and return at session 10. Participants were given individualized step goals to increase their activity by 500 steps each week (above baseline calculated as average daily steps/day during week 1).</description>
