  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us determine how hormones impact the production of
      cervical mucus which is a fluid secreted by the opening of the uterus, also called the
      cervix. During a normal menstrual cycle, cervical mucus changes in response to two hormones
      that the ovaries make: estrogen and progesterone. Many of the birth control methods women use
      thicken mucus and make it less likely for sperm to enter the uterus. The goal of this study
      is to better understand the effects estrogen and progesterone have on the cervical mucus in
      the body. To do this, the investigators will be using a drug that suppresses natural hormone
      production for 3 months. Estrogen and progesterone will be artificially replaced to better
      understand their effects. The investigators will also be studying the effect of a common
      birth control pill that may work by thickening cervical mucus. Last, the investigators will
      study some of the cells in the cervix that produce mucus.

      This proposed study is to evaluate the temporal changes in human cervical mucus in response
      to progesterone and progestins as an initial step toward clarifying these relationships. Our
      hypothesis is that direct effects of progesterone on the endocervix, independent of estrogen
      withdrawal, cause contraceptive changes to cervical mucus. To study this, a randomized,
      prospective, crossover study will be conducted by examining cervical mucus changes in a small
      cohort of women in whom investigators will suppress circulating hormonal levels by
      administering a GnRH antagonist. Investigators will then artificially replace Estrogen and
      Progesterone in order to differentiate their effects on clinical and laboratory measurements
      of mucus quality. The investigators will be looking closely at the immediate changes in mucus
      when .35 mg of norethindrone, a marketed drug is administered in this experimental setting.
      Cervical cell samples will also be collected at various time points and perform RT-PCR to
      determine whether genes for membrane bound progesterone receptor are expressed and regulated
      by Estrogen and Progesterone.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of median cervical mucus scores at baseline. The current clinical standard for appraising cervical mucus is the cervical mucus score (ie. Insler score) that examines mucus based on 5 metrics including volume, spinnbarkeit (stretch), ferning, viscosity and cellularity on a 15-point scale. Per WHO guidelines, scores above 10 are considered &quot;mucus favoring penetration&quot; and scores below 10 are considered to be &quot;unfavorable to penetration.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in PGRMC1 During Menstrual Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring the mean transcript change of membrane bound progestin receptors (PGRMC1) from follicular phase to ovulation to luteal phase of spontaneous menstrual cycle.
Total RNA (ribonucleic acid) was isolated from endocervical cell samples and analyzed for expression of PGRMC1 using real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) relative to levels of ribosomal (S10) RNA. An endocervical brush will be inserted into the os and then immediately rinsed into a special RNA preserving reagent. After total RNA is isolated and purified, it will be reverse transcribed into cDNA using primers.

    <description>This arm will receive Norethindrone (NET) first then experience estradiol withdrawal (E2WD).
On the day prior to each admission, we instructed subjects to apply three fresh estradiol (E2) patches (0.3mg/day) to achieve mid-cycle level E2 effects.
On the day of the first and third admission, subjects were randomized to the experimental condition, either: (1) oral progestin administration (e.g., a single dose of 0.35mg norethindrone) with continuation of the E2 patches; or (2) estradiol withdrawal (e.g., removal of the patches). Subject then received the converse intervention for admissions two and four.
Subjects resumed treatment with the 0.1mg E2 patch until their next scheduled inpatient assessment. We required a minimum of five days at this level before repeating the dose escalation and the next evaluation.</description>

          <description>This arm will receive Norethindrone (NET) first then experience estradiol withdrawal (E2WD).
On the day prior to each admission, we instructed subjects to apply three fresh estradiol (E2) patches (0.3mg/day) to achieve mid-cycle level E2 effects.
On the day of the first and third admission, subjects were randomized to the experimental condition, either: (1) oral progestin administration (e.g., a single dose of 0.35mg norethindrone) with continuation of the E2 patches; or (2) estradiol withdrawal (e.g., removal of the patches). Subject then received the converse intervention for admissions two and four.
Subjects resumed treatment with the 0.1mg E2 patch until their next scheduled inpatient assessment. We required a minimum of five days at this level before repeating the dose escalation and the next evaluation.</description>

        <title>Median Cervical Mucus Score - Baseline</title>
        <description>Measurement of median cervical mucus scores at baseline. The current clinical standard for appraising cervical mucus is the cervical mucus score (ie.

Per WHO guidelines, scores above 10 are considered &quot;mucus favoring penetration&quot; and scores below 10 are considered to be &quot;unfavorable to penetration.&quot;</description>

        <title>Change in PGRMC1 During Menstrual Cycle</title>
        <description>Measuring the mean transcript change of membrane bound progestin receptors (PGRMC1) from follicular phase to ovulation to luteal phase of spontaneous menstrual cycle.
Total RNA (ribonucleic acid) was isolated from endocervical cell samples and analyzed for expression of PGRMC1 using real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) relative to levels of ribosomal (S10) RNA. An endocervical brush will be inserted into the os and then immediately rinsed into a special RNA preserving reagent. After total RNA is isolated and purified, it will be reverse transcribed into cDNA using primers.

        <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
        <population>PGRMC1 data was analyzed for the 4 subjects who demonstrate ovarian suppression following leuprolide injection and continued to intervention phase of the study. Outcome was only evaluated during spontaneous menstrual cycle (1 month).

            <title>Spontaneous Cycle</title>
            <description>In order to qualify for the intervention phase, subjects needed to demonstrate favorable mucus at ovulation (Insler score of greater than or equal to 10 within 24h of an LH surge) and progesterone level in the luteal phase consistent with ovulation (a single P4 of greater than or equal to 3ng/ ml between days 18-35 of menstrual cycle).
Prior to the intervention cycle, each subject was observed over the normal natural cycle during which time we collected menstrual data including serum sex-steroid levels, mucus and cytology brushings for PGRMC1 analysis.</description>

Subject then received the converse intervention for admissions two and four.
Subjects resumed treatment with the 0.1mg E2 patch until their next scheduled inpatient assessment. We required a minimum of five days at this level before repeating the dose escalation and the next evaluation.</description>

          <title>Change in PGRMC1 During Menstrual Cycle</title>
          <description>Measuring the mean transcript change of membrane bound progestin receptors (PGRMC1) from follicular phase to ovulation to luteal phase of spontaneous menstrual cycle.
Total RNA (ribonucleic acid) was isolated from endocervical cell samples and analyzed for expression of PGRMC1 using real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) relative to levels of ribosomal (S10) RNA. An endocervical brush will be inserted into the os and then immediately rinsed into a special RNA preserving reagent. After total RNA is isolated and purified, it will be reverse transcribed into cDNA using primers.
Ratio of PGRMC1 to 18s RNA
Gene expression of membrane bound progesterone receptors in endocervical cells</description>
          <population>PGRMC1 data was analyzed for the 4 subjects who demonstrate ovarian suppression following leuprolide injection and continued to intervention phase of the study. Outcome was only evaluated during spontaneous menstrual cycle (1 month).
