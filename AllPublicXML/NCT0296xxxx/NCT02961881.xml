      Primary Objective:

      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) blinatumomab dose
      administrations

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine pharmacokinetics (PK) with continuous intravenous (cIV) and SC
           administrations

        -  To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) tested for blinatumomab administered
           subcutaneously

        -  To determine the incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation following SC
           administration

        -  To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab administration

      Exploratory Objective:

        -  To determine the pharmacodynamics (PD) time profiles for B-and T-lymphocytes as well as
           cytokine profiles during SC administration

        -  To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab administration
           using Lugano criteria if positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is
           used for evaluation
