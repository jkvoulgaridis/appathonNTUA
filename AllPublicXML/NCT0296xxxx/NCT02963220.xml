  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to pilot cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-AR)for
      avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in one study for children and adolescents
      (ages 10-17 years) and one study for adults (ages 18-65 years).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to pilot the CBT-AR treatment in youth with ARFID to determine
      treatment acceptability and efficacy.This includes evaluating the efficacy and acceptability
      of CBT-AR in reducing primary ARFID symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, and to assess
      whether improvement in individual symptoms is related to the timing of relevant
      interventions. The investigators hypothesize that from pre-treatment to post-treatment,
      subjects with ARFID will decrease severity of self-reported ARFID symptoms, decrease
      self-reported anxiety and depression, and improve psychosocial functioning. The investigators
      further hypothesize that overall, subjects with ARFID will have reduced phobic avoidance,
      sensory sensitivity, and/or low appetite in comparison to their pre-treatment symptoms.
