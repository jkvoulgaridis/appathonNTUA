    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      Carmat Total Artificial Heart (TAH) in subjects with advanced heart failure requiring
      biventricular support.

      Each subject receiving the Carmat TAH will be evaluated at 6 months (180 days) for primary
      and secondary endpoints with further follow-up assessments up to 2 years.

      The results of the study will be used to support a CE mark application.

      Center selection is based on the following: experience with VAD/TAH implantation and record
      of good results in this patient population (% of survival), the infrastructure required to
      perform the clinical investigation (especially the surgical and cardiology teams); site
      resources and experience to manage the clinical study and the patient population; the
      adherence to the standards of Good Clinical Practice. A specific focus during the site
      selection is done on dedicated VAD - nurse team to ensure that:

        -  Sites are experienced in the selection of patients whom require a mechanical circulatory
           support. Social and psychological conditions of the patient and family must be
           considered to ensure patient and family commitment in the care pathway,

        -  Close supervision of patients on the use of the device (when changing batteries) by
           experienced hospital professionals is guarantee;

        -  Extensive hospital training program and regular support for patients and family -
           relatives are ensured.
