  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the discriminant ability of simple clinical
      markers to detect swallowing impairment in individuals with ALS, 2) develop and validate a
      minimally invasive clinical screening tool for use at multidisciplinary ALS clinics, and 3)
      determine the natural history of swallowing impairment and decline in ALS.

      This research study is being performed to determine screening tools or tests that are able to
      identify and track swallowing problems associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
      over time. Also, this study will provide insight into the natural progression of swallowing
      impairment in persons with ALS over time.

      Participants enrolled in this study will complete an evaluation at the University of Florida
      Aerodigestive Research Core laboratory located at Shands Hospital, Gainesville every three
      months. Each evaluation will take approximately 90 minutes. During these evaluations, a
      videofluoroscopy (X-ray of swallowing) examination, cough tests and questionnaires will be
      completed.

    <description>The DIGEST scale will be used by trained, blinded raters to assign ratings of safety to bolus trials. Both efficiency and safety will be assigned a score from 0-4 (more safe/efficient - less safe/efficient) and based on these ratings, will be given a total score ranging from 0-4 that captures their DIGEST rating.</description>

    <description>A capsaicin challenge with three randomized blocks of 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 Î¼M capsaicin. The capsaicin will be dissolved in a vehicle solution consisting of 80% physiological saline, and 20% ethanol. Participants will be given the instruction &quot;cough if you need to&quot; prior to capsaicin delivery.The solution will be administered automatically upon detection of an inspired breath and there will be a minimum of one minute between each trial. This is to test the reflexive cough testing for upper airway sensitivity and motor thresholds.</description>
