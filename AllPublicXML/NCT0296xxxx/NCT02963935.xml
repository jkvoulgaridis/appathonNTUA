    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The purpose of the trial is to
      investigate the effect and safety of liraglutide 3.0 mg as an adjunct to intensive behaviour
      therapy for obesity in a non-specialist setting (IBT-CMS: Intensive Behaviour Therapy for
      obesity in a primary care setting according to Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)
      visit schedule).

    <measure>Change in Body Weight (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 56</time_frame>
    <description>Observed mean change in body weight from baseline (week 0) to week 56 was evaluated for two different observation periods. In-trial observation period: the uninterrupted time interval from the date of randomisation until and including the date of the follow-up visit or date of last contact. On-drug observation period: includes all time intervals in which subjects are considered to be on treatment from the date of first trial product administration to 7 days (or 14 days for AEs) after the final trial product administration, excluding potential off-treatment time intervals triggered by at least 7 consecutive missed doses (or 14 consecutive missed doses for AEs).
The test of superiority of liraglutide to placebo for the treatment policy estimand was tested in a hierarchical manner for the two primary and the consequent 7 confirmatory secondary endpoints presented.</description>

    <measure>Change in Short Form-36 (SF-36) v2.0 Acute, Physical Functioning Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 56</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the subject's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline in SF-36 physical functioning score is presented. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. The endpoint was evaluated based on in-trial data and on-drug data.</description>

        <title>Change in Body Weight (%)</title>
        <description>Observed mean change in body weight from baseline (week 0) to week 56 was evaluated for two different observation periods. In-trial observation period: the uninterrupted time interval from the date of randomisation until and including the date of the follow-up visit or date of last contact. On-drug observation period: includes all time intervals in which subjects are considered to be on treatment from the date of first trial product administration to 7 days (or 14 days for AEs) after the final trial product administration, excluding potential off-treatment time intervals triggered by at least 7 consecutive missed doses (or 14 consecutive missed doses for AEs).
The test of superiority of liraglutide to placebo for the treatment policy estimand was tested in a hierarchical manner for the two primary and the consequent 7 confirmatory secondary endpoints presented.</description>

        <title>Change in Short Form-36 (SF-36) v2.0 Acute, Physical Functioning Score</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the subject's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline in SF-36 physical functioning score is presented. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. The endpoint was evaluated based on in-trial data and on-drug data.</description>

        <title>Change in Short Form-36 v2.0 Acute (SF-36) (Subdomains)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the subject's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline in in the sub-domain scores is presented. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are evaluated based on in-trial data.</description>

Subjects received 0.6 mg liraglutide during the first week. The dose was escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg until they reached a maintenance dose of 3.0 mg after 4 weeks. The treatment period was 56 weeks. Subjects were also on CMS-IBT during the trial.</description>

          <title>Change in Short Form-36 v2.0 Acute (SF-36) (Subdomains)</title>
          <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the subject's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline in in the sub-domain scores is presented. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are evaluated based on in-trial data.</description>
