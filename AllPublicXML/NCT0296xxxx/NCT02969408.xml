  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3B, 12-week, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the relationship
      between albuterol sulfate (ABS) eMDPI and clinical asthma exacerbation (CAE) in adult
      participants at least 18 years of age with exacerbation-prone asthma. The ABS eMDPI dose will
      be 90 micrograms (mcg), 1 to 2 inhalations every 4 hours as needed, but participant dosing
      will not be limited to this dosing regimen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      relationship between albuterol dosing and CAE.

    <measure>Clinical Asthma Exacerbation (CAE) Rate: Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Moderate or Severe CAE</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CAE was an occurrence of either severe CAE or moderate CAE. Severe CAE was defined as a CAE that involved worsening asthma such that the treating physician elected to administer prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid treatment) at least 10 milligrams (mg) prednisone equivalent above Baseline, for at least 3 days; and an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization.
Moderate CAE was defined as a CAE that involved worsening asthma such that the treating physician elected to administer prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid treatment) at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above Baseline, for at least 3 days, or an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization associated with an increase in asthma therapy that did not qualify for severe CAE as defined above.</description>

    <measure>Total Number of Inhalations in the Days Preceding the Peak of a Severe CAE</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Severe CAE was defined as a CAE that involved worsening asthma such that the treating physician elected to administer prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid treatment) at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above Baseline, for at least 3 days; and an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization. Total number of inhalations taken in 1 day (that is, the 24-hour period on the day prior to the date of the CAE symptom peak) and at 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days preceding the date of the severe CAE symptom peak were reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Days Prior to the Peak of a Severe CAE When Albuterol Use Increased</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Severe CAE was defined as a CAE that involved worsening asthma such that the treating physician elected to administer prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid treatment) at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above Baseline, for at least 3 days; and an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization. Number of days prior to the peak of a severe CAE when albuterol use first increased to greater than (&gt;) 4, &gt;12, and &gt;20 inhalations was reported. Participants were counted in more than 1 category (that is, all of the &gt;20 inhalation participants were also counted in the &gt;12 category, and in the &gt;4 category).</description>

    <description>Severe CAE was defined as a CAE that involved worsening asthma such that the treating physician elected to administer prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid treatment) at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above Baseline, for at least 3 days; and an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization. Number of albuterol inhalations used in the 24 hours preceeding a severe CAE is reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by investigator. SAEs included death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of serious and non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in 'Reported Adverse Events module'.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has had at least 1 episode of a severe CAE over the past 12 months
             before screening. If on a biologic (for example, omalizumab, mepolizumab, or
             reslizumab) and/or post-bronchial thermoplasty, exacerbation has occurred after these
             interventions.

          -  The participant is using a moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) equivalent to at
             least 440 mcg daily of fluticasone propionate.

          -  The participant's baseline asthma therapy regimen, including oral corticosteroids,
             leukotriene antagonists, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, long-acting beta agonist (LABA),
             long-acting muscarinic agent, or cromolyn, biologicals, theophylline, or mepolizumab,
             is allowed.

          -  The participant must be willing and able to comply with study requirements as
             specified in the protocol, including the use of a wearable accelerometer for the
             subset of participants who consent to use of the device.

          -  The participant is willing to discontinue all other rescue or maintenance short-acting
             beta 2 agonist (SABA) or antimuscarinic agents and replace them with the
             study-provided ABS eMDPI for the duration of the trial.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or at least 2 years
             postmenopausal) must have exclusively same-sex partners or use a highly effective
             method of birth control and must agree to continue the use of this method for the
             duration of the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of the investigational
             medicinal product (IMP).

               -  Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has any clinically significant medical condition (treated or

          <title>ABS eMDPI</title>
          <description>Participants received 90 micrograms (mcg) of albuterol sulfate (ABS) via a multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) with an eModule (eMDPI) (sitting on the upper part of the device for the purposes of detecting and storing usage information), 1 to 2 inhalations every 4 hours, as needed for 12 weeks. ABS eMDPI was a rescue/reliever agent that included an eModule on top of the approved PROAIR RESPICLICK® inhaler. Participants were allowed to continue use of other asthma and non-asthma medications as advised by their physician without changes unless deemed necessary by their physician.</description>

        <description>CAE was an occurrence of either severe CAE or moderate CAE. Severe CAE was defined as a CAE that involved worsening asthma such that the treating physician elected to administer prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid treatment) at least 10 milligrams (mg) prednisone equivalent above Baseline, for at least 3 days; and an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization.
Moderate CAE was defined as a CAE that involved worsening asthma such that the treating physician elected to administer prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid treatment) at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above Baseline, for at least 3 days, or an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization associated with an increase in asthma therapy that did not qualify for severe CAE as defined above.</description>

          <title>Number of Days Prior to the Peak of a Severe CAE When Albuterol Use Increased</title>
          <description>Severe CAE was defined as a CAE that involved worsening asthma such that the treating physician elected to administer prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid treatment) at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent above Baseline, for at least 3 days; and an unscheduled provider visit such as an office visit, urgent care visit, emergency care visit, or hospitalization. Number of days prior to the peak of a severe CAE when albuterol use first increased to greater than (&gt;) 4, &gt;12, and &gt;20 inhalations was reported. Participants were counted in more than 1 category (that is, all of the &gt;20 inhalation participants were also counted in the &gt;12 category, and in the &gt;4 category).</description>
          <population>ITT analysis set included all enrolled participants regardless of whether a participant took any IMP. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed'= number of participants experiencing at least 1 severe CAE. 'Number analyzed'= participants who had any single day prior to CAE where their albuterol use exceeded 4, 12, or 20 inhalations in that day.</population>

        <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by investigator. SAEs included death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition.
