      This is a multicenter, open labeled, phase 2 clinical trial, where patients are stratified to
      one of two treatment groups based on upfront TP53 mutation status; i.e. TP53 mutated vs. TP53
      wt disease, and treated with dose-dense cyclphosphamide. Furthermore, patients included are
      stratified based on tumor stage; i.e. locally advanced breast cancer (M0 disease) or
      metastatic breast cancer (M1 disease). All participating cancer centers will prospectively
      include patients with breast cancer fulfilling the inclusion criteria.

      If patients do not respond to the experimental treatment as outlined in the protocol,
      treatment with dose-dense cyclophosphamide will be terminated, and further cancer treatment
      will continue at the treating oncologist's discretion. The response data for all patients who
      have received at least one chemotherapy course will be included in the final efficacy
      analysis.

      Tumor tissue, blood samples and radiology data will be collected before therapy starts, if
      therapy needs to be changed, and for patients with locally advanced breast cancer: at
      surgery. Response data will be evaluated closely during treatment, with clinical assessment
      of tumor size every two weeks for patients with locally advanced breast cancer and by
      radiology every eight weeks for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Evaluation of side
      effects/tolerance will be performed at every clinical visit, i.e. every two weeks for all
      patients included in the p53 trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage IV breast cancer (distant metastases) remains a non-curable condition; thus, treatment
      is considered palliative. However, many patients may live for years with their metastatic
      disease with a reasonably good quality of life. As for locally advanced primary breast
      cancers in need of primary medical therapy, lack of responsiveness to regular chemotherapy is
      associated with a poor prognosis, with a high risk of relapse and, subsequent, breast cancer
      death. TP53 mutations have been shown to predict a poor response to anthracyclines, a group
      of cytotoxic agents which is extensively used and which is in general efficacious in breast
      cancer. Notably, dose-intensification with cyclophosphamide has been found to significantly
      improve the response rate in TP53 mutated primary breast cancers. Our preliminary experience
      indicates that the use of dose-dense cyclophosphamide monotherapy every 2nd week with G-CSF
      support is well tolerated. As for patients with metastatic disease for whom the alternative
      would be to receive continuous chemotherapy at 3-weekly intervals the hypothesis is that
      cyclophosphamide given at 2-weekly intervals over a limited time period, followed by a
      &quot;treatment holiday&quot; among responders should be associated with a non-inferior quality of life
      all-over. As for patients with TP53 mutated locally advanced breast cancers where standard
      chemotherapy fails, the hypothesis is that cyclophosphamide dose dense treatment may be an
      effective treatment option downstaging the tumor prior to surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Locally advanced breast cancers in need of pre-surgical chemotherapy or metastatic
             breast cancer in need of chemotherapy.

          -  Resistance to endocrine therapy:

        Either i) estrogen and progesterone negative tumor, or ii) harboring an estrogen and / or
        progesterone positive tumor where regular endocrine therapies have failed or where the
        treating physician finds endocrine therapy not indicated.

        - Prior cancer therapy:

        Metastatic disease:

        First line treatment (amendment 2018):

        No prior chemotherapy*. Prior endocrine therapy +/- CDK4/6 inhibitor or mTOR inhibitors is
        allowed if hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative disease.

        Late-stage disease (approved protocol):

        i) Prior exposure to and resistance to a taxane regimen**. ii) Prior exposure to and
        resistance to an anthracycline regimen** -mandatory only for patients with TP53 wt tumors.

        LABC:

        i) Prior exposure to and lack of response to to a taxane regimen**. ii) Prior exposure to
        and lack of response to an anthracycline regimen** - mandatory only for patients with TP53
        wt tumors.

        * Only for patients with TP53 mutated disease. Previous adjuvant chemotherapy, including
        alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide a.o.) and/or platinum, is allowed if completed &gt;12
        months prior to inclusion in the trial.

        ** In metastatic breast cancer resistance to taxanes/anthracyclines is defined as
        progressive disease (PD). In LABC lack of response is defined as stable disease (SD) after
        4 courses of chemotherapy or PD. Breast cancer relapsing within 12 months subsequent to
        adjuvant taxanes or anthracyclines is considered resistant and re-exposure is not required
        prior to inclusion in the trial. This relates also to patients who could not receive proper
        taxane or anthracycline therapy due to side effects or other medical reasons.

          -  The primary tumor or at least one metastatic lesion must be available for biopsy
             collection at protocol inclusion. Notably; for patients with primary metastatic breast
             cancer, TP53 status should be determined in a metastatic deposit; tissue from the
             primary tumor may not substitute (this relates both to patients with synchronous and
             metachronous metastatic disease).

          -  Patients must have clinically and/or radiographically documented measurable breast
             cancer according to RECIST.

          -  WHO performance status 0-1

          -  Known tumor ER, PGR and HER2 status in the current situation, i.e. archival and
             historic breast cancer tissue can not be used for patients with relapse of the
             disease. However, patients can be included regardless of hormone receptor and HER2
             status; in case such information lacks at inclusion, it may be analysed on the biopsy
             retrospectively.

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Radiology studies (CT thorax/abdomen and bone scintigraphy/bone scan) and ecco cor
             must be performed within 28 days prior to start of treatment.

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to
             national and local regulations.

          -  Blood test requirements:

          -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.0 x 109/L

          -  Platelets &gt; 75 x 109/L

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 20 µmol/L.

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Co-morbidity that, based on the assessment of the treating physician, may preclude the
             use of cyclophosphamide at actual doses.

          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition(s) potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients.

          -  Clinical evidence of serious coagulopathy. Prior arterial/venous thrombosis or
             embolism does not exclude patients from inclusion, unless patient is considered unfit
             by study oncologist.

          -  Active cystitis (to be treated upfront)

          -  Active bacterial infections

          -  Urinary obstruction

          -  Known hypersensitivity towards cyclophosphamide or pegfilgrastim, their metabolites
             and other ingredients in the drug administration formulation.

          -  Patient not able to give an informed consent or comply with study regulations as
             deemed by study investigator.

          -  Amendment 2018: Patients with HER2 positive, metastatic breast cancer in the first
             line setting (Arm C).
