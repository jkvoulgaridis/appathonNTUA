    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate melflufen in combination with dexamethasone in the treatment of
      relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in adult patients with disease refractory to
      pomalidomide and/or an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. All patients in the study will be
      treated with melflufen on Day 1 and dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day
      cycle.

      Melphalan flufenamide (melflufen) is a peptide-drug conjugate that rapidly delivers an
      alkylating payload into tumor cells. Peptidases are expressed in several cancers, including
      solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Melphalan flufenamide is rapidly taken up by
      myeloma cells due to its high lipophilicity. Once inside the myeloma cell, the activity of
      melphalan flufenamide is determined by its immediate cleavage by peptidases into hydrophilic
      alkylator payloads that are entrapped. Melphalan flufenamide is 50-fold more potent than
      melphalan in myeloma cells in vitro due to increased intracellular alkylator concentration.
      It rapidly induces irreversible DNA damage leading to apoptosis of myeloma cells. Melphalan
      flufenamide displays cytotoxic activity against myeloma cell lines resistant to other
      treatments, including alkylators, in vitro. Melphalan flufenamide also has demonstrated
      inhibition of angiogenesis and DNA damage with a lack of functional DNA repair in preclinical
      studies.
