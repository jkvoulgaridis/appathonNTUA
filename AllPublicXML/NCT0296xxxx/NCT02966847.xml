  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the coming years, an increase in lung nodule resection is expected, particularly in
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). In some situations, it is necessary to use a
      device for locating these nodules. Meanwhile, the Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a
      tool whose use is constantly spreading.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using intraoperative CBCT to develop
      a new procedure for intraoperative localization of pulmonary nodules in video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery.
