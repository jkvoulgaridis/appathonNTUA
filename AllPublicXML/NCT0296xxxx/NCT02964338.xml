          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Monthly Average Number of CH Attacks at Week 4 and Week 12</title>
          <description>A CH attack was defined as a severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain lasting 15 to 180 minutes with either or both of the following 2 categories: 1) ≥1 of the following symptoms or signs, ipsilateral to the headache: -conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation; -nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea; -eyelid edema; -forehead and facial sweating; -forehead and facial flushing; -sensation of fullness in the ear; -miosis and/or ptosis. 2) a sense of restlessness or agitation. Mean change from baseline in monthly average number of CH attacks during 4-week period after administration of first dose of study drug (based on Week 0 to 4 data) and during 4-week period after administration of third dose of study drug (based on Week 8 to 12 data) is reported.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 10 days of postbaseline efficacy assessments by the Week 12 assessment. Here, 'Number analyzed' signifies participants evaluable at specified timepoint.</population>

Participants marked the level of CH-associated pain and indicated if pain is &quot;1=much worse,&quot; &quot;2=moderately worse,&quot; &quot;3=slightly worse,&quot; &quot;4=unchanged,&quot; &quot;5=slightly improved,&quot; &quot;6=moderately improved,&quot; or &quot;7=much improved&quot; compared with 4 weeks prior. PPSI was defined as the change in pain that corresponds with a minimal rating of &quot;5=slightly improved.&quot; Data at Week 1 was recorded on Day 7 in the electronic diary device at home. Week 12 data also included assessment at the early withdrawal visit for participants who discontinued the study early.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the Investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe as an AE that prevents usual activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the Investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

        <description>Coagulation parameters included: prothrombin time (PT) (seconds) and prothrombin international normalized ratio (INR). Shifts represented as Baseline - endpoint value (last observed post-baseline value). Shifts from baseline to endpoint were summarized using participant counts grouped into three categories: - Low (below normal range) - Normal (within the normal range of 9.4 to 12.5 seconds) - High (above normal range). Missing PT and prothrombin INR shift data are also presented. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

        <description>ECG parameters included: heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval corrected using the Fridericia formula (QTcF), QT interval corrected using the Bazett's formula (QTcB) and RR interval. Shifts represented as Baseline - endpoint value (last observed post-baseline value). Abnormal NCS indicated an abnormal but not clinically significant finding. Abnormal CS indicated an abnormal and clinically significant finding. Missing ECG shift data are also presented. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior as Assessed by the Electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS)</title>
        <description>eC-SSRS is a questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent, any self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent.</description>
