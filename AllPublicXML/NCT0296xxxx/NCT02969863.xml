  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct an outpatient study testing two configurations of the bionic pancreas (bi-hormonal
      and insulin-only) with and without remote monitoring of hypoglycemia in 25 adult (≥ 18 years
      of age) subjects with type 1 diabetes in a random-order crossover study versus usual care
      with an insulin pump with and without remote monitoring of hypoglycemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to measure the safety of eliminating the glycemic monitoring
      that the investigators have done in all of the previous outpatient studies under both insulin
      only and bihormonal bionic pancreas control. The investigators are planning to transition the
      outpatient studies to an integrated bionic pancreas, the iLet, in the near future. The
      intended use of this device does not include remote monitoring, which would not be feasible
      on a commercial scale. Therefore, in this trial the investigators will test the effects on
      hypoglycemia of eliminating blood glucose related monitoring. In addition, the investigators
      will perform a pilot trial testing the effects of the bionic pancreas on food intake,
      exercise, weight and body composition. The primary purpose of this pilot is to assess the
      feasibility of performing these measurements in the context of a larger trial and to collect
      data that can be used to power sub-studies of pivotal trials looking at these outcomes.
      Finally, the investigators will test the accuracy of two new CGM devices to see if they have
      sufficient accuracy to provide glucose data to the bionic pancreas. If so, this would provide
      new options for users who may have difficulties with the only currently validated CGM for
      this purpose, the Dexcom G4 AP / G5 platform.

             and the subject does not answer their telephone (up to two individuals can share this
             role, but they must be willing to carefully coordinate with each other and the subject
             so that one of them is clearly designated as having this responsibility at any given
             time)

          -  Willing to wear one or two infusion sets and one Dexcom CGM sensor and change sets
             frequently (at least one new glucagon infusion set daily during bi-hormonal arms, and

             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception Subjects must use

             and for the two weeks following the study.

        Acceptable contraception methods include: Oral contraceptive pill (OCP), Intrauterine
        Device (IUD, hormonal or copper), Male condoms, Female condoms, Diaphragm or cervical cap

             sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period
             of participation in the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the
             dose is stable and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia unawareness
             while taking that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics, even if by
             prescription, may be excluded according to the judgment of the principal investigator)

          -  History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia

             hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver, hemochromatosis,
             glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes significant compromise

             myocardial infarction, proximal LAD critical stenosis (Wellen's sign), prolonged QT
             interval (&gt; 440 ms). Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are not grounds for
             exclusion in the absence of symptoms or history of heart disease. A reassuring
             evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.

          <description>Subjects will wear the insulin only bionic pancreas, consisting of a Dexcom G4 CGM, an insulin pump, and an iPhone running the study algorithm. They will be monitored for CGM connectivity and hypoglycemia.
Monitored for hypoglycemia
Insulin Only Bionic Pancreas: Participants will wear a Bionic Pancreas that uses just insulin (insulin-only) to automate their glucose control based on continuous glucose monitor readings.
Monitored for Hypoglycemia: During half of the study arms (one each bihormonal bionic pancreas, insulin-only bionic pancreas and usual care) the subjects will be remotely monitored for device connectivity and hypoglycemia, and will be notified by study staff any time their continuous glucose monitor reads less than 50 mg/dl for 15 mintues.</description>
