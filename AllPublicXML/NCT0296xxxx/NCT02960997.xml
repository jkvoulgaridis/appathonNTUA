  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) simplex is a rare orphan disease caused by a mutation in DNA
      leading to abnormal dominant keratins in the skin. Patients with EB simplex develop lifelong
      painful thick soles on their feet, and current standard of care is supportive. This pilot
      study will target the dominant mutant keratin proteins in the skin to ameliorate the severity
      of EB simplex. The purpose is to improve the function of EB simplex feet with an application
      of topical sirolimus, 2%. The investigators plan on inhibiting the mTOR pathway to down
      regulate the translation of defective keratin proteins and work through anti proliferative
      pathways.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed 40 week pilot study being conducted is a prospective, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants will be assigned to treat both feet with
      either topical sirolimus, 2% cream daily or placebo (vehicle-control) for 12 weeks, followed
      by a 4 week washout period, then re-treatment to both feet will occur by the cross-over
      intervention.

      These studies will exploit the naturally occurring transcriptional regulation of keratin
      sequences, the known gene aberration causing EB simplex, and assess the potential for mTOR
      pathway inhibition in treatment of the patient's plantar lesions. The objective of this study
      is to assess (1) the safety of topical rapamycin for plantar lesions for the treatment of EB
      simplex, and 2) test if topical rapamycin to improves the clinical severity of lesional skin,
      including pain and itch, in subjects with EB simplex at the end of treatment versus baseline
      and compared to an intrasubject placebo treated control. Wound size measurement, quality of
      life evaluation will be assessed using epidermolysis bullosa (QOLEB), and EB disease activity
      and Scarring Index (EBDASI). With the results of this pilot study, physicians would be able
      to transition from supportive care (the current state of the art for EB simplex) to targeted
      molecular therapeutics, leading to improved mobility and quality of life for patients with EB
      simplex.

    <description>Quality of Life-Epidermolysis Bullosa (QOLEB) Questionnaire specifically designed for people with EB. The QOLEB can be used to identify everyday life occurrences negatively affected by EB. It assesses change in quality of life over time, an important measure when assessing the success of new treatments for EB. Scores from 0 to 51, with higher scores indicate greater impact of EB on quality of life. Data are reported per intervention.</description>

    <description>The EBDASI is a validated scoring system that objectively quantifies the severity of EB affecting the entire body. It has been designed to evaluate the response to new therapies for the treatment of EB. Scores range from 0 (absent of EB) to 10 (entire area involved).

    <description>The 5-D Pruritus Scale is a 1-page, 5-question tool used in clinical trials to assess 5 dimensions of background itch: degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution. Each question corresponds to 1 of the 5 dimensions of itch; participants were to rate their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the most affected. After the summation of individual score, the total score ranges from 5 (least affected) to 25 (most affected). Data are reported per intervention.</description>

Each question corresponds to 1 of the 5 dimensions of itch; participants were to rate their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the most affected. After the summation of individual score, the total score ranges from 5 (least affected) to 25 (most affected). Data are reported per intervention.</description>
