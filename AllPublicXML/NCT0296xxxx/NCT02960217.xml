    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, and Discontinuations Due to TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug through 30-35 days after final dose. Mean (SD) treatment duration was 65.7 (12.06) and 68.3 (7.04) days for double-blind UX007 and placebo, and 305.0 (122.71) days for open-label UX007.</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, whether or not considered drug related. Serious adverse events (SAE) was defined as an AE that at any dose, in the view of either the Investigator or Ultragenyx, results in any of the following outcomes: death; a life-threatening AE; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant incapacity or disability (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical event. All reported AEs with with a start date that occurred or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug in the corresponding treatment period and before the first dose of study drug in the next treatment period were defined as TEAEs. AEs were graded as 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life=threatening, 5=death.</description>

    <measure>Baseline and Post-Baseline Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Responses During Double-Blind Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a participant-rated questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent (yes or no responses). Positive responses (i.e., 'Yes') to C-SSRS questions correspond to events in these categories with the exception of the category 'No events'. Suicidal ideation includes the following subcategories: passive; active-nonspecific; active-method/no intent/no plan; active-intent/with or without method/no plan; active-method/intent/plan. Suicidal behavior includes the following subcategories: suicide attempt; interrupted attempt; aborted attempt; preparatory actions toward immanent suicidal behaviors; completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior category includes participants with positive responses in the category suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, whether or not considered drug related. Serious adverse events (SAE) was defined as an AE that at any dose, in the view of either the Investigator or Ultragenyx, results in any of the following outcomes: death; a life-threatening AE; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant incapacity or disability (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical event. All reported AEs with with a start date that occurred or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug in the corresponding treatment period and before the first dose of study drug in the next treatment period were defined as TEAEs. AEs were graded as 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life=threatening, 5=death.</description>

        <title>Baseline and Post-Baseline Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Responses During Double-Blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a participant-rated questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent (yes or no responses). Positive responses (i.e., 'Yes') to C-SSRS questions correspond to events in these categories with the exception of the category 'No events'. Suicidal ideation includes the following subcategories: passive; active-nonspecific; active-method/no intent/no plan; active-intent/with or without method/no plan; active-method/intent/plan. Suicidal behavior includes the following subcategories: suicide attempt; interrupted attempt; aborted attempt; preparatory actions toward immanent suicidal behaviors; completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior category includes participants with positive responses in the category suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior.</description>

        <title>Change From Period Baseline in PROMIS Health Assessment Questionnaire (Adult Form) Fatigue Score at Treatment Week 10</title>
        <description>The PROMIS was developed by the National Institutes of Health and uses domain-specific measures to assess patient well-being (Broderick et al. 2013; NIH 2015). It uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. For the Fatigue Domain, decreases in score indicate less fatigue.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS was developed by the National Institutes of Health and uses domain-specific measures to assess patient well-being (Broderick et al. 2013; NIH 2015).

For the Social Roles and Activities Domain, decreases in score indicate worse /less or decrease of performance in social roles and activities.</description>

        <title>Change From Period Baseline in PROMIS Health Assessment Questionnaire (Pediatric/Parent-Proxy Form) Fatigue Score at Treatment Week 10</title>
        <description>The PROMIS was developed by the National Institutes of Health and uses domain-specific measures to assess patient well-being (Broderick et al. 2013; NIH 2015) via parent/proxy. It uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. For the Fatigue Domain, decreases in score indicate less fatigue.</description>
