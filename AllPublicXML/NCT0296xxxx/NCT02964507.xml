  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a combination Phase I and Phase II study, with an aim to evaluate the combination of
      GSK525762 and fulvestrant in women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who
      have disease that has progressed after prior treatment with at least one line of endocrine
      therapy.

      The objectives of the study are to first identify, in open-label single-arm Phase I, a
      recommended Phase II dose of GSK525762 that may be combined safely with fulvestrant. Phase I
      will follow a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, and a sentinel group will
      be evaluated first for dose-limiting toxicity and further expanded to collect additional
      safety data. This will be followed by a double-blind, randomized controlled Phase II, to
      identify the clinical activity of the two study treatments when given in combination. The
      composition of Phase II will be selected at the end of Phase I.

      Approximately, up to 140 subjects and 154 subjects will receive study treatment in Phase I
      and Phase II respectively. A completed subject will be one who is followed until death.

          -  Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., unstable or uncompensated
             respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiac disease, or clinically significant bleeding
             episodes). Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical (aside from malignancy),
             psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subject's safety,

                  diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg found on 2 separate occasions
                  separated by 1 week, despite adequate therapy, will be defined as uncontrolled
                  hypertension.

               2. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (despite therapeutic; compliance to intervention)
                  as defined by a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level more than 8% and/or occurrence of

                  of study drug.

          -  Subjects with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral spread, that are at risk of
             life-threatening complications in the short term including subjects with massive
             uncontrolled effusions (pleural, pericardial, peritoneal), pulmonary lymphangitis, and
             over 50% of liver involvement in metastases.

             compression.

          -  Cardiac abnormalities as evidenced by any of the following: Baseline QT interval
             corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval &gt;=480 milliseconds (msec);
             Clinically significant conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias; Presence of cardiac
             pacemaker or defibrillator with a paced ventricular rhythm limiting electrocardiogram
             analysis; History or evidence of current &gt;=Class II congestive heart failure as
             defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA); History of acute coronary syndromes
             (including unstable angina and myocardial infarction), coronary angioplasty, or
             stenting within the past 3 months. Subjects with a history of stent placement
             requiring ongoing antithrombotic therapy (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel) will not be
             permitted to enroll; Clinically significant cardiomegaly, ventricular hypertrophy, or
             cardiomyopathy.

          -  Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or otherwise stable chronic liver disease
             per investigator assessment).

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening.

          -  History of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Any serious known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction(s) to GSK525762 or
             fulvestrant, or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to the investigational drugs.

          -  Hemoptysis &gt;1 teaspoon in 24 hours within the last 28 days.

          -  Concurrent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (except for cases
             where NSAIDs provide benefit over other analgesics and in these cases, consideration
             should be given to the prophylactic administration of a proton pump inhibitor) and
             high dose aspirin (allowed up to &lt;=100 milligrams orally daily).

          -  Subjects with history of known bleeding disorder(s) including clinically significant
             hemorrhage (e.g., gastrointestinal, neurologic), within the past 6 months.

          -  Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption,
             such as malabsorption syndrome, chronic gastrointestinal disease, or major resection
             of the stomach and/or bowels that could preclude adequate absorption of the study
             medication.
