  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium +
      olodaterol fixed-dose combination (FDC) (5 μg/ 5 μg) delivered by the RESPIMAT inhaler after
      single dose and at steady state in Chinese patients with COPD.

      The secondary objective is to assess the safety of tiotropium + olodaterol FDC (5 μg/ 5 μg)
      delivered by the RESPIMAT inhaler after 3 weeks once daily treatment in Chinese patients with
      COPD.

             history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion
             criterion No. 1).

          -  Patients being treated with oral or patch β-adrenergics.

          -  Patients being treated with oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e.,
             less than six weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg
             of prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day.

          -  Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than one hour per day and
             in the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen therapy
             during clinic visits.

          -  Patients who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior
             to the screening visit (Visit 1) or patients who are currently in a pulmonary
             rehabilitation program.

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives or
             within the wash out period (whichever is greater) prior to screening visit (Visit 1).

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to β-adrenergics and/or anticholinergic drugs,
             benzalkonium chloride (BAC), disodium edentate (EDTA) or any other component of the
             RESPIMAT inhalation solution.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using two highly effective methods of birth
             control*.

        Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically
        sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or post-menopausal for at least two
        years.

        * as per ICH M3: a highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which
        result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and
        correctly.

          -  Patients who have previously been allocated in this study or are currently
             participating in another study.

          -  Patients who are unable to comply with pulmonary medication restrictions prior to
             allocation.

      <recruitment_details>12 patients were entered to receive treatment with tiotropium+olodaterol fixed-dose combination (FDC) 5 microgram / 5 microgram (5 μg / 5 μg). All of the 12 entered patients were treated with trial medication.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Patients attended specialist sites which would then ensure that all patients met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients were not to be entered to trial treatment if any one of the specific entry criteria were not met.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Regarding AUC0-6 and RA,AUC0-6, the descriptive statistics of AUC0-6 could not be evaluated. Since the plasma concentrations of olodaterol and tiotropium was only quantifiable in less than two-thirds of the patients after 4 hours and 1 hour, respectively, and the descriptive statistics is calculated in case that 2/3 patients of total could be evaluated as defined in Clinical trial Protocol (CTP). And RA,AUC0-6 is the ratio of AUC0-6,ss to AUC0-6. So, the descriptive RA,AUC0-6 was not calculated either.</description>

        <description>Regarding AUC0-6 and RA,AUC0-6, the descriptive statistics of AUC0-6 could not be evaluated. Since the plasma concentrations of olodaterol and tiotropium was only quantifiable in less than two-thirds of the patients after 4 hours and 1 hour, respectively, and the descriptive statistics is calculated in case that 2/3 patients of total could be evaluated as defined in CTP. And RA,AUC0-6 is the ratio of AUC0-6,ss to AUC0-6. So, the descriptive RA,AUC0-6 was not calculated either.</description>
