      This trial studies how well different levels of nicotine in very low nicotine content
      cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) work in promoting smoking cessation in
      current daily and intermittent smokers. Different levels of nicotine may effect certain
      behaviors, including withdrawal symptoms, nicotine cravings, and mood and may lead to changes
      in smoking behavior, including finding it easier to quit smoking, in current daily and
      intermittent smokers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the effects of dual use of very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNCC)
      and electronic cigarettes (ECIG) on abuse liability (nicotine compensation and product use,
      liking, and relative reinforcing efficacy [RRE]) and toxicant exposure among daily (DS)
      smokers.

      II. To characterize the effects of dual use of VLNCC and ECIG on abuse liability (nicotine
      compensation and product use, liking, and RRE) and toxicant exposure among intermittent (ITS)
      smokers.

      III. To characterize the effects of dual product use on abuse liability using measure of
      withdrawal, craving, affect, and satisfaction (reinforcement).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To characterize the effects of dual use of VLNCC and JUUL ECIG on abuse liability
      (nicotine compensation and product use, liking, and RRE) and toxicant exposure among daily
      (DS) smokers.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Patients smoke their usual cigarettes brand during week 1.

      PHASE II: Patients smoke VLNCC cigarettes provided during weeks 2-4.

      PHASES III-IV: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients smoke ECIG-high (Hi) for 3 weeks and then ECIG-low (Lo) for 3 weeks

      ARM II: Patients smoke ECIG-Lo for 3 weeks and then ECIG-Hi for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.
