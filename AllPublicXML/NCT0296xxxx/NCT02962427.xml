      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of a sphenopalatine
      ganglion block to an epidural blood patch for post-dural puncture headache relief in
      randomized postpartum parturients over a 48 hour period. A known dural puncture is defined as
      free flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) during neuraxial placement. An unknown dural
      puncture is defined as neuraxial placement where free flow of CSF is not appreciated, however
      the patient is diagnosed with a post-dural puncture headache as defined by the International
      Classification of Headache Disorders.

    <measure>Change in The Numerical Rating Scale Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is commonly used to evaluate pain level in patients. It is presented as a numerical scale of 11 options, numbered 0-10, where the patient's pain intensity is represented by a number between the extremes of 0 = no pain at all to 10 = worst pain imaginable in numerical fashion. Its simplicity, reliability, and validity have made the NRS a useful tool for describing pain severity or intensity. The Investigators will consider a difference of 20% as a clinically significant change in pain score.</description>

    <description>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block: The patient is placed in the supine position. Four cc of 2% viscous lidocaine is placed to the level of the sphenopalatine ganglion with a 20 gauge angiocatheter along sterile swabs which were placed carefully into the patients nostrils bilaterally and lateral to the middle turbinate. It will be documented that the patient has no pain or paresthesia during or after the procedure. The swabs are withdrawn after 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Epidural Blood Patch: The patient is positioned in the sitting or lateral positon. Using aseptic technique, 20mL of autologous blood is drawn by a trained practitioner. The epidural placement is performed by a trained practitioner using aseptic technique and the vertebral space accessed is at or immediately below the original neuraxial placement. After entrance into the epidural space is confirmed with loss of resistance technique to either air or saline, 15-20 milliliters of sterile autologous venous blood is injected. After the procedure the patient rests supine for at least 1 hour. Patients are instructed to avoid heavy lifting, abdominal straining, or coughing for at least 48 hours.</description>

        <title>Change in The Numerical Rating Scale Pain Score</title>
        <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is commonly used to evaluate pain level in patients. It is presented as a numerical scale of 11 options, numbered 0-10, where the patient's pain intensity is represented by a number between the extremes of 0 = no pain at all to 10 = worst pain imaginable in numerical fashion. Its simplicity, reliability, and validity have made the NRS a useful tool for describing pain severity or intensity. The Investigators will consider a difference of 20% as a clinically significant change in pain score.</description>

            <description>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block: The patient is placed in the supine position. Four cc of 2% viscous lidocaine is placed to the level of the sphenopalatine ganglion with a 20 gauge angiocatheter along sterile swabs which were placed carefully into the patients nostrils bilaterally and lateral to the middle turbinate. It will be documented that the patient has no pain or paresthesia during or after the procedure. The swabs are withdrawn after 30 minutes.

            <description>Epidural Blood Patch: The patient is positioned in the sitting or lateral positon. Using aseptic technique, 20mL of autologous blood is drawn by a trained practitioner. The epidural placement is performed by a trained practitioner using aseptic technique and the vertebral space accessed is at or immediately below the original neuraxial placement. After entrance into the epidural space is confirmed with loss of resistance technique to either air or saline, 15-20 milliliters of sterile autologous venous blood is injected. After the procedure the patient rests supine for at least 1 hour. Patients are instructed to avoid heavy lifting, abdominal straining, or coughing for at least 48 hours.
