  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI) is a classic and standard method for some special patients
      which is also difficult for anesthesiologists to learn and master. The procedure is sometimes
      hard and often takes about 20-30 min. Most of patients have a strong sense of discomfort.
      Investigators conducted the research to study the simplification and feasibility of AFOI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have studied the sedative drugs and regional anesthesia related to awake
      intubation. However, several problems of AFOI are existing including long operation time,
      patients' strong discomfort, coughing and resistance. And, to investigators' knowledge, there
      was a lack of a fixed procedure for the implementation of AFOI. Investigators conducted the
      research and aimed to study the simplification and feasibility of a new AFOI method based on
      years of clinical theory, practice and experience.

    <description>With forty patients (ASA I~II, aged 18~75, simulating cervical instability injury) recruited to be operated on under general anesthesia, two experienced anesthesiologists performed the whole procedures within the study. Pre anesthetic interview was taken to illustrate the procedures of tracheal intubation to the patients. The simplified method consisted of three parts: conscious sedation, regional anesthesia and intubation. The time of AFOI, rate of one-time intubation success, hemodynamic parameters, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), rate of amnesia of the intubation, patients' satisfaction, and relative complications were recorded accordingly.</description>
