    <textblock>
      Within the present study 4 different band-aid/adhesive combinations will be tested in
      patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes with regard to adherence to the body and
      allergic potential. The study period is set to 21 days following adhesive material placement
      to cover the maximum expected wear-time of the novel CGM system (14 days) plus an additional
      seven days to ensure that adhesive material is tested for a sufficient time-period and
      differences in adhesion can clearly be observed.
