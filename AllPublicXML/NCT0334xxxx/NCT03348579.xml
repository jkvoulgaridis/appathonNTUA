  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hospital-acquired pneumonia are a common disease in intensive care unit. The prevention, the
      diagnosis and the treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia are a frequent challenge.
      Nevertheless it seems that there are great differences in standard of care between hospitals.
      The investigators hypothesized that medical education and implementation of evidence-base
      guidelines can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in patients presenting of
      hospital acquired pneumonia

      The before period (phase 1) will consist of all consecutive patients admitted to the
      participating ICUs before the national guidelines publication concerning healthcare
      associated pneumonia.

      The second period (phase 2) will consist of all consecutive patients admitted to the
      participating ICUs after the publication of the national guidelines publication concerning
      healthcare associated pneumonia.

      Afterward, an interphase will occur during which all physicians, residents, physiotherapists
      and nurses will receive a formal training for the processes and procedures related to the new
      guidelines published in september 2017.

      In the intervention group, on top of the standard training, the centers receive an analysis
      of the evolution of the practices of their center and the future of their patients between
      phases 1 and 2, as well as these same values for the data set. The centers are then called to
      conduct a meeting to determine their priority improvement points based on this audit.

      The third and final period (phase 3) will consist of all consecutive patients admitted to the
      participating ICUs after the formal training.

    <description>Intensive care units are randomized in two groups:
Standard training: The centers will receive the text of the recommendation electronically. The principal investigator of each center will then train doctors, interns, nurses and physiotherapists to the use of these recommendations (team leader). A computer presentation common to all the centers will be used and a communication strategy vis-à-vis the other caregivers of the investigative services will be put in place. All doctors, interns and nurses must have attended this theoretical training during the awareness phase.</description>
