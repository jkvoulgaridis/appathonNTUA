      This is a first-in-human, Phase I, multicenter, open label, dose escalation study to evaluate
      the DLTs and MTD and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CPX-POM administered
      IV in patients with any histologically- or cytologically-confirmed solid tumor type.

      The study will initially employ an accelerated escalation design, with a single patient
      enrolled in each cohort (i.e., Single-Patient Cohorts). The initial patient will receive
      CPX-POM at a starting dose of 30 mg/m2. Doses will be escalated (doubling), until a ≥Grade 2
      toxicity (with the exception of alopecia), is encountered. Subsequently that and all
      subsequent cohorts will follow a classical &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose escalation design.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ciclopirox phosphoryloxymethyl ester (CPX-POM) administered intravenously (IV) and establish the CPX POM dose recommended for further investigation.
A DLT will include some Grade 3 or 4 AEs if deemed related to study drug. In addition, any patient who is unable to receive 80% of the expected dose of CPX-POM (i.e., patients who are unable to receive at least 4 of the 5 scheduled doses) because of AEs will be considered to have a DLT.
In order to identify any DLTs, safety assessments including AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests will be conducted during each study visit through Day 22.
The MTD is defined as the dose BELOW that dose which causes DLTs in ≥33% of patients.</description>

               3. Neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 by CTCAE criteria

               4. Heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) ≥ III

        Exclusion Criteria Include:

        Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this
        study

          1. Patient has a history of risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome) or requires the use of concomitant
             medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval during study participation. Patients
             should not receive anti-emetic medications before and following Dose 1 of Cycle 1 for
             each treatment cohort. However, anti-emetics such as ondansetron or granisetron that
             have a mild QTc prolonging effect are allowed starting with Dose 2 of Cycle 1, if used
             with caution and attention to the approved labelling.

          2. Patient has an abnormal cardiac appearance/heart size, as evidenced by chest X-ray or
             computed tomography (CT) scan.

          3. Patient has an uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical condition (including
             uncontrolled brain metastases). Patients with stable brain metastases either treated
             or being treated with a stable dose of steroids/anticonvulsants, with no dose change
             within 4 weeks before the first dose of CPX-POM and no anticipated dose change, are
             allowed. The decision to exclude a patient from the study for an uncontrolled or
             severe intercurrent medical condition will be made by the Principal Investigator.
             Examples could include epilepsy, resistant infection, or any other neurological
             disease that would make clinical assessment difficult.

          4. Patient underwent major surgery within 4 weeks before the first dose of CPX-POM or
             received cancer-directed therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy,
             biologic or immunotherapy, etc.) or an drug or device within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             mitomycin C and nitrosoureas) or 5 half-lives of that agent (whichever is shorter)
             before the first dose of CPX-POM. A minimum of 10 days between termination of the
             investigational drug and administration of CPX-POM is required. In addition, any
             drug-related toxicity, with the exception of alopecia, should have recovered to ≤Grade
             1.

          5. If female, patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          6. Patient has evidence of a serious active infection (e.g., infection requiring
             treatment with intravenous antibiotics).

          7. Patient has active Hepatitis A infection.

          8. Patient known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis B or C infection, as
             such patients may be at increased risk for toxicity due to concomitant treatment and
             disease-related symptoms may preclude accurate assessment of the safety of CPX POM.

          9. Patient has an important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would increase the risk of participating in this study.

         10. Patient is taking warfarin.

         11. Patient has a history of other malignancy treated with curative intent within the
             previous 5 years with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with previous invasive cancers are eligible
             if the treatment was completed more than 5 years prior to initiating current study
             treatment, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease.

         12. Patient has known allergy or hypersensitivity to components of CPX-POM.

         13. Patient is taking any iron replacement therapy administered IV, IM, or orally due to
             the potential for loss of anticancer activity due to drug and metabolites chelating
             iron.

        Exclusion criteria for Expansion cohort:

        Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        Expansion Cohort of this study.

          1. Baseline GFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m^2.

          3. Patients may not have concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis)
             invasive urothelial carcinoma. Patients with history of non-invasive (Ta, Tis) upper
             tract urothelial carcinoma that has been definitively treated with at least one
             post-treatment disease assessment (i.e. cytology, biopsy, imaging) that demonstrates
             no evidence of residual disease are eligible.

          4. Patients may not have another malignancy that could interfere with the evaluation of
             safety or efficacy of the study drugs. Patients with a prior malignancy will be
             allowed without study chair approval in the following circumstances:

               1. Not currently active and diagnosed at least 3 years prior to the date of

             injury or specific anti-cancer treatment ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or
             patients who have had percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device ≤ 1
             week prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from side effects of such
             procedure or injury.

          6. Patients must not have clinically significant cardiac disease.

          7. Patients may not have chronic active liver disease or evidence of acute or chronic
             Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV).

             solid organ transplant, pneumonitis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) that requires
             chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             medications (NSAIDS) for the treatment of osteoarthritis and uric acid synthesis
             inhibitors for the treatment of gout are permitted.

         10. Patients with any serious and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions (e.g..,
             active or uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled diabetes) or psychiatric illness that
             could, in the investigator's opinion, cause unacceptable safety risks or potentially
             interfere with the completion of the treatment according to the protocol are not
             eligible.

         11. Patients may not have any live viral vaccine used for prevention of infectious
