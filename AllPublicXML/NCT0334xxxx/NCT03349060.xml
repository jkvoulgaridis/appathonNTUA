  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B7451012 is a Phase 3 study to evaluate PF-04965842 in patients aged 12 years and older with
      a minimum body weight of 40 kg who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The efficacy
      and safety of two dosage strengths of PF-04965842, 100 mg and 200 mg taken orally once daily,
      will be evaluated relative to placebo over 12 weeks of study participation. Eligible patients
      will have an option to enter a long-term extension study after completing 12 weeks of
      treatment.

Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Responses to 5 dimensions comprised a health state/a single utility index value. E.g. if a participant responded &quot;no problems&quot; for each 5 dimensions, then health state was coded as &quot;11111&quot; with a predefined index value to it. Every health state (coded as combination of responses on each of 5 dimensions) had a unique predefined utility index value assigned to it, by EuroQol. US value sets (with all possible health states) was used for adults in the study, range from 1 to -0.109. Higher (positive) scores = better health state.</description>

        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD) Total Score at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12: Full Analysis Set</title>
        <description>PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [lighter or darker], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

        <description>PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [lighter or darker], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index Response of &gt;=75% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4 and 8</title>
          <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>IGA assesses severity of AD on a 5 point scale (0 to 4, higher scores indicate more severity). Scores: 0= clear, no inflammatory signs of AD; 1= almost clear, AD not fully cleared- light pink residual lesions (except post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), just perceptible erythema, papulation/induration lichenification, excoriation, and no oozing/crusting; 2= mild AD with light red lesions, slight but definite erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and no oozing/crusting; 3= moderate AD with red lesions, moderate erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and slight oozing/crusting; 4= severe AD with deep dark red lesions, severe erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and moderate to severe oozing/crusting. Assessment excluded sole, palms and scalp.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index Response of &gt;=50% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index Response of &gt;=90% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index Response of 100% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in the affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Percentage Body Surface Area Less Than (&lt;) 5% at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
          <description>4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in the affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limb, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limb. % BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Response of &gt;=50% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none=0, mild=1, moderate=2,severe=3. The severity scores were summed to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale (VAS) where &quot;0&quot; = no itch/no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch/sleeplessness, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Response of &gt;=50% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
          <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none=0, mild=1, moderate=2,severe=3. The severity scores were summed to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale (VAS) where &quot;0&quot; = no itch/no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch/sleeplessness, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Response of &gt;=75% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). The severity scores added to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where &quot;0&quot; = no itch or no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch or sleeplessness, higher scores worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD = worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Response of &gt;=75% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
          <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). The severity scores added to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where &quot;0&quot; = no itch or no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch or sleeplessness, higher scores worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD = worse outcome.</description>

        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). The severity scores added to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where &quot;0&quot; = no itch or no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch or sleeplessness, higher scores worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD = worse outcome.</description>

Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where &quot;0&quot; = no itch or no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch or sleeplessness, higher scores worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD = worse outcome.</description>

        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). The severity scores added to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where &quot;0&quot; = no itch or no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch or sleeplessness, higher scores worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD = worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving &gt;=1 Point Improvement From Baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [lighter or darker], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's (aged above 17 years) quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions added up to give DLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Here, “Overall Number of Participants Analyzed” signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on adolescents (aged 12-17 years) quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. CDLQI total score was the sum of individual scores of question 1-10 and ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of children.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Here, “Overall Number of Participants Analyzed” signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Baseline Dermatology Life Quality Index Score &gt;=2 and Achieving &lt;2 DLQI Score at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's (aged above 17 years) quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions added up to give DLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

        <description>CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on adolescents (aged 12-17 years) quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. CDLQI total score was the sum of individual scores of question 1-10 and ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of children.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Baseline Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index Score &gt;=2 and Achieving &lt;2 CDLQI Score at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
          <description>CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on adolescents (aged 12-17 years) quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. CDLQI total score was the sum of individual scores of question 1-10 and ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of children.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Here, “Overall Number of Participants Analyzed” signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure and &quot;Number Analyzed” signifies number of participants evaluable at specified time points.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Baseline Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index Score &gt;=2.5 and Achieving &gt;=2.5 Point Improvement From Baseline in CDLQI Score at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on adolescents (aged 12-17 years) quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. CDLQI total score was the sum of individual scores of question 1-10 and ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of children.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): Depression Subscale at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-D: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of depression) to 21 (severe feeling of depression); higher score indicating greater severity of depression symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: Anxiety Subscale at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-A: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of anxiety) to 21 (severe feeling of anxiety); higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With &gt;=8 Points at Baseline and Achieving Score of &lt;8 Points in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: Anxiety Subscale at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-A: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of anxiety) to 21 (severe feeling of anxiety); higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With &gt;=8 Points at Baseline and Achieving Score of &lt;8 Points in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: Depression Subscale at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-D: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of depression) to 21 (severe feeling of depression); higher score indicating greater severity of depression symptoms.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With &gt;=11 Points at Baseline and Achieving Score of &lt;11 Points in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: Anxiety Subscale at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-A: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of anxiety) to 21 (severe feeling of anxiety); higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With &gt;=11 Points at Baseline and Achieving Score of &lt;11 Points in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: Depression Subscale at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-D: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of depression) to 21 (severe feeling of depression); higher score indicating greater severity of depression symptoms.</description>

        <description>POEM is a 7-item participant reported outcome (PRO) measure used to assess the impact of AD (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping) over the past week. Each item is scored as &quot;no days (0)&quot;, &quot;1-2 days (1)&quot;, &quot;3-4 days (2)&quot;, &quot;5-6 days (3)&quot; and &quot;every day (4)&quot;. The score ranges from 0 to 28, where higher score indicated greater severity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
          <description>POEM is a 7-item participant reported outcome (PRO) measure used to assess the impact of AD (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping) over the past week. Each item is scored as &quot;no days (0)&quot;, &quot;1-2 days (1)&quot;, &quot;3-4 days (2)&quot;, &quot;5-6 days (3)&quot; and &quot;every day (4)&quot;. The score ranges from 0 to 28, where higher score indicated greater severity.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Here, “Overall Number of Participants Analyzed” signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L): Index Value at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant (aged &gt;17 years) completed questionnaire consisted of 2 components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile had 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Responses to 5 dimensions comprised a health state/a single utility index value. E.g. if a participant responded &quot;no problems&quot; for each 5 dimensions, then health state was coded as &quot;11111&quot; with a predefined index value to it. Every health state (coded as combination of responses on each of 5 dimensions) had a unique predefined utility index value assigned to it, by EuroQol. US value sets (with all possible health states) was used for adults in the study, range from 1 to -0.109. Higher (positive) scores = better health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L)- Visual Analogue Scale Score at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D VAS was used to record a participant's (aged above 17 years) rating for his/her current health-related quality of life state and captured on a vertical VAS (0-100), where 0 = worst imaginable health state and 100 = best imaginable health state.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Here, “Overall Number of Participants Analyzed” signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension Youth Scale (EQ-5D-Y): Index Value at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-Y: standardized participant (aged 12-17 years) completed questionnaire consisted of 2 components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile had 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Responses to 5 dimensions comprised a health state/a single utility index value. E.g. if a participant responded &quot;no problems&quot; for each 5 dimensions, then health state was coded as &quot;11111&quot; with a predefined index value to it. Every health state (coded as combination of responses on each of 5 dimensions) had a unique predefined utility index value assigned to it, by EuroQol. UK value sets (with all possible health states) was used for adolescents in the study, range from 1 to -0.594. Higher (positive) scores = better health state.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-Y is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score specifically developed and validated for use by youths age 12-17 years. EQ-5D-Y consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D VAS was used to record a participant's rating for his/her current health-related quality of life state and captured on a vertical VAS (0-100), where 0 = worst imaginable health state and 100 = best imaginable health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) at Week 12</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants (aged above 17 years) scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated) greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (the best score) where higher scores indicated better overall health status (less fatigue).</description>

          <description>Peds-FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire for adolescents of 12-17 years of age. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). Higher the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the Peds-FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (the best score) where higher scores indicated better overall health status (less fatigue).</description>
