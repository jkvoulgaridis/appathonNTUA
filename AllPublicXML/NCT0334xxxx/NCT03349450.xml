      This is a Phase 2 non-randomized, open label, uncontrolled, efficacy and safety study. Study
      participants will receive two priming doses of 0.5mL of DPX-Survivac 21 days apart and up to
      six 0.1ml maintenance injections every two months with low dose metronomic oral
      cyclophosphamide (50 mg BID) for one year or until disease progression, whichever occurs
      first.

      Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered every 3 weeks for up to one year or until disease
      progression, whichever occurs first.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomized, open-label, uncontrolled, efficacy and safety trial.

      Participants will receive 2 priming injections (0.5ml) of DPX-Survivac 3 weeks apart on Study
      Days 7 and 28. In addition, up to 6 maintenance injections (0.1ml) over the course of the
      study occurring on Study Days 84, 140, 196, 252, 308, and 364. All injections will be given
      under the skin of the upper thigh.

      Participants will receive metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50mg BID; 7 days on / 7 days off)
      for study period.

      Pembrolizumab 200mg will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks, commencing on study day
      7, to a total of 18 infusions.

      If a participant is removed from the trial prior to the completion of at least 4 doses of
      Pembrolizumab and 3 injections of DPX-Survivac, that particiapnt may be replaced to determine
      the efficacy of treatment in a minimum of 16 participants.

      DPX-Survivac injection sites will be evaluated throughout the study and if evidence of
      significant reaction, an Injection site reaction biopsy will be sought.

      During the course of the study, blood will be drawn to evaluate immune cells and the effect
      that DPX Survivac will have on the participants immune system. During all treatment cycles a
      physical exam and questions about the participants general health will be performed.

      Participants will undergo &quot;re-staging&quot; to assess the status of their disease at approximately
      study day 70 (if there is evidence of Grade 2 or greater injection site reaction or
      ulceration evident on study day 49) or routinely at approximately study day 91, and again at
      end of study or study withdrawal for all participants.

      A follow-up tumour biopsy will be requested between study day 77-83 for participants with any
      grade 2 or greater Injection site reaction or ulceration on SD49 or between SD98 and SD104 if
      no evidence of injection site reaction or ulceration.

      Upon completion of study, participants will be monitored every 2 months for 1 year.

          1. Subjects with histologically proven recurrent DLBCL. Subjects may have recurrence
             after primary, secondary or tertiary treatment regimens for DLBCL.

          2. Subjects with recurrence at least 90 days post aggressive first line combination

             therapy are eligible.

          3. Patients with partial response or measureable disease after first line therapy (who
             are not candidates for ASCT) or after second or third line therapy without disease
             progression may also be eligible. Patients with recurrence any time after
             non-aggressive combination or single agent therapy with or without Rituximab (ie. CVP,
             CHL or, VP16) for first, second or third line disease are eligible.

        Patients may have evidence of transformed lymphoma with past history of indolent lymphoma
        provided current biopsy shows DLBCL. Patients with double hit or high grade lymphomas
        including Burkitts lymphoma and High Grade B-Cell lymphoma unclassifiable (with features
        intermediate between Burkitts and diffuse large B cell lymphoma) are eligible.

          4. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained (up to 3 month prior to Day 0)
             biopsy of a tumour lesion. If this is not available, the patient must be willing to
             undergo a core biopsy prior to starting treatment. They must also be willing to
             provide an on-treatment biopsy. Note: Pre-Treatment biopsy's that extend 7 days past

             limit of normal and/or reduced GFR of 50-100% normal range can be considered for
             enrolment if the alteration is due to lymphoma.

             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication (day
             0). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
             pregnancy test will be required.

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course

             Association class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the

         26. Allergies to any vaccine, that after discussion with the medical monitor are serious
             enough to warrant exclusion from this study.

         27. Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
