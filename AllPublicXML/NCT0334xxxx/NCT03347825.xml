  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate and compare peri-operative outcomes of
      lobectomy compare with different approaches. The study aims to include patients with stage
      IA, IB, IIA, IIB and IIIA lung cancer that underwent lobectomy via robotic-assisted, VATS and
      open approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, retrospective chart review study of all consecutive lobectomies
      performed for clinical stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB and IIIA lung cancer, performed by
      participating surgeons at their respective institutions that meet all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. All cases of lobectomy performed for clinical stages, IA, IB, IIA, IIB and IIIA
      lung cancer via robotic-assisted, VATS (video assisted thoracic surgery) and open approach
      that meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be considered for inclusion in the
      study. The chart review and data collection will be performed in a reverse chronological
      order starting at 30 days prior to IRB approval of the study at the institution and going
      back to 2013 (i.e most current data in 2017 and chronologically going back through 2013). The
      retrospective chart review and data collection is anticipated to occur in two phases:

      Baseline patient characteristics, perioperative and post-operative short term clinical and
      pathological outcomes data will be obtained from hospital records. Each participating
      institution will contribute approximately 100-800 cases from one or more surgeons. Since the
      data will have been de-identified, and is archival in nature, there will be no active subject
      recruitment and no patient consenting is required
