  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with unresectable peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer is
      poor. These patients may obtain survival benefit from radical gastrectomy and cytoreductive
      surgery (CRS). The response rates of previous conversion therapy are low. Hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) and systemic chemotherapy are effective methods of
      reducing peritoneal cancer index (PCI) levels. Apatinib, a novel targeted inhibitor of VEGF
      receptor 2 (VEGFR2), shows significant antitumor activity in the patients with gastric
      cancer. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of HIPEC and
      systemic chemotherapy combined with Apatinib in the conversion therapy of peritoneal
      metastases from gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy and safety of HIPEC and systemic chemotherapy combined with
      Apatinib in the conversion therapy of peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer, patients
      undergo HIPEC with Docetaxel/ Lobaplatin at the time of fist surgery and twice repeat within
      one week after the surgery, following 2 cycles of 3-week Oxaliplatin/S1 chemotherapy combined
      with Apatinib and 1 cycles of 3-week Oxaliplatin/S1 chemotherapy. The second surgery,
      exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy, is carried out one week later after the series of
      systemic chemotherapy.
