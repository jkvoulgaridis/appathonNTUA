  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore the capacity for a lifestyle modification in firefighters to improve
      blood pressure, blood vessel stiffness, inflammation, and reduce oxidative stress. The study
      will be a pre- post-testing controlled trial with three groups. The intervention will be a
      weekly circuit workout program and a Mediterranean (high fruit/vegetable) diet. The groups
      will be firefighters with &gt;10yrs experience, firefighters with &lt;10yrs experience, and control
      Non-firefighters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent statistics from the American Heart Association (AHA) have reported that &gt;92% of adults
      in the U.S. meet at least 1 metric for cardiovascular disease risk factors. In firefighters,
      this increased risk is especially concerning. The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)
      estimates there are around 1.3 million firefighters in the United States, 70% of which are
      volunteer. The prevalence of impaired cardiovascular health is higher in firefighters than in
      the general population and the leading line-of-duty death (LODD) cause is cardiac related. It
      is known that exercise and diet mitigate cardiovascular disease risk. Meeting the physical
      activity guidelines remains a target of ideal cardiovascular health and a major public health
      concern. However, the NFPA does not require volunteer fire companies to have a fitness
      program for their crew, and sadly less than a third of the stations actually do. And
      importantly, cardiovascular-related LODD remains a major issue in the firefighter population.
      The results could guide clinical treatment for firefighters and may therefore reduce
      cardiac-related LODD.
