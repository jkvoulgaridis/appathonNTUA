  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating X-linked disease which leads to loss of
      ambulation between ages 7 and 13, respiratory failure and cardiomyopathy (CM) at any age, and
      inevitably premature death of affected young men in their late twenties. DMD is the most
      common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood. It affects approximately 1 in every
      3,500 live male births across all races and cultures, and results in 20,000 new cases each
      year worldwide.Significant advances in respiratory care have unmasked CM as the leading cause
      of death. As there are yet no specific cardiac treatments to extend life, the current study
      aims to address this unmet medical need using a new therapeutic strategy for patients with
      DMD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study with an
      optional open-label extension to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of
      two doses of oral ifetroban in subjects with DMD. DMD patients who meet the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will receive oral ifetroban or placebo once daily
      for 12 months. Subjects will be enrolled onto one of three treatment groups, low-dose
      ifetroban, high-dose ifetroban or placebo. Each dose level will be evaluated by eight
      subjects with early stage (LVEF &gt; 45%) DMD-associated cardiomyopathy and eight subjects with
      more advanced stage (LVEF 35-45%) cardiac disease as there may be differences in the
      treatment effect based on cardiac involvement. Each subject treated will be evaluated for
      first-dose and steady-state exposure PK. All subjects who receive treatment will be assessed
      for safety. All subjects with at least one efficacy assessment post-baseline will be
      evaluated for efficacy. Blood and urine will be collected for standard and novel cardiac
      biomarkers.

    <description>The 23 items Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedQL) questionnaire measures these core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization, as well as role (school) functioning. Items measured include 1) Physical Functioning (8 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (5 items), and 4) School Functioning (5 items). Each item is measured on a 5 point Likert scale with 0 indicating never and 4 indicating almost always.The Likert scores are reversed scored and linearly transform to a 0-100 scale with 0=100, 1-75, 2=50, 5=25, and 4=0. A higher score indicates better health-related quality of life.</description>
