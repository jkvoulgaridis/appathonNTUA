    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Substudy 1:

          -  Participant who receive double-blind treatment in Study M14-431 or Study M14-433 and
             achieve clinical response.

          -  Participant completes study procedures in the parent study. The final endoscopy for
             Studies M14-431 or M14-433 may be missing, if the endoscopy cannot be performed during
             the COVID-19 pandemic.

        For Substudy 2:

          -  Participant completes Substudy 1. The Week 52 endoscopy may be missing, if the
             endoscopy cannot be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

          -  Participant who receive open-label upadacitinib Dose B in Study M14-431 and achieve
             clinical response.

          -  Participant completes study procedures in the parent study/substudy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For Sub-studies 1 and 2:

          -  Participant is considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable
             candidate for the study.

          -  Participant who has a known hypersensitivity to upadacitinib or its excipients, or had
             an adverse event during Studies M14-431 and M14-433 or Substudy 1 of Study M14-430
             that in the investigator's judgment makes the subject unsuitable for this study.

          -  Participant with any active or chronic recurring infections based on the
             investigator's assessment that makes the subject an unsuitable candidate for the
             study. Subjects with ongoing infections undergoing treatment may be enrolled BUT NOT
             dosed until the infection treatment has been completed and the infection is cured,
             based on the investigator's assessment.

          -  Participants with high grade colonic dysplasia or malignancy diagnosed at the
             endoscopy performed at the final visit of Studies M14-431, M14-433 or Substudy 1 of
