  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sugammadex when
      administered according to actual body weight (ABW) as compared to ideal body weight (IBW) for
      the reversal of both moderate and deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by either
      Rocuronium or Vecuronium in morbidly obese participants. The primary hypothesis of this
      investigation is that, compared to obese participants dosed based on IBW, obese participants
      receiving Sugammadex according to ABW will demonstrate a faster time to recovery to a Train
      Of Four (TOF) ratio of ≥0.9 (i.e. faster NMB reversal), pooled across NMB depth and type of
      neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA; Rocuronium or Vecuronium) administered.

    <measure>Time to Recovery (TTR) of Participant Train Of Four (TOF) Ratio to ≥0.9: Primary Kaplan-Meier Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 76 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy analysis of TTR of TOF ratio to ≥0.9 was performed by estimating event rates within each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier method. TTR was monitored by applying electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to magnitudes of the first and fourth twitches respectively, after nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (TOF; expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster TTR of the TOF ratio to 0.9 indicates faster recovery from NMB. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Prolonged (&gt;10 Minutes) Time to Recovery (TTR) of the Train Of Four (TOF) Ratio to ≥0.9</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 76 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Following administration of study intervention, the percentage of participants experiencing prolonged (&gt;10 minutes) recovery to a TOF ratio ≥0.9 was calculated. TTR was monitored by applying electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to magnitudes of the first and fourth twitches respectively, after nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (TOF; expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster TTR of the TOF ratio to 0.9 indicates faster recovery from NMB. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

        <title>Time to Recovery (TTR) of Participant Train Of Four (TOF) Ratio to ≥0.9: Primary Kaplan-Meier Analysis</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy analysis of TTR of TOF ratio to ≥0.9 was performed by estimating event rates within each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier method. TTR was monitored by applying electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to magnitudes of the first and fourth twitches respectively, after nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (TOF; expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster TTR of the TOF ratio to 0.9 indicates faster recovery from NMB. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

        <population>All randomized participants dosed with both an NMBA and an NMB reversal agent (study treatment) with ≥1 post-randomization efficacy assessment.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Sinus Bradycardia Events</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants experiencing treatment-emergent bradycardia events were identified with continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Treatment-emergent sinus bradycardia is defined as a heart rate &lt;60 bpm that has also decreased more than 20% compared to participant baseline heart rate value, sustained for at least 1 minute after administration of study intervention. Treatment-emergent sinus bradycardia events may or may not be considered an adverse event (AE), as determined by investigator judgment. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Sinus Tachycardia Events</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants experiencing treatment-emergent sinus tachycardia events were identified with continuous ECG monitoring. Treatment-emergent sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate ≥100 bpm that has also increased more than 20% compared to participant baseline heart rate value, sustained for at least 1 minute after administration of study intervention. Treatment-emergent sinus tachycardia events may or may not be considered an AE, as determined by investigator judgment. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE) After Administration of Study Intervention</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants experiencing an AE following administration of study intervention was monitored. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence, symptom, or disease witnessed in a participant, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study treatment can be demonstrated. Further, any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study treatment is also considered an AE. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Prolonged (&gt;10 Minutes) Time to Recovery (TTR) of the Train Of Four (TOF) Ratio to ≥0.9</title>
        <description>Following administration of study intervention, the percentage of participants experiencing prolonged (&gt;10 minutes) recovery to a TOF ratio ≥0.9 was calculated. TTR was monitored by applying electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to magnitudes of the first and fourth twitches respectively, after nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (TOF; expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster TTR of the TOF ratio to 0.9 indicates faster recovery from NMB. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

        <title>Time to Recovery (TTR) of Participant Train of Four (TOF) Ratio to ≥0.9: Secondary Geometric Mean Analysis</title>
        <description>The secondary efficacy analysis of TTR of participant TOF ratio to ≥0.9 was performed by estimating the geometric mean of TTR within each treatment group. TTR was monitored by applying electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to magnitudes of the first and fourth twitches respectively, after nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (TOF; expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster TTR of the TOF ratio to 0.9 indicates faster recovery from NMB. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

          <title>Time to Recovery (TTR) of Participant Train of Four (TOF) Ratio to ≥0.9: Secondary Geometric Mean Analysis</title>
          <description>The secondary efficacy analysis of TTR of participant TOF ratio to ≥0.9 was performed by estimating the geometric mean of TTR within each treatment group. TTR was monitored by applying electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to magnitudes of the first and fourth twitches respectively, after nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (TOF; expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster TTR of the TOF ratio to 0.9 indicates faster recovery from NMB. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>
          <population>All randomized participants dosed with both an NMBA and an NMB reversal agent (study treatment) with ≥1 post-randomization efficacy assessment.

        <description>The efficacy analysis of TTR of participant TOF ratio to ≥0.8 was performed by estimating the geometric mean of TTR within each treatment group. TTR was monitored by applying electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to magnitudes of the first and fourth twitches respectively, after nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (TOF; expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster TTR of the TOF ratio to 0.8 indicates faster recovery from NMB. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>

        <title>Time to Recovery (TTR) of Participant Train of Four (TOF) Ratio to ≥0.7: Geometric Mean Analysis</title>
        <description>The efficacy analysis of TTR of participant TOF ratio to ≥0.7 was performed by estimating the geometric mean of TTR within each treatment group. TTR was monitored by applying electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to magnitudes of the first and fourth twitches respectively, after nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 ratio (TOF; expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB. A faster TTR of the TOF ratio to 0.7 indicates faster recovery from NMB. As specified by the protocol, analyses for this outcome measure were conducted in participants pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB (Sugammadex ABW [2 mg/kg ABW plus 4 mg/kg ABW] and Sugammadex IBW [2 mg/kg IBW plus 4 mg/kg IBW]) as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB (Sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW, Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW, and Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW).</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 61 minutes</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants dosed with both an NMBA and an NMB reversal agent (study treatment) with ≥1 post-randomization efficacy assessment. As specified by the protocol, analysis was performed in treatment arms pooled by dosing method across depth of NMB as well as in all randomized treatment arms separated by depth of NMB.</population>
