  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients experience discomfort from lidocaine injections. Vibrating kinetic anesthesia
      devices (KAD) have been shown to reduce pain of injections in dentistry, pediatrics, and
      dermatology, though no studies of lidocaine injections in sites common to dermatologic
      surgery exist. We will conduct a randomized split-body study, in which healthy volunteers
      will rate the pain of lidocaine injections on a visual analog scale, with and without the
      vibrating kinetic anesthesia device being used during injection
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be an open label split-body crossover trial, using healthy adult volunteers
      recruited from the faculty, staff and student body of the University of Pennsylvania, and
      from the University City area of Philadelphia. Participants will be randomized to one of
      three anatomic sites deemed relevant: the nasofacial sulcus, the lateral forehead, and the
      upper back. Participants will then be randomized to receive injection with the KAD first or
      second. The injection will be 0.5 cc of room temperature buffered lidocaine injected at
      constant slow speed (approximately 5 seconds) through a 30-gage needle held perpendicular to
      the skin by the same surgeon, with verbal cues standardized. Injections will be given in
      accordance with the standard of practice. When the KAD is used it will be used as directed:
      firmly pressed on the skin adjacent to the injection, with the needle aimed into the lighted
      area. Volunteers will evaluate each injection immediately after it is complete using the
      visual analog scale. When both injections are completed, participants will indicate their
      preference of injection, complete qualitative questions, and note necessary demographic
      information. Injection location and order of intervention (i.e. first or second) will be
      noted.

Participants will be randomized to one of three anatomic sites deemed relevant: the nasofacial sulcus, the lateral forehead, and the upper back.

    <time_frame>This measurement will occur immediately after each injection</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to mark the pain of injection on a 100mm visual analog scale. The visual analog scale is commonly used to measure acute pain, though it can be used in other settings. It consists of a line 100mm long. The left end is labeled &quot;no pain at all&quot; and the right end is labeled &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Participants will rate pain by marking the scale where they feel that their level of pain falls on the scale. The length from 0 to the participant's mark will be measured in millimeters (for a range of 0 to 100 mm possible). Higher numbers will be considered more pain.</description>

        <title>Pain of Lidocaine Injection, Measured by Visual Analog Scale.</title>
        <description>Participants will be asked to mark the pain of injection on a 100mm visual analog scale. The visual analog scale is commonly used to measure acute pain, though it can be used in other settings. It consists of a line 100mm long. The left end is labeled &quot;no pain at all&quot; and the right end is labeled &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Participants will rate pain by marking the scale where they feel that their level of pain falls on the scale. The length from 0 to the participant's mark will be measured in millimeters (for a range of 0 to 100 mm possible). Higher numbers will be considered more pain.</description>
        <time_frame>This measurement will occur immediately after each injection</time_frame>

          <title>All Participants</title>
          <description>All participants received two lidocaine injections - one on the left and one on the right side of the body, with the left side injection always administered first. One of the injections was performed with the kinetic anesthesia device assistance, while the other was performed without (the control injection).
As noted in the protocol, participants were randomized to receive the kinetic anesthesia device assisted injection first or second. 21 participants received the kinetic anesthesia device assisted injection first, while 26 were randomized to receive it second.
