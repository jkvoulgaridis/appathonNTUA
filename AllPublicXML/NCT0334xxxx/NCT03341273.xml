    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority multicenter
      clinical trial of azithromycin vs. placebo in adults presenting as outpatients with suspect
      Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) and a Procalcitonin (PCT) level of &lt; / = 0.25 ng/mL,
      as a strategy for reducing antibiotic prescriptions. The study is designed to compare the
      efficacy of azithromycin versus placebo on Day 5 (i.e., after 4 days of treatment) in
      subjects with suspect LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; / = 0.25 ng/mL at enrollment using a
      non-inferiority approach. The study will recruit potential subjects 18 years of age or older
      who are suspected to have LRTI. The enrollment cap will be 840 participants, for the goal of
      approximately 674 randomized participants who will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral
      azithromycin or placebo for five days. Randomized subjects will have efficacy measured from
      the time of the first dose of study drug (Day 1) through approximately Day 28. The Primary
      Objective is to compare the efficacy of azithromycin versus placebo on Day 5 (i.e., after 4
      days of treatment) in subjects with suspect LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; / = 0.25 ng/mL at
      enrollment using a non-inferiority approach.

      physician's office or urgent care by Days 11 and 28; 3) groups receiving azithromycin versus

      azithromycin versus placebo with regard to hospitalization by Days 11 and 28 if not
      hospitalized at the enrollment and randomization visit; 5) groups receiving azithromycin
      versus placebo with regard to improvement in presenting symptoms by Days 11 and 28; 6) the
      efficacy of azithromycin versus placebo on Day 11 in subjects with suspect LRTI and PCT
      levels of &lt; / = 0.25 ng/mL at enrollment using a non-inferiority approach; 7) the efficacy of
      azithromycin versus placebo on Day 28 in subjects with suspect LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; / =
      0.25 ng/mL at enrollment using a non-inferiority approach; 8) the efficacy of azithromycin
      versus placebo in subjects with suspected LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; / = 0.25 ng/mL at Day 5
      using a superiority approach, employing the &quot;Response Adjusted for Days of Antibiotic Risk
      (RADAR)&quot; methodology; 9) groups receiving azithromycin versus placebo in regard to solicited
      events by Day 5; 10) groups receiving azithromycin versus placebo in regard to
      hospitalization or visits to an Emergency Department (ED), outpatient clinic, or urgent care
      center for worsening or persistent LRTI after randomization by Day 5; 11) groups receiving
      azithromycin versus placebo in regard to improvement in vital sign abnormalities or symptoms
      present at enrollment, on Day 5; 12) groups receiving azithromycin versus placebo in regard
      to new vital sign abnormalities or symptoms on Day 5, or deterioration in symptoms relative
      to the enrollment visit on Day 5.

                  monoclonal antibody therapy (Xolair) or IL-5 monoclonal antibodies (Mepolizumab
                  and Reslizumab) are allowed

          7. Contraindication to the use of azithromycin including history of allergy or
             intolerance to azithromycin or known prolonged QTc interval (&gt; 500 msec).

          8. Any condition that in the judgment of the referring provider or site investigator
             precludes participation because it could affect subject safety or ability of subject
             to participate in this trial.

          9. Prior use of azithromycin in the past two weeks.

         10. Use of any systemic antibiotic in the previous 24 hours.
