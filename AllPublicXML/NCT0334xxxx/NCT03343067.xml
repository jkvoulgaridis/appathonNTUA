    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of both
      elagolix alone and elagolix plus estradiol/norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA) over 24 months in
      the management of endometriosis with associated moderate to severe pain in premenopausal
      women.

          -  Participant must have the following documented in the e-Diary during the last 35 days
             prior to Study Day 1:

               1. At least 2 days of &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; DYS, AND either,

               2. At least 2 days of &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; NMPP and an average NMPP score of at

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has chronic pelvic pain that is not caused by endometriosis that requires

          -  Participant is using any systemic corticosteroids for over 14 days within 3 months
             prior to Screening or is likely to require treatment with systemic corticosteroids

             40 years of age).

          -  Participant has either

               1. a newly diagnosed, clinically significant medical condition that requires
                  therapeutic intervention (e.g., new onset hypertension) that has not been
                  stabilized 30 days prior to enrollment on Day 1 OR

               2. a clinically significant medical condition that is anticipated to required
                  intervention during the course of study participation (e.g., anticipated major
                  elective surgery) OR

               3. an unstable medical condition that makes the participant an unsuitable candidate

Month 4 Through Month 6 (Double-Blind): Efficacy responders to elagolix 150 mg QD Month 3 continued on elagolix 150 mg QD
The efficacy responder status of each participant was determined based on the responses to the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in the electronic diary. Efficacy responder: ≥ 30% decrease (improvement) from Baseline based on the average of the Daily Diary for endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS over a 35 day window.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Monthly Average DYS Pain Score</title>
          <description>The DYS pain scale score ranged from 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), recorded in a daily eDiary and averaged monthly based on a 35-day window. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.
The analysis was based on a 28-day window. If a participant prematurely discontinued during the open-label period, based on the analysis window, some data might fall into Month 4 analysis.</description>

        <description>The dyspareunia pain scale score ranged from 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), recorded in a daily eDiary and averaged monthly based on a 35-day window. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

The efficacy responder status of each participant was determined based on the responses to the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in the electronic diary.

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Each Month During the Treatment Period for Daily Diary Endometriosis-Associated Pain Score Via NRS</title>
        <description>The NRS for overall endometriosis-associated pain ranges from 0 (none) to 10 (worst pain ever), recorded in a daily eDiary and averaged monthly based on a 35-day window. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

participants with opioid only use at screening and opioid dose stopped, decreased, or stable (&lt;15% increase), opioid dose stopped and NSAID substituted (any dose), opioid dose decreased and NSAID added (any dose)
participants with NSAID + opioid use at screening and any of the following: NSAID dose stopped + opioid analgesic use stopped, decreased, or stable (&lt;15% increase); NSAID dose decreased + opioid analgesic use stopped, decreased, or stable (&lt;15% increase); NSAID dose stable (&lt; 15% increase) + opioid analgesic use stopped, decreased, or stable (&lt;15% increase); NSAID dose increased by &gt;15% + opioid analgesic use stopped; NSAID dose increased by &gt;15% + opioid analgesic dose decreases.</description>

        <title>Overall Endometriosis-Associated Pain Via NRS (7-Day Recall) Scores Over Time</title>
        <description>The endometriosis-associated pain questionnaire is an 11-point NRS assessing overall endometriosis-associated pain over a 7-day recall period. Participants assessed their endometriosis-associated pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain ever.</description>

The efficacy responder status of each participant was determined based on the responses to the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in the electronic diary.

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument with 5 items that comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each of which is rated on 5 levels of severity (1=no problem, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, 5=extreme problems) and a separate visual analog scale (VAS) indicating a participant's rating of their current health status (health today) on a scale of from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable).</description>

The efficacy responder status of each participant was determined based on the responses to the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in the electronic diary. Efficacy responder: ≥ 30% decrease (improvement) from Baseline based on the average of the Daily Diary for endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS over a 35 day window.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument with 5 items that comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each of which is rated on 5 levels of severity (1=no problem, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, 5=extreme problems) and a separate visual analog scale (VAS) indicating a participant's rating of their current health status (health today) on a scale of from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable).</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument with 5 items that comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each of which is rated on 5 levels of severity (1=no problem, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, 5=extreme problems) and a separate VAS indicating a participant's rating of their current health status (health today) on a scale of from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable).</description>

        <title>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) Scores Over Time: Percent Work Missed Due to Problem</title>
        <description>Absenteeism is presented as the mean percentage of work time missed due to health problem (as reported on the WPAI:SHP), and is calculated as: 100*number of hours of work missed due to health problem / (number of hours of work missed due to health problem + number of hours worked). WPAI is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity; scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity.</description>

        <description>The mean percentage of overall work impairment due to health problem (based on the WPAI questionnaire) is presented, and is calculated as: Absenteeism (%) + extent to which health problem decreased productivity (%)* [number of hours worked / (number of hours of work missed due to health problem + number of hours worked)]. WPAI is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity; scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity.</description>

The ETSQ has a 7 point response scale. The range for this scale is 0 to 36, with lower ETSQ scores reflecting lower levels of satisfaction with endometriosis treatment.</description>
