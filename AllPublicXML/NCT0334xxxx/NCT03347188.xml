  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fremanezumab in adult patients aged 18 to 70
      years, inclusive, for the prevention of PTH. Patients will provide written informed consent
      and during study visits they will use an electronic diary application daily, to report their
      headache status and other health information. Efficacy and immunogenicity status will be
      captured periodically and at study termination. The safety will be evaluated through adverse
      event report, concomitant medication inquiries, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests and physical
      examination. Additional evaluations will include pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and
      pharmacogenomics. All patients will continue the DB period in an open label period during 12
      weeks with a monthly dose of 675 mg sc.

             study. Men must be sterile or, if they are potentially fertile or reproductively
             competent (ie, not surgically or congenitally sterile) and their female partners are

          -  The patient has received onabotulinmumtoxinA (eg, Botox, Dysport) application in the
