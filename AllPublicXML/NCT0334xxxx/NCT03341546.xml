  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A computational model has been created to estimate the abdominal depth of a patient from a
      single x-ray image. The model has been tested using phantoms and found to be accurate; this
      study aims to test the accuracy of the model with patients and in a clinical setting.

      This will be achieved by enrolling patient's who have already been referred for an
      anterior-posterior abdomen x-ray examination to the trial, taking a physical measurement of
      their anterior-posterior abdominal depth and then comparing this measured value with a value
      as estimated using the computational model based on the patient's x-ray image.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A non-commercial computational model has been developed in-house to estimate the patient's
      anterior-posterior or lateral depth using the radiographic image and the known exposure
      factors with which it was undertaken. This model has been tested using single composition
      phantoms and found to be accurate. If it was found to be accurate for real clinical
      examinations, this would automate the measurement of patient size and give institutions the
      estimate of patient size required for local paediatric patient dose audit. In turn, this
      would provide the national data required to propose national reference values for paediatric
      x-ray examinations, which would give all institutions an important comparator for their
      performance. This would lead to optimisation in those sites most requiring it; nationally,
      paediatric x-ray imaging would improve in time.

      This pilot study is necessary to determine if the computational model is accurate enough to
      be relied upon. Accuracy will be determined by comparing the estimate made by the
      computational model for each patient with an actual measurement of the patient's
      anterior-posterior abdomen depth made at the time of the examination.

    <description>The computational model was used to estimate the patient's anterior-posterior abdominal depth using the digital radiographic image, the exposure factors with which it was acquired and a priori knowledge relating to the x-ray unit and digital detector.
The outcome measure was the accuracy with which the computational model estimates the patient's anterior-posterior abdominal depth. It was determined by comparing the estimate to measured anterior-posterior abdominal depth (measured at the time of the x-ray examination). Results are expressed as a percentage deviation; a low % deviation is more accurate, a high % deviation less accurate.</description>
