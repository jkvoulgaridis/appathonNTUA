  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the phase I/II clinical study is to determine the best dose of fractionated
      stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) given either with GC4419 or placebo to patients who
      have been diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel arm adaptive design phase I-II dose-finding study to determine the optimal
      dose of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT), given either with the
      radiomodulating agent GC4419 or placebo for treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
      Dose-finding will be done using the sequentially adaptive phase I-II Late onset
      Efficacy-Toxicity (LO-ET) trade-off-based design [1-3].

      A maximum of 48 patients will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A or Arm B. Patients in Arm A will
      receive GC4419 in combination with their assigned SBRT dose, and patients in Arm B will
      receive Placebo (PBO) with their assigned SBRT dose. The randomization will be restricted so
      that the sample size within each arm is exactly 24 patients.

      GC4419/placebo will be given intravenously in a one hour infusion. SBRT must be initiated as
      soon as possible upon completion of the GC4419/placebo infusion.

      GC4419/placebo will be given beginning on the first day of radiation and continuing daily,
      concurrent M-F throughout the administration of SBRT

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      • To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
      when given in combination with placebo or GC4419

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate Progression-free survival (PFS) at MTD for patients treated with SBRT given
           in combination with placebo or GC4419

        -  To evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR) including stable disease, partial/ complete
           response for patients treated with SBRT given in combination with placebo or GC4419

        -  To evaluate late (12 month) toxicity of SBRT in combination with placebo or GC4419

         15. Requirement for concurrent treatment with nitrates or other drugs that may, in the
             judgment of the treating investigator, create a risk for a precipitous decrease in

         16. Medical history that includes any condition, or requires the use of concomitant
             medications which, in the investigator's judgment, are associated with or create a
