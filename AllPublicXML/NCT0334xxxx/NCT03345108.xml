  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a methodology to determine the ability of a denture
      adhesive to restrict food ingress underneath dentures during eating.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, controlled, open label, randomized, three-treatment,
      three-period, cross-over design in participants with full upper and full lower dentures. Each
      treatment period will consist of one day of testing with at least two days between adjacent
      treatment visits. This study will consist of four visits: Visit 1 - Screening Visit; Visit 2
      - Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit and Visit 4 - Treatment 3 Visit.
      (Participants will use Test product (denture adhesive) applied to the dentures either in a
      pattern consistent with standard application or applied to the dentures in a pattern of
      continuous strips. Participants will also use no adhesive as a control. Participants will
      cross-over between treatments so that all participants will participate in all 3 treatment
      arms. An hour after the participant has worn their denture, they will chew a portion of
      peanuts in a controlled manner. The peanuts that migrate under the denture during this
      chewing procedure will be collected, washed, dried and weighed. Participant will also answer
      a short questionnaire on the procedure and record the number of times their denture dislodged
      during the chewing procedure. The study hypothesis is that this methodology will enable
      comparisons between denture adhesives and no adhesive to demonstrate the effectiveness of
      denture adhesives at restricting food ingress under dentures during eating.

    <measure>Mass of Peanuts Under Combined Maxillary and Mandibular Dentures (Denture Adhesive Applied Per Conventional Pattern)</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants received 1.6 grams (g) of test adhesive on their dentures in a conventional pattern. After 60 minutes (min), participants were provided with 30-32 g non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately eight peanut halves. Each portion chewed for approximately 20 seconds (s). After consumption of all peanuts, participants had rinse their mouth with water for approximately 5 s. Dentures were removed and any peanuts remaining in the mouth were collected using a gauze. Both denture and gauze were placed in a beaker with hot de-ionized water and sonicated for 30 minutes (min) after which the water was strained through a standard testing sieve. The collected particles were washed and air-dried and transferred to pre-weighed aluminium weighing pans using a spatula and then, were dried in an oven at 40-degree Celsius for 5 hours. The pans were removed, cooled to room temperature and then weighed to determine the mass of the particles collected from each denture.</description>

        <title>Mass of Peanuts Under Combined Maxillary and Mandibular Dentures (Denture Adhesive Applied Per Conventional Pattern)</title>
        <description>Participants received 1.6 grams (g) of test adhesive on their dentures in a conventional pattern. After 60 minutes (min), participants were provided with 30-32 g non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately eight peanut halves. Each portion chewed for approximately 20 seconds (s). After consumption of all peanuts, participants had rinse their mouth with water for approximately 5 s. Dentures were removed and any peanuts remaining in the mouth were collected using a gauze. Both denture and gauze were placed in a beaker with hot de-ionized water and sonicated for 30 minutes (min) after which the water was strained through a standard testing sieve. The collected particles were washed and air-dried and transferred to pre-weighed aluminium weighing pans using a spatula and then, were dried in an oven at 40-degree Celsius for 5 hours. The pans were removed, cooled to room temperature and then weighed to determine the mass of the particles collected from each denture.</description>
        <time_frame>Upto 9 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The primary endpoint has been measured for intent-to-treat (ITT) population (N=48). The ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment during the study and consumed peanuts and had at least 1 mass of peanuts from both upper and lower dentures.</population>

            <description>Participants received the 1.6 grams (g) of adhesive to the denture which was placed in the mouth as 1.0 g for maxillary denture and 0.6 g for mandibular denture. In this group, the test denture adhesive was applied in conventional pattern which is defined as the adhesive was filled in pre-weighed syringe and was applied in short strips (3 strips to the upper denture and 2 strips on the lower denture), not too close to the denture.
