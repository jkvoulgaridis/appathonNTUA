  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to confirm the efficacy of levetiracetam as adjunctive treatment or as
      monotherapy in pediatric epilepsy subjects aged 1 month to less than 4 years of age with
      partial seizures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 periods. The First Period (6 weeks drug treatment) is designed to
      confirm efficacy of levetiracetam (LEV), and the Second Period is designed to evaluate the
      long-term efficacy and safety of LEV.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial onset seizures whether or not
             secondarily generalized

          -  Male or female from 1 month to &lt;4 years of age. Pre-term infants aged &lt;1 year are to

             corrected gestational age

          -  For subjects on adjunctive therapy, subject must be on a stable antiepileptic drug
             (AED) regimen for the Selection and Evaluation Periods of the study. Minor adjustments
             to the dose of current AEDs are allowed only prior to Visit 1. Monotherapy subjects
             must not receive AED treatment, receive temporary AED treatment, or switch an AED
             prior to Visit 1

          -  Subject weighs &gt;=3.0 kg

          -  Subject may have Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) which has been implanted for at least 6
             months prior to Visit 1; the settings must be stable for at least 2 months prior to
             Visit 1. Activated VNS must be counted as 1 of the 2 AEDs

          -  Subject must have experienced at least 2 observable partial seizures, with or without
             secondary generalization during each 7-day period during the 2 weeks prior to Visit 1.
             This time period (the 2 weeks prior to Visit 1) will be referred to as the
             Retrospective Baseline Period. This seizure information (including type, frequency,
             and date) must have been recorded on a daily record card (DRC) in order to be
             acceptable

          -  If epilepsy surgery has been performed prior to study entry, subjects must have a
             documented failed epilepsy surgery outcome at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1

          -  The use of intermittent benzodiazepines, phenobarbitals, and phenytoins is allowed as
             long as the frequency is not greater than 1 single administration per week for at
             least 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 and throughout study participation. If benzodiazepines
             are used more than once a week, they must be considered as 1 of the AEDs

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has been taking any medication (other than their concomitant AEDs) that

          -  Subject is taking any medication that may interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of the concomitant AEDs or levetiracetam (LEV) during the
             course of the study

          -  Subject has received any investigational medication or device within 30 days prior to
             Visit 1

          -  Subject has taken LEV prior to the study

          -  Subjects using felbamate who have presented with clinically significant abnormalities
             and/or hepatic function during felbamate treatment, and subjects who are taking
             felbamate &lt;1year from the date of Visit 1

          -  History of status epilepticus requiring hospitalization during the 30 days prior to

             any of the other laboratory parameters required for this study, as determined by the
             Investigator

          -  Clinically significant acute or chronic illness (as determined during the physical
             examination or from other information available to the Investigator)

          -  Allergy to pyrrolidine derivatives or a history of multiple drug allergies

          -  Subject is known to have a terminal illness

          -  Subject has a disorder or condition that may interfere with the absorption,

             participation

          -  Subject has ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN) of any of the following: alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
             or &gt;ULN total bilirubin (≥1.5xULN total bilirubin if known Gilbert's syndrome). If
             subject has elevations only in total bilirubin that are &gt;ULN and &lt;1.5xULN, fractionate
             bilirubin to identify possible undiagnosed Gilbert's syndrome (ie, direct bilirubin

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
