  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to assess the safety of PDT in subjects with
      peripherally located malignant tumors in lung parenchyma prior to surgical resection. It will
      involve up to 10 sites in USA. Participation will last 4 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer accounts for almost one-third of cancer deaths. Cancer screening strategies have
      the potential to achieve a 20% reduction in death rates. Newly developed bronchoscopic
      technologies (such as navigational bronchoscopy) have been shown to enable physicians to
      safely reach lesions in peripheral regions of the lung and obtain diagnosis. This new
      technology may now potentially offer bronchoscopic therapeutic interventions, such as
      photodynamic therapy, to tumors that were previously unreachable due to their peripheral
      anatomic location.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a photosensitizing drug (a drug that is
      activated by light), called porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), and a light from a laser that emits
      no heat. This technique works to allow the medical doctor to specifically target and destroy
      abnormal or cancer cells while limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation
      of the drug is done by lightning the abnormal area using a fiber optic device (very fine
      fiber [like a fishing line] that permits light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube
      with a light, called bronchoscope for the lung. The light activates the porfimer sodium
      concentrated in the abnormal tissue, leading to its destruction.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of using photodynamic therapy prior to
      surgical resection of tumors located in the periphery of the lung.

          <title>Photodynamic Therapy-Photofrin</title>
          <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the i.v. injection of porfimer sodium (Photofrin®) followed by illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device during navigational bronchoscopy. Two days after the injection, the laser light will be applied to the tumor.
Porfimer Sodium: Porfimer sodium (Photofrin®) will be injected intravenously at a dose of 2 mg/kg.
Fiber optic: After injection of porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), a flexible bronchoscopy with navigation guidance will be performed to confirm the location and the size of the lesion with the use of radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography (REBUS). An optical fiber diffuser length matching the tumor length will be placed in the lesion or adjacent to the lesion under fluoroscopy guidance. After the placement of the optical fiber, the laser light will be applied at a dose of 200 J/cm of diffuser length.</description>

Porfimer Sodium: Porfimer sodium (Photofrin®) will be injected intravenously at a dose of 2 mg/kg.
Fiber optic: After injection of porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), a flexible bronchoscopy with navigation guidance will be performed to confirm the location and the size of the lesion with the use of radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography (REBUS). An optical fiber diffuser length matching the tumor length will be placed in the lesion or adjacent to the lesion under fluoroscopy guidance. After the placement of the optical fiber, the laser light will be applied at a dose of 200 J/cm of diffuser length.</description>

            <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the i.v. injection of porfimer sodium (Photofrin®) followed by illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device during navigational bronchoscopy. Two days after the injection, the laser light will be applied to the tumor.
Porfimer Sodium: Porfimer sodium (Photofrin®) will be injected intravenously at a dose of 2 mg/kg.
Fiber optic: After injection of porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), a flexible bronchoscopy with navigation guidance will be performed to confirm the location and the size of the lesion with the use of radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography (REBUS). An optical fiber diffuser length matching the tumor length will be placed in the lesion or adjacent to the lesion under fluoroscopy guidance. After the placement of the optical fiber, the laser light will be applied at a dose of 200 J/cm of diffuser length.</description>

ECOG is Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. ECOG has 6 levels (0-5). Level 0 is the best status (fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction); Level 1 is mildly restricted (Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory ad able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g. light house work, office work); Level 2 is more restricted (Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours); Level 3 is restricted (Capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours); Level 4 is highly restricted (completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair); and Level 5 is death (dead).</description>

Porfimer Sodium: Porfimer sodium (Photofrin®) will be injected intravenously at a dose of 2 mg/kg.
Fiber optic: After injection of porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), a flexible bronchoscopy with navigation guidance will be performed to confirm the location and the size of the lesion with the use of radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography (REBUS). An optical fiber diffuser length matching the tumor length will be placed in the lesion or adjacent to the lesion under fluoroscopy guidance. After the placement of the optical fiber, the laser light will be applied at a dose of 200 J/cm of diffuser length.</description>

            <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the i.v. injection of porfimer sodium (Photofrin®) followed by illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device during navigational bronchoscopy. Two days after the injection, the laser light will be applied to the tumor.
Porfimer Sodium: Porfimer sodium (Photofrin®) will be injected intravenously at a dose of 2 mg/kg.
Fiber optic: After injection of porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), a flexible bronchoscopy with navigation guidance will be performed to confirm the location and the size of the lesion with the use of radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography (REBUS). An optical fiber diffuser length matching the tumor length will be placed in the lesion or adjacent to the lesion under fluoroscopy guidance. After the placement of the optical fiber, the laser light will be applied at a dose of 200 J/cm of diffuser length.</description>
