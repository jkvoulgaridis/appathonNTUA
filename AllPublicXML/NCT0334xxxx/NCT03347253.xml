    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate changes in key clinical outcome measures (eg, motor,
      respiratory, fatigue) in adult subjects with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) subjects
      receiving standard-of-care enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Additionally, information gained
      may be used in the design and conduct of future studies in LOPD subjects.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the baseline characteristics and degree of change
      over time in clinical outcome measures commonly used to evaluate patients with LOPD.

        Male and female subjects with LOPD between 18 years and 75 years, inclusive and ≥ 50 kg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a diagnosis of Pompe disease based on documented deficiency of GAA
             activity and a documented GAA mutation.

          2. Male and female subjects between 18 years and 75 years, inclusive and ≥ 50 kg.

          3. Subject must be currently receiving standard-of-care ERT (alglucosidase alfa) at a
             dose of 20 mg/kg dose every other week.

          4. Subject must have been on ERT for the preceding 2 years or more.

          5. Subject must have an upright forced vital capacity (FVC) within 35 to 90% of predicted
             normal (NHANES III reference values), based on the higher of the screening or baseline
             value, if their 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) is &gt; 200 m. Subject must have an upright
             FVC within 40 to 90% of predicted normal (NHANES III reference values), based on the
             higher of the screening or baseline value, if their 6MWD is ≤ 200 m. If FVC is between
             80 and 90% of predicted normal, the subject may enter the study if the percent
             predicted FVC value drops by 10% predicted or more in supine position

          6. Subject is able to walk at least 100 m in the 6MWT and the assessment is noted as
             valid.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has received any investigational therapy or pharmacological treatment for
             Pompe disease, other than alglucosidase alfa within 30 days or 5 half lives, whichever
             is shorter, prior to the Baseline Visit or is anticipated to do so during the course
             of the study

          2. Subject is on any of the following prohibited medications within 30 days of baseline:

               -  miglitol (eg, Glyset)

               -  miglustat (eg, Zavesca)

               -  acarbose (eg, Precose, Glucobay)

               -  voglibose (eg, Volix, Vocarb, Volibo)

          3. Subject requires use of invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support for &gt; 6 hours a
             day while awake.

          4. Subject has a medical or any other extenuating condition or circumstance that may, in
             the opinion of the investigator, pose an undue safety risk to the subject or
             compromise his/her ability to comply with protocol requirements. This includes
             clinical depression (as diagnosed by a psychiatrist or other mental health
             professional) with uncontrolled or poorly controlled symptoms.

          5. Subject is breastfeeding, or is pregnant or planning to become pregnant within the
             next 2 years.

          6. Other exclusion criteria according to the Lumizyme/Myozyme instructions for use.
