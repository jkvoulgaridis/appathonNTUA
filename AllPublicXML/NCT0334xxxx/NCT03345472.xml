  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy of spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) therapy for pain relief using high dose (HD) stimulation parameters
      delivered to neural targets identified during current commercial trial stimulation
      procedures. The study will evaluate changes in back and leg pain from baseline to 3, 6, and
      12 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Overall Pain Intensity on the Visual Analog Scale (0-100)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Demonstrate a significant improvement in overall pain intensity as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable). The change in overall pain intensity is calculated as the Baseline VAS minus the 3-month VAS, where a positive value indicates an improvement (ie, reduction) in pain from Baseline to 3 months. Higher values represent a larger reduction (ie, greater improvement) in pain.
The change in overall pain intensity as measured by the VAS can range from -100 (worsening in pain from 0 at baseline to 100 at 3 months) to 100 (improvement in pain from 100 at baseline to 0 at 3 months). It should be noted that while the change in VAS can range from -100 to 100, no subjects had a VAS of 0 at baseline, as the presence of pain was required for eligibility for inclusion in the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Pain Efficacy Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Characterize the overall pain efficacy responder rate, where the responder rate is the percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in overall pain, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable). The percent improvement for each subject was calculated as [100*(Baseline VAS - 3-month VAS)/Baseline VAS], where a positive number represents an improvement, and the larger the number the greater the percent improvement. If the percent improvement from baseline to 3 months was at least 50%, the subject was considered a responder.
The percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in overall pain can range from 0% (no responders) to 100% (all responders).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Low Back Pain Efficacy Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Characterize the low back pain efficacy responder rate, where the responder rate is the percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in low back pain, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable). The percent improvement for each subject was calculated as [100*(Baseline VAS - 3-month VAS)/Baseline VAS], where a positive number represents an improvement, and the larger the number the greater the percent improvement. If the percent improvement from baseline to 3 months was at least 50%, the subject was considered a responder.
The percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in low back pain can range from 0% (no responders) to 100% (all responders).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leg Pain Efficacy Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Characterize the leg pain efficacy responder rate, where the responder rate is the percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in leg pain, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable). The percent improvement for each subject was calculated as [100*(Baseline VAS - 3-month VAS)/Baseline VAS], where a positive number represents an improvement, and the larger the number the greater the percent improvement. If the percent improvement from baseline to 3 months was at least 50%, the subject was considered a responder.
The percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in leg pain can range from 0% (no responders) to 100% (all responders).</description>

        <title>Change in Overall Pain Intensity on the Visual Analog Scale (0-100)</title>
        <description>Demonstrate a significant improvement in overall pain intensity as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable). The change in overall pain intensity is calculated as the Baseline VAS minus the 3-month VAS, where a positive value indicates an improvement (ie, reduction) in pain from Baseline to 3 months. Higher values represent a larger reduction (ie, greater improvement) in pain.
The change in overall pain intensity as measured by the VAS can range from -100 (worsening in pain from 0 at baseline to 100 at 3 months) to 100 (improvement in pain from 100 at baseline to 0 at 3 months). It should be noted that while the change in VAS can range from -100 to 100, no subjects had a VAS of 0 at baseline, as the presence of pain was required for eligibility for inclusion in the study.</description>

The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable). The percent improvement for each subject was calculated as [100*(Baseline VAS - 3-month VAS)/Baseline VAS], where a positive number represents an improvement, and the larger the number the greater the percent improvement. If the percent improvement from baseline to 3 months was at least 50%, the subject was considered a responder.

          <description>Characterize the leg pain efficacy responder rate, where the responder rate is the percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in leg pain, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable). The percent improvement for each subject was calculated as [100*(Baseline VAS - 3-month VAS)/Baseline VAS], where a positive number represents an improvement, and the larger the number the greater the percent improvement. If the percent improvement from baseline to 3 months was at least 50%, the subject was considered a responder.
The percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in leg pain can range from 0% (no responders) to 100% (all responders).</description>
