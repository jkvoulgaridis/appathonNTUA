  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of opioid use disorders (OUDs) has increased to near-epidemic proportions.
      While maintenance with long-acting opioids such as methadone or buprenorphine represents an
      effective treatment strategy, it may be unacceptable to many individuals. As a result,
      long-acting injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX), an antagonist medication that blocks the effects
      of opioids for at least 4 weeks, is now indicated for relapse prevention following
      detoxification. This randomized, controlled trial aims to test the efficacy of a glutamate
      modulator at facilitating a rapid non-opioid based naltrexone induction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study combines a nonopioid detoxification; a naltrexone titration schedule that allows
      for pushing the dose rapidly while monitoring closely to ensure tolerability; and infusions
      integrated into the treatment in such a way as to potentially ameliorate spontaneous and
      precipitated withdrawal. The first part of the treatment trial involves receiving inpatient
      treatment for up to 5 days. Following week 1, participants will meet with staff twice weekly
      and receive 12 weeks of mindfulness based relapse prevention and motivational interviewing
      sessions.
