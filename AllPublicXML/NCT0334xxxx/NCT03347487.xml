  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The habenula(Hb) is an epithalamic structure located at the center of the dorsal diencephalic
      conduction system, a pathway involved in linking forebrain to midbrain regions. An increasing
      number of studies indicates that overactivity in the lateral habeluna(LHb) is present during
      depressed states, where it could drive the changes in midbrain activity linked to depression.
      Deep brain stimulation(DBS) of the major afferent bundle (i.e., stria medullaris thalami) of
      the LHb can treat treatment-resistant major depression(TRD). There is no clinical case of
      directly stimulating habeluna for treatment TRD. This research will investigate effectiveness
      and safety of bilateral DBS to habenula for patients with TRD. This study will also use
      structural and functional MRI to explore the underlying mechanism of Hb's effects on TRD.
