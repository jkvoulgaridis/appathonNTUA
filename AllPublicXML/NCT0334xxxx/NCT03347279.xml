      A Multicentre, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Parallel Group, Phase 3 Study to

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults and adolescents with
      severe, uncontrolled asthma on medium to high-dose ICS and at least one additional asthma
      controller medication with or without OCS. Approximately 1060 subjects will be randomized
      globally. Subjects will receive tezepelumab, or placebo, administered via subcutaneous
      injection at the study site, over a 52-week treatment period. The study also includes a
      post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks.

    <measure>Annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AERR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized exacerbation rate is based on exacerbations reported by the investigator in the eCRF over 52 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-bronchodilator (pre-BD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in FEV1 as compared to placebo at Week 52. FEV1 is defined as the volume of air exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced expiration.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ(S)+12) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 as compared to placebo at Week 52. The AQLQ(S)+12 is a questionnaire that measures the health-related quality of life experienced by asthma subjects. The total score is defined as the average of all 32 questions in the AQLQ(S)+12 questionnaire. AQLQ(S)+12 is a 7-point scale questionnaire, ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in ACQ-6 as compared to placebo at Week 52. The ACQ-6 captures asthma symptoms and short-acting β2-agonist use via subject-report. Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in weekly mean daily Asthma Symptom Diary score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in Asthma Symptom Diary score as compared to placebo at Week 52.
The Asthma Symptom Diary comprises of 10 items (5 items in the morning; 5 items in the evening). Asthma symptoms during night time and daytime are recorded by the patient each morning and evening in the daily diary. A daily ASD score is the mean of the 10 items. Responses for all 10 items are required to calculate the daily ASD score; otherwise, it is treated as missing. For the 7-day average asthma symptom score, scoring is done with no imputation using the mean of at least 4 of the 7 daily ASD scores as a mean weekly item score. The 7-day average ASD score ranges from 0 to 4.</description>

PGI-S is a single item designed to capture the subject's perception of overall symptom severity using a 6-point categorical response scale (no symptoms to very severe symptoms)</description>
