      -  Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness, in terms of reducing social isolation and
           improving the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), of a non-pharmacological
           multicomponent intervention in elderly telecare users.

        -  Design: Clinical trial randomized by cluster, multicentric.

        -  Location: 14 health centers of the Andalusian Health Service (Spain).

        -  Subjects and methods: Subjects with social isolation. Age 65 or older. Residents in your
           home. Persons with cognitive impairment or dementia, difficulty in responding to scales,
           legal incapacitation or not giving consent will be excluded.

           9 health centers will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The
           people of both groups will be evaluated at baseline, at 4 and at 6 months. 57 subjects
           will be included in each group (n = 114).

      Variables: a) Independent: of the professional and of the patients (sociodemographic,
      healthcare, morbidity, intervention performed -multicomponent vs. non-intervention-) b)
      Dependents: social support, loneliness and HRQoL.

      The intervention includes 8 sessions at home [1 hour], every 15 days and 4 telephone [30
      minutes] -1 monthly-. To measure the effectiveness of the intervention, the Duke-UNC
      Functional Social Support Questionnaire (DUFSS), the De Jong-Gierveld Scale of loneliness,
      and the EuroQol-5D will be used to measure HRQoL.

      Univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis (multiple linear regression).

      -Aspects ethico-legal: Standards of good clinical practice and ethical principles of the
      Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent. Application for authorization to the management of
      the Sanitary District.
