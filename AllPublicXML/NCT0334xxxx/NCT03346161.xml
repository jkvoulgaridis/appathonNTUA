  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although clinical decision tools (CDTs) exist for a variety of treatments, CDTs designed to
      support personalized breast reconstruction decisions, particularly about type and timing of
      reconstruction, are lacking. The objective of this proposal is to develop and pilot test a
      clinical decision tool that provides personalized risk information and reflects patients'
      preferences and clinical needs.

    <measure>Percent Correct on the Knowledge Measure (Objective Knowledge Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of breast consultation appointment (total participant time approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether the CDT increases knowledge about their choice, the investigators will compare objective knowledge scores between participants using the CDT and those who received usual care</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Conflict (SURE Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of breast consultation appointment (total participant time approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether the CDT reduces uncertainty about choice. Participants are asked to report how sure they feel about their choice, if they have enough information to understand the choice, if they are clear about the risks and benefits, and if they have enough support to make a choice. Results are compared between the BREASTChoice and Enhanced Usual Care groups.
Higher SURE values indicate certainty in choice
Scores range from 0-4</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Process (Decision Quality Index Subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of breast consultation appointment (total participant time approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The total points are summed and then divided by the total number of items to result in scores from 0-100%, with higher scores indicating a more shared decision making process
Assess the extent to which patients were meaningfully involved in decision-making with their clinicians</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life as Measured by the BREAST-Q Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of breast consultation appointment (total participant time approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed 4 subscales: satisfaction with breasts, psychosocial well-being, physical well-being, and sexual well-being
Score from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores reflect a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gold Standard Shared Decision Making as Measured by the Top collaboRATE Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of breast consultation appointment (total participant time approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Top collaboRATE score = the percentage of patients from whom there was 'gold standard' shared decision making as assessed by the collaboRATE measure
The top score is coded as '1', if the response to all three collaboRATE items was less than 9. Then the investigators calculated the percentage of all encounters that were coded as '1' indicating gold standard shared decision making.</description>

    <description>Investigators recruited patients scheduled for a plastic/reconstruction consult. Investigators identified patients who completed a mastectomy, or were scheduled for one, and considering reconstruction, but didn't have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member called the patient to determine their interest and offered for them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator or offered them the option to complete pre-appointment procedures at home. Patients randomized using computer random assignment. If the patient didn't have an appointment, she scheduled a convenient time to complete study procedures with research staff. Patients interacted with the decision tool. They were asked to answer a survey. After the appointment, the team collected information consult duration, decision process quality, and measures of shared decision making. Patient participation was approximately 30 minutes.</description>

Investigators identified patients who completed a mastectomy, or were scheduled for one, and considering reconstruction, but didn’t have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member called the patient to determine their interest and offered for them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator or offered them the option to complete pre-appointment procedures at home. Patients randomized using computer random assignment. If the patient didn’t have an appointment, she scheduled a convenient time to complete study procedures with research staff. Patients interacted with the decision tool. They were asked to answer a survey. After the appointment, the team collected information consult duration, decision process quality, and measures of shared decision making.

Investigators identified patients who completed a mastectomy, or were scheduled for one, and considering reconstruction, but didn’t have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member called the patient to determine their interest and offered for them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator or offered them the option to complete pre-appointment procedures at home. Patients randomized using computer random assignment. If the patient didn’t have an appointment, she scheduled a convenient time to complete study procedures with research staff. Patients interacted with the decision tool. They were asked to answer a survey. After the appointment, the team collected information consult duration, decision process quality, and measures of shared decision making. Patient participation was approximately 30 minutes.</description>

            <description>Investigators recruited patients scheduled for a plastic/reconstruction consult. Investigators identified patients who completed a mastectomy, or were scheduled for one, and considering reconstruction, but didn’t have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member called the patient to determine their interest and offered for them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator or offered them the option to complete pre-appointment procedures at home. Patients randomized using computer random assignment. If the patient didn’t have an appointment, she scheduled a convenient time to complete study procedures with research staff. Patients interacted with the decision tool. They were asked to answer a survey. After the appointment, the team collected information consult duration, decision process quality, and measures of shared decision making. Patient participation was approximately 30 minutes.</description>
