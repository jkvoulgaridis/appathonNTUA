  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to prevent ultraviolet light (UV) overexposure by providing consumers with
      relevant, easy-to-access, specifically actionable information. This research proposal will
      develop a UV protection system consisting of an automated real-time counseling framework and
      a personal dosimeter that overcomes barriers to consumer adoption. These new, wearable
      sensors take the form of small (&lt; 1 cm), thin (&lt;0.1 mm), lightweight (&lt;0.1 g), battery-free
      &quot;stickers&quot; that are fundamentally differentiated from other wearable electronics in their
      modes of use, cost structures and accuracy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work is to refine and validate a UV protection system based on a dosimeter
      &quot;sticker.&quot; The key innovations of the system are automated personalized intervention
      messaging triggered by the exposure levels measured by a novel charge accumulation device
      applied to ultraminiaturized circuit forms. The research will validate the system's accuracy
      and acceptability to users, refine the device, and prove its robustness and efficacy in real
      world use cases. Focus groups and structured interviews will develop sun protection
      strategies to be communicated by text messages to participants. Successful completion of the
      research will yield a system to prevent excessive UV exposure and sunburn, thus reducing the
      incidence of skin cancer by equipping large numbers of general-population consumers and
      at-risk people to practice digitally-informed healthy sun behavior.

Focus group: It is expected that each participant will provide comments during the 2 hours of the focus group. It will take about one month to enroll the subjects. The audio files should be transcribed and the analysis completed in 60 days. The analysis will determine enablers and barriers to sun protected outdoor activities and determine strategies for achieving sun protected outdoor activities.</description>

Usability test with structured interview: Each participant will use the sensor for 14 days and transmit data with the app installed on their mobile phone. It will take about one month to enroll the subjects. The analysis of the structured interview is completed in one week.</description>

    <description>60 subjects
First cohort study: It is expected that each of 60 melanoma survivors will wear the sensor and transmit data for 21 days in the warm weather months of June-Aug 2019. It will take about 2 months to enroll the subjects. Subjects will receive daily text messages in a sequence starting with behavioral facilitation, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and self-regulation. On day 10, participants will receive a text message prompting review and reflection on the prior 10 days of UV exposure. Participants will be randomized to receive a survey item inviting selection of strategies to achieve sun-protected outdoor activities (structured goal attainment) or submit a free text description of their strategy (unstructured goal attainment).</description>

    <description>50 young adults, ages 18-39 will participate in structured interviews to determine their barriers and enablers of sun exposure and sun protection. Eligible subjects will have at least one hour a day outdoors with 30 minutes of the hour being consecutive. It will take about 3 months to enroll the subjects. The audio files will be transcribed and analysis completed in 60 days.</description>
