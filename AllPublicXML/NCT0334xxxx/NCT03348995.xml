  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair (BEAR) is a new procedure being developed to treat patients with
      ACL injuries. In the BEAR procedure, an implant is placed between the torn ends of the ACL
      and the patient's own blood is added to the implant to stimulate ligament healing. We propose
      the current study to determine if older patients do better than younger patients (or vice
      versa) with this procedure. This is a cohort study designed to determine if age is a risk
      factor for a worse outcome after a bridge-enhanced ACL repair (BEAR) as defined by an 11.5
      point difference on the IKDC Subjective or Objective Knee Evaluation score at two years after
      surgery. Additional objectives are to determine the effect of age on safety outcomes
      including infection, graft rejection, and need for further surgical procedures.
