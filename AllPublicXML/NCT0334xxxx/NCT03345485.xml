  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinostamustine (EDO-S101) is a new chemical entity, an AK-DAC (a first-in-class alkylating
      deacetylase inhibiting molecule), that in pre-clinical studies has been shown to
      simultaneously improve access to the DNA strands within cancer cells, break them and block
      damage repair. This Phase 1/2 study will enroll patients with various advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 phases:

        -  Phase 1: Dose Escalation until MAD

        -  Phase 2: Evaluation of Toxicity and Response Rate in Selected Solid Tumor Cohorts

      The study is designed as an open label, Phase 1/2 trial of single agent EDO-S101. The Phase 1
      portion of the study is designed to define the MTD by evaluating toxicities during dose
      escalation until MAD. The Phase 2 portion of the study is designed to evaluate ORR and SD
      that persists for at least 4 months of the RP2D.
