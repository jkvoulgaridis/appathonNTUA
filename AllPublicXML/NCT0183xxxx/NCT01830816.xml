  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters
      of ixazomib (MLN9708) in cancer participants with either normal renal function or severe
      renal impairment (RI), including participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

  <detailed_description>

      The drug tested in this study was called ixazomib (MLN9708). Ixazomib was administered to
      participants with cancer and either normal renal function or severe renal impairment,
      including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. This study characterized the
      PK, safety and efficacy of ixazomib.

      The study enrolled 41 participants (37 multiple myeloma and 4 advanced solid tumor). The
      study was conducted in 2 parts, Part A and Part B. Participants were enrolled to receive:

        -  Ixazomib 3.0 mg

      In Part A, all participants were asked to take one 3 mg ixazomib capsule, orally on Day 1.
      Participants who tolerated ixazomib in Part A had the option of continuing the study by
      participating in Part B. In Part B, participants received ixazomib (4, 3, or 2.3 mg per
      protocol) on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle until participants experienced disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      This multicenter trial was conducted at 6 study sites in the United States and Canada. The
      overall time to participate in this study was 435 days. Participants made multiple scheduled
      visits to the clinic.

    <description>Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 of every other cycle from cycle 1 (each cycle of 28 days) up to progression of disease (approximately up to 855 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate defined as percentage of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma participants who achieved partial response (PR), complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR) according to International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. PR=&gt;50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hours urinary M-protein by &gt;90% or &lt;200 mg/24 h. If serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, &gt;50% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain levels in place of M-protein criteria. If serum and urine M-protein and serum free light assay are not measurable, &gt;50% reduction in plasma cells in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell &gt;0%; CR=negative immunofixation on serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and &lt;5% plasma cells in bone marrow; VGPR=serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or &gt; 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level &lt;100 mg/24 h.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 of every other cycle from cycle 1 (each cycle of 28 days) up to progression of disease (approximately up to 855 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR was defined as time from date of first documentation of a PR or better to date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) for responders. Increase of &gt;25% from lowest response value in any one or more of following: Serum M-component and/or (absolute increase must be &gt;0.5 g/dL); Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be &gt;200 mg/24 h); difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels and the absolute increase must be &gt; 10 mg/dL; Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; absolute percentage must be &gt; 5%; Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Development of hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder. Responders without PD were censored at the date of the last response assessment that was stable disease (SD) or better.</description>

        <description>Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DOR) in RRMM Participants</title>
        <description>DOR was defined as time from date of first documentation of a PR or better to date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) for responders. Increase of &gt;25% from lowest response value in any one or more of following: Serum M-component and/or (absolute increase must be &gt;0.5 g/dL); Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be &gt;200 mg/24 h); difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels and the absolute increase must be &gt; 10 mg/dL; Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; absolute percentage must be &gt; 5%; Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Development of hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder. Responders without PD were censored at the date of the last response assessment that was stable disease (SD) or better.</description>
