  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accidental falls result in major physical and psychological morbidity in the elderly. The aim
      of this study was to evaluate the effects of lower-limb strength and flexibility program,
      which is analyzed under the control of other risk factors, on preventing falls and
      fall-related injuries in the community-dwelling elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the effect of strength and flexibility training with elastic band on
      community-dwelling elderly gait, balance, and functional performance. All subjects received a
      home exercise program with low resistance elastic band training. All subjects were assessed
      for functional assessment, balance and gait analysis at initial and after training.

    <description>Using the theraband for strengthening and stretching the upper and lower extremity muscles.
All exercises were performed by using a Theraband in the following movements: shoulder elevating and abducting, horizontal and oblique direction, plantar flexion, dorsi-flexion, inversion and eversion of ankle, knee extension and hip abduction. The stretching exercises were focused on the hamstring muscle and heel cord. Each movement was held for 5 seconds. The participants were instructed to perform 5-10 repetitions of each movements twice per day.</description>
