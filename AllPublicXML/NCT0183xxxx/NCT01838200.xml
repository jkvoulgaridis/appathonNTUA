  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, single-center study in patients with
      histologically confirmed Stage III or IV melanoma and at least 3 metastatic cutaneous or
      subcutaneous lesions that were suitable and accessible for intralesional (IL) injection (1
      lesion), biopsy (1 lesion), and response evaluation (1 lesion). The primary objective was to
      determine the safety of IL administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) followed by oral
      dosing with an antibiotic (isoniazid) and intravenous (IV) infusions of ipilimumab. Secondary
      objectives were to evaluate the clinical efficacy (induction of tumor response) and
      immunogenicity (induction of immune response against the tumors) of the combination regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were enrolled into one of two study cohorts depending on the induration noted after
      a baseline purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test to determine tuberculin reactivity.
      Cohort 1 comprised patients with an induration of &lt;10mm in diameter, and Cohort 2 comprised
      patients with an induration of ≥10mm. Enrollment was staggered by 3 weeks for each of the
      first 3 patients in Cohort 1, Group 1 to enable safety monitoring of each patient prior to
      exposure of additional patients.

      In all cohorts, study treatment included BCG (200 µL volume) given IL on Day 1, isoniazid
      (300 mg) given orally daily from Days 29 to 56, and ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) given IV every 3
      weeks (± 3 days) on Days 36, 57, 78, and 99. The dose of BCG varied by assigned treatment
      group: Cohort 1, Group 1 received 0.16 - 0.64 × 10^6 colony-forming units (CFU); Cohort 1,
      Group 2 received 0.8 - 3.2 x 10^6 CFU; Cohort 1, Group 3 was to receive 4.0 - 16.0 x 10^6
      CFU; and Cohort 2 was to receive 0.16 - 0.64 × 10^6 CFU. Enrollment into Cohort 2 was to be
      initiated after the final patient in Cohort 1, Group 1 reached Week 7. Enrollment was then to
      proceed in parallel for Cohort 2 and Cohort 1, Groups 2 and 3.

      Patients were monitored for safety, tumor response, and immunogenicity (cellular, humoral,
      and in situ immunity) for the duration of study participation.

    <description>Toxicity was graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported based on clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs from pre-treatment through the study period. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for BCG was defined as any ≥ Grade 3 local injection site reaction (ulceration or necrosis requiring operative intervention), and DLT for ipilimumab was defined as any toxicity that required dosing modifications in accordance with the recommendations in the local product labelling, or any ≥ Grade 3 hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity that was definitely, probably, or possibly related to the administration of ipilimumab.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Best Overall Clinical Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor responses were evaluated using computed tomography and clinical photography at Baseline, Weeks 6, 17, 21, and 30 (± 3-day window for each assessment), and at the end of the study. Tumor response was designated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1). Per RECIST, target lesions are categorized as follows: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions (no evaluable disease); Partial Response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

    <description>Immune-related tumor responses were evaluated using computed tomography and clinical photography at Baseline, Weeks 6, 17, 21, and 30 (± 3-day window for each assessment), and at the end of the study. Tumor response was designated according to the immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) (Wolchok et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:7412-20) into the following categories: immune-related complete response (irCR) requires disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart; immune-related partial response (irPR) requires ≥ 50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline in two observations at least 4 weeks apart; immune-related stable disease (irSD) is assigned when neither a 50% decrease from baseline tumor burden nor a 25% increase in tumor burden from nadir can be established; immune-related progressive disease (irPD) requires a ≥ 25% increase from nadir in tumor burden at any single time point in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed stage III (unresectable) or stage IV melanoma.

          2. Minimum 1 metastatic lesion, cutaneous or subcutaneous, but ideally 3 or more lesions,
             to accommodate intralesional injection (1 lesion), accessibility for biopsy (1
             lesion), and evaluability for response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (1 lesion) and modified RECIST (immune-related response
             criteria [irRC]).

          3. Performance status of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1.

          4. Within the last 2 weeks prior to study Day 1, vital laboratory parameters must have
             been within normal ranges, except for the following laboratory parameters, which must
             have been within the ranges specified:

               -  Hemoglobin: ≥ 100 g/L

               -  Platelets: ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

               -  International normalized ratio: ≤ 2.0

               -  Creatinine: ≤ 120 µmol/L

               -  Bilirubin: ≤ 30 µmol/L

               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate: &gt; 0.75 x lower limit of normal

               -  Aspartate and alanine aminotransferase: ≤ 2.0 x upper limit of normal

          5. Estimated life expectancy of at least 4 to 6 months. Because of the slow onset of
             action of ipilimumab and the protocol requirement for a 5-week delay post-BCG,
             patients with rapidly progressive disease may not have been suitable for the protocol.

          6. Full recovery from surgery. A minimum of 2 weeks should have elapsed since the most
             recent surgery.

          7. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.

          8. Able and willing to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          6. Generalized skin disease.

          7. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, were excluded from this study, as were
             patients with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of
             autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis). Exceptions:
             vitiligo, type I diabetes, pernicious anemia (treated).

          8. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator would have made the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscured

             frequent diarrhea.

          9. Prior immunotherapy or systemic adjuvant therapy for melanoma following most recent
             relapse and/or resection of melanoma.

         10. Prior treatment with a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor.

         11. Concomitant therapy with any of the following: interleukin 2, interferon, or other
             non-study immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents;
             other investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids.

         12. Known human immunodeficiency virus positivity, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

         13. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosourea drugs).

         14. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessments.

         15. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent
             within 4 weeks prior to first dosing.

         16. Mental impairment that may have compromised the ability to give informed consent and
             to comply with the requirements of the study.

         17. Women who were pregnant (positive pregnancy test at baseline), or breastfeeding.

         18. Men and women unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to
             avoid pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 8 weeks after cessation
             of study drug.

         19. Prisoners or patients who were compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness.

        <description>Immune-related tumor responses were evaluated using computed tomography and clinical photography at Baseline, Weeks 6, 17, 21, and 30 (± 3-day window for each assessment), and at the end of the study. Tumor response was designated according to the immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) (Wolchok et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:7412-20) into the following categories: immune-related complete response (irCR) requires disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart; immune-related partial response (irPR) requires ≥ 50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline in two observations at least 4 weeks apart; immune-related stable disease (irSD) is assigned when neither a 50% decrease from baseline tumor burden nor a 25% increase in tumor burden from nadir can be established; immune-related progressive disease (irPD) requires a ≥ 25% increase from nadir in tumor burden at any single time point in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart.</description>
