      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Boston Scientific's
      Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system in the treatment of patients with with advanced,
      levodopa-responsive bilateral Parkinson's disease (PD) which is not adequately controlled
      with medication.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of bilateral idiopathic PD (H&amp;Y ≥ 2) with a duration of PD ≥ 5 years.

          -  Persistent disabling Parkinson's disease symptoms or drug side effects (e.g.,
             dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, or disabling &quot;off&quot; periods) despite optimal medical
             therapy.

          -  Able to understand the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides
             written informed consent before any study-specific tests or procedures are performed.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any intracranial abnormality or medical condition that would contraindicate DBS
             surgery.

          -  Have any significant psychiatric condition likely to compromise the subject's ability
             to comply with requirements of the study protocol

          -  Any other active implanted devices including neurostimulators and /or drug delivery
             pumps

          -  Any previous thalamotomy, pallidotomy or subjects who have undergone a DBS procedure.

          -  Have any significant medical condition that is likely to interfere with study
             procedures or likely to confound evaluation of study endpoints.

          -  A female who is breastfeeding or of child-bearing potential with a positive urine
             pregnancy test or not using adequate contraception.

          <title>Low Intermittent Dose of Stimulation</title>
          <description>Subjects in this arm received a lower intermittent dose of Deep Brain stimulation which was less likely to be effective.
Deep Brain Stimulation: The Vercise™ DBS system was implanted in subjects in both study arms. Stimulation parameters were varied depending on the study arm assignment. All subjects received therapeutic settings at the end of the blinded period.</description>
