  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether plantarflexion has an effect on the degree
      of urinary urgency and on the amplitude of detrusor contraction during filling cystometry in
      patients with detrusor overactivity (DO).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with urodynamic DO will be included in this study. During urodynamics, the mean peak
      detrusor pressures of each contraction will be documented and compared. At the beginning of
      the 2nd or 3rd wave, patients will be asked to perform continuous plantar-flexion by pushing
      their tiptoes against the floor. Following each wave, patients will be asked to grade the
      severity of the urgency by a visual analogue scale
