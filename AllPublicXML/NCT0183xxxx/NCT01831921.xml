  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to test two different strategies for weight loss and diabetes
      prevention in the Latino community in and around Forsyth County, North Carolina. The study is
      designed to test the hypothesis that a lifestyle weight-loss program implemented within the
      Latino community will have a more beneficial and clinically meaningful impact on hemoglobin
      A1c (HbA1c), insulin metabolism, and markers of the metabolic syndrome when compared to an
      enhanced usual care condition. This lifestyle intervention will include group-based sessions
      promoting healthy eating, increased physical activity and weight loss. These sessions will be
      delivered by lay community members, known as Latino Health Advisors (LHAs). The enhanced
      usual care group will consist of individual counseling with are registered dietitian and uses
      existing community resources to assist participants in making healthier lifestyle choices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major health concern in the United States, accounting for 90 to
      95% of the more than 25 million diagnosed cases of diabetes in 2010. Racial and ethnic
      minorities are disproportionately affected by the diabetes epidemic, specifically African
      Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. Although the cumulative evidence suggests that
      lifestyle interventions to prevent diabetes can be implemented across a variety of settings
      with diverse personnel, numerous barriers to widespread dissemination in minority populations
      still exist. Latinos Combatiendo la Diabetes (La Comunidad) is a 225-participant randomized
      trial designed to test the hypothesis that a community-based lifestyle weight-loss
      intervention implemented within the accountability and structure of existing Latino
      communities will have a more beneficial and clinically meaningful impact on HbA1c, insulin
      metabolism, and markers of the metabolic syndrome when compared to an enhanced usual care
      condition. An economic evaluation will also be conducted to determine costs and
      cost-effectiveness. One trial arm will consist of a group-based intensive lifestyle
      intervention promoting healthy eating, increased physical activity and modest, yet achievable
      (5-7%) weight loss delivered in an early 6-month intensive phase followed by an 18-month
      maintenance phase. Latino Health Advisors (LHAs) will be utilized in the intensive
      intervention arm. The control arm will consist of an individual educational intervention that
      incorporates existing community resources that are available to assist residents in making
      healthier lifestyle choices.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women 18 years and older who reside in or near Forsyth County, North Carolina

          -  Self-identified as Hispanic or Latino

          -  Evidence of pre-diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c of 5.7-6.5%

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI): 25-45 kg/m2

          -  Potential participants must be willing to accept randomization to either the intensive
             lifestyle intervention or the comparison usual care condition

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently involved in a supervised program for weight loss

          -  Clinical history of diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes at screening

          -  Clinical history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurring within the past 6 months,
             including myocardial infarction, angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, transient
             ischemic attack (TIA), carotid revascularization, peripheral arterial disease,
             congestive heart failure. All persons with recent CVD should be participating in
             cardiac rehabilitation (with appropriate supervision as indicated) to reduce their
             risk of recurrence; hence, randomization might raise ethical concerns.

          -  Uncontrolled high blood pressure (BP): BP &gt; 160/100. Potential participants can be
             re-screened after control has been achieved.

          -  Pregnancy, breast feeding, or planning pregnancy within 2 years

          -  Other chronic disease likely to limit lifespan to less than 2-3 years, including any
             cancer requiring treatment in past 5 years except non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Chronic use of medicine known to significantly affect glucose metabolism (e.g.,
             corticosteroids, protease inhibitors)

          -  Conditions/criteria likely to interfere with participation and acceptance of
             randomized assignment, including the following: inability/unwillingness to give
             informed consent, another household member already randomized to La Comunidad, major
             psychiatric or cognitive problems (schizophrenia, dementia, self-reported active
             illegal substance or alcohol abuse), participation in another research study that
             would interfere with La Comunidad.

            <description>Participants in the Behavioral: Lifestyle Weight Loss arm will take part in a group program aimed at achieving modest weight loss (5-7%) through promoting healthy eating and increasing physical activity. The intervention sessions will take place at churches and other community locations and will be coordinated and facilitated by LHAs. The lifestyle intervention will be delivered in 2 phases: Phase 1 will last for 6 months and consist of weekly group meetings; Phase 2 will last for 18 months and consist of one LHA-led group session or one telephone contact from the LHA per month. Participants in this treatment arm will also receive individual visits with a registered dietitian during months 1, 3, and 6 of phase 1.
