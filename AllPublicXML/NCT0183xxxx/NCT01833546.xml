A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs are events with start date on or after the date of first dose of study treatment and up to and including 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or events with start date prior to the date of first dose of study treatment, and worsened in severity or become serious during treatment. TEAEs include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Death</title>
        <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this the study drug. An AE was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs are events with start date on or after the date of first dose of study treatment and up to and including 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or events with start date prior to the date of first dose of study treatment, and worsened in severity or become serious during treatment. TEAEs include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <description>Apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase, calculated as Vz = Dose/AUC0-inf multiplied by elimination rate constant [λz]) following single dose. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity, calculated (AUC0-inf) as AUC0-t + AUCextra. AUCextra represents an extrapolated value obtained by Clast / λz, where Clast is the calculated serum concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration is at or above lower limit of quantification (LLQ) and λz is the elimination rate constant. And the elimination rate constant obtained from linear regression of the terminal phase of the log transformed concentration-time data.</description>

Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity, calculated (AUC0-inf) as AUC0-t + AUCextra. AUCextra represents an extrapolated value obtained by Clast / λz, where Clast is the calculated serum concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration is at or above lower limit of quantification (LLQ) and λz is the elimination rate constant.

        <title>Best Overall Response (BOR)</title>
        <description>BOR was determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). BOR was defined as the best response of any of the confirmed complete response (CR), confirmed partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. Stable disease (SD)=Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. PD was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Number of participants with CR, PR, SD and PD were reported.</description>
