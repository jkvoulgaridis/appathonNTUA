      The aim of this study is to investigate the acute effect of two different training on the
      balance and performance of healthy young football players. Cognitive-Based Neuromuscular
      Education (CBNE) will be applied to one group and Game Based Education (GBE) will be applied
      to the other group. In addition to study groups, there will also be a control group.
      Individuals will be randomly placed in groups. Sociodemographic data will be recorded at the
      beginning for all athletes. Then the first measurements of dynamic balance and performance
      will be taken. Star Balance Excursion Test will be used to assess the dynamic balance.
      Measurements shall be taken in 8 directions including anterior (A), anterolateral (AL),
      lateral (L), posterolateral (PL), posterior (P), posteromedial (PM), medial (M) and
      anteromedial (AM) for the right and left sides. Performance will be evaluated by Speed
      Dribbling test. After the first measurements, two study groups will be trained. The control
      group will spend this time relaxing. After the trainings, the final measurements will be
      taken.

      Purposes The primary purpose; The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effect of
      CBNE and GBE on dynamic balance and performance in healthy young football players.

      Secondary objectives; The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between
      dynamic balance and performance in healthy young football players.

      hypotheses H0: In healthy young soccer players, CBNE and / or GBE has no acute effect on
      balance.

      H0: In healthy young soccer players, CBNE and / or GBE has no acute effect on performance.

      H1: CBNE and / or GBE have an acute effect on balance in healthy young football players.

      H2: CBNE and / or GBE have an acute effect on performance in healthy young football players.

    <description>Cognitive-Based Neuromuscular Training has the content of focusing on different tasks at the same time and coordinating on neuromuscular functions as well as football-specific movements. Game-Based Training (OTE), which includes football, tennis, bowling, shooting, racing and climbing games, consists of active video games of game consoles, which are frequently used among young people.</description>
