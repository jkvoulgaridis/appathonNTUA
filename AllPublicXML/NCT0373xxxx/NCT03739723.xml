  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to a number of factors, including power differentials and adverse events, residents are
      susceptible to mistreatment (i.e., discrimination, harassment, and abuse) and toxic outcomes
      (i.e., burnout, attrition, and suicide). Our subsequent work following the FIRST Trial
      identified considerable variation in program-level rates of resident-reported burnout, severe
      stress, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and verbal abuse. To
      investigate these issues, the SECOND Trial will include a national mixed-methods analysis of
      and a pragmatic randomized trial to improve resident program culture and wellness.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective, pragmatic randomized trial will include approximately 320 surgical residency
      programs across the United States. Participating programs will be randomized to the
      intervention or usual care arm. The intervention arm (vs. usual care) will receive
      program-specific cultural outcomes reports and a Surgical Culture Toolkit at the start of the
      trial as well as participate in Coaching Calls and In-Person Meetings to help facilitate and
      support intervention uptake throughout the trial period.

      To assess the individual efficacy of the reports in regards to decreasing rates of
      mistreatment and toxic outcomes, the reports will be given to programs approximately 2 months
      to 6 months prior to toolkit dissemination. Prior to toolkit dissemination, programs will
      have the opportunity to fully review the report, form internal teams to address the issues,
      and mobilize necessary resources in preparation of receiving the toolkit. A comprehensive
      list of all activities performed after report dissemination will be kept at a program level.
      Toolkit dissemination to intervention programs will occur within 6 months of report
      dissemination. Coaching Calls and In-Person Meetings will be held at a variety of time points
      during the trial. The usual care arm will continue to perform their normal quality
      improvement activities.

      Subsequently, the investigators will compare multiple postoperative outcomes between the two
      study arms using data collected from an annual resident survey.
