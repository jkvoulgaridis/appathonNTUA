    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The ORS is a composite score derived from 4 components: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 9-Hole Peg Test in the dominant hand (9HPT-D), and 9HPT in the non-dominant hand (9HPT-ND).</description>

    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>12-week confirmed disability improvement is defined as a patient who showed an improvement in the EDSS+ and maintained the improvement for at least 12 weeks during the treatment period 52-weeks. The EDSS+ is used to assess severity of symptoms of MS and includes the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW), 9-Hole Peg test in either hand (9HPT), and EDSS.</description>
