  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endodontic failures are not uncommonly encountered despite improvements in routine root canal
      therapy. Endodontic microsurgery is one way to manage such failure. The placement of a
      retrograde filling material is considered the most important prognostic factor in endodontic
      microsurgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and radiographic outcome
      of a fast set bioceramic root end filling material in human teeth.

      Patients who were referred to the endodontic postgraduate clinics in the period between
      January 2017 till August 2017 were assessed for inclusion in the study according to preset
      criteria. Endodontic microsurgery was performed following modern techniques including
      magnification, root resection with minimal angle, ultrasonic root end preparation and
      placement of a fast set bioceramic putty as retrograde filling material. The case was
      subsequently evaluated clinically and radiographically at 3, 6 and 12 months. And will be
      followed subsequently at 2 years and 4 years post treatment.
