  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have attempt to improve DAPT adherence through social media. The investigators
      will explore the prevalence of DAPT discontinuation and prove the hypothesis that using
      social media will improve DAPT adherence among patients requiring DAPT following DES
      implantation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is frequently discontinued after drug-eluting stent (DES)
      implantation, which could lead to many major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Social
      media have been proven effective in improving lifestyles and blood pressures control, but few
      studies have attempt to improve DAPT adherence through social media.Therefore, eligible
      patients will be enrolled through scanning QR code and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an
      intervention group or control group with 12 months of follow-up.The investigators will find
      out the prevalence of DAPT discontinuation and prove the hypothesis that using social media
      will improve DAPT adherence among patients requiring DAPT following DES implantation..

    <measure>Rate of Discontinuation of Dual Antiplatelet Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as discontinuation of any dual antiplatelet drug owing to patients' own discretion, including bleeding or non-compliance rather than doctors' advice. Changing of DAPT medication between ticagrelor and clopidogrel under doctors' advice will not be identified as dual antiplatelet drug discontinuation; changing of such under own discretion will be identified as such</description>

    <description>Medication adherence will be assessed according to the MMAS-8 scores. Medication adherence is further divided into poor (&lt;6 points), moderate (6‒7.75 points), and good (8 points) according to the MMAS-8 score.</description>

    <intervention_name>Personalized Reminders</intervention_name>
    <description>The mHealth tools will provide special interventions according to the patients' medical history. For example, patients with hypertension will receive daily reminders on blood pressure measurement and medication. They will also receive early warning on hypertension with a systolic blood pressure of &gt;180 mmHg or &lt;90 mmHg. Patients who smoke will be required to quit smoking. Every patient will receive a Health Report monthly, which will reflect their drug compliance, blood pressure and so on.
Drug Reminders: Patients' medication information will be recorded by obtaining pictures of their medication. Patients will be asked to punch time clocks simply in the mHealth tools. If they forget to punch cards, they can punch cards whenever they think of it. If there is no record of medication for 3 days, SMS alerts will be received, and phone calls will be received over 7 days.</description>

    <description>Auto-Response: After sending personal or discomfort symptom questions, the patients will be provided with an automatic response pushed by the back-end database by crawling the keywords. It is suggested that the answer is just for reference. In case of urgent questions, they will be advised to consult the clinicians.
The researchers will communicate with the patients every month.</description>
