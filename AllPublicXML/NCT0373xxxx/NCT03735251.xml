    <textblock>
      This study is one of the largest ongoing prospective population studies to evaluate target
      organ damages (TODs) and Left Ventricular Diastoic Dysfunction in the community-dwelling
      elderly Chinese, which is authorised and funded by the Shanghai municipal government.This
      study was approved by the Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital Institutional Review Board and was
      conducted under financial support from the Shanghai municipal government (grant ID:
      2013ZYJB0902 and 15GWZK1002). The preliminary sample size is expected to be 3000-4000
      participants.

      The Northern Shanghai Study is an ongoing prospective community-based study. After enrolment,
      clinical examination,anthropometric measurement and a questionnaire will be administered to
      each participant at baseline and after every 2 years in the follow-up. Our tests and
      examinations include: blood/urine sample and biochemical measurements, office blood pressure
      recording, carotid ultrasonograph, echocardiograph, pulse wave velocity, pulse wave analysis,
      4-limb blood pressure recording, body mass index, etc. Baseline measurement will also include
      the assessments on target organ damages(TODs) and the conventional CV risk factors. In the
      follow-up, the incidence of CV events and mortality will be recorded. The Northern Shanghai
      Risk Score will be calculated, with considerations on CV risk factors and TODs.

    <description>All the ultrasonography measurements are performed with a MyLab 30 CV machine (ESAOTE SpA, Genoa, Italy), according to the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations.The echocardiography is performed in the left decubitus position. Left ventricular (LV) internal diameter at end-diastole (LVIDd) and septal (SWTd) and posterior wall thickness at end-diastole (PWTd) are measured directly.

      Venous blood samples are obtained after an overnight fast. Total cholesterol, high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides are measured by standard methods, and the
      Friedewald formula is used to calculate the lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-c).
      Other biological parameters like plasma/urine albumin and creatinine are measured by standard
      methods at local laboratories. The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) is also
      calculated. The serum and urine samples will be stored at −80°C. Prior to storage, the date,
      number of vials and recorder's name will be recorded.

        Northern Shanghai region has the largest population of elderly adults in Shanghai, with a
        total population of 1.57 million and an elderly proportion of over 19%. We use a
        computer-generated list of communities, and 10 communities were randomly selected for the
        first-phase enrolment. Other communities in the list will be randomly selected for the
        later enrolment. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we invite all the
        eligible older people (over 65 years) to participate in this study. The recruitment
        strategies include: (1) posting study recruitment files in the neighbourhood committees and
        community hospitals; (2) according to the health file, community hospitals recruit the
        potential participants Open Accessby telephone; (3) hand out recruitment flyers directly to
        the potential participants.
