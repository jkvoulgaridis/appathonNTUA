  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to pilot test an intervention developed to enhance parent knowledge
      regarding child development and encourage parents to engage in activities that promote
      language acquisition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our specific aim for this proposal is to pilot test an intervention developed to enhance
      parent knowledge regarding child development and the home cognitive environment comprised of
      distribution of (1) publicly available developmental monitoring materials, (2) age and
      language appropriate children's books, and (3) text message reminders. Participants in this
      intervention will receive: (1) educational materials about child development and
      developmental monitoring checklists; (2) age and language appropriate picture books; and (3)
      two text messages per week for a 6-month period. Differences in pre- and post-intervention
      knowledge regarding child development and the home cognitive environment will be assessed.

    <time_frame>Visit 2 (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>We will ask parents to respond to questions regarding child development upon enrollment and at 6-month follow-up.Knowledge questions are based on CDC materials and evidence based screening tools.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Home cognitive environment:</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The StimQ2 is a validated, parent-report measure of the cognitive home environment for children that assesses 4 domains: (1) availability of learning materials, (2) reading, (3) parent involvement in developmental advancement, and (4) parental verbal responsiveness. We will administer the Reading and Parental Verbal Response Scale. Participants will be asked to complete the StimQ2 pre- and post-intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency Shared Reading:</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure how often parents read to their children, they will be asked to respond to the following question at enrollment and at 6-month follow-up, &quot;How often did you read to your child in the last week?&quot;</description>
