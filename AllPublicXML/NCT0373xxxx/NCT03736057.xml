  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to determine whether knowing details about how a person's genes affect
      the way medicines work in the brain and body will help doctors pick more effective or safer
      medicine for that person. Target symptoms are restlessness, agitation, depression and related
      problems common in people with memory loss and dementia.

      This project offers an innovative approach to improving treatment outcomes for people with
      Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as well as a novel electronic health
      record (EHR) -compatible means of assessing treatment response. To date, there has been
      limited investigation of pharmacogenomic testing among people with dementia. Testing has
      mostly been focused on testing a single Cytochrome P450 (CYP)polymorphism to guide treatment
      decisions for cognitive enhancing cholinesterase inhibitor medications in patients with
      Alzheimer disease. Pharmacogenomic guidance of prescribing decisions for psychotropic
      medications has not been studied for BPSD but there is growing evidence that such analyses
      can assist in effective prescription decisions for treatment of depression. Since affective
      symptoms are among the most prominent drivers of BPSD and associated distress, and the
      highest level evidence for successful treatment of BPSD is with the antidepressant drug
      citalopram, investigators believe that pharmacogenomic guidance for selection of drugs to
      treat BPSD is truly innovative, and will provide new insights on implementing safer and more
      effective treatment for BPSD.

      Additionally, investigators will explore the use of the NIH-sponsored Patient Reported
      Outcomes measurement Information System (PROMIS) as an outcome measure for BPSD. PROMIS is a
      system of highly reliable, valid, flexible, precise, and responsive assessment tools that
      measure patient-reported health status. PROMIS measures are available for typical BPSD like
      anger, anxiety, and depression, but their utility has not been studied in a sample of
      dementia patients. They offer the potential, through patient-portal EHR interfaces, for
      clinicians to track treatment responses in a more timely and efficient manner than
      traditional clinic-based instruments, placing less burden on patients and families to present
      for in-clinic assessments.

    <description>Comparison from baseline Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and the 12-week follow-up.
Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire is a questionnaire completed by caregivers about patients designed to measure both neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation/aggression, anxiety, hallucinations). There are 12 symptoms included in NPI-Q. Each domain includes an initial response of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If &quot;yes&quot;, then the caregiver rates the severity of the symptom on a 3-point scale (1= mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe). The NPI-Q provides a total severity score ranged 0-36 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>Comparison from baseline Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the 12-week follow-up.
This assessment is a self- or informant-rated measure that ascertains mental health domains that are important across psychiatric diagnoses. The scale is used as screener for symptoms severity of the following domains: Anger, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale with higher scores reflect greater symptom severity. A rating of mild (i.e., 2) or greater on any item within a domain may serve as a guide for additional inquiry and follow up to determine if a more detailed assessment for that domain is necessary. On the subscales noted above, The raw scores should be summed to obtain a total raw score and identify the associated T-score
The T-scores are interpreted as follows:
Less than 55 = None to slight 55.0—59.9 = Mild 60.0—69.9 = Moderate 70 and over = Severe</description>

    <description>1:1 randomization schedule for delayed knowledge of pharmacogenomic results to clinician and patient. Results are released to prescriber at &lt;1 week (unblinded) or 12 weeks (blinded). When genomic results are available upon receipt, unblinded clinicians select an FDA-approved drug from the &quot;recommended&quot; drugs when possible. Blinded prescribers provide the intended prescription when notified of blinded status. At 4 weeks, 1° outcome measures, NPI-Q and side effects ratings are collected. Clinicians make a GO/NO-GO decision for continuation based on those measures. A NO-GO decision is unblinding and an alternative drug may be prescribed. At 12 weeks, 1° outcomes are collected again. Previously blinded clinicians will be unblinded and may decide to continue or revise the treatment plan based on the clinical outcomes and the genetic results. After the 12 week visit, results of the genetic tests will be entered in the EHR. Further clinical follow-up is based on need.</description>

        As director of the Division of Memory Disorders, PI Dr. Geldmacher leads the effort of the
        four neurologists and two nurse practitioners who provide clinical services at the UAB
        Memory Disorders Clinic (MDC). During 2013, there were 1595 total outpatient MDC visits for
        patients with dementia-related diagnoses. A sample of 100 consecutive MDC patients from
        April 2015 demonstrated that 69 were treated with psychotropic agents, including
        antidepressants (n=67), antipsychotics (n=6), or both.
