  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether resistance exercise will improve immune responses to the
      seasonal influenza vaccine in older adults. One third of the participants will perform
      exercise in the arm that receives the vaccine, one third of the participants will perform the
      same exercise in the arm that does not receive the vaccine, and one third will only receive
      the vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance exercise, particularly novel eccentric exercise, recruits immune cells to the
      targeted muscle. The exercises selected here targets the deltoid and biceps brachii
      muscles-those same muscles that the flu vaccine is delivered to during typical vaccination.
