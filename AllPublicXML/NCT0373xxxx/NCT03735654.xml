  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare walking to leg strength and endurance in people with
      multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Using these findings, we hope to be better understand what causes
      PwMS to have problems walking.

    <textblock>
      The purposes of the research are to determine the association of gait performance with lower
      extremity muscle fatigability and strength measures, and create a preliminary model that can
      better explain the variance in gait performance based on these muscle performance values.
      Objective criterion-based measures of physical fatigue (i.e., fatigability) and muscle
      weakness have been associated with impaired task performance in people with multiple
      sclerosis (MS). MS-related deficits in muscle capacity result in higher fall risks and a loss
      of function. However, it is unclear if lower extremity fatigability tests add clinical value
      to objective strength testing in the rehabilitation and clinical management of MS. Better
      understanding how patterns of lower extremity (LE) fatigability and strength affect mobility
      in people with MS could improve outcome measure development and inform rehabilitation
      strategies.

The system measures ankle and hip motion in three dimensions. It allows for object measurement of balance when a patient performs Romberg, sharpened Romberg eyes open and closed and single leg stance.</description>

    <measure>Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>This is a standardized neurological disability scale developed specifically for MS. It accounts broadly for MS symptoms, including things like mobility, mental health, and sensory disturbances. Scores range from 0-10 with higher scores indicating loss of ambulatory ability.</description>
