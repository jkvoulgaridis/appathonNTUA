  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether pharmacogenomics
      (PGx) testing for ADHD medications will help guide clinicians to choose medications and
      dosages for pediatric ADHD treatment that provide faster symptom relief, fewer or less severe
      side effects, improve patient quality of life, and lessen emotional stress for
      parents/guardians of the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of pediatric Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) patients using an experimental group and a control group. The subjects in the
      experimental group will be administered a commercially available pharmacogenomics (PGx) test
      panel of 38 genes specifically related to drug metabolism rates and drug response. A subset
      of these genes are known to be involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADHD
      medications.

      The PGx test report indicates if there are genetic variants detected related to ADHD
      medications and consequently provides recommendations for the clinician on which medications
      and doses may be optimally effective. The control group is the &quot;treatment as usual&quot; (TAU)
      group whose subjects are treated with medications for ADHD based on the treating clinician's
      customary method(s) for selecting medications and doses.

      The hypotheses to be tested are that PGx testing guidance will reduce the time it takes to
      reach a treatment regimen that improves patient symptom relief, reduces the frequency and
      severity of adverse drug reactions, improves patient quality of life, and reduces parental
      emotional stress. Additionally, since the test is performed using next-generation sequencing,
      we wish to tabulate relevant allele frequencies and use variant call files to discover
      previously unknown PGx genetic variants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Change in ADHD Symptom Severity Between Experimental and Control Group</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement is performed by using the National Institute for Children's Health Quality (NICHQ) Vanderbilt Assessment Scales. The Vanderbilt assessment for ADHD is a validated questionnaire that provides a quantitative measure of ADHD symptoms and severity. Specific measures:
Symptom Score: 18 questions on symptom type and severity between a measure of 0 (Never) and 3 (Very Often). Total Symptom Score range from 0 to 54. Lower scores indicate less severe symptoms.
Performance Score: 8 questions on subject academic and interpersonal relationship functions using a measure between 1 (Excellent) and 5 (Problematic). Performance Score ranges from 0 to 40. Lower scores indicate better performance.
Side Effects or Problems: 12 questions related to health and behavioral issues. Scores range from None, Mild, Moderate, to Severe. These are not quantitatively scored on the assessment.
These measurements will be analyzed separately.
This assessment is performed by parent/guardian.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Differences in Parenting Stress Between Experimental and Control Group</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement is performed using the Psychological Assessment Resources (PAR) Parenting Stress Index - 4th edition - Short Form for Parents of Children (ages 6-10) or Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents (ages 11-18) as appropriate for age at time of enrollment.
Questionnaire for children ages 6 - 10 consists of 36 questions regarding problems with parental stress. Scale for each question ranges from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree). Total scoring ranges from 36 to 180. Higher scores indicate less parenting stress.
Questionnaire for adolescents ages 11 - 18 consists of 90 questions regarding problems with parental stress. Scale for each question ranges from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree). Total scoring ranges from 90 to 450. Higher scores indicate less parenting stress.

Questionnaire consists of 23 questions regarding problems with subject's physical, emotional, social, and school functioning. Scale for each question ranges from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost Always). Total scoring ranges from 0 to 92. Lower scores indicate higher quality of life.
