      This research study is evaluating a psychological intervention for caregivers of loved ones
      with malignant gliomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of loved ones with malignant gliomas frequently experience a physical and
      psychological burden caring for their loved ones. The purpose of this study is to find out
      whether a psychological intervention can help caregivers learn effective coping methods
      during their loved one's treatment and make the experience of being a caregiver more
      manageable.

      The psychological intervention will take place in a series of six sessions. A trained social
      worker or psychologist will meet with the participant or talk with the participant over the
      telephone or by video conference for 45 minutes at a time to discuss the caregiver experience
      while developing effective skills to support the loved one as well as the participant over
      the course of the loved one's illness.

      Upon the completion of the sessions, the investigators will have a short (30-minute) exit
      interview to obtain the participant's feedback on the intervention. The investigators will
      use the feedback to improve the intervention before further testing its effectiveness in
      future research studies. The investigators will also ask the participant to complete
      questionnaires before and after their participation in the intervention to help the
      investigators understand the participant's coping skills, caregiving burden, mood, and
      understanding about the loved one's illness.
