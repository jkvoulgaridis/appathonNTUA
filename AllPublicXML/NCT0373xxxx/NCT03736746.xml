  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of using a cognitive
      behavioral intervention called Motivational Interviewing to help persons with pain from
      cancer set goals for managing that pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate a new way that clinicians can help identify the
      goals that cancer participants have for managing their pain. This new method uses discussion
      between a patient and a clinician, in this case a registered nurse, during which one or more
      goals may be set. At this time, there are no tested methods that clinicians can use for
      helping patients set these kinds of goals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Motivational Interviewing intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of enrolled participants completing at least one follow-up Motivational Interviewing session (at least two sessions total). The proportion of participants completing at least one follow-up intervention session will be estimated along with an exact 90% confidence interval.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivational Interviewing intervention usage rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The number of interventions sessions attended divided by the total possible number of interventions sessions reported as the sample mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant intervention acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Participant Experience Questionnaire, developed by the investigator, will be used to summarize overall patient-reported acceptability in this study. Summary measures of median/range and mean/SD for total categorical scores, the time in weeks from the initial to follow-up intervention visit, and the number of completed intervention sessions will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudinal barriers to pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudinal barriers to pain management will be measured using the Barriers Questionnaire-II which measures four attitudinal realms with 27 self-rated questions about pain beliefs. The total score will be calculated at study entry and after the first follow-up visit and scores will be summarized (median/range, mean/SD). If additional sessions are completed, the scores will be plotted over time and trends will be explored with graphical methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Pain self-efficacy will be measured using the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire in which participants rate their confidence in daily living activities despite pain using a Likert-type scale.The total score will be calculated at study entry and after the first follow-up visit and scores will be summarized (median/range, mean/SD). If additional sessions are completed, the scores will be plotted over time and trends will be explored with graphical methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observed engagement in goals-setting</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Observed engagement will be evaluated using the instrument developed by the investigator for this study in which discussions of behaviors indicating active goal setting will be tabulated and salient quotes will be extracted for dissemination. Categories are:
pain as an obstacle
what helped pain before
life with controlled pain
suggestions to control pain
suggestions actually used
help-seeking</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivational Interviewing intervention fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Fidelity to Motivational Interviewing methods will be assessed on 33% of interviews using the Motivational Interviewing Skills for Health Care Encounters which is used to evaluate the degree to which the person providing the intervention follows five domains key to Motivational Interviewing.The domains are:
Motivational Interviewing philosophy
health interviewing
motivation
Motivational Interviewing principles
interpersonal process
Each domain has specific behaviors that are rated as:
deficient
developing
accomplished
not applicable</description>
