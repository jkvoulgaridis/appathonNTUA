      This pilot trial studies the side effects of hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing participants with glioma. Diagnostic procedures, such
      as hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate MRI, may help find and diagnose glioma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the safety and feasibility of hyperpolarized 13C MR metabolic imaging as a new
           and unique tool for evaluating tumor burden and detecting early response to standard
           therapy in patients with glioma.

        2. To define the most appropriate imaging parameters for obtaining hyperpolarized 13C data
           from the brain, one hundred patients with evidence of residual disease from a prior MRI
           examination will be scanned with either a slice select, a dynamic or a single time point
           MR sequence after receiving an injection of hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate.

        3. To establish the time course of changes in hyperpolarized pyruvate and lactate peaks on
           a voxel by voxel basis from the dynamic hyperpolarized data after the injection of
           hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate. Twenty patients will be studied before and after treatment
           with standard radiation and temozolomide in order to determine the time course of
           delivery of 13C pyruvate and the location of maximum pyruvate and lactate or glutamate
           signals in normal brain and in the region of T2 hyperintensity (T2L).

        4. To evaluate if patients who receive treatment with standard radiation and temozolomide
           exhibit a reduction in hyperpolarized 13C lactate/pyruvate or 13C glutamate/pyruvate at
           post-radiation follow-up compared to their baseline scan. A second group of twenty
           patients will be studied at the time determined from the prior group to provide the
           maximum contrast between lactate/pyruvate or glutamate/pyruvate in the lesion versus
           normal brain.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) and undergo
      MRI at one time point .

      COHORT II: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRI before
      standard treatment with radiation therapy and temozolomide and 4 weeks after completion of
      radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed for up to 24 months.

    <description>Adverse events will be monitored from just before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration until the end of study participation. Vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate only) will be recorded at baseline and 30 minutes post injection. For blood pressures and heart rate recorded after IMP administration, the following safety endpoints will be summarized for each part of the study: (1) The occurrence of changes from baseline, at each post-administration time point, greater than a pre-specified magnitude (20 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure, 10 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure, 10 beats per minute for heart rate). (2) The occurrence of post-administration values outside the normal limits. Toxicities will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology (Toxicity) Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</description>

        To be included in the study all subjects must also meet the following criteria:

          1. Patients must be &gt; 18 years old and with a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          4. Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, would compromise the
             patient's ability to tolerate the imaging examination or any disease that will obscure
             toxicity or dangerously alter response to the imaging agent.

             months prior to study enrollment.

          7. This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to
             measure differences of intervention effects. Males and females will be recruited with
             no preference to gender. Minorities will actively be recruited to participate. No
             exclusion to this study will be based on race.

          8. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study. Patients must sign an authorization for the

             therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.

         11. Patients must not be pregnant or breast feeding. Women of childbearing potential are
             required to obtain a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of Hyperpolarized Imaging

             child-bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (1) Subjects must be excluded from participating in this study if they are not able to
        comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.
