  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is predicted to become the fourth leading cause of disability
      worldwide by 2020. and is estimated to affect more than 40 million people in Europe and 4
      million people in Italy. OA has multifactorial etiology and obesity is one of the most
      important risk factor for knee Regarding therapy of OA in 2014, the European Society for
      Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) published a
      treatment algorithm for the management of knee OA. In Step 1 of the treatment, it is
      recommended to initiate therapy with chronic symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis
      (SYSADOAs). Among SYSADOAs, the evidence is greatest for the effect of chondroitin sulfate
      (CS).

      Sixty overweight subjects with knee osteoarthritis (OA) were recruited and randomly allocated
      to a group of treatment with 600 mg/d of non-animal Chondroitin sulphate (CS) or to a placebo
      group.

      These measurements were considered:

      Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring (TLKS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis
      (WOMAC) index and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain were analyzed at time 0 and at 4 and
      12 weeks. Health-related quality of life by ShortForm36, inflammation by C-Reactive Protein
      (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were also evaluated, together with a body
      composition assessment performed by DXA.

    <measure>Change in Generic Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 30, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity measured both at motion and at rest, using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). VAS measures a characteristic or attitude ranging across a continuum of values and cannot be directly measured. For example, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks. The results are showed with a scale 0-10. 0 means no pain and 10 high pain. A VAS reduction is expected only in treatment group.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Pain (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 30, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of knee pain by WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis) Index. The WOMAC pain scale consists of five questions that assess pain while walking on a flat surface, going up or down stairs, in bed at night, sitting or lying, and standing upright. The responses are recorded on a five-point Likert scale, with a higher score representing a greater level of pain. This scale is valid and reliable in hip and knee OA populations. A significant decrease in expected in treatment group.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Functionality (TLKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 30, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tegner Lysholm Knee function Scoring (TLKS). Each patient completed a self-report questionnaire, TLKS, related to knee symptoms and function. It includes eight items: Limp, Support, Locking, Instability, Pain, Swelling, Stair climbing and Squatting. Each possible response to the items gives an arbitrary score on an increasing scale with a maximum of 100, a higher score representing a higher ability. An increase in expected in treatment group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 30, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life, recorded by the Short Form 36 Health questionnaire (SF-36), a generic measure of health status designed for use in population surveys which consider body pain as a dimension of health status. This is a self-reporting questionnaire and outcomes are measured with 8 numbers that express 8 different aspects of quality of life. Scoring 36-Item Health Survey is a two-step process. First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the given scoring key. all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Hence, scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered.</description>

    <description>Inflammation markers in plasma: C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). High-Sensitivity CRP was determined by immunonephelometry while the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was analyzed by capillary photometry.</description>

    <description>Body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Body composition was measured at baseline by DXA, using a Lunar Prodigy DEXA (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI). Free Fat mass, Fat mass and visceral fat data were derived from DXA using the DXA Prodigy enCORE software (version 17; GE Healthcare).</description>
