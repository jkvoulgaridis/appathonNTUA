        Inclusion Criteria:

        To participate in the study, subjects must meet all inclusion criteria at screening:

          1. Willing and capable of giving informed consent;

          2. Between the ages of 18 and 45 years old, inclusive;

          3. Healthy, per investigator judgment, based on detailed medical history, clinical
             laboratory safety tests, vital signs, full physical examination, and ECG;

          4. Nonsmoker defined as not having smoked or used any form of tobacco within 6 months
             before screening;

          5. BMI between 18.5 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight ≥50 kg at screening;

          6. Willing and able to comply with study procedures, adhere to study restriction, and
             stay at the CRU during in-patient stays required by the protocol;

          7. All female subjects (childbearing potential and non-childbearing potential) must have
             a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening. In addition, female subjects must
             meet 1 of the following 3 conditions: (i) postmenopausal for at least 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause, (ii) surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion) based on
             subject report, or (iii) if of childbearing potential and heterosexually active,
             practicing or agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception. Highly
             effective methods of contraception include an intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine
             hormone-releasing system (IUS), and contraceptives (oral, skin patches, or implanted
             or injectable products) using combined or progestogen-only hormonal contraception
             associated with inhibition of ovulation. A vasectomized male partner is an acceptable
             contraception method if the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the
             female subject and the vasectomized partner has received medical confirmation of
             surgical success. Highly effective methods of contraception must be used for at least
             21 days prior to study drug dosing, throughout the study, and for a minimum of 1 month
             after the end of the study to minimize the risk of pregnancy.

          8. Sexually active, fertile, male patients must be willing to use acceptable
             contraception methods throughout the study and for at least 1 month after the end of
             the study if their partners are of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with a decrease of ≥20 mmHg in systolic
             blood pressure (SBP) or decrease of ≥10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when
             changing from a supine to a standing position after having been in the supine position
             for at least 5 minutes or SBP less than 105 mmHg in a supine position at screening;

          2. Clinically significant history of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal,
             endocrine, hematologic, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, bronchopulmonary, neurologic,
             immunologic, and/or lipid metabolism disorders, and/or drug hypersensitivity;

          3. History of epilepsy, seizures as an adult, lifetime history of stroke, or transient
             ischemic attack (TIA) within 1 year prior to screening;

          4. History of sleep attacks or narcolepsy;

          5. Known or suspected malignancy within 5 years with the exception of treated and cured
             basal cell carcinoma (skin), squamous cell carcinoma (skin), or in-situ cervical
             carcinoma;

          6. Positive blood screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibody;

          7. Positive pregnancy test result or plan to become pregnant if female;

          8. Female who is pregnant or breastfeeding or of childbearing potential without adequate
             contraception (see Inclusion Criterion 7);

          9. Hospital admission or major surgery within 30 days prior to screening;

         10. Receipt of another investigational product within one month or 5 half-lives of the
             other investigational product, whichever is longer, before study drug administration
             in this study.

         11. History of prescription drug abuse or any illicit drug use within 6 months prior to
             screening;

         12. History of alcohol abuse according to medical history within 6 months prior to
             screening;

         13. Positive screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse;

         14. Unwillingness or inability to comply with food and beverage restrictions during study
             participation;

         15. Donation or blood collection of more than 1 unit (approximate 450 mL) of blood (or
             blood products) or acute loss of blood during the 90 days prior to screening;

         16. Use of prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications and/or herbal supplements
             (including St John's Wort, herbal teas, garlic extracts) within 14 days prior to
             dosing (Note: Use of acetaminophen at &lt;3 g/day is permitted until 24 hours prior to
             dosing);

         17. Inability to tolerate study drug in any prior rotigotine or LY03003 trial or
             intolerance or hypersensitivity to rotigotine or any excipients or diluents (Poly
             (lactide-co-glycolide) [PLGA], carboxymethylcellulose sodium [SCMC], stearic acid, or
             mannitol);

         18. History of known intolerance/hypersensitivity to antiemetics such as ondansetron,
             tropisetron, and glycopyrrolate;

         19. History of suicide attempt in the past 6 months and/or seen by the investigator as
             having a significant history of risk of suicide or homicide;

         20. Unwillingness of male participants to use appropriate contraceptive measures (see
             Inclusion Criteria 8) if engaging in sexual intercourse with a female partner of
             childbearing potential throughout the study and for at least 1 month after the end of
             the study;

         21. Unwillingness to refrain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating women
             throughout the study and for at least 1 month after the end of the study;

         22. Any other clinically relevant hepatic, renal, hematologic, and/or cardiac dysfunction,
             or other medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that
             would interfere with the subject's safety or study outcome in the judgment of the
             investigator.

         23. A lifetime history of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymia or other
             specified bipolar and related disorders.
