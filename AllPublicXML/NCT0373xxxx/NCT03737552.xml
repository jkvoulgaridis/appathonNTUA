    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental
      disorder of childhood, affecting 3 -5% children &amp; adolescent worldwide . Inattention,
      hyperactivity, and impulsiveness are the major ADHD symptoms based on the diagnostic criteria
      of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fifth Edition .

      Sleep has been referred to as a &quot;window to the central nervous system&quot;, owing to its close
      associations with many other neurophysiological variables. Children are highly vulnerable to
      sleep disruptions in early childhood, perhaps due to the complexity of the sleep process and
      children's reliance on caregivers for achieving and maintaining sleep .

      The relationship between sleep and ADHD is a complex process and has gained renewed interest
      since clinicians and researchers observed that sleep-related problems and complaints are
      relatively common among children with ADHD .Previous studies have shown that About 25-50% of
      children and adolescents with ADHD have sleep disorders , including nocturnal awakenings,
      phase delay, increased night time activity and insomnia.

      Evaluation of sleep problems in child &amp;adolescent clinical settings is commonly lacking,
      often unrecognized and go untreated in clinical setting. So, Untreated sleep disturbances and
      sleep disorders pose significant adverse daytime consequences and place children at
      considerable risk for poor health outcomes . Sleep disturbances impair a child's cognitive
      functioning and contribute to problems with school attendance and performance .

        This study will involve recruitment of 51 children and adolescents with ADHD and a control
        group of 51 healthy childern and adolescents without psychiatric diagnoses. Participants
        will participate in 3 stages : Screening stage , Sleep Study stage , and Neurocognitive and
        quality of life assessment stage . To ensure consistency in sleep schedules, 1 night of the
        sleep study will occur on weeknights during the school year. The neurocognitive and quality
        of life assessment will occur during the afternoon following the final night of sleep
        assessment.
