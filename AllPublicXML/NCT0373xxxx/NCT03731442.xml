  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, adjuvant therapy is not recommended for patients with esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma who received radical surgery. However, the recurrence rate is as high as 23.8%-58%,
      and the median time-to-recurrence is about 10.5 months. In patients who had residual tumor
      after surgery, evidence lacks for chemoradiation. The aim of the study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of chemoradiation therapy in patients with recurrences after radical
      surgery or palliative surgery.

      Currently, adjuvant therapy is not recommended for patients with esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma who received surgery as their first treatment. However, the recurrence rate is as
      high as 23.8%-58%, and the median time-to-recurrence is about 10.5 months. In patients who
      had residual tumor after surgery, evidence lacks for chemoradiation.

      Retrospective data of 218 cases in our hospital indicated patients underwent salvage
      chemoradiation had significantly improved survival compared with chemotherapy, radiotherapy
      or best supportive care. For patients with locoregional recurrence, the 1-, 3-year overall
      survival (OS) rates were statistically higher in patients received salvage chemoradiation
      than radiotherapy (1-year OS, 70.0% vs. 55.2%, 3-year OS, 41.9% vs. 23.5%, p=0.045). Patients
      received chemotherapy had 1-year OS of 0%.

      Data of 218 cases of our hospital indicated patients received radiation dose &gt; 54Gy had a
      significantly longer median overall survival time of 21.2 months compared with 11.3 months in
      patients had &lt;54Gy. The optimal radiation dose should be further investigated.

      The recurrence pattern of patients with esophageal cancer after esophagectomy mainly consist
      of supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes. For patients recurred after radical surgery,
      prophylactic irradiation to high-risk lymph node regions should be considered. The study use
      simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in this
      trial, which made different radiation dose to recurrent tumor and high-risk lymph node
      regions possible.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemoradiation therapy in
      patients with recurrences after radical surgery or palliative surgery. Patients were further
      assigned to receive elective field irradiation (ENI) or involved field irradiation (IFI)
      according to tumor size, tumor location and time-to-recurrence.

    <description>Patients after R0 surgery whose recurrence lesion larger than 5cm in diameter, or largest diameter was less than 5cm but with skip metastasis far from primary tumor or their time-to-recurrence longer than 16 months were assigned to involved field irradiation group. For lesions far from the thoracic stomach, the prescribed dose is 60Gy/2Gy/30f, and for lesions close to the thoracic stomach, the prescribed dose is 59.4-61.2Gy/1.8Gy/33-34f. Chest CT scan is planned at 50Gy. Radiation field should be modified according to the tumor response. Concurrent chemotherapy of paclitaxel and platinum was delivered every 3 weeks. PEG-rhG-CSF (3-6mg) should be given after 48 hours of chemotherapy.If patients received postoperative chemotherapy of paclitaxel and platinum and went through local-regional recurrence within six months, it is allowed to deliver chemotherapy regimens in the second line. Consolidate chemotherapy were adjusted to the patients after radiation therapy.</description>

    <description>Patients after R1/R2 surgery or R0 surgery with the recurrence lesion whose diameter was less than 5cm without skip metastasis far from primary tumor and time-to-recurrence shorter than 16 months were assigned to elective field irradiation group. For lesions far from the thoracic stomach, the prescribed dose is 50.4Gy/1.8Gy/28f with a simultaneously integrated boost up to 59.92-62.16Gy/2.14-2.22Gy/28f. For lesions close to the thoracic stomach, the prescribed dose is 50.4Gy/1.8Gy/28f with a sequential boost of 10-12Gy/1.8-2Gy/5-7f. For patients whose planned thoracic stomach V50&gt;50%, the dose should be lowered to 45Gy/1.8Gy/25f. Concurrent chemotherapy of paclitaxel and platinum was delivered every 3 weeks. PEG-rhG-CSF should be given in need. If patients received postoperative chemotherapy of TP and went through local-regional recurrence within 6 months, chemotherapy regimens delivered in the second line. Consolidate chemotherapy were adjusted to the patients after radiation therapy.</description>
