  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of rapamycin (sirolimus) versus a
      placebo, an inactive substance, on responses to alcohol cues in individuals with alcohol use
      disorder. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a FDA-approved antibiotic and immunosuppressive drug that
      is currently used to (a) prevent organ transplant recipients from rejecting their transplants
      (b) treat cardiovascular diseases, and (c) treat some forms of cancer. Rapamycin (sirolimus)
      is not FDA-approved to treat alcohol use disorder. The use of rapamycin (sirolimus) in this
      study is investigational, meaning that the study medication is not a proven treatment for
      alcohol use disorder. The study will examine the medication's use as a potential treatment
      for alcohol use disorder, as well as how safe and tolerable it is to take.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate safety of a single 15 mg dose of rapamycin (sirolimus) at first visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>MOSES will be assessed at the first study visit on day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be monitored through adverse events checks by the study physician assistant (PA). The study PA will use the Monitoring of Side-Effects Scale (MOSES) to track if there are any adverse effects. For the MOSES, a higher value indicates a worse outcome. A value of zero indicates no side-effects.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate safety of rapamycin (sirolimus) at second visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>MOSES will be assessed at the second study visit, 24 hours after medication administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be monitored through adverse events checks by the study physician assistant (PA).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate safety of rapamycin (sirolimus) at third (last) visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>MOSES will be assessed at the third study visit, approximately 10 days after medication administration.</time_frame>

    <measure>Evaluate effects of sirolimus versus placebo on drinking behavior during 10 day follow-up period (visit 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>At participant's last study visit, approximately 10 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be given a timeline to record any drinking that occurs between visits 2 and 3.</description>
