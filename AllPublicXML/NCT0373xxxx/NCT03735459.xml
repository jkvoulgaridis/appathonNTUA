  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eczema is a chronic disease that requires long term and extensive treatment. However patient
      adherence to the treatment plans provided to them by their healthcare providers is poor.
      Frequent follow-up appointments have been demonstrated to improve treatment adherence, this
      may be due to patients feeling a sense of accountability which motivates them to adhere to
      their treatment. However, although frequent follow-up appointments are effective, they are
      not feasible. The goal of the Eczema Reminder and Accountability Program (ERAP) is to assess
      the effectiveness of a patient reminder system on patient adherence to treatment and the
      outcome of eczema. Participants will receive weekly/biweekly text messages that encourage
      them to adhere to their treatment plan, and asks them to assess the severity of their eczema
      and adherence to treatment for that week using questionnaires. Participants are then asked to
      send the completed questionnaires to Hamilton Allergy. Should the ERAP improve eczema outcome
      and treatment adherence, the goal is to use the ERAP as a virtual follow-up to reduce the
      need for frequent in-office follow-ups.

    <description>Participants will complete the Patient Oriented SCORAD (PO-SCORAD) to assess the severity of their eczema. Participants in arm 1 (reminders) will complete the PO-SCORAD on the date of randomization, and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 post randomization. Participants in arm 2 (no reminders) will complete the PO-SCORAD on the date of randomization and 6 weeks post randomization.
To assess the impact of the ERAP on the outcome/severity of eczema, the change between the PO-SCORAD score from randomization and week 6 post randomization will be compared for arm 1 and arm 2.</description>

    <time_frame>From 1 week post date of randomization until 6 weeks post date of randomization. Time frame: 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Adherence Questionnaire (AQ) to assess their adherence to the eczema treatment plan provided.
Participants in arm 1 (reminders) will complete the AQ on weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 post randomization.
Participants in arm 2 (no reminders) will complete the AQ on week 6 post randomization.
The AQ will be scored for week 6 post randomization and compared between arms 1 and 2 to determine the impact of the ERAP on treatment adherence.</description>

    <measure>Change in family quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the impact of eczema on the family's quality of life, the participants' parents/guardians will be asked to complete the Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI).
Family members of participants in both arms 1 and 2 will be asked to complete the FDLQI on the date of randomization and 6 weeks post randomization.
The change in FDLQI between the date of randomization and 6 weeks post randomization will be compared between arms 1 and 2 to assess the impact of the ERAP on the family's quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants who are assigned to the patient reminder arm will receive text messages 1, 2, and 4 weeks after enrollment. These text messages will encourage participants to adhere to the provided treatment plan, and ask participants to complete questionnaires to assess their adherence to treatment (in-house Adherence Questionnaire) and severity of eczema (PO-SCORAD) for that week.</description>
