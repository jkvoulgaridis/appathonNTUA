  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether addition of a low dose of total body
      irradiation (TBI) to a standard preparation for transplant [total lymphoid irradiation (TLI)
      and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)] conditioning will help to augment donor chimerism without
      reducing tolerability of this regimen or increasing the risk of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD)

      Primary Objective:

      • Determine the proportion of patients with full donor T-cell chimerism at Day 28 following
      hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Determine the risk of disease progression, overall and event free survival, and
           non-relapse mortality, following treatment with TLI; ATG; and TBI.

        -  Determine the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD following treatment with TLI; ATG; and
           TBI.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      • Determine the changes in frequency of hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and mature cell
      subsets and the changes in cytokine milieu and cellular architecture in the bone marrow of
      patients receiving TLI compared to TLI+TBI.

    <description>Subsequent to TLI/ATG/TBI conditioning, the proportion of patients with full dose donor chimerism (FDC) will be determined at Day 28. FDC is defined as achieving ≥ 95% donor type in the CD3+ lineage within 28 days of donor cell infusion. FDC will be measured with short tandem repeat (STR) testing. The outcome will be expressed as the number and proportion, a number without dispersion.</description>

    <description>Each transplanted participant will be assessed for disease progression at 1 year after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). For each participant, time-to-disease progression will be assessed as a value up to 12 months, and the outcome will be expressed as the median with standard deviation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the number and proportion of participants remaining alive at 12 months after transplant. The outcome is expressed as the number without dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-free survival (EFS) at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the number and proportion of participants remaining alive at 12 months after transplant, who did not experience disease relapse defined as blasts &lt; 5%. The outcome is expressed as the number without dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-relapse mortality (NRM)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Non-relapse mortality (NRM) is defined as death without disease relapse or recurrence. The outcome is reported as the number and proportion of from the group of participants that did not experience disease relapse or recurrence. The outcome is expressed as the number without dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Recipients will be monitored for new Grade 3 to 4 HCT toxicities (related adverse events) and Grade 3 to 4 graft vs host disease (GvHD). The outcome is expressed as the number of patients experiencing qualifying events, and the number of overall qualifying events, without dispersion.</description>
