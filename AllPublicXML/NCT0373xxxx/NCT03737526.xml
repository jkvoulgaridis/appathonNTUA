      To study the influence of anaesthesia (local by cervical block vs. general or spinal
      anaesthesia) on height and volume of resection specimens in case of conization treatment for
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

      Prospective observational study of all patients who underwent a first treatment by loop
      electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for CIN. Height of fresh resection specimens was
      first measured by the operator and then by the pathologist after formaldehyde fixation.
      Volume of fresh specimens was measured in a measuring cylinder by fluid displacement.

      Measure of conization specimens can be done in the operating theatre on fresh specimen or by
      pathologist after fixation. Methods and conditions of specimen measurement are rarely, if
      ever, described in published studies.

        The investigators conducted a prospective non-randomized controlled study at the Amiens
        University Hospital (France). The study took place between January and December 2015. The
        investigators included every patient who underwent a first conization procedure, regardless
        of indication. The only exclusion criterion was the patient's refusal to
        participate.Written consent was obtained before procedure. Data was gathered using
        questionnaires, pre-, per- and post-procedure.
