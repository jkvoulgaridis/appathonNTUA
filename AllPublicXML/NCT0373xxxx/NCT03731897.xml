  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain and it is diagnosed by clinically.

      Resting, stretching exercises, weight loss, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical
      therapy methods are used in the treatment. Steroid injection can be applied in patients who
      do not respond to these treatments. But steroid injection is not a pathology-based treatment,
      and also can cause serious side effects, such as fat pad atrophy and plantar fascia rupture.
      At this stage, in patients who do not respond to conservative treatments, new methods such as
      dextrose prolotherapy and platelet rich plasma may be used instead of steroid injection. In
      the literature, there is insufficient study showing effect of prolotherapy in patients with
      plantar fasciitis. Because these studies enrolled small number of patients and lacked
      controlled design. The investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to
      assess the effect after prolotherapy injection in patients with plantar fasciitis.

      The participants evaluated with clinically and sonographically. The aim of this study is to
      compare the pain, function and thickness of proximal plantar fascia in prolotherapy or
      control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically and sonographically
      diagnosed with plantar fasciitis were randomized into intervention and control group.
      Participants in intervention group received two-session prolotherapy injection and control
      group received two-session 9cc salin + 1 cc 2% lidocaine injection in 3 weeks interval.
      Stretching and range of motion exercises were prescribed after treatment.

      The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Foot Function
      Index , ultrasonographic measurement of proximal plantar fascia. The evaluation was performed
      pretreatment as well as on the 1st and 3th month the treatment.

    <description>Using the Foot Function Index (FFI) to measure the activity and functional status before treatment and multiple time frame after treatment. . The FFI consists of 23 self-reported items divided into 3 subcategories on the basis of patient values: pain, disability and activity limitation. The patient has to score each question on a scale from 0 (no pain or difficulty) to 10 (worst pain imaginable or so difficult it requires help), that best describes their foot over the past week. The higher scores indicate worse pain. Both total and subcategory scores are calculated.</description>
