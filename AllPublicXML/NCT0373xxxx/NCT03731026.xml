  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label study to examine the performance of the LightPath®
      Imaging System using the PET tracer 68Ga-RM2 in patients scheduled for and/or undergoing wide
      local excision (WLE) with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or complete axillary
      lymph node dissection(cALND) for breast cancer with an ER-positive invasive primary cancer.

      The study consists of 3 sequential groups:

      Group 1 (N=20 patients): Torso, i.e. base of skull to thighs, PET/CT imaging and axillary
      gamma probe measurements (using a collimator) of 68Ga-RM2 to: determine the optimal scan
      time-window post-injection; to extrapolate the optimal dose for resolution against axillary
      background signal on gamma probe measurements (first 6 patients); and the value of 68Ga-RM2
      PET/CT imaging for breast cancer staging (all 20 patients).

      Group 2 (N=10 patients): Intraoperative LightPath® imaging with 68Ga-RM2 to familiarise site
      with procedure and interpretation of intraoperative scans,validate the dose and timings
      determined from Group 1, and optimise LightPath® Imaging parameters such as acquisition
      resolution and duration. Group 2 scans will acquire LightPath® images of both intact and
      incised cancer specimens for post-operative standardised, controlled assessment. Group 2 will
      use the optimal scan time-window and 68Ga-RM2 activity extrapolated from at least the first 6
      patients in Group 1. The dose of 68Ga-RM2 will be determined to optimise the intra-operative
      imaging and axillary gamma probe measurements.

      Group 3 (N=50 patients): Intraoperative LightPath® imaging with 68Ga-RM2 to measure agreement
      between LightPath® images and post-operative histopathology. Group 3 scans will acquire
      LightPath® images of intact and incised cancer specimens for post-operative standardised,
      controlled assessment. Group 3 will use the optimal scan time-window and 68Ga-RM2 activity
      extrapolated from the first 6 patients in Group 1 with the optimised imaging parameters, and
      dose developed from Group 2.

      The intraoperative LightPath® Images will be used to inform the surgeons about detectable
      residual cancer in an attempt to achieve better guided cancer surgery and complete tumour
      excision with clear WLE resection margins

      The study site will use the local criteria considered standard of care to guide decisions to
      act on positive margins. Lightpoint Medical will provide guidance to act on LightPath® Images
      in the Instructions forUse (IFU). It will be at the Investigator's discretion to choose
      whether to act based upon the intraoperative LightPath® Images.

      In Group 3,the resection margin status of the WLE specimen, cavity shavings (if any) and the
      metastatic status of axillary (sentinel) lymph nodes as measured with the LightPath® Imaging
      System will be compared with histopathology results. A positive margin on histology will be
      defined as

        -  Invasive carcinoma: positive: ink on tumour; close: &lt;1mm; negative ≥1mm

        -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)or pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (if
           present): positive: ink on tumour; close: &lt;2mm; negative ≥2mm.
