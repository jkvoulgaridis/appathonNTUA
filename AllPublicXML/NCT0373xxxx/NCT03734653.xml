      This is an open-labeled, single-arm, interventional pilot study. It is being done to
      determine the feasibility of the administration of transdermal testosterone alternating with
      enzalutamide, as well as the safety and efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this trial is to determine the feasibility of the administration of
      transdermal testosterone alternating with enzalutamide. High dose testosterone has shown
      activity in phase II studies of patients with castration resistant metastatic prostate
      cancer; however, these studies have generally employed the intramuscular formulation. It has
      been hypothesized that the transdermal formulation will show activity but will have less
      potential for toxicity due to extremely high levels of circulating testosterone (i.e.
      thrombotic events). In addition, this will allow for a steady state of elevated testosterone,
      rather than the peaks and troughs seen with the IM approach.
