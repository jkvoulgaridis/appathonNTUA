  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the clinical activity of novel immune-oncology agents (in combination
      or as single agents) to standard of care in participants with relapsed/refractory advanced
      NSCLC. The study will initially evaluate two treatment regimens/arms. Additional
      regimens/arms may be added via future protocol amendment(s). Participants will be stratified
      by histology (squamous vs. non-squamous) and line of anti-programmed cell death ligand 1
      (PD[L]1) therapy (first vs. second line). Initially, the study will evaluate the GSK3359609
      inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) agonist in combination with SoC docetaxel compared to
      docetaxel alone (sub-study 1). SoC arm will be the common comparison arm across all
      sub-studies. At study start, subjects will be randomized to the study at a ratio of 1:2 to
      Arm 1 (docetaxel) and Arm 2 (ICOS agonist + docetaxel). The study will consist of three
      periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-Up. There will be approximately 105 participants
      enrolled in the study initially. Treatment will continue for approximately 2 years and
      participants will be followed for survival during the follow-up period.

             advanced recurrent, Stage IIIb/Stage IV or metastatic disease. Two components of
             treatment must have been received in the same line or as separate lines of therapy: i.
             A maximum of 1 line of platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic
             setting, and ii. A maximum of 1 line of PD(L)1 mAb containing regimen. b. Subjects
             with known BRAF molecular alterations must have had disease progression after
             receiving the locally available SoC treatment for the molecular alteration.

          -  Measurable disease, presenting with at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1.

          -  ECOG PS score of 0 or 1.

          -  A tumor tissue sample obtained at any time from the initial diagnosis of NSCLC to time
             of study entry is mandatory. Although a fresh tumor tissue sample obtained during
             screening is preferred, archival tumor specimen is acceptable.

          -  Adequate organ function.

          -  A male subject must agree to use a highly effective contraception during the treatment
             period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain
