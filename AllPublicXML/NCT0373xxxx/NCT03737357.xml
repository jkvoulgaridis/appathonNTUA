  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-market study is to show that dental implants with a SLActive® surface (SLActive®
      implants) show non-inferior clinical performance compared to dental implants with a SLA®
      surface (SLA® implants). The primary hypothesis is that 12 months after implant loading, the
      bone loss around the SLActive® implants will not be appreciably greater than around the SLA®
      implants.

      The occurrence of adverse events and device deficiencies will also be recorded to confirm
      once more the safety of the Straumann® Bone Level Tapered (BLT), Roxolid® implant.

      Osseointegration and anti-inflammatory potential of SLActive® implants will be evaluated in
      the study as secondary endpoints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, paired sample, multi-center clinical
      study. Eight visits per patient are scheduled in this study. The final analysis will be
      conducted after all patients completed the 12-month visit.

      The study devices are CE- (Conformité Européenne, meaning European Conformity) marked
      products and used within their intended use.

      Two centers in Spain will participate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  males and females, at least 18 years old

          -  partially edentulous patients in need of two or more dental implants (canine to
             molars) placed in two different quadrants in healed sites (3 months post extraction)

             per day) or who use chewing tobacco

          -  subjects with drug or alcohol abuse

             either bone or soft tissue or the osseointegration process (e.g. bone metabolism
             disturbances, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, anticoagulation drugs/ hemorrhagic
             diatheses)

          -  patients with local factors that could interfere with the healing process, such as
             untreated periodontal diseases, acute infection of implant site, temporomandibular
             joint disorders, treatable pathologic diseases of the jaw and changes in the oral
             mucosa)

          -  conditions or circumstances, in the opinion of the investigator, which would prevent
