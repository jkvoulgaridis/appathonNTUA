  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a blinding optic neuropathy that affects 60 million people around the world.
      Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common etiology. The therapeutic arsenal now includes
      medicated hypotonic treatments, lasers and surgery. The most common glaucoma surgery in
      France is trabeculectomy and non-perforating deep sclerectomy. These are two filtering
      surgeries whose principle is to lower the intraocular pressure by creating a way of
      evacuation of the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye to the space sub
      conjunctival creating a bubble of filtration. The short-term complications with these
      techniques are early hypotonia and its attendant complications (choroidal detachment,
      maculopathy of hypotonia, haemorrhage...). In the medium term, blood pressure with deep
      anterior chamber, testify to a scleral flap too tight which may require suture lysis.
      Finally, the problems of excessive conjunctivo-tenon healing affect 25 to 30% of operated and
      are responsible for the majority of late blood pressure. In the longer term, the most common
      complication is cataracts. It can be complicated by a very serious endophthalmitis. A new
      minimally invasive therapeutic option has been developed that limits per and postoperative
      complications. In contrast to traditional techniques that have an ab externo approach, the ab
      interno approach of the proposed new technique involves the implantation of a collagen tube 6
      mm in length and 45 μm of light called Xen® through the anterior chamber. This surgery can be
      performed alone or at the same time as a cataract surgery. The geometry of the Xen® implant
      has been studied to prevent major hypotonia. This new technique would also avoid the
      complications associated with conjunctival dissection, while being faster. A Xen® implant is
      nowadays indicated for simple surgery or combined with cataract surgery for open-angle,
      early-to-moderate, cataract and non-cataract glaucoma, progressive and unbalanced under local
      hypotonism therapy. Since June 2017, the Xen® technique is part of the routine at GhPSJ.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of surgery with Xen® implantation on
      intra-ocular pression drop in patients with primary or secondary open-angle glaucoma,
      beginner to moderate. The study will be proposed to all eligible patients operated between
      June 2017 and June 2018. After patient's non opposition, clinical data will be collected from
      patient's medical record.

    <description>The success of surgery will be evaluate with the intra-ocular pressure's measurement. Complete success corresponds to Intra-ocular pressure between 5 and 18 mmHg, with a relative decrease of more than 20% compared to the initial intra-ocular pressure, without having resorted to hypotonic treatments. Partial success corresponds to intra-ocular pressure between 5 and 18 mmHg but with an intra-ocular pressure reduction of less than 20% or with maintenance of a hypotonizing treatment. Therapeutic failure is defined as an intra-ocular pressure strictly greater than 18 mmHg or less than 5 mmHg.</description>
