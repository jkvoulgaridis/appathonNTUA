    <textblock>
      Rising costs and poor patient experiences from under-treated symptoms have led to the demand
      for approaches that improve patients' experiences and lower expenditures. This observational
      project assigned a lay health worker to concuct proactive symptom assessments intended to
      achieve these goals among patients with advanced cancer.

      All newly diagnosed Medicare Advantage enrollees with Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors or
      hematologic malignancies who planned to receive all oncology care at the Oncology Institute
      of Hope and Innovation from 11/1/2015 through 9/30/2016 were enrolled in the program. The
      program consisted of a 12-month telephonic program in which a lay health worker (LHW)
      supervised on-site by a registered nurse practitioner (RNP), assessed patient symptoms after
      diagnosis using the validated Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) with the frequency of
      symptom assessment varying based on patient risk. We evaluated feasibility, defined as
      monthly LHW documentation of symptom assessments, and change in patient-reported satisfaction
      and overall and emotional and mental health with validated assessments at enrollment and
      5-months post-enrollment among patients in the intervention. We compared healthcare use and
      costs to a historical cohort of similar Medicare Advantage enrollees diagnosed between
      11/1/2014-10/31/2015 (control). We assessed differences in demographic and clinical factors
      between the two groups using chi-square and t-tests and used generalized linear models to
      evaluate differences in healthcare use and costs.

    <description>Each patient will receive a satisfaction with care survey (The Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems - General (CAHPS)) at baseline and 5 months. We will measure the change in satisfaction from baseline to 5 months. Scores for satisfaction were assessed using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems-General survey question #18 which measured rating of health provider, on which scores range from 0 to 10, with higher ratings correspond to higher patient satisfaction. Scores for each group are averaged at baseline and at 12 months.</description>
