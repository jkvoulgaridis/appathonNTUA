  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      There are many people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Liberia.
      Most experts consider HIV an epidemic there. Researchers want to collect health data from
      Liberians with HIV over several years. This may help HIV prevention and treatment programs in
      Liberia.

      Objective:

      To learn more about how HIV affects people in Liberia.

      Eligibility:

      People with HIV in Liberia

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a blood sample.

      Participants will visit the study clinic about 10 times over 3 years. They will need to
      return to the clinic after some visits to get test results. The visits will be closer
      together during the first part of the study and less frequent later.

      At each study visit, participants will:

        -  Have a brief physical exam

        -  Answer questions about how they are feeling and what medicines they are taking

        -  Have blood taken from an arm vein by a needle

        -  Give urine samples

      Participants ages 12 years or older may be asked questions about HIV risk behaviors. These
      include sex practices and drug use. Participants ages 18 years or older may be asked how
      their

      HIV infection makes them feel emotionally.

      Participants may be asked to join a research substudy. This will be about tuberculosis (TB)
      testing in people with HIV. For this substudy, participants will have a TB skin test. A small
      amount of liquid will be injected under the skin on the arm.

      Participants will return to the clinic a few days later. The test area will be checked. They
      will get their test results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resources for management of HIV-positive individuals are extremely limited in the West
      African country of Liberia, and many knowledge gaps exist about the nature of the HIV
      epidemic in this country. While the prevalence is likely low compared to other regions in
      Sub- Saharan Africa, the burden of disease is likely high given the current state of the
      Liberian health care system, despite attempts to improve HIV treatment services and coverage.
      The Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016 created tremendous strain on a health care system already
      weakened by years of civil strife, and it is suspected that care for many HIV-positive
      individuals was disrupted by this event. Currently, clinicians do not have regular access to
      measurements of CD4 levels or viral loads, making management of people living with HIV in
      Liberia difficult. While there is some access to antiretroviral (ARV) medications through the
      National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Control Program, several details,
      including the extent of this access and the impact on disease outcomes, remain unknown. This
      cohort study will examine these basic factors; attempt to characterize major
      social/demographic, clinical, immunologic, and virologic features of HIV/AIDS; and
      investigate the course of HIV disease, including rates of hospitalization, frequencies of ARV
      regimen modifications, and incidence of certain opportunistic diseases, STIs, other
      co-infections, and non-AIDS comorbidities among those who are enrolled. Study participants
      will attend periodic study visits over 3 years. Clinical information will be collected, as
      will blood and urine samples for clinical and research tests. This protocol is not designed
      to estimate the prevalence of HIV infection; however, it provides a unique opportunity to
      generate quality data to understand the course and epidemiology of HIV and AIDS in Liberia.
      It also provides an opportunity to contribute to the quality and impact of HIV prevention,
      treatment, and care programs in Liberia.
