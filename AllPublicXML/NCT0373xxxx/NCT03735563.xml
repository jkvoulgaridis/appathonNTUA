  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early respiratory management of preterm infants immediately after birth should be as gentle
      as possible. With this so-called developmental approach, unnecessary invasive methods can be
      avoided or at least postponed. This kind of &quot;soft landing&quot; allows cardiorespiratory
      transition with fewer adverse outcomes. Less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) is a
      technique that involves delivery of surfactant to a spontaneously breathing infant through a
      thin catheter. This technique minimizes the risk for neonatal lung injury caused by positive
      pressure ventilation. LISA is nowadays widely used in neonatal intensive care units (NICU).
      Although less invasive, newborns exposed to this procedure need premedication prior the
      procedure. There is no consensus, which drug would be the optimal premedication for LISA and
      the research on this topic is lacking. An ideal premedication would treat the procedural pain
      without suppressing the infant's own breathing. The sedation and analgesia should start fast
      but the effect should be short-acting with as few adverse effects as possible. The aim of
      this randomized, controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety
      of LISA protocol with the premedication of either ketamine or fentanyl by investigating
      whether one or the other is associated with lower rate of adverse events, hence would be
      preferred choice for premedication protocol.

      All infants fulfilling the inclusion criteria during the study period are asked to
      participate in this randomized controlled trial of LISA premedication. Written informed
      parental consent is acquired from all of the participants. After the consent, individuals
      needing the LISA will receive premedication as follows: caffeine (in case of gestational age
      &lt;32 weeks and not already given), glycopyrrolate, and randomly either ketamine or fentanyl.
      The investigators and medical staff are blinded to the fact which study medication is given.
      This study is a pilot study and 20 patients are recruited for both groups. Randomization is
      done in the blocks of four.

      S-ketamine (Ketanest-S 5 mg/ml) or fentanyl (Fentanyl-Hamel diluted to 5 μg/ml) is used as a
      masked study drug. Both study drug solutions appear equally transparent. Drug administration
      is started with glucopyrrolate (Robinul 0.2 mg/ml), which is given intravenously at a dose of
      5 µg/kg. Thereafter, the masked study drug is administered intravenously slowly in one to two
      minute injection of 0.2 ml/kg. In this way, doses of S-ketamine 1 mg/kg or alternatively
      fentanyl 1 μg/kg is received. After five minutes (from the beginning of administration of the
      study drug), videolaryngoscopy is started. If the study drug does not have sufficient effect,
      the study drug may be repeated with the same dose. If study drug fails to give appropriate
      conditions to LISA procedure, midazolam 0,1 mg/kg can be used as an additional drug.

    <description>Pain will be scored with validated Neonatal Infant Acute Pain Assessment Scale (NIAPAS) tool. The scale includes five behavioral and three physiological indicators, and takes into account the gestational age of neonates as a contextual factor. The indicators are rated on a 2, 3, or 4-point scale for a possible total score of 18. Assessments of each neonate include alertness, facial expressions, crying, muscle tension, reaction to handling, and breathing. In addition, the neonates on monitors are assessed for changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation (Copyright Pölkki T, Korhonen A, Axelin A. 2013)</description>
