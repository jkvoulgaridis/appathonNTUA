      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-blinded controlled study. Dynamic
      monitoring of patients with stage II-III colorectal cancer was performed using the previously
      established colorectal tumor-specific plasma ctDNA methylation markers (diagnostic model
      established by next-generation sequencing of 2181 gene loci methylation). The methylation
      marker had a sensitivity of 93% in colorectal cancer patients with a specificity of 99% in
      healthy individuals. Dynamic monitoring of high-throughput next-generation sequencing of
      plasma ctDNA methylation before and after treatment and at regular follow-up in patients with
      colorectal cancer after radical resection of stage II-III colorectal cancer, to explore the
      predictive effect of postoperative plasma ctDNA methylation on postoperative recurrence and
      whether dynamic monitoring of postoperative ctDNA methylation could be earlier than imaging
      examination to indicate tumor recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the main treatment of stage II-III CRC (CRC) is surgical resection. CRC patients
      after radical surgery have good overall survival. However, there are still a large number of
      patients with postoperative recurrence. The postoperative recurrence rate of stage II CRC
      patients is 20-30%, and that of stage III CRC patients is 50-60%. Currently, there is no
      effective measures to predict whether patients suffer postoperative relapse. Patients can
      only periodically visit doctors in the hope of timely treatment in case of recurrence.
      Current clinical monitoring methods mainly include imaging detection and tumor markers
      detection. However, long-term monitoring may affect patients' quality of life and increase
      patients' economic burden. Therefore, biomarkers that can predict the prognosis of patients
      and screen out those who need intensive follow up are urgently warranted. At present, imaging
      is the mainly used approach to monitor tumor recurrence. Quantitative determination of ctDNA
      methylation in plasma may find tumor recurrence trend before imaging detection, indicating
      that quantitative determination of ctDNA methylation in plasma is a more sensitive monitoring
      approach than traditional imaging detection. Can next-generation sequencing of the plasma
      ctDNA methylation be a new recurrence monitoring technique and prognostic prediction method
      of stage II-III CRC in clinical practice? In this study, we aimed to monitor the dynamic
      level of plasma ctDNA methylation after surgery in patients with stage II-III CRC, and to
      explore the advantages of plasma ctDNA methylation detection over traditional CRC in
      recurrence monitoring and prognosis prediction. This is a prospective, multicenter,
      observational, single-blinded controlled study. Dynamic monitoring of patients with stage
      II-III CRC was performed using the previously established colorectal tumor-specific plasma
      ctDNA methylation markers (diagnostic model established by next-generation sequencing of 2181
      gene loci methylation). The methylation marker had a sensitivity of 93% in CRC patients with
      a specificity of 99% in healthy individuals. Dynamic monitoring of high-throughput
      next-generation sequencing of plasma ctDNA methylation before and after treatment and at
      regular follow-up in patients with CRC after radical resection of stage II-III CRC, to
      explore the predictive effect of postoperative plasma ctDNA methylation on postoperative
      recurrence and whether dynamic monitoring of postoperative ctDNA methylation could be earlier
      than imaging examination to indicate tumor recurrence.
