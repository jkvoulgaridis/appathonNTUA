  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Textile workers are exposed to various harmful substances during work, including cotton dust,
      which is the dust present in air during the handling or processing of cotton. Previous
      research found a link between cotton dust exposure and impaired respiratory health. This
      study will comprise of administration and workers' training regarding preventive measures for
      protection against respiratory illnesses. Workers will be provided free, disposable face
      masks and measures to reduce cotton dust exposure will be introduced at the textile mills.
      The study would then determine the effectiveness of this intervention on reduction in cotton
      dust levels in the mills, and improvement in respiratory health of workers. This study would
      help the cotton textile workers and managers reduce the health hazards of cotton dust
      exposure and also guide researchers from Pakistan and other low-resource countries towards
      developing relevant strategies for health protection of these workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The textile, clothing and footwear sector provides employment to more than 60 million people
      worldwide, mostly in developing countries. Pakistan's textile industry accounts for 8.5% of
      the national GDP and employs around 40% of the industrial workforce. High burden of
      respiratory illnesses, including byssinosis and lung function decrements has been reported
      among cotton textile workers in developing countries and previous work undertaken by Dr
      Nafees found a high burden in Pakistan. Dr Nafees recently implemented an interventional
      study designed to improve workers' knowledge, attitude and practices and respiratory health,
      and reduce dust exposure at cotton textile mills through a multifaceted intervention
      (MultiTex pilot study). The preliminary findings from the pilot were helpful in improving the
      overall design and implementation of a larger and more definitive study (cluster randomised
      controlled trial). The aim of the trial would be to determine the effectiveness of a
      multifaceted interventional package for improvement in reducing dust levels at the cotton
      textile mills as well as improvement in respiratory health of textile workers.This study will
      add important context-specific knowledge regarding preventive strategies in cotton mills with
      policy implications for Pakistan and other developing countries.
