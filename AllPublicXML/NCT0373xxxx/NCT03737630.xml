  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that affects some organs of the human body. Among them,
      the lungs tend to be the most affected due to the accumulation of mucus in the airways, which
      in addition to avoiding the passage of air, favors pulmonary infections. With the evolution
      of the condition, secondary complications arise, such as postural changes, decreased
      respiratory muscle strength, decreased functional capacity and, consequently, quality of
      life. Therefore, respiratory muscle training may be an intervention that improves the
      respiratory condition of these individuals, allowing an improvement in the quality of life
      and may delay the evolution of respiratory symptoms. Thus, this study aims to investigate a
      home protocol of respiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle strength, lung function,
      quality of life, posture and functional capacity in adolescents and adults with cystic
      fibrosis. The researchers believe that the training can cause an improvement in the studied
      variables, and can be inserted in the usual treatment of these patients.
