      Assessment of pulp inflammation by hemostasis achievement after pulp exposure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The possibility has been raised of diagnosing pulpal pathological status using the cytokines
      that are released during the inflammation process in healthy as well as infected tooth pulp.
      Cytokines are small polypeptides secreted by leucocytes and other inflammatory cells and are
      known to play important roles in the intensity and duration of the immune response
