  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome is to assess the impact of the group program on falls prevention and
      patient education on home modifications and the implementation of technical assistance.

      This study aims to demonstrate that a group program on falls prevention and patient education
      will improve the acceptance and the implementation of recommendations on technical assistance
      and home modifications following discharge after an hospitalization for fall.

      The secondary outcome will measure the impact of the group program on the incidence of falls,
      the number of readmissions, fear of another fall and improvement in walking and balance
      skills.

    <time_frame>6 months after the hospitalization discharge (patient call #2)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of potential falls in the 6 months after discharge will be measured by a telephone call to the patient (if impossible, the call will be placed to his caregiver or nurse).</description>

    <time_frame>At inclusion visit (visit 0; before the occupational therapy) and after the occupational therapy (visit 1; 2 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of falling will be measured by the Falls Efficacy Scale I [FES-I] (score from 16 to 64; higher values represent a stronger fear of falling)</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the walking by the &quot;Stop Walking when Talking&quot; test</measure>

    <description>20 items distributed in 4 themes: mobility in decubitus, sitting position, standing position, walking.
Each item rated from 0 (motor skill abnormal) to 1 (motor skill preserved) Total score from 0 to 20; higher values represent preserved motor skills</description>

    <time_frame>At inclusion visit (visit 0; before the occupational therapy) and after the occupational therapy (visit 1; 2 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>The time of the course (in seconds) is retained as the final score. The test is positive if the score is 14 seconds or more, representing a risk of falling.</description>
