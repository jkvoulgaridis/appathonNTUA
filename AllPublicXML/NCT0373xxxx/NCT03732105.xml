    <textblock>
      RAISE is a multicenter phase II randomized 2x2 factorial trial. The purpose is to further
      investigate both the efficacy and safety of the radiotherapy/apatinib for adjuvant treatment
      of HCC patients accepted radical resection with microvascular invasion.

    <textblock>
      RAISE trial will recruit 160 patients, and they will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to four groups
      (radiotherapy group, apatinib group, radiotherapy+apatinib group and control group). Patients
      in radiotherapy group will receive Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) at a dose of
      50Gy/25fraction after randomization. Patients in apatinib group will receive oral apatinib at
      an initial dose of 500mg/qd until recurrence, patient withdrawal or unacceptable toxic
      effects. Patients in radiotherapy+apatinib group will receive Intensity Modulated Radiation
      Therapy (IMRT) at a dose of 50Gy/25fraction after randomization and after radiotherapy they
      will receive oral apatinib at an initial dose of 500mg/qd until recurrence, patient
      withdrawal or unacceptable toxic effects. Patients on the control arm will be actively
      monitored after randomization.

Two dose reductions were permitted for apatinib (500 mg and 250 mg taken on alternate days, and 250 mg once daily).
