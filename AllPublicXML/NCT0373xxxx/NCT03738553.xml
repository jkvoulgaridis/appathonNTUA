  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, observational research study in which women are observed using
      DWI/DCE MRI imaging before and after receiving neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy.

      This is not a treatment trial. Patients will be treated according to the plan developed by
      their medical oncologists. Only patients planning to receive anti-HER2 therapy as part of
      planned systemic therapy will be eligible for this imaging study. Patients and their
      referring oncologist will be asked to start the anti-HER2 therapy 2-3 weeks prior to surgery
      and after the pre-therapy MRI.
