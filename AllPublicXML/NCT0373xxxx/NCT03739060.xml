  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lichtenstein herniorrhaphy still remains one of the most often performed inguinal hernia
      repair techniques. It is frequently associated with acute postoperative and chronic pain. Due
      to insufficient effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, they are often overdosed.
      However opioids have many side effects. Interventional treatment, such as transversus
      abdominis plain (TAP) block requires an additional intervention and has relatively short
      effect, also could not be applied in outpatient conditions. The hypoalgesic effect of
      transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is well known for many years, but
      effectiveness during postoperative period is still controversial and maybe therefore didn't
      come to daily practice. However it could be a promising part of multi-modal pain treatment
      for hernia patients. This study analyse the hypoalgesic effect of TENS and its impact on
      hernia specific quality of life (QoL) after Lichtenstein hernia repair.

      Aim#1 To determine whether use of TENS is effective for acute postoperative pain relief.

      Aim#2 To determine whether use of TENS have impact on hernia specific QoL in early and late
      postoperative period.

      Aim#3 To identify factors associated with effectiveness/ineffectiveness of TENS procedures.

      Aim#4 To determine whether a psychological condition (depression, anxiety and pain
      catastrophisation) is somehow associated with TENS effectiveness.

    <description>Pain is assessed using a 100 mm handheld slide rule-type visual analogue scale (VAS) with values from 0 to 100 (0 = no pain, 100 = extreme pain) during lying, waking and getting out of bed. Total scores are averaged.</description>

    <time_frame>1 hour before surgery (baseline), 2 days, 1 week, 4 weeks and 6 month after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall quality of life is assessed using self reported short form (36) health survey questionnaire (SF-36) application.The SF-36 consists of 36 items, that aggregate into 8 parts: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. Each domain is scored on a value of 0 (poor health) to 100 (best health).</description>
