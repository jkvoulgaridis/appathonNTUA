  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SPK-8016 is in development for the treatment of patients with inhibitors to FVIII. This Phase
      1/2, open-label, non-randomized, dose-finding study is part one of a planned two part study
      of SPK-8016. Part one will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of SPK-8016 in
      adult males with clinically severe hemophilia A and no measurable inhibitor against FVIII.
      Data obtained from Part 1 will inform the study design and dose selection for Part 2 in
      patients with FVIII inhibitors.

        Inclusion Criteria for Part 1:

          1. Be male and ≥18 years of age;

          2. Have clinically severe hemophilia A, defined as:

               1. &lt;1% (&lt;1 IU/dL) endogenous FVIII activity levels as historically documented by a
                  certified laboratory or screening data results; OR

               2. 1-2% (1-2 IU/dL) endogenous FVIII activity levels and &gt; 10 bleeding events per
                  year (in the last 52 weeks prior to screening); OR

               3. 1-2% (1-2 IU/dL) endogenous FVIII activity levels and on prophylaxis;

          3. Have had &gt;150 exposure days (EDs) to any recombinant and/or plasma-derived FVIII
             concentrates or cryoprecipitates

          4. Have no prior history of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with any FVIII or
             IV immunoglobulin administration

          5. Have no measurable inhibitor against FVIII as assessed by central laboratory, have no
             confirmed history of clinically significant FVIII inhibitor, and no clinical signs or
             symptoms of decreased response to FVIII administration (Note: family history of
             inhibitors will not exclude study participation)

          6. Agree to use reliable barrier contraception after the administration of SPK-8016 until
             notified by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria for Part 1:

          1. Have active hepatitis B or C

          2. Have significant underlying liver disease.

          3. Have serological evidence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 with CD4 counts ≤200/mm3. Participants who
             are HIV-positive and stable, with an adequate CD4 count (&gt;200/mm3) and undetectable
             viral load, and are on an antiretroviral drug regimen are eligible to enroll

          4. Have detectable antibodies reactive with AAV-Spark capsid

          5. Have history of chronic infection or other chronic disease

          6. Have been dosed in a previous gene therapy research trial within the last 52 weeks or
             with an investigational drug within the last 12 weeks

          7. Any concurrent clinically significant major disease (such as liver abnormalities or
             type I diabetes) or other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or
             Sponsor, makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study;

          8. Unable or unwilling to comply with the schedule of visits and study assessments
             described in the clinical protocol.
