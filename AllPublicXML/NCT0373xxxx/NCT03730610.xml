  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and insulin resistance are worldwide epidemic and taking a major public health toll.
      Obesity also increases the risk for cognitive impairment which is also an increasing medical,
      societal, and economic challenge. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a
      statistical model to assess systemic cross-talk between brain, peripheral tissues, gut
      microbiota and glucose metabolism. Integrated with exercise training intervention the results
      will be utilized to provide disease risk profiling and personalized predictions of exercise
      training as a drug free treatment for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
