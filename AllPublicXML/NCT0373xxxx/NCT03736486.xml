    <textblock>
      The Mil Familias Program is a 10-year initiative to reduce the burden of cardio-metabolic
      disease among Latino families in the Central Coast of California. The Mil Familias Program
      involves enrolling 1000 Latino families with at least one member in the family having type 2
      diabetes, measuring the 5 determinants of human health: genetics, biology, behavior,
      psychology and environment, training Latino community health workers (&quot;Especialistas&quot;) ,
      creating a Living Information (bio)Bank and planning culturally-relevant interventions.

      The Mil Familias Pilot Study aims to develop, operationalize and refine methods to both
      recruit and collect data from 100 adult participants pertaining to the 5 determinants of
      human health: genetics, biology, behavior, psychology and environment. Specially-trained
      Latino and bilingual community health workers known as &quot;Especialistas&quot; will be used to help
      gather data and to serve as the participants trustworthy health companion. Over 100 variables
      of information pertaining to the 5 determinants of human health (as listed above) will be
      gathered and stored to create a Living Information (bio)Bank particular to Latinos. The
      ultimate goal of this research is to provide the target population with effective,
      culturally-relevant interventions that are geared toward population specific needs.
