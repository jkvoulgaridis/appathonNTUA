      Primary objective

      - Evaluate the efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) of aflibercept in
      combination with FOLFIRI in patients treated routinely for metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC) after failure of treatment with oxaliplatin + EGFR.

      Secondary objective

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI on the 2-year overall
           survival rate and the objective response rate.

        -  Evaluate the tolerance profile of aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI.

             -  Observational study, national, multicenter, cohort, prospective without
                intervention on the therapeutic strategy.•

      Inclusion criteria

        -  All patients expected to be treated with aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI for a
           mCRC, after failure of treatment with oxaliplatin + anti-EGFR on the decision of the

           defined as progression during or within 6 months after discontinuation of oxaliplatin

      Exclusion criteria :

        -  Concurrent participation in a clinical trial

        -  Patients who have previously received anti-VEGF agents and / or aflibercept in one
