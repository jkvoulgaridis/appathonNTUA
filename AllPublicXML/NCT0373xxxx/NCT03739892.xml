  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to determine predictors of treatment response, i.e gain from rehabilitation
      training, in post stroke upper limb deficits. The investigators will like to answer the
      following question: &quot;What is this patient's potential for recovery, given his profile?&quot; The
      investigators propose to conduct a longitudinal physiopathological study on the stroke
      patients with motor deficits who entered the rehab center of Pitié Salpêtrière hospital. The
      investigators will benefit from the organization, which is already in place (clinical
      asssessments and training) to add MRI, TMS and EEG recordings, as well as genotype analysis
      before the training offered in the rehabilitation unit. The investigators will repeat these
      assessments after the training (immeadiately and 6 weeks after).

      The protocol is based on 10 visits. The three main one are V1, V9 and V10. V1, V9 and V10 are
      the assessments visits with clinical scores, MRI TMS and EEG recordings. These are made
      before the training (V1), immediately after the 6 weeks of training (V9) and 6 weeks after
      (V10) V5 is a visit where the investigators will clinically assess the patients at three
      weeks of the training.

      The other visits (V2, V3, V4, V6, V7, V8) consist in recording an EEG while patients are
      under training each week during six weeks.
