  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy and safety of the AbsorbaSeal 6Fr Vascular Closure
      device (VCD) for the closure of access site of patients requiring percutaneous diagnostic or
      interventional procedures. An expected total of 50 patients will be enrolled in this study. A
      total of 12 patients (4 patients per site) will be treated as roll-in phase, prior to
      enrollment of the first patient. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety
      and effectiveness of the AbsorbaSeal 6Fr VCD. Enrollment into this study will include
      anatomically eligible patients requiring diagnostic and interventional procedures. Following
      physician training, patients will be enrolled. Efficacy and safety analyses will be based on
      these patients.Patients will be followed procedurally to discharge, at one month, (follow-up
      commitment). Secondary objectives are to further characterize adverse events (serious and
      non-serious), clinical utility measures and health-related quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increased number of percutaneous interventions being performed in outpatient
      settings there is a growing need to obtain faster, safer, and more secure hemostasis
      following these outpatient procedures. CyndRx believes an improved VCD will lead to more
      widespread use and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The AbsorbaSeal Vascular Closure
      Device (ABS-6) has been developed to meet this need. The ease of use and automatic deployment
      of the device will eliminate the learning curve associated with the use of VCDs. The active
      closure system used in the ABS-6 ensures a secure closure with every deployment. The
      composition of the seal used is completely bio-absorbable and does not require the use of
      adjunct materials (i.e. collagen, sutures, staples, etc.) needed in many of the devices
      currently available.

      The First In Man (FIM) trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the ABS-6 system in
      humans (N=20). To further evaluate the safety and efficacy, up to 50 patients will be
      enrolled in the CP002CE-study.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      AbsorbaSeal 6Fr VCD. Enrollment into this study will include anatomically eligible patients
      requiring diagnostic and interventional procedures. Patients will be followed procedurally to
      discharge, at one month, (follow-up commitment). Secondary objectives are to further
      characterize adverse events (serious and non-serious), clinical utility measures, and
      health-related quality of life.
