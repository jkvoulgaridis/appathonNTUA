    <textblock>
      There are chronic hepatitis B patients with poor antiviral efficacy of entecavir in clinical
      practice. Tenofovir or interferon alfa is the optimal choice right now. The aim of this study
      is to investigate the therapeutic effect of using tenofovir of interferon alfa in these
      patients.

    <textblock>
      There are chronic hepatitis B patients with poor antiviral efficacy of entecavir in clinical
      practice. Poor efficacy is defined as hepatitis b virus DNA is still positive and decreases &gt;
      2 lg from baseline. Sequential therapy by using tenofovir or interferon alfa is the optimal
      choice right now. 100 patients with poor antiviral efficacy of entecavir will be recruited in
      this study. They are randomly divided into tenofovir group or interferon alfa group. The aim
      of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of using tenofovir of interferon alfa
      in these patients.
