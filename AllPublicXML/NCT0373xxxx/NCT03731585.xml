    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well online psychosocial intervention works in improving social
      well-being and support in women who are undergoing treatment for stage I-IV non-small cell
      lung cancer. Psychosocial intervention techniques, such as mindfulness, compassion, and
      emotional processing, may improve distress and help patients manage symptoms related to
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the feasibility (primary outcome) of the BREATHE intervention in women with lung
      cancer (LC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the initial intervention efficacy regarding psychological distress (secondary
      outcome) and cancer symptoms (tertiary outcome) relative to an education comparison (EC)
      group.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore potential mediation (e.g., mindfulness, compassion, inflammatory processes) and
      moderation (e.g., demographic and medical factors) of the intervention effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (PSYCHOLOGICAL): Patients participate in 5 psychological sessions and complete
      training on mindfulness, compassion, emotional processing, social support, generating
      positive emotions, and proactive coping strategies once a week for up to 5 weeks. Patients
      also complete questionnaires over 35 minutes and participate in video-based group sessions
      weekly for 5 weeks.

      GROUP II (EDUCATIONAL): Patients participate in 5 information sessions and receive education
      on lung cancer, symptom management, communication, and practicing self-care once a week for
      up to 5 weeks. Patients also complete questionnaires and participate in group sessions as in
      group I.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 1 week and at 3 months.

    <description>The study will examine preliminary evidence of intervention efficacy. Will calculate effect sizes for between-group comparisons based on the primary efficacy endpoint of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), a 20-item self-report measure focusing on the affective component of depression.
Answers range from: almost never (less than 1 day), sometimes (1 to 2 days), often (3 to 4 days), almost always (5 to 7 days).</description>

    <description>The study will examine preliminary evidence of intervention efficacy. Will calculate effect sizes for between-group comparisons based on the primary efficacy endpoint of Impact of Event Scale (IES) measured at T2 using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). IES scale answers range from NOT AT ALL, RARELY, SOMETIMES, OFTEN.</description>
