  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Finding the balance between toxicity and benefit should be the major goal when negotiating
      about the therapeutic regimen. This becomes nowadays even more important, since there are
      emerging options in the field of sarcoma therapy. Especially in the palliative treatment of
      sarcoma patients, knowing that na single drug can provide an overall survival benefit,
      physicians have to incorporate the patient's preferences and goals in life when consulting
      them.

      The study will allow patients with several types of soff tissue sarcoma to be included. After
      progression under current therapy, the patient will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion and
      allocated to either pazopanib or investigator's choice. Quality of life (QoL) and other
      secondary outcome measures will be recorded continuously. The aim of the study is to assess
      patient reported outcomes (PROs), which should be the primary aim when treating these
      patients.

      Primary objectives

      • Assess the overall quality of life (QoL) under treatment with pazopanib or
      physician-preferred chemotherapy after 9 weeks

      Secondary objectives

        -  Assess the overall QoL under treatment with pazopanib compared with the physician's
           preference of chemotherapy three times in Cycle 1 and Cycle 3

        -  intergroup evaluation of pain

             -  intergroup evaluation of fatigue and its different categories (physical, mental,
                cognitive, emotional)

             -  intergroup evaluation of anorexia/cachexia

             -  intergroup evaluation of satisfaction with care

             -  Evaluation of the association of QoL with criteria of response

             -  Evaluation of the QoL of all patients during follow up (FU) intergroup evaluation
                of treatment effects on survival

        -  Evaluation of the prediction of severe early toxicity in elderly patients receiving
           palliative therapy

        -  Safety and efficacy of the different treatment regimens

    <description>The 30 items of the QLQ-C30 questionaire distribute in diverse subscales (for example: cognitive function, pain and emotional function). The sum score of QLQ-C30 is generated by average of the normative values of all subscales. The higher the sum score the higher the Quality of live (Qol).</description>
