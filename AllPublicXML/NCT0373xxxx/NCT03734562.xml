      To compare the efficacy and safety of substrate-based radiofrequency catheter ablation vs.
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and scar-related
      sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia remains an important source of morbidity and
      mortality in patients surviving a myocardial infarction. ICD´s have been proven to reduce
      mortality in this patients population, nonetheless, recurrent arrhythmia and ICD shocks are
      known to negatively impact ventricular function and are associated with worsening heart
      failure and mortality. We devised a controlled, randomized, parallel, single blind, phase IV
      clinical trial with the aim of comparing the efficacy and safety of substrate-based
      radiofrequency catheter ablation vs. antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with ischemic
      cardiomyopathy and scar-related sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, implanted with
      an ICD.

    <measure>Quality of life measured with the The Short Form (36) Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured with the The Short Form (36) Health Survey at pre-specified study follow-up visits (3,6,12,24 months).
The short-form (36) health survey consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability</description>
