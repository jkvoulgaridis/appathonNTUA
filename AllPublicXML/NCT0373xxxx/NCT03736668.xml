  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with high cardiovascular risk. Recent meta-analyzes suggest
      that the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in the diabetic is increased by 20% for
      each hemoglobin A1c point and that the risk of death from all causes or cardiovascular cause
      and the risk of hospitalization is significantly increased by 30 to 40% in patients with
      acute or chronic heart failure with diabetes.

      Systematic analysis of cardiac function is not currently proposed in international
      recommendations even though some antidiabetic drugs have been associated with an increased
      risk of heart failure in large randomized controlled trials or an increase in adverse events
      in proof-of-concept studies of heart failure with or without diabetes. Observational studies
      suggest that hypoglycemic sulfonamides may increase the risk of developing heart failure. In
      contrast, two sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (empagliflozin and
      canagliflozin) have recently demonstrated a significant reduction in hospitalizations for
      heart failure in two large randomized controlled trials.

      The detection of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction is therefore essential to better
      assess the risk of cardiac decompensation and to identify the existence of possible
      contraindications to the use of certain classes of drugs used in diabetes. Recent studies
      suggest that the left ventricular ejection fraction measured on three-dimensional
      acquisitions is a prognostic value index greater than the ejection fraction measured by
      Simpson biplane method in two-dimensional ultrasound. Similarly, it seems that the analysis
      of global longitudinal deformation is a prognostic factor superior to the analysis of the
      ejection fraction (two-dimensional or three-dimensional). The investigators will analyze
      these different parameters to confirm these data.

      The main objective of this study is to analyze left ventricular function by echocardiography
      in a prospective cohort of 200 patients with type 2 diabetes and without known cardiac
      dysfunction and to search for possible differences in clinical profile depending on the
      presence and type of cardiac function's impairment.

      Patients will be classified into four categories according to the left ventricular function:

        -  Normal heart function

        -  Altered ejection fraction (&lt;40%)

        -  Ejection fraction preserved (&gt; 50%) with structural abnormality (left ventricular
           hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation) or diastolic dysfunction

        -  Moderately impaired ejection fraction &quot;mid range&quot; (40 to 49%)
