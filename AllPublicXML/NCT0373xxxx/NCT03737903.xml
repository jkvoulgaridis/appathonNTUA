  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to determine whether a wrist-worn accelerometer device is able to
      objectively measure physical activity, and whether it is an acceptable process for high-risk
      elderly patients prior to planned surgery. Accelerometers measure physical activity in
      'counts' of activity, enabling them to record the total amount of activity in a given time
      period (e.g. number of steps per day), and also the time spent in various levels of intensity
      of activity. The investigators will ask study participants to wear an accelerometer around
      their wrist (like a wristwatch) for up to 14 days prior to their surgery. Participants will
      receive the same care as non-participants. Part of this routine medical care includes a
      preoperative review by a multidisciplinary team including specific personalised advice to
      optimise physical activity before surgery. The investigators will measure the impact that
      this existing intervention has on physical activity levels. Being more physically active is
      good for our health, and may be associated with a better recovery from surgery. In the future
      there may be methods of improving physical activity in the period of time before patients'
      surgery, which may improve their recovery from surgery.

      In order to study this further, the investigators first need a robust and objective way of
      measuring physical activity. In current practice patients are asked to estimate how
      physically active they are on a day-to-day basis. This relies on how well they remember, and
      how good they are at getting it right and may not be accurate. The wrist-worn accelerometer
      is an objective method of measuring physical activity in patients, which not only offers
      greater understanding of the physical activity levels of elderly patients before a variety of
      operations, but also offers the opportunity to measure the impact of existing and potential
      future interventions to modify physical activity in the preoperative period.

        The investigators are aiming to recruit approximately 50 high-risk patients aged 65 years
        and above, prior to major or complex elective surgery.

        &quot;High-risk&quot; is determined by Rockwood Clinical Frailty Score ≥4. Major or complex surgery
        is defined in NICE guideline (NG45).
