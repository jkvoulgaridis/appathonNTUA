  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study of carisbamate in adult and pediatric subjects with
      LGS, with single- and multiple-dose PK assessments from Days 1 through 73. There will be a
      Screening Period of up to 28 days and a Treatment Period of 87 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 24 subjects are planned: 6 subjects in each of 4 cohorts: Cohort I (≥18 years),
      Cohort II (12 to &lt;18 years), Cohort III (6 to &lt;12 years), and Cohort IV (2 to &lt;6 years).

      For Cohorts I and II, PK assessments of carisbamate, S-enantiomer and its R-enantiomer plasma
      concentrations, will be conducted on Days 1, 2 and 3 of the single dose period at pre-dose
      and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after dosing and on Day 17 of the
      multiple-dose period at pre dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after dosing;
      trough samples will be collected on Days 45 and 73 of the dose-adjustment period.

      For Cohort III, PK assessments of carisbamate, S-enantiomer and its R-enantiomer plasma
      concentrations will be conducted on Days 1, 2 and 3 of the single dose period at pre dose and
      0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after dosing and on Day 17 of the multiple-dose
      period at pre-dose and 2 hours after dosing; trough samples will be collected on Days 45 and
      73 of the dose-adjustment period.

      For Cohort IV, a sparse PK sampling approach will be used, and the time of PK sampling time
      will be based on the PK results from the other cohorts. A maximum of 2 to 4 time points on
      each day (1 and 17) will be collected.

      Safety assessments include adverse event (AE) and concomitant medication reporting, clinical
      laboratory testing, vital sign measurements, 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical
      examinations, and neurologic examinations.
