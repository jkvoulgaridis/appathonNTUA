  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that treatment outcome could be positively associated with treatment intensity.
      However, tolerance of chemotherapy decreases in the elder, some patients could not tolerate
      standard (SD) therapy and even died of side effect, and overall survival (OS) might not be
      prolonged. Whether all elder acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients could benefit from SD
      therapy, or some should receive reduced-intensity therapy or even only supporting care
      remains controvertal. In this multi-center study, we are going to evaluate the benefit of SD
      and non-SD (NSD) therapy in elder AML patients.

      remains controvertal. SD therapy is definited as the treatment regimen must follow NCCN
      guildline and chemotherapy intensity could not be reduced. Non-SD (NSD) therapy is definited
      as patients receiving reduced-intensity therapy or only supporting care. In this multi-center
      study, we are going to evaluate the benefit of SD and NSD therapy in elder AML patients.
