      This research study is developed on an experimental design with randomized controlled
      intervention were participated 135 subjects with AD including 45 of the control group. It
      lasted 6 months with pre-post tests (T0-T1) executed before and after six months of
      treatment. By having in focus the evaluation of GPR therapy effects on cognitive,
      proprioceptive, depressive, autonomy, gait and life quality of the above mentioned subjects.

      In order to assess the cognitive abilities of the patients a cognitive test was administered
      which acts through a scale concerning depression and mood evaluation as well as a
      questionnaire was developed aiming to evaluate the examined subjects' functional abilities:
      Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Quality of Life in Alzheimer Disease (QoL-AD),
      geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Barthel Index (BI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI),
      Tinetti Scale (TS).

    <description>The therapeutist provides the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale records. The evaluation consits in a 0-30 points-scale. Lower scores imply the severity of dementia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline cognitive evaluation at 6'th month</time_frame>
    <description>The therapeutist measures in the begining and in the end of the study the quality of life in patients with Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD). This questionnaire consists in 13 elements referring to the perception that patients have concerning various aspects of their life: mood, health, cognition, environment and functional capacity. The range of scores is 13-52, were higher scores indicate a better life quality.</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline cognitive evaluation at 6'th month</time_frame>
    <description>The version of 15 articles was used, which given its length can be validly and reliably resolved by patients themselves in the quality of a self-report questionnaire aiming to investigate the possible presence of depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline cognitive evaluation at 6'th month</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is used by therapist to measure the performance in the basic activities of daily life of AD patients. The maximum score used is 100 points and refers to the patient's independence in all basic daily living activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline cognitive evaluation at 6'th month</time_frame>
    <description>This test includes 12 symptoms scored according to the phenomenon severity and frequency. It is a helpful instrument for the therapist because of specifically designed for the assessment of psycho-behavioral disorders in individuals with cognitive impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinetti Scale (TS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline cognitive evaluation at 6'th month</time_frame>
    <description>The therapist used the equilibrium sub-scale, which consists in 7 elements and has a score between 0 and 13. Highest scores indicate a better balance.</description>
