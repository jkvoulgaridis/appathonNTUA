  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many behavioral weight loss interventions have been developed, but still have significant
      limitations in terms of achieving clinically significant, sustained weight loss. A recent
      study incorporating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in a randomized clinical trial
      resulted in participants who attained significantly greater 12-month weight loss in the ACT
      arm than those assigned to standard behavioral treatment, suggesting that ACT may have the
      potential to improve behavioral weight loss outcomes. The investigators have developed a
      novel telephone-delivered version of the ACT behavioral weight loss intervention, based on
      proven success using ACT telephone counseling intervention for smoking cessation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is consistent evidence from observational studies that higher amounts of body fat are
      associated with increased risks of cancer. Many behavioral weight loss interventions have
      been developed, but still have significant limitations in terms of achieving clinically
      significant, sustained weight loss. A recent study incorporating Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy (ACT) in a randomized clinical trial resulted in participants who attained
      significantly greater 12-month weight loss in the ACT arm than those assigned to standard
      behavioral treatment, suggesting that ACT may have the potential to improve behavioral weight
      loss outcomes. However, this study required in-person clinic visits with treatment groups,
      which limits its potential reach and disseminability. The investigators have developed a
      novel telephone-delivered version of the ACT behavioral weight loss intervention, based on
      our proven success using ACT telephone counseling intervention for smoking cessation. There
      will be a two-arm pilot randomized trial (N = 100), comparing the ACT telephone intervention
      to a standard behavioral treatment (SBT) telephone control. The pilot RCT will yield
      engagement, receptivity, and preliminary weight loss results that will provide critical and
      timely weight loss intervention data.
