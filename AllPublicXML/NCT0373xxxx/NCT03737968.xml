    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized, open label study of durvalumab with/ without tremelimumab as
      neoadjuvant therapy and durvalumab maintenance after SoC RTx with/without cisplatin as
      post-surgical adjuvant therapy in treatment naïve participants with newly diagnosed
      resectable LA HNSCC. The study will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices
      (GCP). Approximately 44 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to below two Arms

    <description>Patients in the durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy treatment group will receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) (1500mg Q4W) once prior to surgery in this study. After surgical resection, these patients will receive the post op adjuvant treatment including RTx with/without cisplatin based on the pathologic findings and physician's discretion. After completion of adjuvant treatment, durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500mg Q4W as maintenance treatment for up to a maximum of 12 months until confirmed disease progression unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. The first durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy dose at 1500mg Q4W will be within 8 weeks after the completion of adjuvant therapy. If a patient's weight falls to 30kg or below the patient should receive weight-based dosing equivalent to 20 mg/kg of durvalumab Q4W until the weight improves to &gt;30 kg, at which point the patient should start receiving the fixed dosing of durvalumab 1500mg.</description>
