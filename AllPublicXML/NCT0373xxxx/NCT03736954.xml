  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients who survive critical illness suffer from symptoms of anxiety, depression, or
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after leaving the intensive care unit (ICU). Memories
      of frightening and delusional experiences in the ICU appear to be the strongest potentially
      modifiable risk factor. Research on the formation of fear and associated memories shows that
      if mitigating information about a traumatic event is introduced during the time between
      memory formation and its recall, the emotional experience of the memory can be modified in a
      positive manner. This means that in order to prevent mental health problems in critical
      illness survivors, psychological support needs to take place in parallel with medical
      treatment in the ICU. The Researchers hypothesize that early psychological support for the
      critically ill can decrease mental health morbidity in critical illness survivors. However,
      providing consistent psychological support intervention is a challenge for busy ICU
      clinicians. It is not feasible to hire behavioral medicine trained psychologists to become
      permanent ICU staff nationwide. Doulas, trained lay health care providers who provide
      emotional support to women in labor, have been identified as reliable yet affordable
      alternative. Given common elements of their services and our intervention, doulas are in an
      ideal position to administer early psychological support. The objective of this project is to
      refine and test a behavioral intervention to be administered in parallel with medical
      treatment in the ICU. This will be accomplished by training doulas in providing standardized
      psychological support intervention and refining the intervention based on stakeholder
      feedback

    <description>We will use an &quot;interpretive description approach&quot; to qualitative research, which creates an interpretive account of a clinical phenomenon for the purpose of informing clinical practice. We aim to understand the changes in experiences of critically ill patients, their family members, and providers through the interviews. This allows us to explore patient and key stakeholders' perspectives and to refine PSBPS based on the areas of highest priority, focusing on elements that are deemed by patients to be of highest acceptability. Following patient ICU discharge, interviews will be conducted on a one-on-one basis by the candidate or a trained qualitative interviewer who is not directly involved in the patient's clinical care; participants will be assured that interview transcripts will be confidential. Interviews will last approximately 15 minutes and will be conducted in person.</description>
