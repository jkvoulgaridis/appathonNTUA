      The purpose of this study is to collect information about how the PHIL® Embolic System works
      in the treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Data collected in this study
      will be used to evaluate the safety and probable benefits in treating DAVFs.

      The PHIL® Embolic System is a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). The U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved the use of the PHIL Embolic System as a HUD in June 2016.

      Study design:The study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, clinical study evaluating
      outcomes in pediatric subjects with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas treated with
      PHIL® device.

      Study purpose: To evaluate the safety and probable benefit of MicroVention, Inc. PHIL® Liquid
      Embolic material in the treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas, alone or as
      an adjunctive treatment for dAVFs.

On completion of the PSOM examination, the neurologist scores a Summary of Impressions containing 5 subscales: right sensorimotor, left sensorimotor (each with subcategories), language production, language comprehension, and cognitive/behavioral. Subscale scoring is 0 (no deficit), 0.5 (mild deficit, normal function), 1 (moderate deficit, decreased function), or 2 (severe deficit, missing function). The PSOM total score is the sum of the 5 subscale scores and ranges from 0 (no deficit) to 10 (maximum deficit).</description>
