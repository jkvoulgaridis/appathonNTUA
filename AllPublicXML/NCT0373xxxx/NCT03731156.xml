  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intra-alveolar form of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PjP) is a common pathology in
      immunocompromised patients, particularly those infected with HIV. The diagnosis is based on
      the detection of Pj in a LBA. Intra-tissue granulomatous form (PGP) is a rare entity observed
      in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. In this case, the LBA is mostly non-contributory and
      the diagnosis is based solely on the detection of cysts on histological examination on biopsy
      of a pulmonary nodule. For many years, it has been clearly demonstrated that the use of a
      specific PCR clearly improves the biological diagnosis of PcP. However, in case of
      granulomatous form this method is not implemented because the diagnostic hypothesis is not
      mentioned.

      In 2018, two cases of PGP were diagnosed at 3-month intervals at Montpellier University
      Hospital Center. The diagnostic confirmation was obtained with PCR Pj. In this context the
      investigators will investigate the interest of implementing PCR Pj on biopsies on pulmonary
      nodules from hospitalized patients between 2015 and 2018. In all selected patients,
      histopathological aspect of the nodule was compatible with a PGP and, no other diagnosis has
      been confirmed (infectious, tumoral, inflammatory ...). Finally, 17 patients were selected to
      check retrospectively, if the presence of Pj could be at the origin of the pathology.
