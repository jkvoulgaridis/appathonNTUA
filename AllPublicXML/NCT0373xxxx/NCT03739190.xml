    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed to evaluate the performance rate of a new natural rubber latex
      (NRL) male condom.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical investigation, a new NRL male condom (test condom) will be evaluated against
      two marketed NRL male condoms of varying thickness (condom A and condom B). This clinical
      investigation will also evaluate the in-use tolerance of the test and the two reference
      condoms.

    <description>Number of clinical failure events, defined in ISO 29943-1:2017, will be reported by participants.
Clinical failure rate is calculated as the number of condoms with at least 1 acute failure event (clinical slippage or clinical breakage) divided by the number of condoms used during intercourse, reported as a percentage. A condom that experiences multiple clinical failure events only counts as a single clinical failure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A male and a female subject aged: 18 - 60 years inclusive.

          2. All subjects must be generally healthy and in a mutually monogamous heterosexual
             relationship - current relationship â‰¥ 3 months.

          3. All couples must be sexually active, and agree to have penile-vaginal intercourse with
             a frequency sufficient to meet protocol requirements (a minimum of 5 coital acts over
             4 weeks).

          4. The female partner should use one other established highly effective form of
             non-barrier contraception, unless post-menopausal.

          5. Couples must agree not to use drugs or non-investigational devices that can affect
             sexual performance e.g. medication/medical devices used to treat erectile dysfunction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Either partner is or becomes aware of an allergy or sensitivity to the ingredients of
             the test products, including the test or control condoms or any lubrication products
             provided.

          2. Either partner has a pre-existing skin condition (severe eczema/psoriasis) or systemic
             allergic reactions or as confirmed by the subject and physical examination.

          3. Either partner that needs to use condoms for a specific sexually transmitted infection
             (STI) protection e.g. discordance for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or herpes.

          4. Subjects that have previous or planned genital surgery, that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would consider the subject unsuitable to participate in the clinical
             investigation e.g. laser for abnormal smear.

          5. Male partners that have known erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction.

          6. Either partner that requires to use/is using medication or preparations that are
             applied topically to the genitalia area or intravaginally other than that supplied for
             the investigation.

          7. A female partner that has been diagnosed with or treated for vaginal complaints
             (including vaginal dryness) in the previous 3 months which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, deems the partner unsuitable for the investigation.

          8. Any participant who has clinical symptoms or signs of a sexually transmitted diseases
             (STD) or HIV/AIDS or has a previous history of high risk behaviour as judged by the
             investigator.

          9. Female partner using medication which in the investigators opinion would affect
             vaginal mucosal secretion, such as Chlorpheniramine at any time in the 14 days (or 5
             half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer) before first condom use.

         10. A male partner with abnormal penile anatomy that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, affect the ability to keep the condom in place during intercourse.

         11. Either partner intends to continue to use antihistamines, anti-inflammatory drugs or
             pain killers for the duration of the investigation.
