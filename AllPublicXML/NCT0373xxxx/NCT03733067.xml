  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      CTLA4 stands for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4. It is a protein the body makes naturally
      to check its immune system from attacking itself. Some people don t produce enough CTLA4
      protein, causing problems due to overactive immune system such as big spleens, repeated lung
      infections, breathing problems, stomach and intestine symptoms as well as inflamed brain and
      nerve problems. Many have problems with their bone marrow causing low numbers of blood cells
      like platelets, red blood cells or white blood cells, which is called cytopenia. Researchers
      want to see if the drug abatacept can treat cytopenias by replacing the missing protein
      CTLA4.

      Objective:

      To see if abatacept is safe and helps treat cytopenias caused by CTLA4 deficiency.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 8-65 years who have CTLA4 deficiency with cytopenia

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, medication review, physical exam and
      blood and urine tests. They will continue their current medications and may start taking
      antibiotics daily. Participants will receive either abatacept or placebo through a vein for 6
      months. The study team will not know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo

      Women who can become pregnant must agree to use birth control measures.

      Men who get someone pregnant during the study will be asked to collect information and have
      the partner contact the study team.

      Participants will undergo the following procedures before starting the study and at the
      completion:

        -  radiology scans of body and brain

        -  heart and lung function tests

        -  Bone marrow examination by a needle inserted into the hip bone to remove a small amount
           of tissue to study.

        -  Participants may have a small camera on a long, thin tool passed down the throat into
           the stomach and small intestine for evaluation of their gut.

        -  Questionnaires about their disease, symptoms and quality of life

      Over 6 months, participants will have regular study visits and get 8 doses of the study drug
      or a placebo by intravenous injection. They will repeat some of the same tests done earlier
      at the end of the study at assess response.

      About 1 month after the last study drug visit, participants will have a final study visit.

      Some participants may join a treatment extension for the study drug abatacept with no
      placebo. They will sign a separate consent form for this.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rare heterozygous mutations in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) lead to a monogenetic
      defect that presents with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype of recurrent infections,
      lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, and lymphocytic infiltration of target organs. Management
      is challenging and focuses on treating infections, autoimmune complications, and end organ
      damage due to lymphocytic infiltrates. Experience with the natural history of the disease and
      therapies for underlying complications are limited. There is no established standard of care
      for these patients.

      Abatacept is a biologically engineered CTLA4-mimetic that is approved as an intravenous (IV)
      infusion to treat adult rheumatoid arthritis, adult psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis. Given that abatacept mimics CTLA4 function, we hypothesize that the
      drug will prevent T-cell hyper-activation, restore regulatory T-cell function, and thereby
      treat the autoimmune and immune dysregulatory manifestations of CTLA4 deficiency.

      This study is a phase 1/2, double-blind, randomized, intra-patient dose-escalation,
      placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abatacept in
      participants with CTLA4 deficiency and cytopenia. Participants will come to the NIH Clinical
      Center

      monthly for 210 days to receive infusions of study agent or placebo and to undergo safety and
      research evaluations, including blood draw for cytopenia evaluation and scoring of disease
      severity. Before and after the treatment period, participants will also have imaging,
      pulmonary function testing, bone marrow biopsy, and endoscopy (symptomatic participants
      only). Primary endpoints will be evaluated at Day 210. After completing the blinded treatment
      trial, participants will be offered the option to enroll in a 6-month open-label extension
      study for long-term safety evaluation of abatacept.
