  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, single-site, open-label prospective study in adult with a chronic wound
      diagnosis. Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to either the control treatment arm,
      antimicrobial control treatment arm, or Next Science treatment arm and will receive this
      treatment until the wound is completely healed or they are exited from the study. Subjects
      will have a weekly in-office debridement visit for up to 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, single-site, open-label prospective study in adult subjects ages 18 years
      of age and older with a chronic wound diagnosis. There will be 15 completed subjects with up
      to 18 enrolled. Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to control group (Mepilex Foam
      dressing); antimicrobial control group (Mepilex Ag Foam dressing); or Next Science group
      (TorrentX irrigation, BlastX application, and Mepilex foam dressing). Subjects will receive
      this treatment until the wound is completely healed or they are exited from the study.
      Subjects will have a weekly in-office debridement visit for up to 12 weeks. For the Next
      Science arm, TorrentX will be used during in-office debridement whereas BlastX will be
      applied once during the in-office visit and then mid-week with dressing change. DNA and plate
      count analysis will be taken at maximum of 5 time points: baseline/randomization visit,
      maximum of 3 treatment visits (Visits 3, 5, and 9), and Visit 13/Study exit (if applicable),
      with cultures taken pre- and post- debridement. Wound measurements will be taken via imaging
      from Silhouette camera system at every in-clinic visit.

          4. Subjects with a history of bleeding dyscrasia or with medical conditions that would
