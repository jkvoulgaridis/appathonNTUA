        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be ≥18 years of age.

          2. Native AV fistula has been created ≥60 days prior to the index procedure.

          3. AV fistula, located in the arm, has undergone one or more successful hemodialysis
             sessions.

          4. Target de novo or non-stented restenotic lesion consisting of a ≥50% stenosis by
             operator visual estimate.

          5. Fistula vessel diameter ≥5 mm and ≤7 mm by operator visual estimate.

          6. Target lesion or tandem lesion ≤120 mm in total length by operator visual estimate.

          7. Successful pre-dilatation of the target lesion. Defined as crossing of the guide wire
             AND pre-dilatation with a PTA balloon resulting in: residual stenosis of ≤30% and
             dissection ≤ Grade B

          8. Subject has provided written informed consent and is willing to comply with study
             follow-up requirements.

          9. Subject has a life expectancy of ≥1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a synthetic AV graft.

          2. Determined by operator to have a lesion that prevents complete inflation of an
             angioplasty balloon.

          3. Presence of pseudoaneurysm or aneurysm requiring treatment at the lesion site.

          4. Target lesion is located &lt;30 mm from any stent.

          5. Thrombosis of the access site 30 days prior to procedure.

          6. Surgical revision of the access site planned within 30 days of procedure.

          7. Blood coagulative disorder, sepsis, or current AV access infection (white blood count
             ≥12,000).

          8. Known contraindication (including allergic reaction) or sensitivity to antiplatelet
             therapy, anticoagulation therapy or paclitaxel (mild to severe cases), that cannot be
             adequately managed with pre-and post-procedure medication.

          9. Subjects who are taking immunosuppressive therapy or are routinely taking ≥10mg of
             prednisone per day.

         10. Scheduled for kidney transplant or peritoneal dialysis within the next 6 months post
             procedure.

         11. Myocardial infarction 30 days prior to procedure.

         12. Stroke or TIA 90 days prior to procedure.

         13. Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or men who intend
             to father children during the time of the study.

         14. Subject is participating in any other investigational study that has not completed
             primary endpoint(s) evaluation or that clinically interferes with the endpoint from
             this study.
