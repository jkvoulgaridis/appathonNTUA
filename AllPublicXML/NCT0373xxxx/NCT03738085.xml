      Previous surgery and obesity has disputed as an unfavorable factor during Total Laparoscopic
      Hysterectomy. The aim of the investigator's study was to assess the effects of previous
      abdominal surgery and obesity on intra-operative and post-operative outcomes of TLH.

      Abstract:

      Objective: To assess the effects of previous abdominal surgery and obesity on the
      intra-operative and post-operative outcomes of total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH).

      Method: In this retrospective cohort study, women who underwent TLH for benign conditions
      between January 2011 and December 2016 in tertiary academic center were included. Patients
      were grouped according to previous abdominal surgery. The study group consisted of patients
      who had at least one previous abdominal surgery and the control group consisted of patients
      with no previous abdominal surgery. In a further analysis, a subgroup of obese patients with
      BMI (body mass index) ≥30 kg/m2 was evaluated. For this analysis, the obese patients who
      underwent TLH were picked up and the results were compared to the results of obese patients
      who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) during the same time period. The main
      outcome parameters were duration of hospital stay and major complication rate.
