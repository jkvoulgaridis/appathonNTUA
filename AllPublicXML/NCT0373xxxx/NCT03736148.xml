  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of manual and instrument-assisted cervical manipulation on
      electromyographic activity and sympathetic nervous system. Subjects were divided in four
      groups, one group was submitted to a manual cervical manipulation, other group was submitted
      to an instrument-assisted cervical manipulation, other group was submitted to a sham
      manipulation and another group served as control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The manual manipulation was applied over C3/C4, as the participants were positioned in supine
      with the cervical spine in a neutral position. Slight ipsilateral side flexion and
      contralateral rotation were introduced until tension was perceived in the tissues at the
      contact point. A high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust manipulation was directed upward and
      medially in the direction of the subject's contralateral eye.

      The instrument-assisted manipulation was applied using a handheld Activator IV Adjusting
      Instrument. Contacts were made firm enough to prevent slipping of the rubber tip but not so
      firm as to load the spring, in consistence with customary clinical use of the instrument. The
      spring was then loaded by means of the instrument's trigger mechanism, and the impulse was
      delivered in an anterosuperior direction, over the posterolateral aspect of the vertebra on
      the right lamina-pedicle junction of C3.

      The sham manipulation to the right C3/C4 segment was administered using the same 'set-up' as
      for the manual manipulation; however, once the barrier was engaged, the head was
      re-positioned to neutral with no thrust applied. The control group individuals were
      positioned supine for the same twenty minutes as the other groups and they received no manual
      contact.
