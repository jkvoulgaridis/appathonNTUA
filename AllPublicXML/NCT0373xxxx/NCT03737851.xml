    <description>12-week confirmed disability improvement is defined as a patient who showed an improvement in the EDSS+ and maintained the improvement for at least 12 weeks during the treatment period 52-weeks. The EDSS+ is used to assess severity of symptoms of MS and includes the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW), 9-Hole Peg test in either hand (9HPT), and EDSS.</description>
