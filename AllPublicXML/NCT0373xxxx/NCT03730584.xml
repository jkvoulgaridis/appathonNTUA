  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether topical application of Ropivacaine is
      effective for treating refractory pain during dressing changes and so improve quality of life
      of patients (newborn, child, adolescent or adults under 21) suffering from hereditary
      epidermal epidermolysis bullosa.

      This clinical trial aims to determine the efficacy on pain of local application of
      ROPIVACAINE 0.2% on cutaneous lesions related to Epidermolysis Bullosa during dressing
      change, associated with the standard premedication.

      Patients will be hospitalized and will have several baths. The first bath will be done
      according to usual protocol (usual premedication 1h before the bath). Pain measurements
      (Visual analog scale or FLACC) will be done at the entry into the water, in the middle of
      bath and at the time of the dressing change.

      The following baths will be done using local application of Ropivacaine 15 minutes before
      entering into the water on lesions identified by the patients as the most painful lesions due
      to Epidermolysis Bullosa.

      A blood test will be done during the first use of Ropivacaine to determine plasmatic level of
      Ropivacaine.

      After 3 baths in the dermatology unit, patients will continue such bath at home, every 48h
      during 15 days.
