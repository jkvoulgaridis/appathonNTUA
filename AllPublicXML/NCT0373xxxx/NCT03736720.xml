  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well liposomal irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil work
      in treating patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancer of gastrointestinal, unknown, or
      pancreatic origin that does not respond to treatment and has spread to other places in the
      body. Lliposomal irinotecan may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and
      leucovorin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving liposomal
      irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil may work better in treating patients with
      neuroendocrine cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate liposomal irinotecan (nanoliposomal irinotecan
      [Nal-IRI]) + fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin in patients with refractory advanced high
      grade neuroendocrine cancer of gastrointestinal (GI), unknown or pancreatic origin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure,
      safety, clinical response and, quality of life (QOL) changes resulting from the combination
      treatment of nanoliposomal irinotecan (Nal-IRI) + fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Genetic profiling for mutations will be conducted on all pre-study tumor samples and
      compared to changes in immune response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, leucovorin IV over
      30 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      for in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then every 2
      months thereafter.
