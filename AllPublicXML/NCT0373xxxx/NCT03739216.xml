    <description>Effectiveness will be assessed by the change from baseline in nasal symptoms using the TNSS (Total Nasal Symptom Score). The TNSS is a patient-reported assessment of 4 symptom scores for rhinorrhea (runny nose), nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing. Each symptom is rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The symptom scores are summed to give a total TNSS score that can range from 0 to 12.</description>
