  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify neural signatures, behavioral and phenomenological
      expressions of self-related processes including: sense of agency, semantic distinction
      between self and other, selflessness (altruism), social agency, embodied self
      (interoception), perceptual functioning of dissolved self including hallucinations and
      crossmodal processing, and finally the mystical type dissolution of the self.

      Four placebo-controlled, double blind sets of procedures using psilocybin with four
      independent study groups will be conducted. The number of subjects, testing procedures and
      dose of psilocybin for each group are as follows: group 1 (20 subjects, EEG, questionnaires,
      0.200 mg/Kg body weight), group 2 (30 subjects, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
      questionnaires, 0.200 mg/Kg body weight), group 3 (10 subjects, fMRI, questionnaires, 0.215
      mg/Kg body weight), study group 4 (80 subjects, blood serum and saliva parameters,
      questionnaires, fMRI (only in 20 subjects from this group), 0.315 mg/Kg body weight). The
      groups 1, 2 and 3 involve healthy volunteers. The group 4 involves healthy volunteer
      long-term and short-term meditators during a 5-day group meditation retreat. Together, 140
      subjects will participate in the study.

    <description>Total score of the 5D-ASC (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale). Consists of 94 items which are rated on a visual analogue scale (100 millimeters in length). The scale ranges from 0 (no alterations) to 100 (maximum alterations). The items are scored by measuring the millimeters from the low end of the scale to the participant's mark (from 0 to 100).</description>

    <measure>Mood changes will be assessed with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report questionnaire that consists of 10 positive and 10 negative valence word items. Each item is rated on a 5-point likert scale with a range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The final score of the PANAS Scale is the sum of the 10 terms on the positive scale in which a higher score indicates increased positive affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50 and the sum of the 10 terms on the negative scale in which a higher score indicates more negative affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50.</description>
