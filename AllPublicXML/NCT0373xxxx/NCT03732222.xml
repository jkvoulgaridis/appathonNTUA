    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of two different techniques, stretching of the diaphragm
      and cervical level impulse technique C3-C4, in the possible spirometric changes, vital
      capacity (CV), maximum expiratory flow (PEF) and maximum expiratory volume (FEV). in relation
      to the secondary variables (age, physical activity, BMI, sex). the subjects of the study were
      informed and clarified doubts about it and its subsequent reading and signing of informed
      consent. The subjects were randomly selected to determine which intervention group they would
      belong to (G1: intervention group of the diaphragm muscle stretch technique, G2: intervention
      group of the cervical rotation rotation impulse technique C3- C4, G3: Combined technique G1
      and G2, G4: control group.The evaluation technique is spirometry.The intervention protocol is
      as follows, first the pre-intervention spirometry is performed, then the corresponding
      technique (according to intervention group), then the post-intervention spirometry, the
      intervention technique and at 5 minutes, the intervention technique is performed.

      The objectives of the study are the following: 1. To evaluate the changes in the values of
      the simple spirometry after the application of the study techniques: muscle stretching
      technique of the diaphragm (G1), rotation impulse technique of the cervical level of C3- C4
      (G2) and combined technique of both (G3); 2. Determine the influence of these on measurable
      respiratory parameters by simple spirometry; 3. Compare the spirometric values obtained after
      applying the study techniques (G1, G2, G3) and the control group (G4: simulation of a
      previous technique); and 4. Analyze the different variables measured (age, gender, weight,
      height, sports practice and body mass index) in the effects of the applied treatment.

    <masking_description>the masking of the evaluator has been obtained, measuring the association between the response variables at baseline and the intervention group, by means of the variance analysis (ANOVA), for each response variable separately. We have verified that there are no differences between the means of the responses at the baseline level in each assigned intervention group, so that masking at the level of the evaluator has been carried out correctly</masking_description>
