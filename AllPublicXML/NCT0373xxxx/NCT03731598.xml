  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overnutrition and physical inactivity promote the accumulation of sphingolipids such as
      ceramides which block insulin signaling and anabolic metabolism. Implementation of
      pharmacological or genetic interventions to reduce sphingolipid levels in rodents prevents or
      reverses an impressive array of metabolic pathologies (e.g. insulin resistance, diabetes,
      steatohepatitis, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and atherosclerosis). To elucidate the
      tissue-specific mechanisms through which ceramides contribute to these diseases, mice have
      been produced to allow for the conditional, cell-type restricted ablation of enzymes required
      for ceramide biosynthesis or degradation (i.e. serine palmitoyltransferase and
      dihydroceramide desaturases-1) or degradation (i.e. acid ceramidase). Aims of the project
      include the following: To use these novel mouse models to evaluate the effect of
      muscle-specific ceramide depletion or induction on insulin sensitivity, muscle growth, and
      genomic/proteomic signatures under conditions of overnutrition and inactivity. To apply a
      ceramide flux assay in isolated human myotubes to identify the regulatory mechanisms that
      influence rates of ceramide biosynthesis; and, To determine the efficacy of a new class of
      inhibitors of dihydroceramide desaturases-1, our preferred target in the ceramide synthesis
      pathway, as therapeutics that improve muscle insulin sensitivity and prevent muscle loss in
      rodents. Findings obtained from these studies could uncover new nutrient-sensing machinery
      that modulates insulin sensitivity and muscle growth. Moreover, the translational component
      could lead to new pharmacological approaches for improving muscle health.

      Healthy, insulin sensitive, physically active male and female adults will be studied (N=15;
      65-80 years as determined by sample size calculation below) recruited from the Salt Lake City
      area. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Protection of Human Subjects.
      Outpatient blood screening, including an oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test, and bed rest
      experiments will take place in the University Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences
      (CCTS), a clinical service supported by an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award. The
      CCTS medical supervising physician oversees procedures. Participants will arrive at the CCTS
      fasted on Day 1 and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study will be performed as done
      previously with this unit. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies will be obtained before and three
      hours after the clamp. Periodic blood samples will be obtained as part of the clamp procedure
      for measurement of insulin and glucose. Muscle samples will be either cultured or
      flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for later analysis. After completion of the first
      insulin clamp experiment (Day 1), subjects will adhere to 5-days of strict bed rest as this
      is a clinically-relevant time frame for older adults hospitalized for acute medical illness,
      as well as being sufficient to induced insulin resistance. Established safety and comfort
      guidelines will be followed as done previously. On Day 5, after an overnight fast, a second
      insulin clamp study will be conducted and muscle biopsies will be again obtained.
