  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the utility of two interventional videos, submitted to
      patients discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or deep vein
      thrombosis.

      The primary hypothesis is that patients enrolled in the study group will show a higher degree
      of comprehension of their medical condition and its related complications, as compared to the
      control group. Secondly, we will also analyze any possible effect of the videos on the
      knowledge of the therapy prescribed and patient's overall satisfaction of communication in
      the ED.

      Eventually, we will examine the association of some factors with the outcomes (age, sex,
      level of education, atrial fibrillation vs. deep vein thrombosis group).

    <intervention_model_description>We designed a multicentric, pragmatic, parallel groups trial, with 1:1 randomization, that will involve patients discharged from EDs with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
The study aims to demonstrate the superiority of the intervention in terms of efficacy of doctor-patient communication at the ED, assessed with a telephone interview that will be conducted within 48 hours from patient's discharge.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>All subjects enrolled in the study group will be showed during the discharge process the video related to patient's condition (DVT vs AF), using it as a graphic support to doctor's verbal explanation of the diagnosed pathology and its possible complications.
For the purposes of the study we have selected two 3D videoclips, available on various internet sites and not covered by any copyright restrictions; these have been modified and shortened to make them suitable to use in our study setting.
The images contained show the pathophysiological process underlying the two diseases under study, namely deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation.
The SIs will show the videos to patients on the institutional computer or, alternatively, on their personal smartphone / tablet. The videos were purposely left without audio content.</description>

    <description>Patients of the control group will receive discharge explanations without the aid of any video.
The communication strategy in these cases won't be standardized, in order to leave the treating doctors free to express themselves in the way they are used to in their clinical practice, which is based solely on doctor's verbal and non-verbal communication skills.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age &gt;18

          -  being diagnosed with one of the two medical condition under study

          -  being discharged home directly from the emergency department

          -  capacity of the patient to understand the explanations and instructions provided by
             the doctor (this includes excellent command of the Italian language)

          -  having provided a valid phone number

          -  having signed the informed consent

        In case of eligible patients who are already assisted by a caregiver, and in all cases of
        patients who will be judged by the recruiting doctor as incapable to safely receive the
        discharge instructions, the caregiver will be enrolled to the study with identical
        modalities.

        In the context of a pragmatic trial, we didn't set exclusion criteria in terms of education
        level and comorbidities of the enrolled patients.
