  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed to investigate the feasibility of employing communication and sensor
      technologies for the patient after a knee operation.

      In the study, it is hypothesized that the effectiveness of postoperative rehabilitation
      programs might be improved by establishing electronic communication between healthcare
      professionals and the patients. It is also believed that users satisfaction and patients
      quality of life will be improved.

      The telerehabilitation program promises a synchronized communication as well as an
      individualized training program (by health professionals) based on the patient's electronic
      reports.

      Aim The objectives of this project are to assess the feasibility of using a
      telerehabilitation program for patients after a knee operation and investigate the acceptance
      of the provided solution by the patients and healthcare professionals.

      Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the acceptance and satisfaction of patients and healthcare
      professionals by using the telerehabilitation program will be high and correlated with
      patients' exercise adherence and health recovery.

      Telerehabilitation Group (Target Group) The subjects will be recruited before the operation
      and will be followed during an 8-week rehabilitation period.

      In addition to the telerehabilitation program, the subjects will receive the regular
      treatment offered by Farsø Hospital in connection with total knee replacement surgery and are
      to follow the same rehabilitation procedure as regular patients (see below).

      Before the operation, the project physiotherapist will hand over the telerehabilitation
      system equipment and instruct the subject how to use the system. In addition, the
      physiotherapist will also ask the subject to follow the instruction process and try the
      available services a few times. The physiotherapist makes sure that the subject can operate
      the system easily and without any challenges.
