  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine adhesion, also known as Asherman's syndrome, is the partial or complete
      occlusion of the uterine cavity as a result of endometrium damage. Most intrauterine
      adhesions patients manifest amenorrhea, reduced menstrual pattern, infertility, and
      intrauterine growth restriction, which seriously affect their reproductive health.It is well
      established that the formation of intrauterine adhesion likely involves hypoxia, reduced
      neovascularization, and altered expression of adhesion associated cytokines, but the exact
      mechanisms are not well understood. Although excessive curettage is considered the primary
      cause, intrauterine adhesion is known to be associated with diverse non-traumatic factors,
      such as postabortal sepsis, puerperal sepsis and infections. Intrauterine adhesion separation
      surgery is the gold standard for the treatment of uterine adhesion. Although the success rate
      is as high as 95%, the patients with moderate or severe uterine adhesion have severe damage
      to the endometrial basement, poor regeneration of endometrial and gland, poor tolerance of
      endometrial and poor clinical prognosis. Even if all kinds of anti-adhesion measures are used
      comprehensively, the postoperative recurrence rate of patients with moderate and severe
      uterine adhesion is high.Therefore this study was conducted to investigate whether
      intrauterine lavage or intrauterine gel-injection therapy after surgery could reduce the
      recurrence of intrauterine adhesion, promote the endometrial growth and repair and improve
      the menstruation and reproductive prognosis for severe intrauterine adhesion, and we
      hypothesize that intrauterine adhesion may be related to changes in microbial flora in the
      reproductive tract.
