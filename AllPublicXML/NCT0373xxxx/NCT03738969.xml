  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center longitudinal study aims to compare the survival outcomes (including overall
      survival, progression-free survival and disease-free survival between uterine cervical
      patients receiving different surgical routes (vaginal, laparotomy and laparoscopy), which is
      the primary study objective. All clinical and pathological data would be retracted from case
      reviews, and all survival data would be reached by clinic, telephone and mail follow-up. This
      study also would analyze the impact on survival outcomes of other factors, including
      nerve-sparing techniques, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant radiotherapy and infection of
      human papillomavirus. The predictive effects of different following protocol and imaging
      plans will be also compared. Last, the influences of surgical routes on the fertility
      outcomes (pregnancy and its complications) and the ovarian reserve are important secondary
      study objectives.
