  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized clinical trial, the investigators expect to demonstrate that the MRI
      contrast agent Dotarem is not less effective in contrast enhancement of breast lesions then
      Gadavist. Participants will be randomized to receive either Dotarem or Gadavist. In all
      cases, inclusion criteria will require patients having undergone or scheduled or most likely
      to be scheduled to undergo tissue sampling with histology results available. The patients
      will be prospectively and consecutively identified such that the majority of patients
      included will have been diagnosed with breast cancer, while including benign disease in the
      minority of patients in each arm. Following randomized enrollment, quantitative,
      semi-quantitative and qualitative image analysis will be performed to objectively assess for
      differences in image quality and diagnostic value.

      A stratified randomization of participants based on the time of menstural cycle and breast
      density. Women will then receive their clinically indicated Breast MRI with contrast, using
      SOC procedures for weight-based dosage. After enrollment, MRI images and medical metadata
      will be abstracted using the hospital medical records in EPIC and PACS databases. Data to be
      collected from the medical record includes histology parameters: tumor, tumor type and size,
      grade, stage and personal data: MRN, accession number, date of birth, date of MRI, age, sex,
      race/ethnicity, family history. Images will be stripped of identifiers and then coded by a
      study ID using the third party SanteSoft Dicom Editor software. Medidata will also be coded
      and stored separately from a mastercode file linking the study ID with the following
      identifiable information: MRN, accession number, date of birth, and date of MRI.

      After a period of data collection, two radiologists blinded to the contrast agent will
      independently review the the MRIs. This qualitative review will consist of each exam being
      graded on a scale of 1-(Fail) to 5-(Excellent) contrast enhancement quality. Additionally,
      each blinded radiologist or designee will conduct the secondary quantitative measurements of
      the wash-in/wash-out contrast characteristics through use of computer aid design (CAD) in
      PACS.
