      The purpose of this project is to investigate if PET/MR imaging improves the accuracy in
      visualization and characterization of lung cancer disease, compared to PET/CT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer type and the leading cause of cancer-related death
      worldwide. Positron emission tomography (PET) coupled with computed tomography (CT) is the
      standard of care for visualization and staging of lung cancer. Recent clinical introduction
      of hybrid PET and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems has shown potential to improve
      tumor imaging beyond the limits of PET/CT. However, knowledge about the clinical impact of
      this new hybrid modality is still limited.

      This project aims to investigate how PET/MR may improve the diagnosis and treatment of lung
      cancer disease, compared to PET/CT: PET/MR may allow early detection of brain and liver
      metastases, which strongly affects treatment outcome and survival; predictive models based on
      machine learning may combine image derived biomarkers from PET/MR, histology and health
      record data, to automatically visualize and characterize the tumor, facilitating computer
      aided diagnosis and personalized radiotherapy treatment.
