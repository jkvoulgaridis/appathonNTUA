  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 randomized, multi-center, double-blind, vehicle controlled, 12-week,
      safety, efficacy, and systemic exposure study followed by a 12-week open-label extension of
      trifarotene cream in adults and adolescents with autosomal recessive ichthyosis with lamellar
      scale
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-cohort, multicenter study in subjects with moderate to severe LI. Adults (Cohort
      A) and adults and adolescents (Cohort B) will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to 1 of
      2 doses of active or vehicle and treated twice weekly for 12 weeks. Subjects who complete the
      randomized, double-blind portion of the study will be eligible to enter a 12 week, open-label
      extension study.

      Approximately 15 adults (≥18 years old) will be randomized into the first cohort of subjects
      (Cohort A) in a 1:1:1 ratio and treated twice weekly for up to 12 weeks. If no safety issues
      are identified, both adults and adolescents (ages 12-17 years, inclusive) will be allowed to
      enroll in Cohort B. Subjects in Cohort B will be randomized 1:1:1 and treated twice weekly
      for up to 12 weeks in the same manner as subjects in Cohort A.

      All subjects who complete 12 weeks of double-blind study treatment will be eligible to enroll
      in a 12-week open-label extension. Subjects in the open-label extension will receive active
      twice weekly for up to 12 weeks.

    <description>The amount of roughness of the skin will be measured on a 5-point scale. 0 (Clear) Smooth skin
(Almost Clear) Hardly palpably roughness
(Mild) Mild roughness (fine sand paper-like)
(Moderate) Moderate, coarse roughness (coarse sand paper-like)

    <measure>The difference in mean scores using Palm Sole Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Thickening of the skin on the palms and soles will be measured on a 5-point scale:
0 (Clear) No thickening, no roughness, no fissure
(Almost Clear) Only slight thickening, minimal to no roughness, no fissures
(Mild) Some thickening, mild roughness on palpation, few fissures may be present

    <measure>The difference in proportion of subjects with presence of fissures between the active and vehicle groups</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fissuring will be assessed by recording the presence or absence of fissures, the number of fissures present, and the pain associated with each fissure.

    <measure>Quality of life measurement per Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI, or the Dermatology Quality of Life Index, is a dermatology-specific Quality of Life instrument. It is a simple 10-question validated questionnaire with 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment); higher scores indicate poorer quality of life. Responses collected are on a scale of 0-3 depending on the question relevance to the subject.
Response (Score) Very much (scored 3) A lot (scored 2) A little (scored 1) Not at all (scored 0) Not relevant (scored 0) A minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 30 is obtained by summing the score of each question. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.
0-1 = no effect at all on patient's life 2-5 = small effect on patient's life 6-10 = moderate effect on patient's life 11-20 = very large effect on patient's life 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life</description>

(Severe) Very large, adherent, coalescent and very thick scales</description>

    <measure>The difference in mean ectropion scores between the active and vehicle groups</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Ectropion Severity Score (ESS), is a proven system to be reliable and sensitive to the presence of ectropion and has a maximum score of 8 points (0-8). A higher score indicates a worse ectropion. The score takes the severity of ectropion in terms of lateral and medial apposition, scleral show, conjunctival show, and roundness of the eye into account and gives an indication of the functional aspects involved in ectropion by scoring redness, excess tear film, and the position of the lacrimal punctum A point scale of 0=Nonaffected, 0.5=Emerging, 1= Affected is assigned to 8 observations.
Lateral apposition
Medial apposition
Sceral show
Conjunctival show

    <measure>Quality of life measurement per EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ visual analog scale (VAS). Descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 5 responses.
no problem
slight problems
moderate problems
severe problems
extreme problems It should be noted that the numerals 1-5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 100-'the best health you can imagine' and 0-'the worst health you can imagine'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents.</description>
