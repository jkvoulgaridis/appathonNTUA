  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Dr. Rogers' research plan involves developing and pilot testing a
      theory-driven, culture-specific intervention that specifically targets masculinity barriers
      care and colorectal cancer (CRC) uptake among African-American men (ages 45-75). CRC is
      preventable as screening leads to identification and removal pre-cancerous polyps; however,
      African-American men consistently have the highest CRC mortality rates across all gender and
      racial/ethnic groups; and their CRC screening uptake remains low for uncertain reason.
      Contributing factors are etiologically complex, yet but culture-specific masculinity barriers
      to care may contribute to low CRC screening uptake among African-American men. Examining
      masculinity barriers to care is vital as CRC screening may challenge some cultural role
      expectations and self-representations of African-American men whose tendency is to delay
      help-seeking medical care. The study's specific aims are to: 1) develop, validate, and test a
      culture specific measure of masculinity barriers to care relative to CRC screening uptake
      among African-American men; and 2) develop and pilot test a theory-driven, culture-specific
      intervention that targets masculinity barriers to care, psychosocial factors, and CRC
      screening uptake among African-American men. Barbershops are historically known as culturally
      appropriate and trusted venues in African-American communities, and are critical for this
      research as they provide a pathway for reaching African-American men with masculinity
      barriers to care who are not regularly receiving healthcare services, and in particular, CRC
      screening. The proposed study and integrated training plan well-position Dr. Rogers to launch
      an independent investigator career focused on informing culture-specific interventions to
      eliminate cancer inequities among African-American men.

      The investigator will conduct research in the Salt Lake City metro area (Salt Lake
      City-Provo-Orem) of Utah. African American men's CRC screening rates in UT are substantially
      lower than in other states, and the Salt Lake City region has the largest population of
      African-Americans in the state.10,50 Approach. The investigator propose a multi-stage mixed
      methods study (Figure 1), beginning with an exploratory sequential design validating the
      items for subsequent use in a pilot mixed methods intervention to accomplish aims. For Aim 1
      (Years 1-2), the investigator will collect and analyze QUALitative data from 2 sources -
      focus groups and cognitive interviews - to validate and test a culture-specific scale of
      masculinity barriers to care among African-American men (hereafter called the Masculinity
      Barriers to Care Scale, MBCS). Next, the investigator will administer the MBCS as an online
      QUANTtitative survey with the target population to evaluate the association between scale
      scores and CRC screening uptake. For Aim 2 (Years 3-5), the investigator will consider
      existing evidence-based approaches (e.g., motivation interviewing), the integrated results
      (QUAL + QUANT) from Aim 1 regarding masculinity barriers to care, and community input to
      design a novel, culturespecific, behavioral intervention - one aimed at increasing CRC
      screening uptake (fecal immunochemical test; FIT) among African-American men and feasible for
      delivery in barber shops. The investigator will pilot test the peer intervention in a two-arm
      cluster randomized intervention (6 barbershops, randomized by site) to account for
      differences in barbershop culture and reduce contamination. The primary outcomes for the
      pilot are recruitment, sample size estimation, preliminary efficacy, and acceptability. The
      investigator will also conduct post-intervention interviews with participants from both arms
      to evaluate acceptability (i.e., why and how each arm was or was not successful).

    <description>We anticipate the culture-specific arm developed minimally will include two core components: barbers as motivational interviewers, and (2) fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits distributed by barbers. If we choose this route for the culture-specific arm, preliminary data from our barbers suggest I teach the barbers the MI technique using content that stems from Aim 1 findings. Additional components for this arm may be developed during the APEASE process.</description>
