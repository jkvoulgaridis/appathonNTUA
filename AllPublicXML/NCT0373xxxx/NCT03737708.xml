  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Biologics + Methotrexate with
      Biologics + Tacrolimus measured by the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores. The study
      will also assess the safety of the combinations.
