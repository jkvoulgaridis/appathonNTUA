  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WXFL10030390 (WX390) is a novel oral small molecular that inhibits phosphoinositide-3 kinase
      (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and has demonstrated potent inhibitory
      effects on multiple human tumor xenografts. The first-in-human study is conducted to assess
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WX390 at single dose and
      multiple doses.

      This study will be an open-lable, phase Ⅰ study and will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of WX390 after a single administration followed by a 28-day continuous
      course of therapy; evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy in an open-lable
      administration of WX390 at the MTD.
