  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score from baseline at 6 months postoperative</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>NRS is used for rating patient pain intensity from 0-10, with a score of 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of Index Vertebral Body Angle from baseline at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Vertebral body angle is defined the angle formed by lines drawn parallel to the superior endplate of the fractured vertebral body and the inferior endplate of the fractured vertebral body for each fractured vertebral body.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of NRS score from baseline at 1 day and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 day, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>NRS is used for rating patient pain intensity from 0-10, with a score of 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score from baseline at 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>ODI Questionnaire is used to assess patient back function. The ODI score ranges from 0-100. The best score is 0 (no disability) and worst is 100 (maximum disability).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of SF-36 from baseline at 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is used to assess general health status. The SF-36 results were summarized into two components, a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). The score for PCS/MCS is between 0 and 100, with higher scores denoting better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in vertebral body height restoration at 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute height restored as percent (AHRP) was the amount of height restored in the vertebral body expressed as a percent of estimated pre-fracture (EP) height. Measurements were assessed at anterior, medial, and posterior locations on the vertebral body.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vertebral body angle from baseline at 1 day and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 day and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Vertebral body angle is defined the angle formed by lines drawn parallel to the superior endplate of the fractured vertebral body and the inferior endplate of the fractured vertebral body for each fractured vertebral body.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Rates of adverse events reported through 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events reported through 6 months, in particular, the following events will be reported:
Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome;
Bone Cement leakage;
Vertebral body compression fracture;
Adjacent vertebral body fracture;</description>
