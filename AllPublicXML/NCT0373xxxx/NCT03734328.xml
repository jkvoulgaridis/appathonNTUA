  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) has greater predictability for root coverage and
      causes minimal discomfort to patient. Although donor site heals with primary intention
      causing less scar tissue, in some different harvesting procedures primary flap closure may
      not be achieved due to nature of thick palatal tissues. Some potential complications may
      occur at donor site such as: necrosis of graft and palatal site, pain, excessive hemorrhage,
      protracted discomfort, donor site infection and in some cases donor site paresthesia.
      Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a platelet concentrate obtained by a simple procedure that does
      not require biochemical blood involvement.Based on the known biological effects of PRF, the
      aim of this study is to evaluate the PRF in the management of soft tissue donor sites in term
      of bleeding and pain sensation, and to observe the changes in tissue healing after a
      subepithelial connective tissue graft procedure at palatal donor site.

    <textblock>
      Successful treatment of gingival recession (GR) is based on the use of clinically predictable
      periodontal plastic surgery (PPS) procedures. There are many procedures and different
      surgical procedures were proposed. Coronally advanced flap and subepithelial connective
      tissue graft (SCTG) is a good combination to increase the keratinized tissue width and reduce
      the amount of gingival recession.

      SCTG has greater predictability for root coverage and causes minimal discomfort to patient.
      Although donor site heals with primary intention causing less scar tissue, in some different
      harvesting procedures primary flap closure may not be achieved due to nature of thick palatal
      tissues.

      Some potential complications may occur at donor site such as: necrosis of graft and palatal
      site, pain, excessive hemorrhage, protracted discomfort, donor site infection and in some
      cases donor site paresthesia.

      Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a platelet concentrate obtained by a simple procedure that does
      not require biochemical blood involvement. The three-dimensional fibrin network and presence
      of many growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor
      (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor supports effective neovascularization, accelerated wound
      closure and rapid cicatricial tissue remodeling. The strong fibrin architecture distinguishes
      it from other kinds of platelets concentrates and it seems responsible for the slow release
      of growth factors over a period of 7-14 days5. This period is seen as sufficient to prevent
      complications after connective tissue graft. Since the first description by Choukroun in
      2000, PRF has been used in the clinical field for more than a decade in oral surgery and
      implant dentistry.

      Based on the known biological effects of PRF, the aim of this study is to evaluate the PRF in
      the management of soft tissue donor sites in term of bleeding and pain sensation, and to
      observe the changes in tissue healing after connective tissue graft procedure at palatal
      donor site.

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>to inspect the early wound healing on donor site on palate using early healing index on 3rd, 7th and 14th postoperatively. (1) complete flap closure, no fibrin line in the interproximal area; (2) complete flap closure, fine fibrin line in the interproximal area; (3) complete flap closure, fibrin clot in the interproximal area; (4) incomplete flap closure, partial necrosis of the interproximal tissue; and (5) incomplete flap closure, complete necrosis of the interproximal tissue</description>

    <measure>postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were instructed to complete pain diary for the day at the surgery, first day, third day, seventh day, tenth day after surgery. The visual analog scale (VAS) that consists of a 10-cm line anchored by 2 extremes was used for perception measurements . Total score was 100 and less score was 0 according to this scale. According to this scale &quot;0&quot; means no pain, no discomfort during chewing and speaking, while the &quot;100&quot;,meant 'worst pain, extreme discomfort during chewing and speaking'</description>

    <description>On days 3, 7, 14 , the color of the palatal mucosa was assessed by the VAS score with the adjacent and opposite mucosa color. In this evaluation, 0 points showed no color matching, and 100 points showed excellent color matching with evaluated tissues</description>
