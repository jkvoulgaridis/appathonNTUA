      The aim of this study is to quantify and characterize the outcomes of radiofrequency (RF)
      ablation after, and the utility of electroanatomical mapping with the Advisor™ HD Grid
      Mapping Catheter, Sensor Enabled™ (hereafter called &quot;HD Grid&quot;) and EnSite Precision™ Cardiac
      Mapping System (SV 2.2 or higher, hereafter called &quot;EnSite Precision&quot;) with HD Wave Vmax
      voltage mapping (hereafter called &quot;HD Wave&quot;) in subjects with PersAF or VT in real-world
      clinical settings.

    <measure>To quantify and characterize the acute- and long-term success rate of RF ablation after electroanatomical mapping with HD Grid and Ensite Precision with HD Wave in subjects with PersAF or VT.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (VT) 12 months (Persistent AF)</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of acute success is defined as the proportion of subjects who receive HD Grid mapping and RF energy delivery resulting in acute termination of clinical arrhythmia, defined by termination to SR (or AT if being treated for PersAF) or non-inducibility of clinical arrhythmia after ablation (cardioversion allowed prior to inducibility attempt). For PersAF, the rate of long-term success rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who receive HD Grid mapping and RF energy delivery and have had freedom from all atrial arrhythmias (AF/AFL/AT) greater than 30 seconds (as documented by 48-hr Holter at 12-month follow-up) and a change in class I/III antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) use. For VT, the rate of long-term success is defined as the proportion of subjects who receive HD Grid mapping and RF energy delivery and have had freedom from reoccurrence of sustained monomorphic VT and a change in class I/III AAD use at 6-month follow-up.</description>
