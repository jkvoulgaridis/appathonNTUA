  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of oesophagogastric cancer has increased by 400% since the 1970s in Ireland and
      the United Kingdom. In addition, refinement of perioperative management and the now
      widespread use of multimodal protocols for patients with locally advanced disease have
      significantly improved outcomes for patients with oesophagogastric cancer treatable with
      curative intent. Despite significant advances in chemoradiotherapy, surgical resection
      remains the primary curative option.

      Unintentional weight loss and nutritional complications represent serious concerns for
      patients after radical resection, even among those who remain free from recurrent disease in
      the long-term. A study from the Swedish Esophageal and Cardia Cancer Registry reported a mean
      three year weight loss of 10.8% among disease-free patients, with 33.8% of this cohort
      demonstrating malnutrition at three years post-oesophagectomy.

      Mechanisms contributing to weight loss for disease-free patients after upper gastrointestinal
      surgery are poorly understood, however an association between increasing magnitude of weight
      loss and the presence of increased satiety is described. Our recent studies at SJH have
      demonstrated four fold elevated postprandial satiety gut hormone concentrations after
      oesophagectomy, compared with baseline preoperative values. Postprandial gut hormone levels
      correlate significantly with postprandial symptoms and altered appetite at 3 months
      postoperatively, and with body weight loss at 2 years postoperatively. However, the mechanism
      leading to exaggerated postprandial gut hormone production after upper gastrointestinal
      surgery is poorly understood, limiting targeted therapeutic options.

      In this study, we aim to characterise the role of altered nutrient transit and
      enteroendocrine cell function in the pathophysiology of excessive post-prandial gut hormone
      responses after upper gastrointestinal surgery. To do this, we will measure the gut hormone
      response to a standardised 400 kcal meal, as per previous studies, while concurrently
      assessing gastrointestinal transit time, and enteroendocrine cell morphology and function. In
      this way, we will determine whether the magnitude of the postprandial gut hormone response
      correlates with the rate of nutrient transit into the enteroendocrine L-cell rich small
      intestine, and whether enteroendocrine cell adaptation occurs after oesophagectomy.

      Furthermore, we have previously observed that gut hormone suppression using octreotide is
      associated with increased ad libitum among subjects after upper gastrointestinal cancer
      surgery (Elliott JA et al, Annals of Surgery, 2015). The mechanism of action of octreotide
      may relate to SSTR-5-mediated negative feedback to the enteroendocrine L-cell, but this
      medication may additionally reduce enteroendocrine L-cell responses through its inhibitory
      effect on gastrointestinal motility - reducing the rapidity with which nutrients are
      delivered to the small intestine - and small intestinal nutrient sensing via inhibition of
      the Na+-dependent glucose transporter SGLT-18-10. Through conduction of this double-blind,
      randomised, placebo-controlled crossover study, we aim to establish the mechanism of action
      of octreotide-mediated increased food intake in patients after gastrointestinal surgery. This
      may inform the design of future targeted interventions for this patient group.
