  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PrEliMS study is a mixed-methods feasibility randomised controlled trial of a point of
      diagnosis intervention programme which aims to provide emotional support for newly diagnosed
      people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This feasibility study will enable us to plan for a
      definitive trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this point of diagnosis
      intervention programme. The aim is to assess the feasibility of the trial procedures and
      intervention, and to evaluate the key feasibility parameters before proceeding to a
      definitive trial. Participants (N=60) will be randomised into three groups: (1) usual care;
      (2) usual care + Support 1 (MS Nurse Support); (2) usual care + Support 2 (MS Nurse Support
      plus Peer Support).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will be people who have been recently diagnosed with MS (or currently
      going through diagnosis process), and who are aged 18 years or over, recruited through MS
      clinics. Participants, after consent, will complete baseline measures before being randomised
      into to one of three groups: (1) usual care; (2) usual care + Support 1 (MS Nurse Support);
      (2) usual care + Support 2 (MS Nurse Support plus Peer Support). Group 1 (20 patients) will
      not receive any intervention. Group 2 (20 patients) will receive Support 1 which will include
      one face-to-face support session delivered by an MS Nurse. Group 3 (20 patients) will receive
      Support 2 which includes MS Nurse Support (i.e., Support 1) plus Peer Support. Peer Support
      will include a minimum of two peer support session delivered by Peer Support Workers (i.e.
      patients with lived experiences). All groups will receive usual care. The outcome measures
      will be collected at 3 and 6 months after randomisation by all participants. Feedback
      interviews with up to 21 participants (7 from each group) and up to 10 service providers (5
      MS Nurses who delivered the MS Nurse Support and 5 Peer Support Workers who delivered the
      Peer Support) will be conducted to assess what parts of the intervention were helpful or
      unhelpful, the acceptability of randomisation and trial procedures, and the appropriateness
      of the measures used.

    <description>Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS4; Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mersmelstein, 1983; Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988) to measure the level of perceived stress among people with MS by assessing their level of perceived uncontrollability and unpredictability on a 5 point scale (0=never, 1=almost never, 2=sometimes, 3=fairly often, 4=very often). The scores for each question are added (after reverse scoring two of the four questions) to give a total score ranging from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating higher stress.</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983) will be used to measure the level of mood disturbances. It is a 14-item scale and each item is scored from 0 to 3. The total scores range from 0 to 21 for the anxiety subscale and also for the depression subscale, with higher scores indicating greater levels of anxiety or depression.</description>

Psychological subscale has 9 items with 4-point response categories for each item (&quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;a little&quot;, &quot;moderately&quot;, &quot;extremely&quot;). The total score range from 9 to 36, with lower scores indicating little impact of MS and higher scores indicating greater impact.</description>

    <description>Multiple Sclerosis Self-efficacy Scale (MSSE; Rigby, Domenech, Thornton, Tedman, &amp; Young, 2003) will be used to assess the extent to which participants feel in control of their condition. The scale has 14 items. Each item is presented with a 6-point Likert scale, ranging from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. The scores for each item are added (after reverse scoring six of the 14 items) to give a total score ranging from 14-84, with higher scores indicating an elevated level of self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Receives usual care plus Support 1 (MS Nurse Support) which includes one one-to-one, face-to-face session with an MS Nurse Specialist in a hospital setting (or via Skype). The session will include answering newly diagnosed patients' questions about MS, providing psychoeducation and teaching Acceptance and Commitment strategies (Hayes, Strosahl &amp; Wilson, 1999), and referring to other services (based on needs). Participants will also be given a self-help workbook ('Better living with a diagnosis of MS: Patient Workbook') by the nurses. This session will take place within 2 weeks of diagnosis and last up to 90 minutes. It will be supplemented by phone calls (depending on participant needs). MS Nurses will receive training and on-going supervision from experienced clinical psychologists.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Group 3 (Usual care plus Support 2)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Receives usual care plus Support 2 (i.e. MS Nurse Support plus Peer Support). In addition to receiving the MS Nurse Support (i.e. Support 1, as described in Group 2), this group will also receive peer support which will be provided by Peer Support Workers who are patients/carers with lived experience and who are recruited and trained to deliver peer support under supervision from experienced clinical psychologists. It will be delivered one-to-one, face-to-face (in a community setting or via Skype, based on participants' preferences). Patients in this group will be triaged to a Peer Support Worker by the MS Nurse during the 2-week MS Nurse Support session. The sessions will be scheduled to a convenient time between weeks 2-6 after diagnosis and each session will last up to 60 minutes.</description>

    <description>MS Nurse Support intervention is multi-faceted, involving various components (i.e. information provision and emotional support), and a range of strategies and techniques (e.g. psychoeducation, acceptance and commitment), delivered by MS Nurse Specialists, to provide standardised support and advice to patients at diagnosis, to establish and sustain coping strategies. MS Nurse Support intervention is person-centred and tailored to the needs and lifestyle of each participant.</description>

    <description>Peer Support will be delivered by Peer Support Workers using information provision and supportive listening to provide support and advice to patients at diagnosis, and to provide patients the opportunity to talk freely, extensively and confidentially about their experiences, thoughts and feelings about MS diagnosis and its effects on their lives in a non-judgmental and safe environment. Peer Support intervention is person-centred and tailored to the needs and lifestyle of each participant.</description>
