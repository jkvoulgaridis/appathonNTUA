  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was purposed to evaluate the non-inferiority of YVOIRE volume, a hyaluronic acid
      product, in terms of correction of wrinkles and safety in nasolabial fold deep-dermal
      injection, compared to Perlane, the control preparation.

    <description>Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS)
Absent: no visible fold; continuous line
Mild: Shallow but visible fold with slight indentation; minor facial feature
Moderate: moderately deep fold; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched. Excellent correction expected.
Severe: very long and deep; prominent facial feature; less than 2mm visible fold when stretched
Extreme: extremely deep and long folds; 2-4mm visible v-shaped fold when stretched; detrimental to appearance; unlikely to have satisfactory correction with injectable implant alone</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: Women in 30~55 years.

          2. Those whose wrinkle scores in the treatment site (nasolabial fold) at the screening
             visit were Stage 3 or 4 in the 5-stage Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS)
             symmetrically

          3. Those who were informed on this study in detail, understood it completely, decided to
             participate in the study own their own and signed on the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Those with a skin disease in the face (skin infection, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea,
             herpes etc.)

          2. Those with a history of severe allergy

          3. Those with hypertrophic scar or a history of kelloid

          4. Patients with an autoimmune disease

          5. Those with hepatic dysfunction or abnormality in coagulation, or those administering
             an anticoagulant (aspirin, warfarin etc.) concomitantly

          6. Those who had used a local topical preparation (steroid, retinoid) within 4 weeks
             prior to the study

          7. Those who had underwent a chemical peeling, laser procedure (including IPL) or
             insertion of other bioadaptive materials (however, those who had been treated with HA
             filler could participate in the study if the date of treatment was known and the
             investigator judged that the filler effect had disappeared).

          8. Patients with a malignant tumor

          9. Women in pregnancy or lactation

         10. Hepatitis carriers or VDRL/HIV positive patients

         11. Those with a hypersensitivity to the investigational medical device of this study

         12. Other persons including those considered as difficult to perform this study by the
             principal investigator
