      The purpose of this post-approval study is to report the rate of post-surgical intraocular
      inflammation (based upon a specified case definition) reported within a 180-day post-surgical
      period following attempted implantation of an ACRYSOF® IQ RESTOR® Toric Intraocular Lens
      (IOL) in the US.

    <textblock>
      Qualified subjects will receive cataract surgery followed by implantation of the ACRYSOF IQ
      RESTOR +3.0 D Toric IOL or an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR +2.5 D Toric IOL at the surgery visit. If a
      second eye will participate in the study, subjects will receive the second eye cataract
      surgery within 60 days of the screening visit. Four postoperative follow-up visits are
      planned to occur at 1-2 days, 7-14 days, 30-60 days, and 90-180 days, for each enrolled eye.
      Subject participation in this study is expected to last up to 7 months, including a total of
      6 study visits for subjects implanted in one eye and up to 11 visits for subjects implanted
      in both eyes. Upon completion of the 180 days follow-up visit, subjects will be exited from
      the study.
