  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia affects 2 to 5% of adults in the general population. Patients describe a
      combination of symptoms centred around fatigue not induced by exercise and not relieved by
      rest.

      The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is self-perpetuating by the deconditioning, consequence of a
      reduced muscle mass due to inactivity and periods of prolonged rest.

      Thus, it seems fundamental to develop other non-drug approaches: among them, adapted physical
      activity is recommended by most learned societies because of a good level of evidence (Level
      1, Grade A). The question remains, however, whether simple advice to resume physical activity
      is sufficient (routine care with medical assessment at 3 months) or whether a physical
      activity supervised inside and outside the hospital is not more relevant.

    <time_frame>at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Fatigue Severity Scale. This is a short questionnaire of 9 questions to which the patient answers on a scale from 1 to 7.
Simply add the scores and divide by 9 - you get a result on 7 points. The higher the result, the greater the fatigue. Several studies speak of a threshold at 5.5</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by the Pittsburgh. The questionnaire includes 19 self-assessment questions and 5 questions for the spouse or roommate (if any). Only self-assessment questions are included in the score.
The 19 self-assessment questions combine to give 7 components&quot; of the score with each component receiving a score of 0 to 3.
In all cases, a score of 0 indicates that there is no difficulty while a score of 3 indicates the existence of severe difficulties. The 7 components of the score add up to give an overall score from 0 to 21 points, 0 meaning that there is no difficulty, and 21 indicating on the contrary major difficulties.</description>
