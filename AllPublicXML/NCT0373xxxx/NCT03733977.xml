      Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit-24 (FC-ICU 24) survey is valid and reliable
      survey which was used to evaluate family satisfaction of intensive care units.

      Turkish version which was prepared based on FS-ICU 24 survey was applied to the relatives of
      ICU patients (the ICUs in Anesthesiology, Internal Medicine, General Surgery and Neurosurgery
      ) in the Erciyes University Medical Faculty. The study was conducted between April and June
      2015. The Turkish version was tested for reliability and validity, and it was proven to be
      reliable and valid. The subjects of the study were relatives of patients that were
      hospitalized for at least 48 hours, who had visited the patient at least once. Only one
      relative was included in the study per patient, and the survey was conducted after the
      required permissions were taken from the related medical departments.

    <measure>Family Satisfaction in Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) Survey Validation In Turkish Language</measure>
    <time_frame>An Average Of 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Family Satisfaction in Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) Survey was shown to demonstrate family satisfaction from intensive care units effectively. The survey evaluated the following topics: treatment, care, the attitudes of the ICU staff, environmental conditions, the decision-making process. We evaluate the reliability and the validity of the FS-ICU 24 survey in the Turkish language for demonstrate cross cultural adaptation of survey. The Turkish version ( that was prepared based on the FS-ICU 24 survey ) applied to the relatives of patients who were hospitalized for at least two days and had visited the patient at least once in tertiary intensive care units. The answers to the survey questions ranged from excellent (1 point) to poor (5 points), consistent with the original survey. The results ranged from 20 to 100 points. 20 points indicated excellent satisfaction, 100 points indicated poor satisfaction. The satisfaction decreases as the score increases.</description>
