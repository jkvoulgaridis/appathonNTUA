  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study investigated the effect of using a known drug used in intermittent claudication
      (named pentoxifylline) as an adjuvant to erythropoietin stimulating agents to improve anemia
      of hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty out of 57 hemodialysis anemic patients were finally included. They were assigned to two
      groups of equal numbers. Oral Pentoxifylline 400mg once daily was added to the treatment
      group which was compared to the control group over a six months period regarding hemoglobin,
      hematocrit, serum albumin and CRP.

      Inclusion criteria: (Patients with ESRD on HD who have hemoglobin &lt;11 g/dl, taking
      Erythropoietin alfa 4000 -12000 I.U/wk and having a urea reduction ratio &gt;65%.). There were
      57 patients who met the inclusion criteria out of 158 patients.

      Exclusion criteria: Iron deficiency anemia with transferrin saturation &lt;30%, intact
      PTH&gt;300pg/ml, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (evidenced by macrocytosis), history of
      intolerance to pentoxifylline or other xanthine derivatives, recent retinal or cerebral
      hemorrhage or active peptic ulcer disease, pregnancy or breastfeeding, presence of systemic
      hematological disease or known hemoglobinopathy, major surgery, infection, acute myocardial
      infarction, or malignancy within the last three months and patients who refused to
      participate in the study.
