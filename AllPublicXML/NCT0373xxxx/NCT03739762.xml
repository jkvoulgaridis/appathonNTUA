    <textblock>
      Healthy Aging Resources to Thrive (HART) uses a rigorous two-stage randomized control design,
      adapted and refined based on pilot studies, to test a novel intervention to reduce sitting
      time in older adults. Half the participants will be randomized to the intervention aimed at
      decreasing sitting time, and the other half will be randomized to a healthy living control
      that does not focus on reduced sitting time. After 6 months, the intervention group will be
      further randomized so that half continue with the intervention and the other half receive no
      further intervention. All participants will be followed for 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy Aging Resources to Thrive (HART) is a two-stage randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
      adults over age 60 with obesity to determine the efficacy of a novel sitting-reduction
      intervention and its impact on cardiometabolic risk markers. Participants will be randomized
      to a 6-month sitting reduction intervention (termed I-STAND) or healthy-living attention
      control (Stage 1).

      After 6 months, I-STAND participants will be re-randomized to receive either booster sessions
      or no further intervention (Stage 2). Attention control participants will receive no further
      intervention. All participants will be followed for 12 months total with in person
      assessments at baseline 6, and 12 months. Primary outcomes are reduction in sitting time at 6
      months, objectively measured using the activPAL device, and blood pressure. The design will
      answer novel questions about the impact of sitting reduction on cardiometabolic risk markers
      as well as maintenance of sitting reduction.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized into one of two cohorts/arms: one called &quot;i-STAND&quot; with coaching sessions focused directly on sitting less and standing more; the other called &quot;Healthy Living&quot; with coaching sessions focused on various topics related to a healthy lifestyle, but without a focus on standing more. Those randomized to the i-STAND intervention will also be re-randomized half-way through the study, with half of that cohort moving on to phase 2, which involves booster sessions on sitting less and standing more.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>i-STAND participants are offered wrist-worn devices that vibrate every 15 minutes to encourage a standing break, standing desks, and 2 in-person / 8 phone-based coaching sessions focused on sitting less and standing more. They are given a workbook with strategies to reduce sitting time. The program ends at 6 months where participants will wear an activPAL and come to the clinic for a measurement visit and get feedback on their sitting time. However, people in this cohort will be re-randomized at 6 months, where half will be assigned to intervention boosters (5 more phone coaching sessions / one 9-month activPAL wear) before the 12 month time point for a final activPAL wear and final measurement visit. Those not randomized to receive boosters will have no further contact with the study team until the 12 month time point.</description>

    <description>In this arm, participants are not offered any prompting devices or desks, and their coaching sessions focus on a variety of topics related to healthy living, but without a focus on sitting less/standing more. They have 1 in person session and 9 phone calls with a health coach. Participants are given a workbook. All content is from Kaiser Permanente Washington and is available to all members. Participants will select topics of interest and review them with their health coach. The program ends at 6 months where participants will wear an activPAL and come to the clinic for a measurement visit. After that, they will not have contact with the study team until 12 months when they will again wear an activPAL and come into the clinic for their final measurement visit.</description>

    <description>Via in-person and phone coaching sessions, participants randomized to this arm will be coached to find ways to sit less and stand more, and look for ways to change their home environment to encourage this, as well as look at how their lifestyle may contribute to their sitting time. Participants in this arm may be re-randomized at the half-way point to continue with additional phone coaching sessions.</description>
