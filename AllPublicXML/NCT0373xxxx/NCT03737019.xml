      How does education of health personnel with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy affect the
      extent of medical certificates of sick leave and drug prescriptions in primary health care
      centers in Kalmar compared with similar centers in Jönköping in which the personnel do not
      get such therapy?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five primary health care centers in the County Council of Jönköping who do not get education
      according to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) serve as controls. Six primary health
      care centers in County Council of Kalmar, with the same total number of listed patients
      (about 45 000 in total per County Council) in their areas undergo group education according
      to ACT. Data on medical certificates of sick leave and drug prescriptions are taken from
      registries (this is routine in primary health care in Sweden) at baseline and after 6, 12 and
      24 months in both regions. The personnel at both centers also fill out questionnaires about
      their own quality of life at baseline and after 12 months. The investigators also plan to
      interview about 20 subjects on these matters.
