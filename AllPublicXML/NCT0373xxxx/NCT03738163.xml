    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed as a prospective, non-randomised, single arm clinical
      investigation. Data will be collected from approximately 120 evaluable subjects, divided into
      three groups of approximately 40 subjects; infants (0-36 months old), children (3-18 years
      old) and adults (&gt;18 years old), with the following indications: eczema, psoriasis and other
      dry skin conditions. Each subject will be followed during 4 weeks treatment, with a visit at
      baseline (visit 1), at 2 weeks (visit 2) and at 4 weeks (visit 3) treatment.
