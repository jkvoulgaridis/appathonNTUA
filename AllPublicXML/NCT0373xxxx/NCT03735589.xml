      This phase I/IIa trial studies the side effects and best dose of a type of specialized immune
      cell (natural killer cell-like cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) (nCTLs) and how well they work
      when given with a vaccine (alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cells) in treating patients with
      stage II-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. nCTLs are immune cells
      that are isolated from each patient?s blood and &quot;taught&quot; in the laboratory how to recognize
      and eliminate tumor cells. These &quot;educated&quot; immune cells are then given back to the patient.
      An alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell vaccine is another population of &quot;educated&quot; immune
      cells that work to support the infused nCTLs. Giving nCTLS with a dendritic cell vaccine may
      work better in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of autologous tumor loaded DC vaccines (alpha-type-1
      polarized dendritic cell [alphaDC1]) combined with intradermally administered aDC1 .(Safety
      [Phase I aspect]) II. To measure the intraperitoneal induction and persistence of aDCI
      induced sensitized cytotoxic T Cells (CTLs), which express natural killer (NK) cell-like
      features (nCTLs) and total CTLs following intraperitoneal administration of aDC1. (Local
      Immunologic Efficacy [Phase II aspect])

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To study the T cell populations generated that correlates with higher
      anti-tumor responses.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. To evaluate the progression-free survival and overall survival of
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nCTLs, followed by a phase IIa study.

      Patients receive the alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) 2 weeks
      before day 0, on day 0, and on day 28. Patients also receive nCTLs intraperitoneally (IP)
      over 15-30 minutes on day 0. In the absence of unacceptable side effects, patients may
      receive the alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell vaccine every 1-3 months at the discretion
      of the physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, then at 6 and 12
      months.

          -  Evidence of current drug or alcohol abuse or psychiatric impairment, which in the
             investigator's opinion will prevent completion of the protocol therapy or follow-up.

          -  Any condition that in the opinion of principal investigator (PI) would preclude
             patient from successfully completing the protocol therapy or follow-up.
