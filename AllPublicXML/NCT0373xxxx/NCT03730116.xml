      Multicenter observational open program. Assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of the
      fixed-dose combination of bisoprolol/perindopril in patients with arterial hypertension and
      stable CAD in daily clinical practice (STYLE)

      Study objectives and purposes:

      Primary endpoints:

        -  efficacy of bisoprolol/perindopril FDC in patients with HT and stable CAD in everyday
           practice regarding the BP

        -  efficacy of bisoprolol/perindopril FDC in patients with HT and stable CAD in everyday
           practice regarding the angina

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  impact on the quality of life of bisoprolol/perindopril FDC in patients with HT and
           stable CAD in everyday practice

        -  adherence to bisoprolol/perindopril FDC therapy in patients with HT and stable CAD in
           everyday practice The program will involve 480 general practitioners (GPs) and
           cardiologists from the primary care facilities. Each doctor includes four patients. It
           is planned to include not less than 1920 patients in total.
