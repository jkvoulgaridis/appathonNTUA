      How to reduce the complications of perineal wound after abdominoperineal resection (APR) has
      always been a hot topic in the medical field.To reduce the complications of perineal wound
      and the primary healing of perineal wound must meet the two principles of &quot;unobstructed
      drainage&quot; and &quot; reduced tension closure&quot;.This concept is similar to the concepts of closure
      of enterostomy in rectal cancer patients. It was reported that use of cross-stitch closure
      can significantly reduce complications of closure of enterostomy. So the investigator ever
      used the &quot;cross&quot; closure to reconstruct the perineal wound of APR, which was really decrease
      the complications of perineal wound. However, more clinical trails was needed to confirm the
      conclusion.

      Perineal wound problems after abdominoperineal resection (APR) for rectal cancer is reported
      in up to 25%ï½ž66% of patients,if the perineum does not heal primarily, the secondary wound
      healing may prolong hospital stay, may necessitate surgical reintervention, and often
      requires intensive wound care for several months. Great efforts have been taken to reduce the
      complications of perineal wound of APR, but the incidence of the perineal wound complications
      are not effectively decreased.

      It was reported that one of the most important factors to determine the primary healing of
      perineal wound is whether the anterior sacral drainage and perineal stump drainage are
      sufficient and effective or not, which is similar to the concept of closure of enterostomy.

      Previously, it was reported that &quot;cross&quot; closure is an effective method of skin closure for
      stoma reversal, which allows increased surgical exposure, reduces suture, smooth drainage,
      aesthetic healing simplifies wound care, and gives a neat cosmetic result.

      Therefore, because of the success use of &quot;cross&quot; closure in stoma reversal to reduce the
      complications of perineal wound, the investigator used the &quot;cross&quot; closure to reconstruct the
      perineal wound of APR, and it really can decrease the complications of perineal wound.
      However, more clinical trails are needed to confirm the conclusion.
