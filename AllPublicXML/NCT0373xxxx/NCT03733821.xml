    <textblock>
      Sleep disruptions are prevalent complaints in cocaine use disorder (CUD) subjects, either
      during consumption or withdrawal. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) seem to
      be a promissing strategy in the treatment of chronic cocaine users.

      The aim of this study will be to assess the variation on self-perceived sleep quality and
      drug use variables in individuals with CUD undergoing a rTMS protocol over the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

    <textblock>
      Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disorder characterized by a
      problematic pattern of cocaine consumption leading to a clinically significant impairment. A
      core element of this disease is the increased vulnerability to relapse during the first weeks
      of abstinence. Commonly withdrawal symptoms as sleep disturbances, negative affect or
      craving, may contributes critically to relapses. Especially, sleep disruptions are frequently
      referred by CUD individuals during either use or abstinence. Moreover, polysomnographic (PSG)
      data demonstrate a worsening sleep during the first weeks of abstinence in chronic cocaine
      users, with diminishing rapid eye movement sleep (REM) time, reduction of total sleep time,
      increasing sleep latency, and chronically decreased slow-wave sleep (SWS) time. Such sleep
      anomalies appear to be durable and relate to the severity of withdrawal symptoms and clinical
      outcomes in the treatment of CUD. However, causality between sleep disturbances and CUD has
      not been clearly established yet. Interestingly, sleep deprivation and addictive substances
      have comparable neurobiological effects on several neurotransmitter pathways, particularly in
      the dopaminergic system. Therefore, the implementation of strategies to rewire the altered
      brain circuits might induce clinically significant improvements of addictive symptoms and the
      regulation of sleep patterns in CUD patients.

      Recently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), an innovative and safe brain stimulation
      procedure, which induce neural electrical activity through the application of magnetic pulses
      over the scalp and with enduring effects on mood, has been applied as a promising therapeutic
      approach in addictive disorders. In fact, clinical pilot studies on CUD are giving
      preliminary support to the potential role of rTMS in decreasing cocaine craving and use. PSG
      studies in healthy volunteers have shown rTMS-induced changes in sleep architecture that are
      opposites to those found in CUD subjects, as a prolongation of REM latency or a marked
      increase in slow-wave sleep. The promising therapeutic effect of TMS on insomnia, restless
      legs syndrome and on sleep disturbances associated to epilepsy, depression and post-traumatic
      stress disorder has also been suggested. Further, rTMS application over DLPFC have revealed
      positives outcomes in patients with chronic primary insomnia, by reducing sleep latency,
      increasing the total sleep time and REM latency.

      These findings suggest that rTMS might impact brain circuitry, modulating relevant functions
      as sleep architecture and potentially affecting addictive related symptoms as craving or
      negative affect.

      The hypothesis of the present study is that rTMS treatment intervention might have a
      beneficial effect on sleep disturbances reported by CUD patients during the
      abstinence/withdrawal period. The investigators hypothesized also the positive outcome on
      accompanied cocaine withdrawal symptoms (as craving or mood) of rTMS.

      Hence, the aims of the present study are:

        1. to verify whether rTMS of the left DLPFC in CUD patients produces modifications on the
           subjective sleep quality patterns and drug use variables.

        2. to further strengthen the results of previous CUD-TMS research, the investigators will
           test whether rTMS of the left DLPFC in CUD patients is safe and reduces cocaine use.

      Procedures:

      Patients with CUD will be evaluated for sleep disturbances, craving, depression, anxiety and
      other clinical symptoms by completing the following scales: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      (PSQI), Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II),
      Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and
      Symptoms checklist 90 - Revised (SCL-90-R). Participants could be undergo a battery of
      cognitive tests such as Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Stop Signal Task (SST), Iowa
      Gambling Task (IGT), Stroop task or Delay Discounting Task (DDT). The pattern of drug use
      will be also monitored by recording drug use variables. The measures will be assessed before
      the rTMS treatment (baseline), and after 5 (Day 5), 30 (Day 30), 60 (Day 60) and 90 (Day 90)
      days during the treatment.

    <description>The subjective sleep quality will be assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). This scale is composed by 19 items clustered into 7 components, including sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep latency, daytime dysfunction, sleep efficiency, overall sleep quality, and sleep medication use. Each of them generates a score ranging from 0 to 3, with the highest value indicating the greatest dysfunction. The sleep component scores are summed to produce a global score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher score indicating worse sleep quality. A global score higher than 5 is considered an indicator of relevant sleep disturbances.</description>

    <description>Self-reported craving will be assessed by Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ) which is a 5-item self-report questionnaire measuring five aspects of craving: current intensity, intensity during the previous 24 h, frequency, responsiveness to drug-related conditioned stimuli, and imagined likelihood of use if in a setting with access to drugs. Each craving aspects yields a score ranging from 0 to 9 with the highest values indicating high craving. The overall score is obtained by summing every item score and dividing it by 5. A higher mean craving score is associated with less likeliness to initiate abstinence.</description>

    <description>Depression symptoms will be assessed by Beck Depression Inventory - II (BDI - II) which is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory with four options under each item, ranging from not present (0) to severe (3), measuring depressive symptoms. This inventory scoring is obtained by summing the highest ratings for each of the 21 items, with a sum scores range from 0 to 63. The severity levels suggested in the manual are the following: Scores between 0 and 13 indicate minimal, between 14 and 19 mild, between 20 and 28 moderate, and between 29 and 63 severe depression.</description>

    <description>Anxiety symptoms will be assessed by Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) which is is a 20-item measure developed to assess the frequency of anxiety symptoms based on diagnostic conceptualizations. It consists primarily of somatic symptoms. Each symptom is rated on a 4-point Likert scale on frecuency basis from 1 ('&quot;none or a little of the time'&quot;) to 4 ('&quot;most or all of the time''). Items 5, 9, 13, 17, and 19 are reversed scored and total scores on the SAS range from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating more frequents anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <description>Subjective symptoms of mental disorder will be assessed by Symptoms checklist 90 - Revised (SCL-90-R) which is is a 90-item self-report inventory which assesses psychological distress in terms of nine primary symptom dimensions and three summary scores termed global scores. Each item describes a physical or psychological symptomthat is rated on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The Global Severity Index (GSI) is the single best indicator of the current level or depth of an individual's disorder. It combines information concerning the number of symptoms reported with the intensity of perceived distress.</description>
