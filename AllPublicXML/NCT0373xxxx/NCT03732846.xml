      This is an one-arm, phase II, single-center clinical study of Anlotinib in the treatment of
      recurrent small cell lung cancer, the objection is to exploring the efficacy and safety of
      Anlotinib in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer.It is going to enroll 43 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years old;

          2. Histological or cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer;

          3. Systemic chemotherapy that has previously received at least two or more lines regimen,
             followed by disease progression or recurrence;

          4. According to the RECIST 1.1 standard, there is at least one measurable target lesion;

          5. ECOG physical score 0-1 points; expected survival time ≥ 3 months;

          6. The main organ function meets the following criteria:

               1. blood routine: absolute value of neutrophils ≥ 1.5 × 109 / L, platelets ≥ 75 ×
                  109 / L, hemoglobin ≥ 80 g / L;

               2. Blood biochemistry: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal value,
                  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 times the upper
                  limit of normal value (if liver metastasis, ≤ upper limit of normal value 5
                  times), serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal;

          7. Subjects voluntarily joined the study and signed informed consent, with good adherence
             and follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have previously used Anlotinib;

          2. Systematic anti-tumor treatments have been performed for the past 2 weeks, including
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except for metastatic lesions other than thoracic
             radiation), targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and biotherapy;

          3. Imaging (CT or MRI) shows central tumors in which tumor lesions invade local large
             blood vessels; imaging (CT or MRI) shows significant pulmonary cavitary or necrotizing
             tumors; or other factors identified by the investigator that may cause hemoptysis
             disease;

          4. A history of active bleeding within the first 6 months of screening, or receiving
             thrombolysis or anticoagulant therapy, or the investigator believes that there is a
             clear tendency to gastrointestinal bleeding (such as esophageal varices with bleeding
             risk, local activity) Ulcer lesions, etc.) or active hemoptysis;

          5. A thrombotic event occurs within 6 months (including arteriovenous thrombosis,
             pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, including transient ischemic attack,
             etc.);

          6. Cardiac diseases with obvious clinical symptoms, such as: congestive heart failure,
             coronary heart disease with obvious symptoms, arrhythmia with difficult drug control
             (including clinically significant QTc interval prolongation history, or screening
             period QTc interval women &gt;470ms, Male &gt; 450ms), had myocardial infarction within 6
             months, or cardiac insufficiency;

          7. Hypertension, which is uncontrolled by the drug, is defined as: systolic blood
             pressure ≥ 160 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg;

          8. Clinically obvious gastrointestinal abnormalities, which may affect the intake,
             transport or absorption of drugs (such as inability to swallow, chronic diarrhea,
             intestinal obstruction, etc.), or patients with total gastrectomy;

          9. Surgery (&lt;28 days) before the study was selected or the surgical incision did not
             completely heal, or there were other unhealed wounds;

         10. Active or uncontrolled serious infections;

         11. Pregnant or lactating women; those who have fertility are unwilling or unable to take
             effective contraceptive measures;

         12. Increasing the risk associated with participating in a study or study drug, and at the
             discretion of the investigator, may lead to other conditions in which the patient is
             not eligible for inclusion in the study.
