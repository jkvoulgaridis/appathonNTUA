  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis (HD) patients take more pills per day on average than any other chronically ill
      patient population. On average, an HD patient takes 19 medications per day, of which 70% may
      not be appropriate. The reason the medications may not be appropriate is that HD patients are
      rarely included in clinical trials for new medications and therefore the efficacy and safety
      data that exists for the general population may not actually apply to them. Tools to guide
      the re-assessment and discontinuation (deprescribing) of these specific medications that lack
      evidence for efficacy and safety in HD patients are needed. These tools will help reduce the
      amount of medications being taken and the potential negative consequences of taking so many
      medications (e.g. adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, non-adherence, increased risk of
      cognitive impairment, impaired balance and falls, and increased risk of morbidity,
      hospitalization, and mortality).

      Nine medications that are often inappropriately prescribed to HD patients have been
      identified by the investigators. These medications are: Alpha-1 Blockers, Anticonvulsants,
      Benzodiazepines &amp; Z-Drugs, Loop Diuretics, Prokinetic Agents, Proton Pump Inhibitors,
      Quinine, Urate Lowering Agents, and Statins. The investigators developed and validated tools
      to help medical teams in outpatient HD units with identifying and stopping these medications
      in their patients. The next step will be to perform a study where test these tools are tested
      in practice at multiple HD centers across Canada. This initiative should decrease the average
      number of medications per patient and inappropriate medication use in the HD units where
      these tools are used. The overall objective of this study is to improve current clinical
      practice by optimizing medication use and prescribing patterns in the HD units across Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hemodialysis (HD) patients are rarely included in clinical trials, thus
      medication efficacy and safety data specific to this population is lacking. Toxicity from
      medications inadequately removed by dialysis is also a risk for them. HD patients take an
      average of 19 pills daily, with 70% potentially inappropriate.

      This polypharmacy increases their risk of adverse events, drug-drug interactions,
      non-adherence, cognitive impairment, impaired balance and falls, morbidity, hospitalization
      and mortality. Using provincial databases, the investigators identified 9 medication classes
      with uncertain indications and/or safety in HD patients: Alpha-1 Blockers, Anticonvulsants,
      Benzodiazepines &amp; Z-medications, Loop Diuretics, Prokinetic Agents, Proton Pump Inhibitors,
      Quinine, Urate Lowering Agents and Statins. The investigators developed and validated tools
      for deprescribing, safety monitoring and patient education for each of these medications. The
      next step will be to perform an implementation study evaluating these deprescribing tools at
      multiple HD units across Canada.

      The investigators hypothesize that implementation of these deprescribing tools will decrease
      polypharmacy and improve safety and patient satisfaction in these HD units. Specific Aims are
      to determine:

        1. Effectiveness of the deprescribing algorithms for decreasing polypharmacy (i.e. % of
           successful deprescribing of at least 1 of the medication classes at 6 month post
           implementation)

        2. Safety of the deprescribing algorithms using monitoring tools developed for each
           medication

        3. The impact of the deprescribing tools on patient satisfaction

      Methods: In this quasi-experimental interventional cohort study, the nephrology healthcare
      team will assess medications for all patients as per usual practice in their respective HD
      units, using the deprescribing algorithms to assist in clinical decision making and patient
      education tools to explain rationale to patients. Participating patients will be followed for
      6 months for outcomes.

      The primary outcome will be proportion of individuals successfully deprescribed at least one
      of the 9 target medications.

      Additional outcomes include:

        -  Adverse events associated with deprescribing and medication class specific safety
           outcomes (e.g. for furosemide, the investigators will be tracking blood pressure,
           potassium, intradialytic weight gain and heart failure admissions)

        -  Proportion of identified candidates who began a deprescribing trial

        -  Proportion of deprescribing trials declined by medical team and patient, respectively

        -  Patient satisfaction (using a patient survey)

        -  Average number of medications per patient before/after implementation

        -  Average medication cost savings per patient

      Expected Results/Impact on Health Research: This study will determine the efficacy of the
      deprescribing algorithms on reducing polypharmacy in HD patients. It will also provide
      insights on knowledge translation, as investigators aim to educate providers and patients on
      the harms of polypharmacy and influence prescribing patterns in HD units nationally. This
      study will encourage other institutions to incorporate similar tools into their practice and
      encourage comprehensive and team based re-assessment of patient's medications.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The patient satisfaction survey is based on the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers &amp; Systems (CAHPSÂ®) In-Center HD Survey, which rates the medication and dialysis services. Most questions are on a Likert scale ranging from Never (1) to Always (4) or from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strong Agree (5). There are also two No (1) / Yes (2) questions and one 0 (Worst possible) to 10 (Best possible) question. The survey is divided into 3 sections: Dialysis Center Staff, Your Medications, and Deprescribing.
The average total score overall for patients before vs. after the study will be compared (higher scores indicate higher satisfaction). The average total score per section for patients before vs. after the study will also be compared.</description>

    <description>The study app will track at adverse events associated with deprescribing each of the specific medication classes. For example: for loopdiuretics, blood pressure, potassium, intradialytic weight gain and heart failure admissions will be tracked; for proton pump inhibitors, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptom severity and frequency of antacid use will be tracked
By comparing baseline symptoms to symptoms during and at the completion of deprescribing, safety concerns will be identified.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated cost savings to the patient and to the healthcare system due to deprescribing initiative</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The cost of medications that are deprescribed will be calculated based on a yearly supply at the current dose of the patient's therapy. Total costs will be calculated based on current practices for each province. By identifying patients who have their medication costs covered by the healthcare system, it will be possible to determine the medication cost savings to the healthcare system.
For patients who are insured through private insurance plans, or who pay cash for their medications, the provincial formulary cost represents the most conservative approach when calculating the total medication costs. This approach will therefore determine the minimum cost savings to the patient. Overall, both cost savings to the patient and the healthcare system due to deprescribing in HD patients will be determined.</description>
