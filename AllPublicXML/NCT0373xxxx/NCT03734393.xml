  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if an HIV-infected donor liver (HIVD+)
      transplant is safe with regards to major transplant-related and HIV-related complications
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if receiving a liver transplant from an HIV-infected deceased liver
      donor is safe with regards to survival and major transplant-related and HIV-related
      complications compared to receiving a liver from an HIV-uninfected deceased liver donor
      (HIVD-). Those participants who have accepted an HIVD- organ will be randomized to be
      followed in the full study or followed in the nested observational group

          -  Participant meets the standard criteria for liver transplant at the local center.

          -  Participants being listed for a simultaneous liver kidney (SLK) are eligible if
             participants meet the standard criteria for both organs.

          -  Participant is able to understand and provide informed consent.

          -  Participant meets with an independent advocate per the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE)
             Act Safeguards and Research Criteria.

          -  Documented HIV infection (by any licensed assay or documented history of detectable
             HIV-1 RNA).*

          -  Participant is ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Opportunistic complications: prior history of certain opportunistic infections is not
             an exclusion if the participant has received appropriate therapy and has no evidence
             of active disease. Medical record documentation should be provided whenever possible.

          -  CD4+ T-cell count: ≥ 100/µL within 16 weeks prior to transplant if no history of
             AIDS-defining infection; or ≥ 200 μL if history of opportunistic infection is present.

          -  HIV-1 RNA is below 50 RNA/mL.* Viral blips between 50-400 copies will be allowed as
             long as there are not consecutive measurements &gt; 200 copies/mL. *Organ recipients who
             are unable to tolerate anti-retroviral therapy (ART) due to organ.

        failure or recently started ART may be eligible despite a detectable viral load if safe and
        effective ART to be used by the recipient after transplantation is described.

          -  Participant must have or be willing to start seeing a primary medical care provider
             with expertise in HIV management.

          -  Participant is willing to comply with all medications related to participant's
             transplant and HIV management.

          -  For participants with a history of aspergillus colonization or disease, no current
             clinical evidence of active disease.

          -  Agreement to use contraception.

          -  Participant is not suffering from significant wasting (e.g. body mass index &lt; 21)
             thought to be related to HIV disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or
             primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.*

          -  Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding. (Note: Participants who become pregnant
             post-transplant will continue to be followed in the study and will be managed per
             local site practice. Women that become pregnant should not breastfeed.)

          -  Past or current medical problems or findings from medical history, physical
             examination or laboratory testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may
             interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements or that may
             impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study.
