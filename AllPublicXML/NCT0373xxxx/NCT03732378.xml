      Background: Patients with major depressive disorder have prominently been reported to be
      related with subnormal polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids levels, importantly low
      docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma and dietary intake. However, more
      randomized controlled trials are needed to support its importance in management of
      depression.

      Objective: To explore polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid role in major depressive disorder
      management.

      Materials &amp; Methods: Seventy patients 20 to 40 yeas, who were already diagnosed with
      depression and taking antidepressant treatment, were selected at department of psychiatry and
      behavioral sciences Kind Edward Medical University Lahore, and assigned into 2 groups, i.e.
      Intervention and control, by simple random lottery method. For twelve weeks, intervention
      group advised to take one omega-3 (300mg EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid and 200mg DHA
      docosahexaenoic acid), or placebo (500 mg corn oil) capsules once daily with meal. Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI) scale was used to assess the depression. Demographic information
      was collected by using a structured questionnaire.

      Study Design:

      12 week Randomized, single blind, placebo-Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted at King Edward
      medical university, psychiatry &amp; behavioral sciences department Lahore. From 19 May 2017 to
      16 August 2017 one capsule of omega-3 (EPA 300mg, and 200mg DHA) were given (38, 39), or
      placebo (500 mg corn oil) (40).

      Data Collection and Evaluation:

      Subjects were assessed at the first visit according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Information about demographics, dietary habits and risk factors such as age, gender, height,
      weight and family history of depression, dietary habits, education levels, marital status,
      cigarette smoking, supplementation and sleeping hours were obtained by using a structured
      questionnaire in face to face interview in local and easy to understand language. BMI was
      calculated by using the equation BMI=kg/m2.

      Ethical Approval:

      Written approval (Reg.No.Psy/561/17) was taken from the head of psychiatry &amp; behavioral
      sciences department, King Edward medical university Lahore. Informed consent had been taken
      from all study participants in written form after explaining the procedure of the study.
      Guidelines laid out in the Declaration of Helsinki were followed to conduct this study.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Data was analyzed through SPSS 20.0 with 95% confidence interval. Frequency distribution and
      of demographic variables were checked. Chi square test was used to check the relationship
      between depression and risk factors. Paired T test was used to analyze the before and after
      intervention mean difference. Results were presented in tabular and graphical form.
