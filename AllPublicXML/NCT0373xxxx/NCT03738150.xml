      This study evaluates the effect of sotatercept (ACE-011) in adults with Pulmonary Arterial
      Hypertension. Each eligible participant will receive standard of care (SOC) plus sotatercept
      (ACE-011) for a 24 week treatment period followed by a 16 week follow up period.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, single arm, open-label, multi center exploratory study to determine the
      effects of sotatercept (ACE-011) plus standard of care (SOC) in adults with WHO functional
      class III pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

      All eligible participants will receive standard of care (SOC) plus sotatercept (ACE-011) at a
      starting dose level of 0.3 mg/kg SC for Cycle 1 and escalating to 0.7 mg/kg at cycle 2 for
      the remainder of the treatment period. Participants will be required to attend clinic visits
      once every three weeks for 24 weeks to perform one or more protocol specified evaluations.
      Evaluations include hemodynamic measures collected during right heart catheterization (RHC)
      with invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET), and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
      (MR), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic parameters,
      anti-drug antibody testing, and adverse events. These assessments will be performed at the
      Screening Period Visit (up to 28 days before Cycle 1 Day 1), the End of Treatment Visit (Day
      169), and at the End of Study Visit (Day 260).
