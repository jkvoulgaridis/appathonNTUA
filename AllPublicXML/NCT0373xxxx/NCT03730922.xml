  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In breast cancer patients treated by mastectomy and adjuvant post-mastectomy radiation
      therapy (PMRT) reconstruction is often delayed until 6 - 12 month after completion of
      chemotherapy and PMRT, due to high risk of complication. In this trial the safety of the
      delayed-immediate reconstruction method is tested, where a skin sparing mastectomy and
      reconstruction with silicone implant is performed at primary surgery to save the native skin
      for the final delayed reconstruction.

      An increasing proportion of breast cancer patients treated by mastectomy wish for a breast
      reconstruction. If post-mastectomy radiation therapy is recommended, the reconstruction is
      often delayed until 6 - 12 months after completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy due
      to risk of complication that might delay adjuvant treatment. At this time the native skin
      over the removed breast cannot be used in the reconstruction, resulting in a suboptimal
      aesthetic outcome. In the delayed-immediate reconstruction method, a skin sparing mastectomy
      and reconstruction with implant is performed at primary surgery, to save the native skin
      under radiation therapy, thereby improving the chance for a good aesthetic outcome at the
      final delayed reconstruction. In this trial breast cancer patients treated by mastectomy and
      loco-regional radiation therapy is randomized to either delayed reconstruction or
      delayed-immediate reconstruction. The complication rate as well as morbidity, aesthetic
      outcome and psychological well-being after delayed-immediate reconstruction will be compared
      with delayed reconstruction

             involvement must have disappeared during systemic therapy. It is highly recommended
             that the decision to offer an inflammatory breast cancer patient inclusion in the DBCG
             RT Recon trial is made during a multidisciplinary team conference.

          -  Adjuvant systemic therapy with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, anti-HER2 treatment
             and other targeted therapies used in the adjuvant setting either as new standard or as
             part of a trial during the course of the trial is accepted.

          -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and primary systemic therapy of an operable breast cancer is
             accepted.

          -  Patient with previous non-breast malignancy is accepted if the patient has been
             without disease minimum 5 years, and the treating oncologist esti-mates a low risk of
             recurrence. Patients with the following diseases can be accepted despite less than 5
             years disease free interval: carcinoma in situ cervicis, carcinoma in situ coli,
             melanoma in situ, basal cell carcino-ma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin.

          -  Previous non-breast malignancy (not including carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
             colon, melanoma in situ, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, and squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin) within 5 years.

          -  Conditions indicating that the patient cannot go through breast reconstruction, the
             radiation therapy or follow up.

          -  Not being able to participate due to language or other personal issues.
