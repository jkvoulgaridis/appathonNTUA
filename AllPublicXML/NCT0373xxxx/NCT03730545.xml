  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteral immunonutrition (EIN) has been gaining increasing attention, but data of its immune
      and anti-inflammatory function in patients undergoing gastrectomy for gastric cancer are
      poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of EIN on immune
      function, inflammation response and nutrition status when compared to standard enteral
      nutrition (SEN).

      The investigators believe that the proportion of cluster of differentiation 4
      T-cells(CD4＋T-cells), cluster of differentiation 3 T-cells(CD3＋T-cells) and the counts of
      CD4＋ / cluster of differentiation 8 T-cells (CD8＋), immunoglobulin G(IgG), immunoglobulin
      M(IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) were larger in EIN group, while the level of WBC, CRP and
      TNF-α were lower and nutritional status was similar.

    <masking_description>Eligible patients were randomly assigned in equal numbers to undergo SEN or EIN according to a computer-generated randomization list managed by a dietary nurse not involved in the study. The study was double-blind: SEN and EIN feeds were identical in color and type of container, so treatment assignments were not revealed to patients or to any staff members.</masking_description>
