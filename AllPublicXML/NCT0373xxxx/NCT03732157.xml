  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of outpatient surgery has become a national priority, with the objective of
      an ambulatory surgery rate of around 50% in 2016, whereas this rate reached only 37.7% in
      2010.

      In the context of the management of primary hyperparathyroidism, there are two possible
      approaches. The first, which is commonly performed on an outpatient basis, consists in
      approaching only the pathological gland, if it was first identified by scintigraphy and
      ultrasound (which is the case in one patient in two), without exploring the others
      parathyroid glands.

      The reference technique consists in exploring the 4 parathyroid sites by transverse
      cervicotomy. Although more invasive, it minimizes the risk of failure due to the lack of
      knowledge of multi-glandular forms of the disease (15 to 20%), whose preoperative diagnosis
      is difficult. This reference technique is poorly performed on an outpatient basis while it
      lends itself to this type of management because of the superficial character of the operative
      site, a short operating time, moderate postoperative pain, rapid return oral nutrition and
      exceptional and early serious complications (delay &lt;24 h for cervical hematoma, &lt;24 h for
      hypocalcemia and immediate diagnosis of recurrent palsy).

      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that parathyroidectomy with 4-gland parathyroid
      exploration is feasible by ensuring patient safety. The investigators also believe that
      outpatient management will not lead to any difference after 3-month surgery, but will reduce
      hospitalization costs while increasing patient satisfaction with conventional care. To do so,
      the investigators carried out an observational cohort study of patients with an indication of
      parathyroidectomy wo will undergo outpatient management or conventional management (stay
      overnight in hospital) to inform all of these data.
