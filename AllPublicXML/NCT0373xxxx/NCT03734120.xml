  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reference technique for the conservation of gametes is storage in liquid nitrogen but new
      vats of nitrogen vapor (storage over liquid nitrogen) or in dry phase (storage in an
      insulated compartment of liquid nitrogen in a tank Liquid nitrogen) also allow the storage of
      flakes. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the dry-phase cryopreservation technique of
      liquid nitrogen compared with liquid-phase storage, depending on the duration of
      cryopreservation.

      Objective: To evaluate the effects of cryopreserved sperm in dry and liquid phase nitrogen at
      3 and 6 month on sperm numeration, motility, vitality, morphology, acrosomal integrity and
      DNA fragmentation.

      Design: Experimental study, investigator was blinded to the type of Cryopreservation.

      Patient(s): Semen samples were collected from patients who came in laboratory for semen
      analysis

      Intervention: Samples were frozen with a programmable freezing unit. Each semen sample was
      divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was plunged into liquid nitrogen and the other was
      stored in dry-phase nitrogen for 3 or 6 month. Thawing was performed at room temperature.
