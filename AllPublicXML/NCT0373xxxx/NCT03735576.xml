  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the unmet medical problem of insufficient treatment of late life
      depression (LLD). Compared with depression in early adulthood, treatment options of LLD are
      limited. This trial is the first confirmatory multicentre study to test the efficacy of an
      LLD-adapted cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program. It will test the hypothesis, that
      LLD-specific cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is superior to unspecific supportive
      intervention (SUI) with regard to reducing symptoms of depression over the course of 6
      months. Secondary goals are to test the efficacy of LLD-CBT in comparison with SUI on patient
      reported outcome in major depressive disorders (PRO-MDD), anxiety, cognition, quality of
      life, overall health status, sleep and global clinical impression.

    <description>There will be a total of four assessments (see primary &amp; secondary endpoints). The first visit of the study will be a screening and baseline (T0) visit. After the baseline assessment, the subjects will be randomized to either of the two treatment arms. Within one week, the first of the successive bi-weekly 50-minute individual face-to-face treatment sessions will be performed by a study therapist. After 7 therapy sessions, the primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained in week 5 (T1) by the blinded rater. This will be followed by the treatment sessions 8 to 15 which will be carried out by the therapist. End-of-treatment primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained in week 10 (T2). The final follow-up assessment (T3) will be performed 6 months after randomization by the blinded rater.</description>
