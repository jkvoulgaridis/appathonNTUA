    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the Connect Through Positive Leisure Activities for Youth (PLAY) Project
      is to improve staff capacity for implementing effective physical activity (PA) programming
      within middle school after school programs serving high-risk youth. All components of the
      'Connect' intervention (health promotion initiative, comprehensive training, and tailored
      physical activity curriculum) aim to support staff cohesion, motivation and efficacy in
      facilitating a PA context that supports youth social goals and meaningful connections. To
      this end, the investigators will be implementing a 5-year randomized controlled trial with 30
      ASPs. Compared to control programs, after school programs receiving the `Connect' program are
      expected to show greater improvements from baseline to post- and 6 mo follow-up in social
      mechanisms, youth PA, and staff PA. The Connect through PLAY project will provide important
      insights into what supports are needed (and efficacious) for after school program staff to
      create a positive social climate to promote increases in youth motivation and participation
      in physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although after school programs (ASPs) have been recognized as a critical context for
      promoting youth physical activity (PA), with broad reach to underserved communities, research
      by the Principal Investigator and others have indicated that ASPs continue to struggle to
      meet policy guidelines for daily youth PA. Moreover, despite continued increases in obesity
      rates among U.S. adolescents, there have been few ASP interventions focused on underserved
      adolescents, and limited-to-no impact on adolescents' sustained behavior change. Previous ASP
      studies by the PI demonstrate that social mechanisms overlooked in previous interventions
      (e.g., developing friendship and connection to peers and staff through PA; group belonging,
      including positive peer PA norms and tangible support) are key predictors of youth PA. The
      research team recently completed a feasibility trial (NIH R21 HD077357) within 6 ASPs (3
      intervention vs. 3 standard- health curriculum controls) for underserved middle school youth
      that was the first intervention to date to address these youth PA social goals/mechanisms.
      Findings showed positive effects for changing staff behaviors, improving youth PA social
      supports and connections with peers and staff, and increasing youth PA. The proposed study
      will expand on the previous ASP feasibility trial with a novel translational approach that
      works with pre-existing ASPs and targets staff as instrumental for sustainable changes in
      social mechanisms within the ASP setting for increasing the daily PA of underserved
      adolescents. The proposed project will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial
      comparing a staff-based social development PA program to a standard ASP health curriculum
      control. The proposed efficacy trial will enhance the influence of pre-existing ASP staff as
      key change agents and address social developmental needs of adolescents overlooked in
      previous interventions through employing a novel theoretical framework that expands on social
      developmental theory and the social mechanisms highlighted by Self-Determination Theory,
      Achievement Goal Theory, and Social Cognitive Theory. The intervention will target the three
      key social mechanisms of &quot;PA social affiliation goals&quot; for increased and sustained PA of
      staff and underserved middle school youth (i.e., Friendships/connections through PA; Group
      Belonging, and; Staff Connection). All components of the intervention (health promotion
      initiative, comprehensive training, and tailored social PA curriculum) aim to improve staff
      capacity for facilitating a PA context that supports these social goals/mechanisms
      (connections, group belonging) and increases the influence of ASP staff as positive PA role
      models and agents of change.

      Compared to control ASPs, ASPs receiving the `Connect' program are expected to show greater
      improvements from baseline to post- and 6 mo follow-up in social mechanisms, youth PA, and
      staff PA. The results of this proposed project will demonstrate the efficacy of the
      intervention, and will assist in developing a model of training, motivating, and empowering
      ASP staff to address social mechanisms that promote youth PA for conducting a large scale
      effectiveness trial.

    <intervention_model_description>The prospective randomized controlled trial is a nested cohort design that compares two levels of the intervention, a staff-based social development PA program to a generalized ASP health curriculum control, over a 10-month (40 week) time period (16-week intervention, 6 month followup). A total of 30 ASPs serving underserved middle school (~40 youth and ~5 staff per school; N=1200 youth, 150 staff) will be randomly assigned to either receive the Connect intervention or serve as the standard ASP Health curriculum control. The project will be implemented over a 5-year period with a new cohort of 6 ASPs added each year (a total of 5 cohorts, with 6 ASPs in each cohort).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Greater increases (change) in physical activity (i.e., light, moderate, vigorous PA; using 7-day omni-directional accelerometers) of youth and staff receiving the Connect Staff-based PA intervention compared to General Health Curriculum control.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6mo follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Objective assessments of PA will be obtained on both staff and youth with omni- directional accelerometers. Data will be recorded in 30-s epochs to best capture short bouts of vigorous activity and raw activity data will be converted into time spent in light PA (1.6-2.9 metabolic equivalents (METS); count cut points=100 and 1500 for youth and 110-1534 for adults) and moderate-to-vigorous (MV)PA (3-8.9 METS; counts ≥ 1500 for youth and ≥ 1535 for adults) based on activity count thresholds for youth (identified by Puyau et al.) and adults (identified by Wilson, Co-I and Troiano et al) respectively. Youth and staff will wear the belts for one full week at baseline, the 8 wk intervention midpoint, 16 week endpoint, and 6 mo follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Greater improvements (change) in the Connect Staff-based PA intervention ASPs compared to General Health Curriculum control in targeted social mechanisms within the ASP for promoting physical activity using a social climate observation tool</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6mo follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Systematic observations will be conducted using the System for Observing Children's Activity and Relationships during Play (SOCARP) and a supplemental social climate observation tool that has been developed and tested by the PI (MCOT-PA). Key social mechanisms assessed include youth peer interactions and social behaviors (e.g., prosocial interactions like praising peers, antisocial interactions like teasing/bullying), staff behaviors and interactions with youth (e.g., providing praise; engaging in PA with youth), and the nature of activities for supporting connection and belongingness (e.g., inclusive). Consistent with other PA interventions, teams of two coders will make continuous observations of daily activities throughout 5 days at each ASP at baseline, 8wk midpoint, 16wk endpoint, and 6mo follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Document the Fidelity of the Connect program through changes in Staff's collective capacity to lead youth in PA activities within ASPs receiving the Connect Staff-based PA intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 mo follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Staff's collective capacity to lead youth in PA activities will be measured through structured interviews using a Readiness Assessment Tool that the PI has developed and tested which examines motivation for implementing the Connect intervention, innovation-specific capacity for Connect (e.g., staff efficacy), and general capacity (e.g., staff cohesion, support and positive relations with higher administration, and overall work satisfaction). The assessment will be conducted at baseline to identify and address any initial program barriers that would impede adoption of the intervention, and again at 8wks (midpoint), 16 wks (endpoint), and 6mo follow-up to determine whether any modifications to implementation are needed to improve adoptability post-intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline to 6 mo follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Staff PA self-concept and efficacy to overcome barriers impeding their accrual of daily recommended amounts of PA will be measured using the Self Concept and Motivation to Exercise Scale (reliability coefficients range from .63-.90; 7 items; 6pt scale; 0=strongly disagree; 6=strongly agree), and the Self-Efficacy for Exercise Questionnaire (reliability coefficient = .96; 10 items; 5pt scale; 1-not at all confident; 5=extremely confident), respectively. Higher mean scores across the scale items will indicate greater PA self-concept/efficacy. The assessment will be conducted at baseline, 8wks (midpoint), 16 wks (endpoint), and 6mo follow-up.</description>
