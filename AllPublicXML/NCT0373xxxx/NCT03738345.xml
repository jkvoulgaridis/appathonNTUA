  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) delivers oxygen at a flow which exceeds the patient's
      inspiratory flow demand in order to improve oxygenation. Numerous randomized control trials
      and meta-analyses have shown that HFNC improves oxygenation and helps avoid intubation in
      hypoxemic patients, as well as reduce work of breathing, improve ventilation, and decrease
      hypercapnia in COPD patients. Flow settings play a critical role when using HFNC, as
      increased flow can reduce inspiratory effort, improve ventilation, and dynamic lung
      compliance. However, flow rates used in many studies vary widely. The clinical effects of
      different HFNC flow setting, specifically to match or over than a patients' own inspiratory
      flow, is still unknown.

      patients and 30-60 LPM in hypoxemic patients. The clinical effects of different HFNC flow
      setting, specifically to match or over than a patients' own inspiratory flow, is still
      unknown.
