    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of Burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in the treatment
      of peripheral neuropathic pain in an extremity. It is a double-blinded &quot;n-of-1&quot; RCT with
      repeated two-week periods of Burst SCS or sham in randomised order.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCS is a treatment offered to patients with peripheral neuropathic pain, and involves
      electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. The analgesic effect is possibly mediated via both
      spinal and supra-spinal mechanisms.

      Traditional &quot;tonic&quot; SCS causes paresthesia during treatment, but the newer burst technique
      (five electrical pulses at 500Hz delivered in intermittent packets of 40 Hz) can be performed
      below detection level. Thus, it is possible to do double-blinded sham-controlled studies.

      In this study, we will study the effect of burst SCS compared with sham on pain intensity,
      function (Patient-Specific Functional Scale) and activity (accelerometry). In addition, we
      will use several questionnaires (psychometric data, health-related quality of life, sleep,
      global impression of change, use of analgesics, blinding).
