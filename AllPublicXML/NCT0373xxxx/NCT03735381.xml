  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized Control Trial (RCT), were healthy but sedentary women are selected in their first
      trimester of pregnancy. This RCT has two interventions arms (pedometer plus a goal of 11,000
      steps / day and pedometer without goal) and a control group arm, without the use of
      pedometer. The main objective is to promote physical activity in pregnancy decreasing the
      prevalence of insomina at their third trimester of pregnancy.

      General Objective: To determine the effect of a walking program during pregnancy in the
      prevention of the appearance of insomnia in the third trimester of pregnancy, in the increase
      of the quality of sleep and in the improvement of the quality of life throughout pregnancy.

      Specific Objectives: Comparison of the interventions group versus the control group; at the
      beginning, middle and end of the program of the following indicators: 1. Average steps/day;
      2. Frequency of insomnia; 3. Hours of night sleep and quality of sleep; 4. Quality of life
      level.

      Methodology: Randomized Control trial in parallel in healthy sedentary pregnant women
      belonging to the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital in Granada, Spain. At 12 weeks of gestation
      (GW) they will be invited to participate and randomly assigned to the intervention group I2
      (pedometer, with goal of 11,000 steps / day), intervention group I1 (pedometer without goal)
      and control (without pedometer). Duration of the intervention: 13-32 GW. At 12, 19 and 31GW
      the average steps/day will be measured in groups I2 and I1. In weeks 13, 20 and 32GW, the
      following variables will be collected: the Athens Insomnia Scale, the Sleep Quality Index
      (Pittsburgh), adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (Predimed), physical activity (short IPAQ),
      quality of life (PSI), the consumption of toxic substances (caffeine, illegal drugs, alcohol
      and tobacco), the anthropometric variables of pregnant woman.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of Insomnia in third trimester of pregnancy in the three arms with the Insomnia Athens Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>32 Gestational Week (GW)</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia Athens Scale (IAS): An eight-item scale that assesses the quantity and quality of sleep (first five items) and the diurnal repercussion of insomnia (daytime sleepiness, physical and mental functioning and well-being during the day). Each of the items scores from 0 to 3 (affectation of the item from light to severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 24 points, considering insomnia from a score equal to or greater than 6 points (S = 93% and E = 85%) or equal to or greater than 7 points (S = 84% and E = 90%).</description>

    <measure>Quality of sleep of pregnant women through pregnancy in the three arms measure with the Pittsburgh Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 (GW), 19 GW and 32 GW</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Questionnaire (PSQI): it assesses the quality of the individual's sleep during the previous month. It consists of 19 items grouped into seven components: quality, latency, duration, efficiency and sleep disturbances, use of medication for sleep and diurnal dysfunction; each component is scored from 0 to 3, according to a Likert scale in which zero is the absence of the symptom and 3 its maximum presence. This will result in a score that ranges from 0 to 21 points (higher score worse sleep quality): a PSQI score of more than 5 indicates poor sleep quality, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and a specificity of 86.5 %.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life of women through pregnancy in the three arms measure with the Pregnancy Synpton Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Gestational Week (GW), 19 GW and 32 GW</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancy Sympton Inventory (PSI): Is a 41-item likert scale developed from a group of experts and focus groups. Registers the range of symptoms that appear in the last month (Likert scale from 0 to 4: never, rarely, sometimes, often) and its impact on quality of life, by affecting the activities of daily life (scale Likert from 0 to 3: it does not limit me, it limits me a little, it limits me a lot). The scale has been adapted to Spanish pregnant women and is reliable (Kappa coefficient range = 0.6-0.9).</description>
