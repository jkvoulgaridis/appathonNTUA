  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus on grade I to III knee osteoarthritis by randomized controlled trials
      which comparing the effectiveness between placebo, autologous platelet rich plasma and
      autologous platelet lysate injections.

    <textblock>
      The current methods for treating knee osteoarthritis include delaying the disease progression
      and joint replacement surgery. The usual treatment methods are mostly temporary, such as
      taking drug and hyaluronic acid injection. Therefore, finding the safe and effective methods
      will greatly reduce medical resource, medical expenses and surgery cost, etc., and restore
      the patient's quality of life. Platelet lysate is the product of complete activation from
      autologous platelet. It contains rich growth factors and cytokines such as PDGF, TGF-β, VEGF,
      EGF and IGF, etc. It can support cell growth and doesn't have any white blood cells in it. It
      is superior to the platelet rich plasma because of reducing the overall inflammatory response
      and pain of the patient during treatment.
