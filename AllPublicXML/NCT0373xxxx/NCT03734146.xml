  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We compared the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise only, resistance exercise only, or a
      combination of both on blood pressure in overweight or obese middle-aged adults with elevated
      blood pressure. Participants engaged in supervised exercise sessions 3 times per week for 60
      minutes each session. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the 8-week intervention.
      Extra-intervention physical activity and diet were also assessed.
