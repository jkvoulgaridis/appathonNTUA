  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to achieve more accurate early classification of diabetes and identification
      of which patients will rapidly require insulin treatment. The investigators will recruit 1200
      participants who have been diagnosed with diabetes in the last year and were aged between 18
      and 50 years at the time of diagnosis. The investigators will recruit an additional cohort of
      800 participants diagnosed after age 50. The investigators will record clinical features and
      biomarkers that may help us to determine diabetes type at diagnosis and follow participants
      for 3 years to assess the development of severe insulin deficiency (measured using C-peptide)
      and insulin requirement. The investigators will assess utility of clinical features and
      additional biomarkers in identifying patients with rapid progression to insulin requirement.
      Findings will be integrated into a freely available clinical prediction models to assist
      classification of diabetes at diagnosis.

      The study is a prospective observational study which will assess the relationship between
      clinical features and biomarkers at diabetes diagnosis and type of diabetes defined by
      endogenous insulin secretion at 3 years diabetes duration.

      The investigators will recruit a prospective cohort of 1200 adults that have been diagnosed
      with diabetes within the previous 1 year and aged between 18 and 50 at the time of diagnosis.
      The investigators will also recruit an additional cohort of 800 participants diagnosed with
      diabetes in the last year aged &gt;50 at diabetes diagnosis, who will be stratified by insulin
      treatment (insulin treated n=400).

      On recruitment into the study, non-fasting (within 1-5 hours of a meal) blood sample will be
      collected for baseline analysis biomarker assessment (serum C-peptide, routine biochemistry,
      Islet autoantibodies (GAD, IA2, ZnT8)) and biobanking. Clinical features will be recorded,
      including weight, height, waist/hip ratio &amp; blood pressure. Participants will be asked to
      provide a home post-meal urine sample for Urinary C-Peptide Creatinine Ratio (UCPCR). At 1
      year and 2 years post recruitment, participants will be contacted by telephone, email or in
      person to record concurrent treatment, hypoglycaemia and health service utilisation.
      Participants will be asked to collect a home post-meal urine sample for Urinary C-Peptide
      /Creatinine Ratio (UCPCR). HbA1c results will be obtained from participants GP practice or
      laboratory records.

      At the end of the study, 3 years post recruitment, a non-fasting blood sample will be
      collected for serum C-peptide, routine biochemistry and stored for future biomarker analysis.
      Weight change, blood pressure, concurrent treatment, hypoglycaemia and health service
      utilisation data will be also be recorded.
