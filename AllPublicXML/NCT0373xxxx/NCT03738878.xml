  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that combined angiotensin receptor
      blockade (ARB)/neprilysin (NEP) inhibition potentiates the effects of exogenous bradykinin,
      substance P, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) on forearm blood flow or endothelial
      tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release compared to ARB alone. A secondary goal is
      to determine if there is an interactive effect of ARB/NEP inhibition and dipeptidyl peptidase
      4 (DPP4) inhibition on responses to these peptides.

      After informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo a screening history and physical
      exam, and anti-hypertensive medications will be withdrawn. During this period, blood pressure
      (BP) will be measured every one to three days.

      After subjects have been off anti-hypertensive medications for three weeks (four for
      spironolactone), they will be randomized to four-week treatment with valsartan 160 mg bid (80
      mg bid for one week, then 160 mg bid) or LCZ696 200 bid (100 mg bid for one week, then 200 mg
      bid) in a double-blind fashion. On the morning of the 28th day of study drug, subjects will
      report to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC) after an overnight fast. Subjects
      will be studied in the supine position in a temperature-controlled room. They will be
      instrumented for intra-arterial infusions. Subjects will be given their last dose of study
      drug. One hour after drug administration, we will measure forearm blood flow (FBF) and give
      bradykinin, substance P, or BNP. Each peptide will be infused in three graded doses for five
      minutes. After administration of all three peptides, subjects will be allowed to rest for an
      hour. Then they will be given a single oral dose of sitagliptin 200 mg and be allowed to rest
      for 90 minutes. We will repeat baseline measurements and the peptide infusions with an
      intervening rest period. The four-week study treatment and protocol will be repeated after a
      three-week washout, until participants complete both arms.
