    <textblock>
      Trial investigates the benefits and harms of Levodopa /Carbidopa 100/25mg compared to placebo
      (given in addition to standardized rehabilitation based on the principles of motor learning)
      and whether there is an association with a patient-relevant enhancement of functional
      recovery in acute ischemic stroke patients. Study participants will be randomized 1:1.

      Trial investigates whether Levodopa/Carbidopa compared to placebo given in addition to
      standardized rehabilitative therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke is associated with

        1. improvements of physical function based on the patient's self-assessment

        2. improvement in patient-self assessed general health aspects, pain, mood, anxiety,
           fatigue and social participation

        3. long-term sustainability of a patient-relevant improvement of motor function

        4. improvement of selective hand and wrist movement

        5. a higher rate of patients walking independently of the help of another person.

        6. less severe impairment

        7. a higher level of activity of daily living

        8. improvements of quality of life (i) better cognitive performance (j) no signals of harms
           (i.e. indications for increased all-cause mortality, recurrent stroke or serious adverse
           events).

    <measure>Between-group difference of scores in the Fugl-Meyer-Motor Assessment (FMMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months +/- 14 days after randomization (= Visit 3)</time_frame>
    <description>FMMA is a stroke-specific impairment index designed to assess motor recovery. Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale (0=cannot perform; 1=performs partially and 2= performs fully). FMMA total scores range from 0 (no movements) to 100 (normal movements) with 66 points for movements of the upper limbs (FMMA-UE) and 34 for those of the lower limbs (FMMA-LE)</description>

    <measure>Change in NIH-Stroke Scale score (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Day 0 (Randomization), 5 weeks after randomization, 3 months +/- 14 days after randomization, 6 months +/- 20 days after randomization and 12 months +/- 30 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>To objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

    <description>Scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.
0 - No symptoms.
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Dead.</description>
