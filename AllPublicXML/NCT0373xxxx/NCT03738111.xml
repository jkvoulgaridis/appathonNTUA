  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1 study. The primary objective is
      to determine the highest dose of TG02 citrate that can safely be given to patients with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults ≥ 18 years of age at screening;

          2. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months;

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 or 1;

          4. Subjects must have histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
             hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and have tumor that is refractory to or progressive
             after sorafenib treatment. Or the subjects are intolerable to sorafenib.

          5. Prior local therapy to tumor (e.g. surgery, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous
             ethanol injection, chemo-embolization, radiotherapy) is allowed provided that there is
             a target lesion not subjected to local therapy and/or disease progression has been
             documented in the target lesion subjected to local therapy. The treatment must be
             completed at least 4 weeks and patient has recovered from all the acute toxicities of
             that treatment.

          6. At least 28 days, or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter), since last systemic
             therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) before the first dosing
             of TG02, and have recovered from any clinically significant toxicity associated with
             such treatment;

          7. HCC subjects must be of Child-Pugh class A (not amenable to or refractory to
             locoregional therapy). Subjects with HCC associated with hepatitis B virus must be
             receiving adequate antiviral therapy.

          8. Must have at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 and evidence of disease
             progression since the last anti-tumor therapy.

          9. Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function:

             White Blood Cells ≥2000/uL Neutrophils ≥1500/uL Platelets ≥75,000/uL Hemoglobin
             ≥9.0g/dL (may have been transfused) Creatinine ≤2mg/dL Aspartate Aminotransferase
             (AST) &lt;5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;5 x upper limit
             of normal (ULN) Bilirubin ≤2 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome, who must
             have total bilirubin &lt;3.0mg/dL) INR ≤1.5

         10. Persistent clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must be ≤ grade
             1.

         11. Ability to take oral medicine.

         12. Negative urine pregnancy test at the time of first dose for women of child bearing
             potential (WOCBP). For men and WOCBP, adequate contraception must be used throughout
             the study. For this study, acceptable methods of contraception include a reliable
             intrauterine device or a spermicide in combination with a barrier method. Hormonal
             forms of birth control (oral, implantable, or injectable) may only be used if combined
             with a barrier method.

         13. Ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent
             and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information, and agree to
             abide by the study restrictions and return for the required assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past liver transplantation.

          2. Uncontrollable hepatic encephalopathy or ascites.

          3. Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III to IV), symptomatic
             ischemia, conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional intervention, and
             myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to first dose.

          4. Screening ECG with a prolonged QTc interval (males: &gt;450ms; females: &gt;470ms) as
             calculated by the Fridericia correction formula despite balancing of electrolytes
             and/or discontinuing any drugs known to prolong QTc interval.

          5. Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (e.g., active systemic infection,
             diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the ability of
             the patient to complete the study.

          6. Symptomatic CNS or brain metastases.

          7. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          8. Prior or second malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer, completed resected
             cervical or prostate cancer (with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of less than or
             equal to 0.1ng/ml), or other cancer for which the subjects has received curative
             therapy at least 3 years prior to study entry.

          9. Patient with pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis or ascites requiring
             paracentesis.

         10. Acute hepatitis.

         11. The subject is receiving an investigational drug, has an investigational device in
             place or has participated in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days
             prior to screening.

         12. Pregnant or nursing.

         13. History of drug abuse and taking drugs (such as marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
             benzodiazepines, amphetamines, barbiturates).

         14. History of addicted to alcohol within 6 months before the study which defines as an
             average weekly intake of greater than 14 units (one unit=17.7ml ethanol, which is
             equivalent to 357ml beer with 5% alcohol content or 44ml spirits with 40% alcohol
             content or 147ml wine with 12% alcohol content).

         15. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigators, should not participate in the
