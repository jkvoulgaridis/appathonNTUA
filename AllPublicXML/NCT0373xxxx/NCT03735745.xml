  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if it is possible to collect tissue, saliva and
      blood samples from patients who are having surgery and send those samples to different labs
      across MUSC. The researchers in these labs will collect tissue, blood and saliva samples
      before surgery and during surgery to see if there are any changes in the samples. They will
      compare the changes in the samples to the clinical outcomes. Patients will also be given
      surveys to evaluate patient preferences, anxiety/distress, symptom severity, support by HPV
      status.

      The primary objective of this exploratory, proof of concept study is to facilitate
      translational science spanning clinicians and basic scientists to obtain tissue samples, PDX
      models, and clinical data in order to successfully analyze tissue linked to clinical outcomes
      in head and neck cancer, resulting in the methodological and statistical framework for a
      larger scale clinical trial in the future. While the incidence of HNSCC has been steadily
      decreasing over the last thirty years, the incidence and prevalence of oropharyngeal cancer
      squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and young patients with oral tongue cancer has increased in
      the face of an overall decline in smoking prevalence. Over the past few years, evidence has
      emerged that oropharyngeal cancer is rising in incidence so rapidly that it has been
      described as an &quot;epidemic&quot; and that it has or soon will surpass cervical cancer in both
      incidence and mortality. In fact, over 30,000 patients will be diagnosed with oropharyngeal
      cancer in the US per year, making it the most rapidly rising head and neck cancer in
      incidence. Despite this unique etiopathogenesis, treatment and toxicities related to
      treatment have not changed. This collaboration and interdisciplinary study will be the first
      of its kind to address these important issues of cancer site, HPV status, tobacco history,
      gender, age, and race using both patient tissue and PDX models to identify novel and unique
      biomarkers. Also, innate to this project is the link between five separate laboratories each
      conducting unique biomarker analysis.
