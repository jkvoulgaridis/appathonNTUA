  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study to assess the safety and tolerability of oral xanthohumol in humans, to
      identify a biological signature of xanthohumol exposure, and to characterize the role of
      xanthohumol metabolism by intestinal microorganisms in that signature.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-masked, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial of xanthohumol, which
      is a constituent of hops (Humulus lupulus). Hops and its constituents have a long history of
      use for a variety of conditions. However, knowledge is limited regarding the measurable
      biological markers of human exposure, and the role of xanthohumol metabolism by
      microorganisms present in the gut. This information is necessary for the development of
      xanthohumol as a potential therapeutic intervention in conditions such as inflammatory bowel
      disease.

    <masking_description>Randomization will occur in up to 8 blocks of 4 based on biological sex. Initial randomization series will be generated using readily available random sequence generators designed to do so. A series of sequential envelopes will be generated, each containing the allocation for one participant. Envelopes will be opaque and signed across the seal. The randomization &quot;code&quot; will be kept in a sealed envelope with a signature across the label and dated the day of creation. Study product and comparator (placebo) will be compounded and placed in identical opaque capsules outside the institution.</masking_description>
