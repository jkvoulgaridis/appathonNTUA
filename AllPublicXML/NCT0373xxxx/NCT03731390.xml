    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical study for evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary
      efficacy of repeated doses, dose escalation of GR1405 injection in patients with advanced
      solid tumor or lymphoma
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of GR1405
      injection monotherapy in an open, non-controlled, escalating trial design in patients with
      advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. Four dose levels (3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 30
      mg/kg) were evaluated at this stage.
