  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Asthma affects nearly 10% of American children, and is a leading cause of pediatric emergency
      visits and hospitalizations. Clinical pathways are operational versions of practice
      guidelines aimed at the hospital management of common illnesses. Single-site studies of
      pediatric asthma pathways have shown significant improvements in quality of care.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effectiveness of clinical pathways for improving quality of care for children
      with asthma in a diverse, national sample of emergency department (ED) and hospital settings.

      Primary Endpoints:

        1. Emergency Department: The proportion of eligible children who receive systemic steroids
           within 60 minutes of ED arrival

        2. Inpatient/Hospital: Mean length of hospital stay

      Study Design:

      This project will be implemented through an established quality improvement collaborative of
      hospitals across the United States, the Value in Inpatient Pediatrics Network (part of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics). A cluster randomized design will be employed. Group 1
      hospitals will receive a multifaceted implementation strategy that includes: 1) a pathway
      implementation toolkit, 2) local multidisciplinary champions in the ED and inpatient
      settings, 3) audit and feedback, 4) educational seminars, and 5) practice facilitation (via
      teleconference). Group 2 will receive the same intervention with the addition of a mobile app
      pathway tool.
