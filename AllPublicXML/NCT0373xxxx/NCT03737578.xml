  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to describe the characteristics of patients on daily home
      hemodialysis and to confirm in real practice in France the effectiveness shown in studies,
      mainly American, both in terms of clinical outcomes and quality of life. Due to the few
      studies available in this population, the focus will be particularly on physical activity.

      Primary objective :

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the physical activity in the daily life of
      patients in daily hemodialysis in comparison with patients treated 3 times a week
      (conventional hemodialysis) others objectives are also:

        1. To describe the characteristics of daily hemodialysis patients;

        2. To describe the prescription procedures of the home daily HD;

        3. To compare the evolution of the blood pressure between the 2 modalities of hemodialysis;

        4. To compare the frequency of hospitalizations, duration and hospitalization reasons
           between the 2 hemodialysis modalities;

        5. To compare the quality of life of the patients between the 2 modalities ;

        6. To evaluate the quality of the sleep of the patients between the 2 modalities ;

        7. Compare the percentage of patients with restless leg syndrome (RLS) and the severity of
           RLS between the two modalities;

        8. Compare the evolution of drug intake between the two modalities;

        9. Evaluate the number of abandoning subjects and causes of discontinuation of HQD;
