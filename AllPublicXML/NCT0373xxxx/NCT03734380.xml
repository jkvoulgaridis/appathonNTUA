      This study will establish a machine-learning algorithm to predict KAM using IMU sensors
      during stair ascent and descent; and then conduct a three-arm randomized controlled trial to
      compare the biomechanical and clinical difference between patients receiving a course of
      conventional laboratory-based stair retraining, sensor-based stair retraining, and walking
      exercise control (i.e., walking exercise without gait retraining). The investigators
      hypothesise that the wearable IMUs will accurately predict KAM during stair negotiation using
      machine-learning algorithm, with at least 80% measurement agreement with conventional
      calculation of KAM. The investigators also hypothesise that patients randomized to the
      laboratory-based and sensor-based stair retraining conditions would evidence similar (i.e.,
      weak and non-significant differences) reduction in KAM (primary outcome) and an improvement
      of symptoms (secondary outcomes), but that these subjects would evidence larger reductions in
      KAM than subjects assigned to the walking exercise control condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventionally, gait retraining is necessarily implemented in a laboratory environment
      because evaluation of biomechanical markers, such as KAM, requires sophisticated motion
      capturing system and force plates. With advancement of wearable sensor technology, it is
      possible to measure gait biomechanics and provide real time biofeedback for gait retraining
      using inertial measurement unit (IMU), which is a lightweight and portable wireless device.
      In an ongoing government funded project, the investigators have developed IMU embedded
      footwear that measures KAM during level ground walking. The investigators have compared Least
      Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and Random Forest in the
      prediction of KAM from IMU recordings. The investigators found that Random Forest could
      provide much higher KAM prediction accuracy than LASSO regression. The agreement between
      conventional laboratory-based and sensor-based measurement of KAM was approximately 90%.
      Based on investigators' previous research work, it is meaningful to extend the newly
      developed technology for KAM measurement during stair ascent and descent without the use of
      laboratory equipment. With the wearable sensors connected to the smartphones, gait retraining
      outside laboratory environment will become feasible but the effects of gait retraining using
      wearable sensors have not been directly verified.

      Given these considerations, this project has two primary aims. The investigators will: (1)
      first establish a machine-learning algorithm to predict KAM using IMU sensors during stair
      ascent and descent; and then (2) conduct a three-arm randomized controlled trial to compare
      the biomechanical and clinical difference between patients receiving a course of conventional
      laboratory-based stair retraining, sensor-based stair retraining, and walking exercise
      control (i.e., walking exercise without gait retraining).

      Primary hypothesis

      Hypothesis 1: The wearable IMUs will accurately predict KAM during stair negotiation using
      machine-learning algorithm, with at least 80% measurement agreement with conventional
      calculation of KAM.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients randomized to the laboratory-based and sensor-based stair retraining
      conditions would evidence similar (i.e., weak and non-significant differences) reduction in
      KAM (primary outcome) and an improvement of symptoms (secondary outcomes), but that these
      subjects would evidence larger reductions in KAM than subjects assigned to the walking
      exercise control condition.

    <description>The surrogate marker of the medial compartment knee joint loading (i.e. KAM) will be measured by a 10-camera motion capture system (Vicon, Oxford Metrics Group, Oxford, UK) at 100 Hz and an instrumented staircase equipped with two force plates (Bertec, Columbus, OH, USA) at 1000Hz during stair ascent and descent at baseline assessment and after 6-week stair retraining.</description>

    <measure>Change in Chinese Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) will be used to assess knee pain, symptoms and physical function of the patients before and after stair retraining. This instrument contains 42 items addressing pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sports and recreational function, and knee-related quality of life. The total score and sub-score for each domain (pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sports/ recreational function, and knee-related quality of life) will be normalized from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the worst possible state, 0 indicating no pain or loss of function.</description>

    <description>The validated visual analogue scale (VAS) of 100 mm will be used to assess overall knee pain level after each stair negotiation session, with 0 mm at the left-most end of the 100 mm scale indicating&quot;No pain at all&quot; and 100 mm at the right-most end indicating&quot;Worst imaginable pain&quot;.</description>

    <description>Subjects will attend 6 weekly sessions of stair ascent and descent exercise over six consecutive weeks. In each session, they walk at a self-selected speed on the instrumented staircase. The training time will be progressively increased from 15 to 30 minutes over the six sessions. The auditory feedback will be gradually removed in the last three sessions.</description>

    <description>Subjects will attend 6 weekly sessions of stair ascent and descent exercise over six consecutive weeks.

    <description>Subjects in the LGR group will be encouraged to modify the gait pattern (e.g. adjusting foot progression angle, performing medial knee thrust, and/or lateral trunk lean) to lower their KAM to 80% of respective average baseline KAM obtained during normal unmodified gait. Real-time auditory feedback will be delivered using stereo speakers from both sides of the staircase. A middle C (261.6 Hz) tone and a high-pitched C (4186.0 Hz) of equal intensity will be generated at a footfall below and above the targeted 80% value, respectively. They will be advised to maintain their new gait pattern during their daily living after training.</description>
