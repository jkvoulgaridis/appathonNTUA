    <measure>10-centimeter Visual Analogue Scale assessing intensity of dyspareunia and dryness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1 month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is a straight line with 2 endpoints &quot;0&quot; and &quot;10&quot;. Zero defines &quot;no dyspareunia at all&quot; and &quot;no dryness at all&quot; , while 10 &quot;dyspareunia as bad as it could be&quot; and &quot;dryness as bad as it could be&quot;. Participants will draw a line at or between the 2 end points. The distance between zero and drawn line will define the intensity of dyspareunia and dryness</description>

    <measure>Day-to Day Impact of vaginal aging questionnaire (DIVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1 month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It includes 4 domains: activities of daily living (5 items), sexual functioning (5 items), emotional well-being (4 items), self-concept and body image (5-items). Each item of each domain could receive values from 0 to 4. Mean scores are calculated on each of the domain scales. Higher scores indicate greater symptom impact</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients Global Impression of Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is a single item questionnaire assessing the impression of participants following the intervention</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10-centimeter Visual Analogue Scale assessing intensity of itching, burning and dysuria</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1 month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is a straight line with 2 endpoints &quot;0&quot; and &quot;10&quot;. Zero defines &quot;no symptom (itching, burning and dysuria) at all&quot; , while 10 &quot;symptom (itching, burning and dysuria) as bad as it could be&quot;. Participants will draw a line at or between the 2 end points. The distance between zero and drawn line will define the intensity of itching, burning and dysuria</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1 month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It has 3 sections: 1) general health and overall health related to urinary symptoms with 2 questions, 2) incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal limitations, emotions, sleep and energy, and severity coping measures with 19 questions and 3) bother or impact of urinary symptoms with 11 questions. Scores of each domain of the 2 sections range from 0 to 100. Scores of the third section range from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicate higher impact of urinary incontinence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Female Sexual Function Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1 month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire defining women's sexual function. It includes 6 domains: desire, arousal, orgasm, lubrication, satisfaction and pain. The answer of each Question in each domain are multiplied by a certain factor. Total score is calculated by summing the scores of the all domains with a minimum value of 2 and a maximum of 36. The highest the total score the better is the sexual functioning. Total score above 26.55 defines normal sexual function</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vaginal Maturation Value</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is calculated by defining the percentage of superficial, intermediate and parabasal epithelial cells on the vaginal pap smear, following the formula (1x%superficial)+(0.5x%intermediate)+(0x%parabasal). It may receive values from 0 to 100%.It is considered to be an indicator of the estrogenic stimulation, whereas values of 0-49%, 50-64% and 65-100% indicate absent/low, moderate and high estrogenic effect on the vaginal epithelium, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vaginal Health Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It evaluates vaginal elasticity, fluid volume, ph of vaginal fluid, epithelial integrity and moisture. Each one of these may receive scores from 1 to 5. Total score is calculated by summing the 5 scores ranging from 5 to 25. Higher scores indicate better vaginal status.</description>
