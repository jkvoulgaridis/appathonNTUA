    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate high frequency ultrasound as a future modality
      for the diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS). The results of the
      ultrasound will help determine if there are any significant radiologic findings or patterns
      seen in patients with CECS.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate high frequency ultrasound as a future modality
      for the diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS). The results of the
      ultrasound will help determine if there are any significant radiologic findings or patterns
      seen in patients with CECS. Evaluation of ultrasonographic findings will be dependent on
      tissue density as measured by hypoechoic versus hyperechoic signal as well as muscle
      compartment thickness at its largest dimension. A specific aim for this study would be to
      facilitate future research in order to eliminate the need for painful and invasive diagnostic
      techniques for CECS.

    <description>Patients who present with symptoms of CECS will be consented and tested per protocol with compartment pressure testing. Concurrently, patients will undergo a high frequency ultrasound to observe any patterns in structure to assist future research in noninvasively diagnosing CECS. Evaluation of ultrasonographic findings will be dependent on tissue density as measured by hypoechoic versus hyperechoic signal as well as muscle compartment thickness at its largest dimension.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female ages 13 and over

          -  Patients with any combination of the following symptoms who would otherwise be
             evaluated for CECS:

          -  Symptoms of leg pain worsened with activity and relieved by rest

          -  Pain that is generalized in the anterior or lateral compartments of lower leg

          -  Numbness or tingling in the distribution of the superficial peroneal nerve

          -  Sensation of &quot;slap foot&quot; or anterior/lateral compartment weakness

          -  Able to exercise for CPT testing: Patients will be asked to go through a standardized
             warm up on a treadmill with increasing speed and incline settings until symptoms are
             achieved. They will maintain exercise for a minimum of five minutes or to patient
             tolerance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known vascular disease

          -  Neurogenic or radicular symptoms
