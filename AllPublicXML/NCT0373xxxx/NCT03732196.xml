  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the reproducibility and relative validity of a
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess food group consumption and
      nutrient intake for Chinese pregnant women in Hong Kong.

      A total of 100 apparently healthy pregnant women aged 18 or above and with gestational age of
      at least 5 weeks willl be recruited from the antenatal clinic of the Prince of Wales
      Hospital. The research staff will check for eligible subjects, explain study details and
      invite them to join the study. Written consent will be obtained from all subjects. Various
      maternal data will be collected using standardized methods and questionnaires, and retrieved
      from the hospital record.

      Each participant will be asked to complete the FFQ twice within 3 to 4 weeks interval (for
      reproducibility evaluation), and three 24-hour food recalls in between the two
      administrations of the FFQ as a reference method to validate the FFQ (for validity
      evaluation). The three 24-hour food recalls will include two weekdays and one weekend day. On
      the interview day in which the 1st FFQ is administrated (FFQ1), each participant will be
      explained by trained research staff on how to complete the FFQ by herself with the provision
      of the food portion booklet. Each participant will be asked to complete the 1st FFQ regarding
      her intake of various food groups over the past month. The frequency of food group intake
      will be reported per day, week or month, and portions will be reported based on standard
      referent portion sizes, as pieces, glasses, cups, spoons, centilitres or grams. Data on use
      of supplements will be collected by asking subjects to specify the brand, the frequency, and
      the dosage of supplements used. On the same interview day, participant will also be asked by
      trained research staff to recall all foods and beverages that have been consumed over the
      past 24 hours. Food photo albums and eating utensils of standardized portions will be
      displayed to help recall. The 2nd administration of the FFQ (FFQ2) will be done 3 to 4 weeks
      after the 1st administration of the FFQ. The FFQ2 and the food portion booklet as well as the
      additional 24-hour recall forms will be given to the participants by email or post within 3
      to 4 weeks after the 1st administration of the FFQ (FFQ1). Between the intervals of two FFQs,
      the research staff will give phone call to the participant on two separate days to complete
      two more 24-hour food recalls for validity evaluation purpose. Daily dietary and nutrient
      intake collected by both FFQs and 24-hour recalls will be entered and calculated using the
      nutrition analysis software Food Processor Nutrition analysis and Fitness software version
      8.0 (ESHA Research, Salem, USA) including local foods selected from food composition tables
      from China and Hong Kong.
