  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this multicentre cohort study is to provide evidence that can be used to
      improve continuity and quality in rehabilitation practice and rehabilitation processes across
      health care levels for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to develop rehabilitation trajectories that ensure coordination and
      communication between health care levels, support of self-management and self-monitoring, and
      follow-up tailored to patients' needs. Such trajectories should be based on evidence from
      current practice. The &quot;Rehabilitation trajectories&quot; project will systematically explore and
      describe current practice of planned and implemented follow-up and self-management strategies
      in primary health care during the first year after rehabilitation for patients with
      musculoskeletal diseases. Further, a newly developed core set of PROMs designed for
      evaluation of rehabilitation in RMDs and a self-monitoring web-based system will be tested
      for feasibility. Knowledge of patients' experiences and use of this self-monitoring system as
      a self-management and communication tool is needed in order to improve and integrate such
      e-technology in future care.

      The Rehabilitation Trajectory study is a multi-centre study, led by the National Unit on
      Rehabilitation in Rheumatology and including participants at four rheumatology hospital
      departments and five specialized rehabilitation institutions. Participants will thus be
      included from all four health regions in Norway.

      The study has five points of assessment. In an electronic portal, delivered by CheckWare,
      patients will log in with their Bank ID and complete the core set of PROMs at admission,
      discharge, and 4, 8 and 12 months following discharge.
