  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of massage chairs is becoming more popular in many countries. According to the
      previous reports, some manual massages have positive effects on the mood, pain, fatigue, and
      sleep quality. However, the clinical benefits of the massage chair have not been fully
      understood. In this trial, it is aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the 6-month
      regular use of massage chair twice a day. It is hypothesized that long-term regular use of
      massage chair has positive effects on the hormonal level related to the stress, inflammation,
      and aging, as well as physical, psychologic, and muscle quality.
