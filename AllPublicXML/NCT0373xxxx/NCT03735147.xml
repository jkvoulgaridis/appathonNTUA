  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LAIV shedding studies in children could be an important way to confirm whether impediments to
      viral replication do indeed explain these observed reductions in vaccine effectiveness (VE),
      whether prior vaccination has any influence on replication and what future implications (if
      any) this might have for the UK paediatric LAIV programme. LAIV virus replication in children
      will be dependent on virological and host factors. The virus factors include replicative
      fitness of individual strains and the susceptibility to inhibition by other replicating
      strains (ability to compete). Host factors which may influence this include pre-existing
      specific immunity as a result of prior infection or previous vaccination (with either LAIV or
      IIV), and innate immune factors including mucosal immunity.

      There is significant variability in shedding across viral subtypes in studies done to date,
      so there is a need to obtain local data in a small pilot observational study which will look
      in detail at virus shedding by sequential daily virus samples, something not possible on a
      larger scale. The data generated will inform future LAIV studies in the UK in terms of
      optimum time of sample collection for viral shedding studies, which are likely to be required
      on a regular basis, to supplement field studies of vaccine effectiveness.

      This study will enrol up to 30 children that will allow these factors to be assessed. Both
      written informed consent from parent/ guardian and written assent from the child will be in
      place prior to any study procedure. All participants will have a baseline assessment of
      pre--existing influenza immunity (blood test, oral fluid collection and nasal swabs),
      followed by a single dose of LAIV. Parents will then be asked to take nasal swabs at home on
      days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, with further nasal swab, blood test and oral fluid collection in
      hospital 4 weeks later, in order to assess for immune responses to LAIV.

          -  Children age 6 years to 15 years +364 days of age on enrolment

          -  Children eligible to receive LAIV in accordance with current UK vaccine policy

          -  Written informed consent given by parent/ guardian and assent from child
