    <description>The Conformis Hip System is an FDA cleared, uncemented, primary total hip replacement device composed of femoral and acetabular components. The system incorporates the use of a pre-operative CT scan to design patient-specific implants and instruments. Using patient imaging (CT scan), a patient-specific implant is designed that best meets the geometric and anatomic requirements of the specific patient.</description>
