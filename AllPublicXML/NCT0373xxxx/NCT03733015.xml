    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to assess whether repeated sessions of repetitive
      trancranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex main
      boost the pain thresholds.

    <textblock>
      Pain is the largest health-related burden on society and, despite many decades of pain
      research, there are still few effective treatments. Since pain experience is a construct of
      the central nervous system (CNS), chronic pain has been recently thought to be a CNS
      disorder.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, non-invasive technique for
      cerebral cortex stimulation and the clinical applications of which have expanded considerably
      in recent years. Recent studies have been shown that 'classical' rTMS to different cortical
      areas temporary reduce chronic and acute pain, suggesting that rTMS may ´have some clinical
      application in future management of chronic pain. However, new rTMS paradigms involving theta
      burst stimulation (TBS) have recently been described with the major clinical advantage to be
      much shorter than 'classical' rTMS. The investigators hypothesize that cTBS would yield
      analgesic effects similar to or, possibly, even stronger than those produced by 'classical'
      rTMS. The investigators will carry out a sham-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover
      study in healthy volunteers, to compare the analgesic effects of two rTMS protocols over
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: classical high-frequency rTMS (10 Hz), and TBS. As
      rTMS-induced analgesia may be dependent on changes in pain modulatory systems, the
      investigators will analyze the effects of the stimulation on conditioned pain modulation
      (CPM). More specifically, the investigators will compare the effects of multiple sessions of
      rTMS on the inhibition of a test experimental stimulus induced by heterotopic noxious
      stimuli, to assess possible changes in diffuse noxious inhibitory controls.

    <description>Pressure will be applied at a rate of 30 kPa/s perpendicularly to the surface of the skin using a handheld algometer (1-cm2 probe; Somedic, Hörby, Sweden). Three readings at the pressure pain threshold (PPT) will be made at 1-minute intervals, at four sites; i) right elbow, ii) left elbow, iii) right leg and iv) left leg. The data will be reported in kPa.</description>

    <description>The temperature of the thermode is slowly decreased or increased to the maximum tolerable levels. The participant will click a button as soon as the tolerable level has been reached, which will bring the temperature back to baseline 32 degrees Celsius. Thresholds are determined by raising or dropping the temperature slowly from baseline skin temperature until the participant reports feeling of pain. The experimenter will then determine the temperature that is consistently rated as moderately painful by applying a temperature above the threshold level and asking the participant to rate the pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most intense pain imaginable).</description>

    <description>First, the volunteers will immerse the left hand in a bucket with water and ice at 4° C for around 45-60 seconds to reach a VAS pain of 60—70/100mm. Immediately after, supra-thresholds painful stimuli over the right leg will be repeated in a randomized order. The supra-thresholds painful stimuli will be reported in a VAS scale (from 0 to 10).</description>

    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to stimulate small regions of the brain. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator, or &quot;coil&quot;, is placed near the head of the person receiving the treatment. TBS refers to a rTMS protocol where pulses are applied in bursts of three, delivered at a frequency of 50 Hz and an inter-burst interval of 200 ms (5 Hz).</description>
