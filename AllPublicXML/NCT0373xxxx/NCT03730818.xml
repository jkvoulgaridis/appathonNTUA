  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and exercise have demonstrated to be an integral part of the
      cancer-continuum care. Despite strong evidence suggesting that both endurance and strength
      training should be encourage in cancer patients, there is still controversy regarding
      exercise dosage, frequency, volume and optimal environment of delivery. In this randomised
      controlled trial we aim to compare water-based versus land-based exercise in breast cancer
      survivors to decrease cancer-related fatigue (CRF), improve Health-Related Quality of Life
      (HRQoL), exercise tolerance, muscle strength and physical activity levels.

    <description>The Water-based Exercise Group will compromise participants attending a 2 weekly exercise intervention each session lasting 1 hour for 12 weeks.
Each session will consist of:
10 minutes of warm-up: general mobilisation, walking, active stretching
40 minutes of global training: 20 minutes of endurance exercise and 20 minutes of resistance exercises targeting large main muscle groups involved in daily life activities (squats, lateral hip abduction, row, etc.) using body weight and elastic bands
10 minutes of cooling down: stretching, breathing exercises and relaxation Intensity will be monitored with the modified Borg Scale to maintain a 5 - 6 level of exertion during the first 5 weeks and progressively increase to a 6 - 7 level for the following weeks.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Land-based Exercise Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The land-based exercise group will attend as well 2 weekly sessions lasting 1 hour each for 12 weeks.
Each session will consist of the same structure as the Water-based Exercise Group including:
10 minutes warm up
40 minutes of global training (20 minutes of endurance exercise and 20 minutes of resistance training)
10 minutes cool down. The exercises will be adapted from the water-based exercise group to match the requirements on the water-based exercise group. Intensity will be monitored with the Perceived Rate of Exertion Scale (modified Borg Scale, Borg 1982) to maintain a 5 - 6 level of exertion during the first 5 weeks and progressively increase to a 6 - 7 level for the following weeks.</description>
