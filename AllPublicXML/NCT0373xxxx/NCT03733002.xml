  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AngongNiuhuang pill has obvious effects on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, especially
      the cerebral vessels. Pharmacological experiments confirmed that AngongNiuhuang pill can
      protect blood-brain barrier, reduce capillary permeability, improve the tolerance of cerebral
      ischemia and hypoxia, improve oxidative stress injury, thus protecting brain tissue. Clinical
      studies have also confirmed that AngongNiuhuang pill can increase the GCS score, reduce coma,
      improve nerve function defect and promote nerve function recovery. The primary purpose of
      this trial was to evaluate the effect of AngongNiuhuang pill and placebo on the improvement
      of life function in patients with ischemic stroke at 90 days in acute phase.

    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo parallel controlled,
      multiple-center trial. A total of approximately 100 patients (18 years ≤age ≤80 years) within
      24 hours of symptom onset of acute ischemic stroke, who shows NIHSS from 5-20 points.
      Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 into two groups after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive
      AngongNiuhuang pill 1 pill 1 times/day for 5-day; 2) the other group will receive Placebo of
      AngongNiuhuang pill 1 pill 1 times/day for 5-day.The primary purpose of this trial was to
      evaluate the effect of AngongNiuhuang pill and placebo on the improvement of life function in
      patients with ischemic stroke at 90 days in acute phase. The study consists of five visits
      including the day of randomization, 2-6 days, monitor daily temperature, 7 days when the
      therapy is done, 30 days, and 90 days when the follow-up is finished. Demographic
      information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment neurological
      function rating scale will be recorded during the program. The improvement of life function
      will be assessed by Modified Rankin Scale(namely score=0-2). The trial is anticipated to last
      from July 2018 to December 2019 with 100 subjects recruited form 5 centers in China. All the
      related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and
      Chinese GCP standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety
      during the study.
