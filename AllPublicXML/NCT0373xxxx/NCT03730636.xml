  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of antibiotic (ATB) therapy in late onset sepsis (LOS) of the neonate is
      currently not based on scientific data. The current PROABIS trial will study the use of a
      biological marker, procalcitonin (PCT), to guide ATB therapy duration in neonates with LOS.

      Our hypothesis is that the use of procalcitonin guidance can reduce of 30% the duration of
      ATB treatment without increasing recurrence of infection and mortality.

      Randomized controlled multicenter open trial comparing the efficacy of PCT guided strategy
      (superiority aspect) and safety (non-inferiority aspect) versus usual strategy in LOS of the
      neonate.

      After inclusion, patients are randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to duration of ATB therapy
      according to PCT guidance (experimental group) or to standard of care (control group).

      Experimental group:

      For patients randomly assigned in the PCT-guided group, a PCT concentration is measured at D0
      (randomisation), at D2 and then, every two days until PCT value is equal or below 0.5 ng/mL.

      The physician in charge of the neonate will be strongly encouraged to stop ATB treatment as
      soon as the PCT value is equal or below 0.5 ng/mL.

      Control group:

      In the control group, management of LOS and treatment are based on the attending clinician's
      practice and according to the usual practice (No PCT dosage).

      In both groups data will be collected at the follow-up visit (day 14±2 after randomization)
      or the day of discharge from the hospital (if before 14±2 days) and at the end of the study
      visit (day 28± 2 after randomization) In case of transfer to another service or hospital or
      known re hospitalization before day28, outcomes will be collected from the service receiving
      the patient.

      A phone call will be made to the parents, only in case of discharge before 28 days. following
      randomization. This phone call will be made 28± 2 days after randomization to identify
      adverse outcomes.
