      This is a single site, open-label, randomized, single-dose, Phase 1 study in post-menopausal
      women.

    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of progesterone in
      post-menopausal women after the insertion of a vaginal ring containing 2.0 g of progesterone.
      Progesterone is slowly released from the ring within 90 days (sustained-release). Study
      participants will use the vaginal ring for a period of 91 days (13 weeks).

      Progesterone blood concentrations will be determined during the use of the vaginal ring and
      after removal of the vaginal ring after a period of use of 13 weeks. In subgroups of
      participants, progesterone blood concentrations will also be determined after removal of the
      ring for a period of 2 hours or 4 hours on Day 28 of use. A study participant has completed
      the study when the final evaluation takes place, which is 7-15 days after removal of the
      vaginal ring on Day 91.

      The safety of the progesterone vaginal ring will be assessed based on the adverse events
      reported.
