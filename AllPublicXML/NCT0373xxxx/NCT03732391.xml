    <textblock>
      This is a prospective two-stage single arm phase II study to be conducted in conformance with
      Good Clinical Practices.

      This study will enrol 53 patients, based on a two steps Simon's design.

      Patients will entry into the study if the following conditions will be satisfied:

        -  BRCA1/2 germline mutations.

        -  Metastatic disease with measurable lesions will be evaluated by computed tomography or
           by PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan.

        -  Patients must have received anthracycline and taxanes before entry into the study.

      Patients will be treated with Carboplatin AUC6 (Area Under The Curve) EV (endovenous) every 3
      weeks in combination with Pembrolizumab 200 mg EV every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Afterwards, the
      Pembrolizumab will recontinued with the same schedule until unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      The primary endpoint will be Objective Responses Rate (ORR) (complete answers + partial
      answers) evaluated according to the RECIST criteria.

             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         13. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception as outlined in Section 5.111.2 - Contraception, for the course of the
             study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.

             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
             contraception for the subject.

         14. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception as outlined in Section 5.11.2- Contraception, starting with the first
             dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception
        for the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             treatment.

          4. Has a known history of active Bacillus Tuberculosis

          5. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          6. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

          8. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         16. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed cell Death-1),
             anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

             (Hepatitis C Virus) RNA [qualitative] is detected).

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
