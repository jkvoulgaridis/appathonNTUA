      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib Combined With
      Paclitaxel and Carbopatin Intensive Regimen in Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced
      Triple-negative Breast patients

    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the characteristics of early onset, high malignancy,
      less treatment, and resistance to treatment. Advanced patients have shorter survival than
      other subtypes. Changes in traditional chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer (ie, the
      addition of carboplatin) are potential ways to improve patient outcomes. Although
      anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide play a very positive role in the treatment of breast
      cancer, there are also small and serious long-term risks. Anti-angiogenic drugs are currently
      one of the few targeted therapies that have achieved some efficacy in TNBC. Apatinib, a
      targeted inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), shows significant antitumor activity in the
      patients with breast cancer. Considering of current status of anti-angiogenic drugs in the
      field of breast cancer, results of apatinib in advanced breast cancer, and current unmet
      clinical needs, the investigator conducted this study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      Apatinib Combined With Paclitaxel and Carbopatin Intensive Regimen in Neoadjuvant Therapy for
      Locally Advanced Triple-negative Breast patients
