  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to reveal the role of inspiratory muscles exercise using Inspiratory Muscle
      Trainer (IMT), which is a form of weight training. The pre- and post study of this experiment
      were conducted in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outpatient clinic during the
      period of September 2017 until April 2018. Patients were recruited by consecutive sampling.
      Inclusion criteria were stable COPD patient with The Global Initiative for Chronic
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria A-D, who has never received prior exercise for
      pulmonary rehabilitation, and willing to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria
      included any problem with extremities and cardiovascular disease. Patients underwent an
      interview about their medical history, tested spirometry using CareFusion®, and the
      inspiratory muscle strength was assessed using Micro RPM CareFusion®. The St George
      Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was used to assess the health status and the 6-Minute
      Walking Test (6MWT) was conducted to assess functional capacity. Subject exercised using
      inspiratory muscle trainer (Philips Respironic®) for eight weeks.

      Intervention is given using Inspiratory Muscle Trainer Philips Respironic®. Impact on
      inspiratory muscles strength, health status, and functional capacity are observed. Muscle
      strength is evaluated using Micro RPM (Respiratory Pressure Meter) Carefusion®. Health status
      is evaluated using St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), while functional capacity
      is evaluated by the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT).

      Patients were recruited by consecutive sampling. This study was granted ethical approval from
      the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia
      Subjects exercised using inspiratory muscle trainer (Philips Respironic®) for 8 weeks.
      Inspiratory muscles strength (Maximal Inspiratory Pressure, MIP) and 6MWT were done at the
      beginning for basic data and were re-evaluated during the second, fourth, sixth and eighth
      week (last week). Questionnaire (SGRQ) was done at the initial and end of research.

      Training dose with IMT was determined by inspiratory muscle strength result and adjusted in
      every evaluation visit. The subject was expected to do exercise twice daily for 15 minutes
      each session with 30-70% intensity from determined MIP score. Exercise is monitored and noted
      in a logbook.

    <description>Health status was evaluated using St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) SGRQ was a questionnaire designed to measure health impairment in asthmatic and COPD patients. It consists of three parts. First part is symptom, followed by activity and impact. Every question has its own score. The least is zero and the highest is 100. Score is calculated by dividing total score with maximum score for that component and translated into percentage.</description>
