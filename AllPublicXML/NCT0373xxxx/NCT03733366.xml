  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the suitability of different types of desk surfaces. The
      investigators will test 10 different surfaces (oak-ruff, oak-varnished, oak-oiled,
      spruce-ruff, spruce-varnished, spruce-oiled, particleboard laminate, particleboard veneer,
      corian and glass). Firstly, the investigators will perform tests to assess physical
      characteristics of the materials (thermal conductivity, hardness, roughness, skid measures).
      Secondly, the investigators will measure the participants' forearm skin temperature after
      20-minutes of using each desk surface. During those 20 minutes the participants will solve an
      attention test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People are surrounded by objects that are made of different materials. These materials should
      be carefully chosen, especially the ones that are in direct contact with user's skin. Office
      workers are constantly in contact with desk surface (while reading, typing, filling in forms,
      etc.). Therefore, it is important that the material of desk surface is suitable and properly
      chosen. It should be both functional and aesthetic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      suitability of different desk surfaces for sedentary workers. The investigators will test 10
      different surfaces (oak-ruff, oak-varnished, oak-oiled, spruce-ruff, spruce-varnished,
      spruce-oiled, particleboard laminate, particleboard veneer, corian and glass). All surfaces
      will be square shaped (800x800 mm). Firstly, the investigators will perform tests to assess
      physical characteristics of the materials (thermal conductivity, hardness, roughness, skid
      measures). Secondly, the investigators will measure the participants' forearm skin
      temperature after 20-minutes of desk use. Every participant will test all 10 sample desk
      surfaces (cross-over design). The investigators will use thermal IR camera to measure the
      temperature of participant's skin surface. The investigators will measure the temperature
      before and after the contact with desk surface. During those 20 minutes the participant will
      solve an attention test to assess the impact of different materials on attention. At the end,
      the participants will answer a questionnaire about the suitability of the material.

    <measure>Change of the skin temperature measured on forearm</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning and after 20 minutes of using desk surface</time_frame>
    <description>Skin temperature in the forearm will be measured with Infrared thermal camera. Thermal camera is suitable for the measurements since it is a reliable tool for measuring skin temperature. The temperature is presented in Celsius degrees. Moreover, thermal camera provides a thermal picture indicating temperature distribution in the space.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention test</measure>
    <time_frame>180 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The attention test will be performed on computer. On the computer screen letters P and R will appear. Each time the letter R appears the participant will have to click ''space''. If a letter P appears the participant should not react.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Mood and feelings questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>180 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of two questions. One is asking the participant about their current mood. The second question is asking the participant about their current arousal. The participant answers both questions using a 9-level scale (1 meaning not at all and 9 meaning very much). There is no total value of the questionnaire. Also, higher or lower values do not represent better or worse outcome.</description>
