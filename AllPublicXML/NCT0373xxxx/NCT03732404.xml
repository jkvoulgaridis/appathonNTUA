  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative carbohydrate treatments have been widely adopted as part of enhanced recovery
      after surgery (ERAS) or fast‐track surgery protocols. Although fast‐track surgery protocols
      have been widely investigated and have been shown to be associated with improved
      postoperative outcomes, some individual constituents of these protocols, including
      preoperative carbohydrate treatment, have not been subject to such robust analysis.

      Carbohydrate (sugar‐containing) nutritional supplements have become a routine part of the
      package of care for people undergoing planned surgical procedures. the investigator wanted to
      discover whether carbohydrate supplements are a useful part of care packages used by doctors
      to improve recovery after planned cesarean section.
