    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, and
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of ZSP1241 in participants with hepatocellular
      carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer and other
      advanced solid tumors.
