  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To develop a new mobile health (mHealth) system that will send text messages to remind
           both pregnant and non-pregnant women with HIV to adhere to their treatment plan (like
           keeping appointments, fillings prescriptions, and taking their medication) and address
           individual barriers to HIV care (like stigma, medical mistrust and resilience).

        2. Investigators also want to see if the mHealth system is feasible, easily accepted and if
           it will impact patient health in a positive way.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a qualitative/quantitative trial that utilizes a Sequential to Parallel intervention study design model. The initial 15 participants (first 5 each that speak English, Spanish, or Haitain Creole) will participate in the Qualitative arm. These participants may also be eligible to roll over into the quantitative portion of the study and randomized to either the control group or the mHealth Intervention group.</intervention_model_description>
