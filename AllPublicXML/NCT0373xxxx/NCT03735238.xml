  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will attempt to put into practice a shared decision making (SDM) strategy, using an
      individualized, computerized decision- aid (DA) for Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate methods to implement a shared decision making strategy,
      using an individualized, computerized decision- aid (DA). The investigators will test the
      effectiveness of this implementation with 3 strategies in 16 clinics. Formative evaluation
      strategies will be used to assess needs at each clinic, with key clinic informants
      participating in semi-structured interviews. The study will enroll at least 500 patient
      participants across all 16 sites, who will review the decision aid and be asked a feasibility
      and acceptability assessment. At the conclusion of the study, key clinic informants, as well
      as selected patient participants will participate in semi-structured interviews to assess the
      effectiveness in implementing the DA in the clinic setting.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Acceptability of Intervention Measure (IAM) for Decision Aid (DA)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinic personnel's perception of the acceptability of the decision-aid, measured using a validated scale with four (4) items with responses ranging from 1 (&quot;completely disagree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;completely agree&quot;). The four items will be averaged to create one composite mean scale score (range 1-5), where higher scores reflect perceptions of greater acceptability (i.e., better outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived DA Implementation Success</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinic personnel's perception of the implementation success of the decision-aid, measured using a validated scale with three (3) items with responses ranging from 1 (&quot;Disagree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;Agree&quot;). These three items will be averaged to create one composite mean scale score (range 1-5), where higher scores reflect perceptions of greater implementation success (i.e., better outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived DA Permanence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinic personnel's perception of the permanence of the decision-aid, measured using one validated item that is scored ranging from 1 (&quot;Not at all permanent&quot;) to 5 (&quot;Extremely permanent&quot;). This item will be examined by itself, where higher scores indicate perceptions of greater permanence of the decision-aid in the clinic (i.e., better outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient perception of DA Usefulness</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient perception of the effect of the decision-aid on preparing the patient for decision making measured using the Preparation for Decision Making (PDM), a validated scale consisting of 10 questions scored on an ordinal scale from (not at all =1) to (a great deal = 5). For scoring, sum the score of the 10 items and divide by 10. Scores can then be converted to a 0-100 scale by subtracting 1 from this summed score and multiplying by 25.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction for Decision Aid (DA)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with the ease of the use of the decision-aid measured using a validated single item scale scored on an ordinal scale from (strongly disagree =1) to (strongly agree = 5). This item will be examined by itself, where higher scores indicate greater patient satisfaction with the decision aid (i.e., better outcome). This is a single item scale, and there are no subscales. It was adapted from another study that assessed satisfaction with IPad or interactive voice response.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM) for Decision Aid (DA)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinic personnel's perception of the appropriateness of the decision-aid, measured using a validated scale with four (4) items with responses ranging from 1 (&quot;completely disagree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;completely agree&quot;). The four items will be averaged to create one composite mean scale score (range 1-5), where higher scores reflect perceptions of greater appropriateness (i.e., better outcome).</description>

    <measure>Perceived Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) for Decision Aid (DA)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinic personnel's perception of the feasibility of the decision-aid, measured using a validated scale with four (4) items with responses ranging from 1 (&quot;completely disagree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;completely agree&quot;). The four items will be averaged to create one composite mean scale score (range 1-5), where higher scores reflect perceptions of greater feasibility (i.e., better outcome).</description>
