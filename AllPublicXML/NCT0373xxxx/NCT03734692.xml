  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single arm efficacy/safety trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of
      combining intensive locoregional intraperitoneal (IP) chemoimmunotherapy of cisplatin with IP
      rintatolimod (TLR-3 agonist) and IV infusion of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (IVP)
      for patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (OC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a total of six treatment cycles, at 3-week intervals. The study will
      use an IP neoadjuvant approach (IP chemoimmunotherapy of cisplatin with IP rintatolimod and
      IV infusion of pembrolizumab), followed by interval cytoreduction (usually laparoscopically)
      of residual tumor. Cytoreduction will occur approximately 4 weeks after the fourth treatment
      cycle. Post-surgery the investigators will consolidate with 2 additional courses of same
      chemo-immunotherapy regimen. Catheter will be removed 12 weeks after the last treatment. All
      surgical procedures, if done laparoscopically, are outpatient and will yield up to three
      serial biopsies of the tumor sites: 1) at catheter placement; 2) at interval cytoreduction
      which consists of removal of any visible tumor sites and the site biopsied initially whether
      tumor is present or not; 3) at catheter removal, when site of first tumor biopsy will be
      re-biopsied for pathologic response.

             o Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study
             may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous
             investigational agent.

          8. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of

             unlikely to recur (the study PI must concur with this determination).

         11. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
