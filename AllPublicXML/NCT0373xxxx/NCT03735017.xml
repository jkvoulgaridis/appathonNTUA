    <measure>Neuropathic Pain Qualities as assessed by Neuropathic Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Final assessment (average 1 week post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) was designed to assess the distinct pain qualities associated with neuropathic pain.The NPS consists of 10 items. Seven of the 10 items contain the words intense, sharp, hot, dull, cold, and itchy to characterize the patient's pain and the word sensitive to describe the patient's pain reaction to light touch or clothing.One item describes the time quality of the pain (all the time or some of the time). The ninth item describes the overall unpleasantness of the pain, whereas the last item indicates the intensity of the deep and surface pain. In the NPS each item is rated separately. All the items are rated 0-10 scale, with higher score indicative of more neuropathic pain for each type of respective pain.
Range of scores: 0-10 for each item.</description>
