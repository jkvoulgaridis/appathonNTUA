  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of subcutaneous (SC) golimumab in
      participants with active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) or Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) over 24
      weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing study will evaluate safety and efficacy profile of golimumab (a fully
      human anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha [TNF-alpha] monoclonal antibodies [mAb], administered
      subcutaneously) in a real-world in Indian participants with active spondyloarthropathy of
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). AS is a chronic inflammatory
      disease of unknown etiology that involves the sacroiliac joints, axial skeleton, entheses,
      and peripheral joints. PsA is a chronic, inflammatory, usually rheumatoid factor negative
      arthritis that is associated with psoriasis. Golimumab binds with high affinity to human
      TNF-alpha and inhibits TNF-alpha bioactivity, TNF-alpha-mediated cell cytotoxicity and
      TNF-alpha mediated endothelial cell activation. Golimumab also induces activation of
      complement-mediated cell lysis and reduces the development of arthritis. Study evaluation
      includes efficacy (efficacy parameters for AS and PsA) and safety. Participant's safety will
      be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study will be approximately 24
      weeks.
