  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a multicenter, non-randomized, Phase II trial with one treatment
      arm. A total of 82 patients of both genders and older than 18 years with relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma are planned to be included in the study. After the first 6 patients will
      have finished the first treatment cycle of the induction phase the DMC will assess safety and
      tolerability of the treatment schedule and decide about the further continuation of the
      study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to investigate the
      clinical activity of pomalidomide administered once daily in combination with oral ixazomib
      and dexamethasone (PId) until disease progression according to IMWG criteria.

      Patients with clinical relapse (any one of the following: deterioration of renal function,
      hypercalcemia, newly developing osteolytic lesions and/or soft tissue plasmacytomas) will go
      off study and receive further treatment according to their treating physician. Patients with
      isolated biochemical relapse with an increase of serum M-protein of ≥ 25% (absolute increase
      in serum must be ≥ 5 g/L) and/or urine M-protein (absolute increase in urine must be ≥ 200
      mg/24h) or in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (provided, the
      absolute increase is &gt; 100 mg/L) without further signs or symptoms will proceed to the
      intensification phase (PICd).

      The intensification phase (PICd) will last until further disease progression. In case of
      significant haematological and non-haematological toxicities, dose adjustments and/or
      interruption of the study drugs may be necessary.

      Response assessments will be performed every four weeks by evaluation of serum and 24 hour
      urine specimens. &quot;Progressive disease&quot; (PD) will require a consecutive confirmatory
      measurement.
