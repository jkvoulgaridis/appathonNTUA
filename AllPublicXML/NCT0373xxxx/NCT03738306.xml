  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mezieres method was born in France with the physiotherapist Francoiçe Mezieres, who in
      the middle of the previous century began a series of observations that led her to rediscover
      body characteristics to understand it in a revolutionary way. Among the most important
      contributions is the first description of muscle chains, from which different global
      physiotherapy techniques have emerged. The method also proposes a form of intercorporal
      relationship different from that used in classical physiotherapy and gives way for people who
      receive this treatment to improve their body disposition and make use of their body in a
      conscientious manner. From this, in the present study we try to understand this method as one
      of the ones that promotes the &quot;Use of self&quot;. In addition to identifying other aspects related
      to the meaning of the corporal intersubjectivity for the physiotherapist and for the person
      being treated, looking for the subjective construction of effectiveness and determining the
      objective effectiveness by means of objective measurements of the body.

      The present research project use a mix method, it aims quantify the bodily benefits when
      applying the method and understand from the subjectivity the implications for the self during
      the body activity of the Mezieres Method. The study will be mixed and in parallel with 82
      people diagnosed with mechanical back pain. Three assessments will be made: one initial, one
      at the end of the intervention and one last follow-up six weeks after the end of the
      treatment. The tests to be used will assess pain, functional limitation related to low back
      pain, quality of life related to health, flexibility, range of motion and posture. For the
      intervention, participants will be divided into 2 groups, group one will receive Method
      Mézières and group two will receive conventional physiotherapy according to the protocols of
      a clinical institution in Bogotá. Parallel to the intervention, the participating individuals
      and physiotherapists will keep a field diary that will facilitate the understanding of the
      body experience by performing the method studied.

      At the end of the study, it is intended to know the objective effectiveness by means of the
      comparison made in the two groups in the variables studied. In addition, an interpretation of
      the body experience is expected when performing the Mezieres Method in comparison with
      conventional physiotherapy. This interpretation of hermeneutic character will revolve around
      the theoretical construction of the &quot;Use of self&quot;; This concept is recognized as a technology
      of the self that will be pursued through the Mézières Method. By promoting the &quot;Use of self&quot;
      the person can recognize their body and appropriate what happens with their locomotor system,
      decreasing the symptoms of pain and improving the prognosis of care for people who have these
      symptoms.

    <description>The Mézières treatment has 3 postures that could be adapted to each patient, depending on his/her needs to correct variations in the dorsal curve and promote diaphragmatic breathing. The first objective was to recover extensibility of the hypertonic muscle groups and, in particular, those in the low back muscular chain. The time of tratment will be of 1 hour, two times a week, during 5 weeks.</description>
