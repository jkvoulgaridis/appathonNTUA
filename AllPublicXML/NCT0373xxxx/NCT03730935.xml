  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of hypertension in the elderly is high. Given that hypertension is the leading
      cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide, safe and efficacious treatment options for this
      condition are highly desired. Apart from medication, changes in lifestyle are recommended to
      lower blood pressure, such as an increase in physical exercise. However, whole-body exercise
      is not feasible for all. Mobility disabilities, for example, increase sharply with age and
      are already common in middle age. For this population, it is necessary to have alternative,
      non-invasive interventions with similar effects on blood pressure. One such intervention
      might be respiratory muscle endurance training (RMET), but the effects on blood pressure are
      currently unknown.

      The primary aim of this project is therefore to investigate the effects of RMET over the
      course of several weeks on resting blood pressure in healthy elderly. The secondary aim of
      the project is to evaluate the effects of RMET on uphill exercise performance in healthy
      active elderly given that elderly experience structural and functional changes of the lungs
      potentially affecting exercise performance. Finally, since prevalence of subjective sleep
      complaints is also high in the elderly, the present study will also investigate the effects
      of RMET on sleep quality.
