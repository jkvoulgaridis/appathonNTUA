  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial hearing in cochlear implant (CI) users is a challenging investigation field since no
      studies have explored yet spatial auditory perception in three-dimensional space (3D).
      Moreover auditory rehabilitation after cochlear implantation is totally devoted to speech
      rehabilitation to date.

      A novel methodology based on virtual reality and 3D motion capture protocol in an immersive
      reality system has recently been developed to evaluate and record spatial hearing abilities
      of norm-hearing (NH) listeners and CI adults in 3D. The results revealed worse sound
      localization in 3D for CI users compared to NH participants, and interestingly noted that
      head movements could improve sound localization performances, leading to a possible track for
      auditory rehabilitation.

      The aim of this study is to explore spatial hearing in CI children with the protocol already
      tested in CI adults. This protocol will be adapted to children over eight years old. Children
      will have to perform a sound localization task in 3D without any feedback of performances.
      The knowledge improvement in pediatric sound localization will lead to develop a specific
      spatial rehabilitation in cochlear implant children.

    <measure>measure of the spatial hearing deficit matching the distance between the hand pointing error and the sound source position in space</measure>
    <time_frame>thirty minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Data from spatial sound perception will be recorded in three dimensional space (azimuth, elevation, and depth). First, the pointing error will be computed separately for azimuth, elevation, and depth, in terms of constant error (absolute and signed) and variable error. Then, these separate errors will be combined into a cumulative error &quot;D&quot;, hence summarizing all three dimensions of space, and taking into account absolute and variable error in one measure.</description>

    <measure>measure of head and eye movements in three dimensional space with a motion tracking system (virtual reality system including a Head-Mounted display) to evaluate their roles in spatial hearing performances.</measure>
    <time_frame>thirty minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Head and eye movements will be recorded in three dimensional space with a motion tracking system (virtual reality system including a Head-Mounted display). The cumulative error &quot;D&quot; will be calculated in two different conditions: first, participant's head will be fixed during sound emission and then, head and eyes will be free to move. If the cumulative error &quot;D&quot; significantly decreases when head movements are free, we could say that head movements allow/help improving spatial hearing performances.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SSQ questionnaire is a clinical subjective scale adapted to parents and cochlear implant children. It allows evaluating hearing performances in daily life. The questionnaire is divided into 3 main items (A: speech; B: spatial hearing; C: other qualities of hearing) comprising questions with rating scores out of ten. For example, a zero score corresponds to bad hearing abilities. We will therefore correlate the mean score of all questions out of ten to the cumulative error &quot;D&quot;.</description>

    <description>Normal hearing children and cochlear implant children will have to localize a sound source in three dimensional space by using a virtual reality system (Neuro immersion platform). The experiment will last thirty minutes.
For normal hearing children, this experience will be performed at the inclusion visit.
For cochlear implant children, this experience will be performed 28 days (+/- 2 days) after inclusion.</description>

    <description>For cochlear implant children and their parents, a SSQ questionnaire will be given and completed during the first visit (at the inclusion).
This questionnaire offers a version for parents of children with hearing loss (&quot;SSQ Parents CI&quot;) and a version for the children themselves (&quot;SSQ Children CI&quot;).</description>

    <description>The SSQ questionnaire for Parents of CI children is composed of three distinct sections (A, B and C).
Each section will be filled separately by parents of CI children with one of the study collaborators during 3 telephone calls spaced 1 week apart. Thus, section A will be completed 7 days (+/- 2 days) after inclusion , section B 14 days (+/- 2 days) after inclusion, and section C 21 days (+/- 2 days) after inclusion.</description>
