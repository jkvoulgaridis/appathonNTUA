  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how well panitumumab-IRDye800 and 89Zr-panitumumab work in identifying
      cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes in patients with squamous cell head and neck
      cancer. Panitumumab-IRDye800 is a drug that contains a dye molecule that fluoresces during
      surgery to indicate cancerous tissue. 89Zr-panitumumab is a drug that contains a small amount
      of radiation, which makes it visible in positron emission tomography (PET) scans. PET scans
      make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the drug is used. Giving
      panitumumab IRDye800 and 89Zr panitumumab to patients with head and neck cancer may help
      doctors find metastatic lymph nodes better than current methods [positron emission tomography
      (PET); computed tomography (CT); magnetic imaging resonance (MRI), or combinations].

      Participants receive standard of care 18F-FDG-PET/CT and/or 18F-FDG-PET/MRI to assess their
      cancer for surgical excision. Participants than receive panitumumab-IRDye800 dye and
      89Zr-panitumumab, both by intravenous (IV) infusion, on Day 0. Participants will undergo
      89Zr-panitumumab PET/CT imaging on Day 1 to 2, and then undergo surgical resection of the
      tumor at 2 to 5 days after infusion. Participants with cancer-positive lymph nodes vs
      cancer-negative lymph nodes will be analyzed as separate cohorts. Research imaging will be
      performed intraoperatively using optical imaging devices and a high-energy gamma probe.
      Subsequently, the excised tissue will evaluated ex vivo (back table) using radioactive
      (89Zr-panitumumab) and fluorescence (panitumumab-IRDye800) imaging techniques. After surgery,
      patients are followed up at 15 and 30 days.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of zirconium Zr 89 panitumumab (89Zr
      panitumumab) for the detection of tumor-involved regional lymph nodes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the number (proportion) of lymph nodes determined to be tumor positive by
      histological and/or pathological evaluation that were NOT predicted tumor-positive by 89Zr
      panitumumab labeling.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of panitumumab IRDye800 for the detection of
      tumor-involved regional lymph nodes.

      II. Determine the number (proportion) of lymph nodes determined to be tumor positive by
      histological and/or pathological evaluation that were NOT predicted tumor-positive by
      panitumumab-IRdye800 labeling.

      optical imaging devices listed in Appendix B intraoperative high-energy gamma probe.

    <description>The number and location of 18F FDG avid nodes within the regional lymphatics will be compared to the number and location of 89Zr-panitumumab avid nodes in relation to the postoperative neck dissection histopathology. The total number of tumor positive nodes will be determined and correlated to the radiologically suspicious nodes identified by 89Zr-panitumumab and 18F-FDG contrast agents using PET/CT and/or PET/MRI imaging.The specificity and sensitivity of 89Zr panitumumab will be calculated and compared to the specificity and sensitivity of 18F FDG for metastatic lymph node identification. Significance will be assessed at the 0.05 level and to assess uncertainty, 95% confidence intervals will be provided for all estimates.</description>

    <description>The number and location of 18F-FDG avid nodes within the regional lymphatics will be compared to the number and location of 89Zr-panitumumab avid nodes in relation to the postoperative neck dissection histopathology. Will calculate the odds of a false negative using 89Zr-panitumumab PET relative to the odds of a false negative using a 18F-FDG PET and compare the negative predictive value (NPV) of 89Zr-panitumumab and 18F-FDG. Will present means and standard deviations (or medians and interquartile ranges when appropriate) for continuous characteristics such as SUVmax as determined with 89Zr-panitumumab PET and 18F FDG PET and radioactivity counts of 89Zr-panitumumab in the node(s) as determined with the PET probe.</description>

    <description>Sensitivity and specificity will be generated by comparison of fluorescence intensity and histological and/or pathological evaluation. Findings will be compared to the sensitivity and specificity of 89Zr panitumumab and 18F FDG (primary objective) using Durkalskis test, as outlined above. For categorical variables such as drainage pattern and number of lymph nodes visualized, will present frequency statistics. Graphical tools such as heat maps, histograms, and boxplots will be used to assess distributional properties of continuous variables. We will illustrate the nature of the relationship between SUVmax/radioactivity counts and/or mean florescence intensity (MFI)/tumor to background ratios (TBRs) and/or drainage pattern across all subjects, the relationship will be illustrated with a heat map and spaghetti plot.</description>
