  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly one-half of all lower extremity percutaneous interventions performed in patients with
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) involve chronic total occlusions (CTOs) which are
      technically more challenging and are associated with more periprocedural complications and
      lower rates of procedural success comparing with non CTOs. Despite innovate dedicated CTO
      devices developed and provides higher technical success, a wire-catheter approach to cross
      peripheral artery CTO is most often the first choice of operators as its lower cost
      advantage.Subhash Banerjee MD reported of all 1,362 CTOs, wire-catheter approaches were used
      in 82% and the technical success rate was 65%. If the operators chose wire-catheter as
      primary crossing device at the beginning of the procedure, but the technically failed with
      the provisional use of re-entry or crossing devices to try to procedural success. Such
      procedures add incrementally to procedure duration and cost and the revascularization and
      amputation rate at 12 month were highly increased comparing with using dedicated CTO devices
      initially. So it is very important to predict the outcome of guidewire crossing through CTOs
      to direct the choice of crossing strategy.

      Current data suggested that computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging of PAD and a
      detailed comprehensive assessment for CTO arteries before endovascular therapy can assist
      preprocedural planning to maximize procedural success. Previous studies about coronary CTOs
      prediction scores as the KCCT score and CT-based CT-RECTOR provide the factors including
      occlusion length, the shape of proximal entry site, severe calcification, and etc. characters
      base on CTA correlating with the outcome of cross. As the same physiopathologic mechanism, we
      hypothesized that the radiographic characteristics are connected with outcomes of guidewire
      crossing occlusions. To our knowledge, few studies focused on how to predict the successful
      GC through peripheral artery CTO, therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish a
      simple and clinically applicable prediction model based on CTA characters within the
      occlusive lesions and clinical parameters to predict the GC outcomes of patients with lower
      extremity CTO.

      In addition, the long-term effect of endovascular revascularization are very important. An
      analysis concluded that limb adverse event (repeat revascularization rate 17.2%, amputation
      rates 8.5%) at 12-month in the CTOs with direct wire-catheter crossing strategy. Base on the
      proven influence factors (the lesion length, small diameter of the vessel and severe
      calcification, mechanical exposure, etc.)of adverse event at after endovascular
      revascularization ,we also can establish model with preoperative computer tomography
      angiography that provided the lesion detail characteristic combing the patients' biochemical
      and clinical feature to predict the adverse event rate at 12-month after endovascular
      revascularization.

      Patients Patients with peripheral artery disease met the inclusion criteria if they were PAD
      patients, had performed preprocedural CTA and PTA. The hospital's database was used to
      identify the patients met inclusion criteria. The medical records and radiologic information
      system database were reviewed to retrieve clinical information including background diseases
      and radiographic findings.

      Computed Tomography Angiography Protocol A 128-section multidetector CT (Philips
      brillianceiCT was used for scanning with the following scanning parametersï¼Œtube voltage was
      120 kVp, tube current 40-440mA, and 0.625-mm slice thicknesses. The protocols required
      patients to lie supine with legs extended, A fixed bolus of contrast medium with total volume
      of 90 ml (370 mg iodine per milliliter) was injected into antecubital vein at a rate of 4
      mL/sec, followed by a 30 mL saline flush, by using a dual-barrel power injector. CT scanning
      was performed with the coverage from the common iliac artery bifurcation to the tiptoe.
      Scanning began 12 seconds after an attenuation threshold of 150 HU was reached.

      CTA Data Analysis CTA data were transferred to an offline workstation for further analysis.
      Axial images, cross-sectional views, curved planar reformations (CPR), and multiplanar
      reformations (MPR), as well as three-dimensional maximum intensity projection images were
      available for evaluation. We measure the degree of transluminal calcification, CT attenuation
      value of the proximal occlusion ,anatomic distribution of the leision,and length of
      occlusion,and the degree of stenosis CTO Crossing Strategy CTO crossing strategy was
      wire-catheter. Technical success was defined as crossing the CTO and placement of a guidewire
      in the distal true lumen confirmed by angiography.Outcomes include binary variables of lesion
      crossing described as technical success or failure.

      Follow-up We also examined patient adverse events after procedures at 12 months: all-cause
      death,nonfatal myocardial infarction,revascularization and amputation.

      Built prediction model we can establish model with preoperative computer tomography
      angiography that provided the lesion detail characteristic combing the patients' biochemical
      and clinical feature to predict the procedural and long-term outcomes of endovascular
      revascularization for Lower extremity peripheral artery chronic total occlusions.
