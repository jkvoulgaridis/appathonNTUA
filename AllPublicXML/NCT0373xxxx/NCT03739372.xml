  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 strata pilot trial within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC).

      The study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's tumor gene expression,
      whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted panel profile (UCSF 500 gene panel), and RNA-Seq. The
      current study will test the efficacy of such an approach in children with High-grade gliomas
      HGG.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For children with High-grade gliomas (HGG) including HGG presenting within the midline
      structures of the brain and spine, outcome remains poor and the majority of children die from
      this disease. The current study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's
      tumor gene expression, whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted panel profile (UCSF 500 gene
      panel), and RNA-Seq. This treatment strategy has shown promising results in adult patients
      with solid tumors and is currently being explored in children with DIPG, neuroblastoma and
      other solid tumors. The current study will test the efficacy of such an approach in children
      with HGG for which outcomes remain dismal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed HGG (including midline HGG but excluding DIPG), who
             undergo tissue collection as part of standard of care. HGG is defined as either World
             Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV, or testing positive for H3K27M mutation.
             Patients with disseminated disease are not eligible, and MRI of the spine must be
             performed if disseminated disease is suspected by the treating physician. Primary
             spinal cord tumors are eligible.

          -  Enrollment within 3 weeks of the start of radiation therapy.

          -  Start of radiation therapy within 6 weeks from initial tissue diagnosis.

          -  Age ≤ 21 years

          -  Karnofsky score ≥ 50 for patients ≥ 16 years of age and Lansky score ≥ 50 for patients
             ≤15 years of age. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis but who are up
             in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the
             performance score

          -  Adequate tissue for molecular profiling (see Section 8 of the protocol for full
             details)

          -  The effects of the current treatment paradigm on the developing human fetus are
             unknown. For this reason, females of child-bearing potential and males must agree to
             use adequate contraception: hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation, and 30 days after
             completion of study drug administration. Should a female become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately. Males treated or enrolled on this protocol
             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of
             study participation, and 30 days after completion of study drug administration.

          -  Adequate neurologic function defined as: Patients with seizure disorder may be
             enrolled if seizures are well controlled.

          -  Ability by patient or parent/legal guardian to understand a written informed consent
             document, and the willingness to sign it.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled on another therapeutic clinical trial. Individual
             cases should be discussed with the study chair.

          -  Patients who are currently taking any anti-cancer directed therapy. Steroids are not
             considered anti-cancer therapy. The use of temozolomide during radiation therapy is
             allowed at standard dosing (maximum 75 to 90 mg/m^2 daily for a total of 42 days). Any
             other schedule(s) need to be discussed with the study chair.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding.
             Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test prior to the start of therapy (as clinically indicated).

          -  Patients with inability to return for follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies
             required to assess toxicity to therapy. Telemedicine visits are acceptable.
