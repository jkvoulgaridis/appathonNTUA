  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to characterize the safety and tolerability of dasiglucagon 4
      mg/mL following IV administration at increasing doses in healthy volunteers. One cohort of
      subjects will receive a SC dose of dasiglucagon to characterize the bioavailability of
      dasiglucagon following SC administration compared to IV administration. Furthermore, the
      trial aims to assess the potential effect of dasiglucagon on corrected QT interval (QTc)
      prolongation via a concentrationresponse analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes is defined as episodes of an abnormally low plasma
      glucose concentration. Hypoglycemia is a common, unpredictable, and potentially dangerous
      side effect of treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially with insulin or sulfonylureas.

      Dasiglucagon (ZP4207) is a stable peptide analog of human glucagon, available in a
      ready-to-use liquid formulation. Dasiglucagon is in development for the treatment of severe
      hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. Dasiglucagon is a specific and full glucagon
      receptor agonist designed to mimic the effects of glucagon, having a fast absorption and
      elimination (minutes).
