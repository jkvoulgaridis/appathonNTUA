  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety (including evaluating side
      effects) of combination of olaparib and abiraterone versus placebo and abiraterone in
      patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received no
      prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or new hormonal agents (NHAs) at metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) stage.

    <textblock>
      PROpel is a phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib
      versus placebo when given in addition to abiraterone to patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have not received prior chemotherapy or new
      hormonal agents (NHAs) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
      (first-line setting).

      Approximately 720 patients globally will be randomized in PROpel in a 1:1 ratio to treatment
      with either olaparib and abiraterone or placebo and abiraterone. Patients will receive oral
      treatment with olaparib 300 mg twice daily + abiraterone 1000 mg once daily or placebo twice
      daily + abiraterone 1000 mg once daily. Patients in both treatment groups will also receive
      either prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily.

               -  Provision of informed consent for biomarker research prior to collection of
                  sample.

             If a patient declines to participate in the optional exploratory genetic research or
             the optional biomarker research, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the
             patient. The patient will not be excluded from other aspects of the study.

          4. Patients must be ≥18 years of age (or ≥19 years of age in South Korea) at the time of
             signing the informed consent form. For patients enrolled in Japan who are &lt;20 years of
             age, written informed consent should be obtained from the patient and from his legally
             acceptable representative.

          5. Histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma.

             androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at study entry should continue to do so throughout
             the study.

          9. Candidate for abiraterone therapy with documented evidence of progressive disease.

             6 months.

         13. Prior to randomisation, sites must confirm availability of either an archival formalin
             fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue sample, or a new biopsy taken during the

             to enable homologous recombination repair (HRR) status subgroup analysis of the
             primary endpoint radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). If there is not
             written confirmation of the availability of tumour tissue prior to randomisation, the
             patient is not eligible for the study.

         14. Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose
             of olaparib+abiraterone when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a
             woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a
             highly effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential.

          6. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥160 millimeters of mercury
             (mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure (BP) ≥95 millimeters of mercury (mmHg)).

          7. History of uncontrolled pituitary or adrenal dysfunction.
