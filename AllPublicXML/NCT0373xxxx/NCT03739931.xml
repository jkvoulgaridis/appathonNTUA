  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study will assess the safety and tolerability of escalating intratumoral doses
      of mRNA 2752 in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study of intratumoral injections
      of mRNA-2752 alone and in combination with intravenously administered immune checkpoint
      blockade therapy in patients with histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor
      malignancies or lymphoma. The study consists of 2 dose escalation and dose confirmation parts
      (Arms A and B) followed by Dose Expansion parts in select indications.
