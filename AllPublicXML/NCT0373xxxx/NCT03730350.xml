  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized-controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate the effectiveness of a pain psychology
      intervention -- consisting of a hybrid of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and
      clinical hypnosis intervention -- in reducing opioid consumption after major surgery.
      Consenting patients undergoing oncology surgeries at Toronto General Hospital (TGH) will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) standard care or (2) standard care plus an
      ACT/clinical hypnosis intervention for pain management. The hypnosis intervention will be
      delivered via one session with a psychotherapist prior to surgery, one session with a
      psychotherapist after surgery, and the provision of audio recordings to guide patients in
      practicing self-hypnosis. The pain psychology intervention is targeted at reducing pain, as
      well as pain-related anxiety, distress, sleep disturbance, and functional impairment. The
      primary goal of the pain psychology intervention is to help patients to feel more comfortable
      while using less opioid medication in the week after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypnosis is one of the oldest strategies for the management of pain; however, interest in
      hypnosis as a pain management strategy has ebbed and flowed over time. Given the current
      concern over opioid use for pain management, non-pharmacological pain management options,
      such as clinical hypnosis, are being revisited. In addition, over the past twenty years,
      there has been a new wave of scientific investigation into the efficacy of hypnosis for acute
      and chronic pain. As a result of this body of evidence for the efficacy of clinical hypnosis
      for pain management, the American Psychological Association has recommended that clinical
      hypnosis be included as part of standard care for pain relief, unless an individual indicates
      a strong aversion to it.

      Previous research has investigated the utility of clinical hypnosis for pain management in
      the perioperative context. Surgical patients who received adjunct hypnosis treatment had
      better outcomes (e.g., less pain, better mood, and less medication use) than 89% of patients
      who received treatment as usual, as evidenced by large effect sizes across 1624 patients from
      randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. A more recent meta-analysis demonstrated
      small to medium effects in favor of hypnosis on various post-surgical outcomes (e.g., pain,
      emotional distress, medication consumption, and post-surgical recovery), across 2597 patients
      in randomized controlled trials. Although these meta-analyses have demonstrated an
      association between the implementation of hypnosis interventions and an overall reduction in
      medication consumption, previous investigations have rarely focused specifically on reduced
      use of opioid medication, which is important in the context of current concerns about opioid
      overuse.

      Furthermore, meta-analyses have indicated that dysregulation of the parasympathetic nervous
      system is associated with the development of chronic pain, leaving sufferers unable to
      regulate stress, recovery, and relaxation processes. The investigators hypothesize that the
      relaxation associated with the clinical hypnosis intervention will lead to activation of the
      parasympathetic nervous system and, accordingly, greater heart rate variability. Therefore,
      the investigators hypothesize that patients who are randomized to the clinical hypnosis
      treatment will not only use less opioid medication in the week after surgery, but will also
      demonstrate greater heart rate variability at one month post-surgery, which is thought to
      protect against the development of long-term pain.

      The study's goal is to provide patients with a range of strategies that will be most helpful
      and efficacious in reducing suffering during the pre- and post-operative periods. A secondary
      goal is to deliver as much therapeutic content as possible through audio recordings in order
      to create a psychological intervention that requires less face-to-face contact between
      clinician and patient, but provides more support (e.g., patients can listen to the recordings
      at bedtime when the clinician would not be available on a daily basis). The use of audio
      recordings will conserve staffing resources, while at the same time allowing for the
      dissemination of pain psychology tools to more patients. Therefore, in the current study, the
      study aims to test the feasibility and efficacy of this approach, termed ACT-Informed
      Clinical Hypnosis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Use: Measured as the morphine equivalent dosage (MED) and based on conversion methods used by doctors and nurses at the University Health Network</measure>
    <time_frame>One Week</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness of the intervention on opioid use will be tested using a 2 factor mixed effects linear model with group (hypnosis vs. standard care) and time (pre-surgery, one week post-surgery) as factors. The investigators predict significantly lower mean daily morphine-equivalent opioid use in the hypnosis group compared to standard care at one week post surgery.
MED values typically range between 0-200 milligrams/day and higher values mean greater opioid use.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Surgical Pain Intensity: Measured using the numeric rating scale (0 = no pain; 10 = most pain imaginable)</measure>
    <time_frame>One Week</time_frame>
    <description>Post-surgical pain intensity will be tested with a linear mixed effects model (group x time).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Surgical Pain Interference: Measured using the Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>One Week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference will be tested with a linear mixed effects model (group x time).
Pain interference has seven subscales of general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. Each subscale has five likert-type response options (not at all; extremely). Pain interference will be measured as the mean ratings of the seven subscales.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Impairment; Measured using the Patient Report Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>One Week</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep impairment will be tested with a linear mixed effects model (group x time).
The majority of the PROMIS items employ response scales with five options: 1 = Not at all, 2 = A little bit, 3 = Somewhat, 4 = Quite a bit, 5 = Very much.Scores are calculated from the total of item responses, with higher scores reflecting greater sleep disturbance/impairment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood: Measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale Short-Form</measure>
    <time_frame>One Week</time_frame>
    <description>Mood symptoms will be tested with a linear mixed effect models (group x time).
The total score is calculated by the sum of the items with higher scores reflecting greater depressive symptomatology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety: Measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>One Week</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety symptoms will be tested with a linear mixed effect models (group x time).
This 7-item scale assesses signs of GAD (e.g. &quot;Feeling afraid as if something awful might happen&quot;) with response options of: (1) Not at all, (2) Several days, (3) More than half the days, (4) Nearly every day. Scores are calculated from the total of item responses, with higher scores reflecting greater anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Parasympathetic Tone and Activation: Assessed by metrics of heart-rate variability (HRV)</measure>
    <time_frame>One Month</time_frame>
    <description>Parasympathetic tone and activation will be measured during conditions of resting (5 minutes) and audio-guided relaxation (10 minutes). Higher HRV values reflect greater parasympathetic tone and activation. The effects of the intervention on parasympathetic tone and activation will be tested with a linear mixed effects model with group (hypnosis, standard care) and time (pre-surgery, one month post-surgery) as between-group factors, condition (rest, relaxation) as the within-subject factor, and heart-rate variability as the dependent variable.</description>

    <description>Prior to surgery, a member of the pain psychology team will guide patients through a clinical hypnosis session aimed at preparing for surgery by reducing anxiety and introducing relaxation and self-soothing strategies that can be used after surgery for adaptive coping. They will also be provided with a recording of this hypnosis script to use at home, and it will be recommended that they listen to the recording on the two days prior to surgery. Following surgery, a clinician from the pain psychology team will visit the patient in hospital on post-operative day one or whenever they are able to be seen prior to hospital discharge, in order to guide them through a clinical hypnosis session targeted at increasing comfort and pain relief.</description>
