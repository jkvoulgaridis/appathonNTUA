      The aim is to conduct a feasibility pilot study of a dietary intervention designed to
      optimise gut bacteria in children diagnosed with ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can suffer debilitating
      symptoms, including problematic behaviour and sleep. Research suggests dietary manipulations
      may be a helpful treatment option for children with ADHD, although the most effective are
      highly restrictive, with little known about why they might work. Optimising gut bacteria in
      individuals with ADHD may help alleviate some of the symptoms of this condition via the
      gut-brain-axis and would provide a plausible mechanism by which dietary interventions
      operate. We propose to conduct a feasibility pilot study of a dietary intervention designed
      to optimise gut bacteria in children diagnosed with ADHD.

Wake after sleep onset (minutes spent awake during the down period after removing sleep latency). Range 0-∞. A higher score = less sound sleep (worse).
Sleep fragmentation (number of awakenings/ total minutes of sleep x 100) - Higher score = more fragmented sleep (worse).

    <description>The parents will have four group sessions with a nutritional therapist, where in depth advice and information about the diet will be provided. Ongoing support will also be provided throughout the study by use of a closed Facebook or WhatsApp group (whichever the parents choose as most appropriate). The diet is based on five main principles:
Eat at least seven portions of different varieties of fruit and vegetables each day.
Have a 12 hour overnight break from food (water only during this time).
Drink a Kefir drink each day - provided free of charge.
Eat a microbiome friendly, protein rich, breakfast from our menu.
Reduce sugar and artificial sweeteners.</description>
