  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create and test a patient decision aid that facilitates the
      shared decision-making process when patients with psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis are
      starting or switching to a new therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the interventional study, we will develop a decision aid using design thinking. In
      this interventional study, we will implement and test a patient-centered decision aid for
      therapy selection among patients with psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis who are starting
      or switching to a new medication.
