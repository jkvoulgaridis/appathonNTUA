  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of RT or chemo-RT on chemosensory gustatory
      function in patients with HNC. By using detailed dosimetric data derived from the RT planning
      system, we will be able to calculate mean radiation doses to important structures including
      the anterior and posterior tongue, oral cavity, parotid and submandibular salivary glands,
      and correlate them with both qualitative and quantitative data for dysgeusia.

      This study aims to collect data from patients with HNC undergoing RT or chemo-RT to correlate
      quantitative chemosensory gustatory function with

        -  Detailed dosimetric data for critical structures relevant to perception of taste

        -  Fungiform papillae density (FPD)

        -  Use of concurrent platinum based therapy

        -  Patient reported taste loss using The Taste and Smell Survey (TSS) [14]

        -  Patient reported toxicity and overall QOL using University Washington Quality of Life
           Revised Version 4 (UW-QOL v4) [15].

        -  Clinician reported acute and late toxicity using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
           Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4) [16] and Scale of Subjective Total Taste Acuity
           (STTA) [17].

        -  Weight (as a surrogate of nutritional status).

      This study hopes to demonstrate a dose dependent relationship for loss of taste and to
      develop a dose constraint for preservation of taste. In turn this will serve as a platform
      for further research to optimise the technical delivery of radiation either in the form of
      optimised IMRT or through the use of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT).

    <measure>The association between radiotherapy dose and patient-reported dysgeusia at 6 months following RT or chemo-RT for HNC.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the mean dose delivered to the anterior two thirds of the surface of the tongue for those patients who report clinically significant dysgeusia at 6 months, with those who report clinically insignificant dysgeusia. For the purposes of the primary objective, mean dose (Gy) to the anterior two thirds of the tongue will be used. Patient-reported dysgeusia will be assessed using the Taste and Smell Survey (Q13) and patient results will be dichotomised into clinically significant and clinically insignificant loss of taste.</description>

    <description>patient-reported dysgeusia will be assessed using the Taste and Smell Survey (Q13) and patient results will be dichotomised into clinically significant and clinically insignificant loss of taste as above. dose volume histogram data will generate mean dose to oral cavity structures (including posterior third of tongue, anterior two thirds of the tongue, whole oral cavity, parotid glands, submandibular glands).</description>

    <description>Therefore prior to gustatory testing, patients will be screened and assessed as having either normal or abnormal olfactory function using the Sniffin' Sticks (Burghart; Wedel, Germany). The test consists of 12 odour pens which represent every-day odours (peppermint, fish, coffee, banana, orange, rose, lemon, pineapple, cinnamon, cloves, leather and liquorice). Patients are presented with an odour and select the perceived smell using a multiple-forced-choice method.</description>

    <intervention_name>Quantative Gustatory Testing using Taste Strips</intervention_name>
    <description>Following screening for olfactory function, whole mouth gustatory function will be assessed using validated taste strips (Burghart; Wedel, Germany). Filter paper test strips are impregnated at one end with 2cm2 of either sweet, sour, salty or bitter taste solutions in four concentrations. In a pseudo-randomised sequence, individual strips will be placed on the tongue and patients will be asked to close their mouth in order to assess whole mouth function. Through a forced-choice procedure patients will be asked to identify the taste stimuli. Scores for individual taste qualities will range from 0-4 and an overall taste score will range from 0-16.
Patients will rinse their mouth with tap water prior the application of each taste strip.</description>
