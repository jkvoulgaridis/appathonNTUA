    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study which aims to explore the effect of bariatric surgery on
      cardiac and vascular structure and function in obesity. Enrolled patients will receive the
      following examinations before surgery and 3,6,12 month after the bariatric surgery: 24-h
      central and brachial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, PWV, echocardiography, vascular
      endothelial function, hemodynamic including cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance
      and so on. We compare these data before and after surgery in order to evaluate effectiveness
      of bariatric surgery in the cardiac and vascular structure and function.

      The including citeria: 1)15-65 years old; 2) Indication for Asian bariatric surgery
      (I.BMI≥32.5 or 27.5≤BMI＜32.5 with obesity-related comorbidities ) ;3) available for
      inspection and therapeutic schedule; 4) available for follow up. The excluding cteria: 1)over
      65 years old; 2)myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and ischemic stroke during the
      previous month;3)congestive heart failure class IV based on the New York Heart Association
      classification; 4) malignancy or any other condition with poor prognosis; 5) serious
      pulmonary and renal dysfunction; 6) gastric disease; 7) poor compliance 8) incomplete
      clinical data .After enrollment, every patient will receive a question-based interview to
      obtain medical history and the following examinations and tests: anthropometric parameters
      measurement including body height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference and so on;
      blood routine tests and biochemical tests. Every patient needs to be assessed before surgery
      and at 3,6,12 month by 24-h central and brachial ambulatory blood pressure, PWV,
      echocardiography, vascular endothelial function, cardiac output and peripheral vascular
      resistance. We compare these data before and after surgery in order to evaluate effectiveness
      of bariatric surgery in the vascular structure and function.
