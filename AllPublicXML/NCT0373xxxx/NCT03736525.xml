  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Design for wellness (DWELL) is an online Facebook intervention developed to effectively cause
      participants to design their home environments for wellness. Also, to improve health
      behaviors (specifically: healthy nutrition, physical activity, smoke free home and hygiene);
      to improve awareness of the importance of the environment in healthy behaviors; and to
      improve overall wellness. The research will follow qualitative methods in early stages for a
      deep understanding of participants' needs and inputs, complimented by a rigorous,
      quantitative approach using randomized controlled trail (RCT) for program evaluation.
      Participants are Israeli mothers to children up to 18 years old with Facebook profile, who
      are often in Israel responsible for household management and raising the family. The program
      will provide the participants with an accessible and convenient online setting for active and
      group oriented collaborative learning, in informal personalized environment. Motivating the
      participants to enhance their engagement in DWELL online community is expected to encourage
      the participants to design their home environment for wellness and improve their health
      behaviors and overall wellness.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on home
      design for wellness (DWELL). This will be measured through the use of a validated DWELL
      questionnaire for actions related to changes in home environment for wellness. Secondary aims
      are to: 1) assess the effectiveness of the intervention on health behaviors, specifically in:
      nutrition, physical activity, smoke-free homes and hygiene; 2) improve awareness of the
      importance of the environment in healthy behavior; 3) improve wellness; 4) assess
      associations between level of participation (active social, active non-social, passive use)
      and other outcomes: DWELL, awareness of importance, health behaviors, and wellness.

      Participants will be Israeli mothers who are at least 18 years old and have children up to 18
      years old, who are willing to participate in the study, can read and write Hebrew, and have
      internet access and Facebook profile. Recruitment for the trial will be mainly through
      Facebook and WhatsApp. Semi-structured focus groups will be conducted in order to create
      DWELL content for intervention and the DWELL questionnaire to assess intervention's
      effectiveness.

      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to assess effectiveness of an online
      intervention. Recruitment for the trial will be mainly through Facebook and WhatsApp. Sample
      size will be calculated based on initial results from the focus group's pilot. After
      recruitment, participants will be randomised into intervention and wait list control groups,
      using the online software &quot;Research Randomizer&quot;. A three-month Facebook intervention will be
      carried out. Participants in both groups will fill pre, mid and post intervention
      questionnaires online. After the first 3 months of the intervention, the investigators will
      open the group to all participants, including those on the wait list control group. This will
      allow control group participants to access the treatment and to compensate the participants
      for participation. The investigators will continue to follow and manage the group and monitor
      its long-term activation.

      A general linear model will be used which takes in to account repeated measures. A
      time-to-event analysis using Cox proportional hazards models will be conducted to examine the
      length of time for which change persisted.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized online to intervention and wait list control groups. Intervention group only will be exposed to a new Facebook group, opened specifically for this study. The Facebook group will have a privacy setting of &quot;closed group&quot;, meaning that only members of the group can see posts. This is to prevent possible contamination, ensuring that members of the control group will not be exposed to the intervention. The intervention period will be 3 months. Participants in both groups will fill pre, mid and post intervention questionnaires. At the end of 3 months, we will change the settings of the group and open it to all, including the wait list control group. That way the control group will get access to the treatment as well, to compensate them for participation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants who will be found suitable for participation and who will agree online to participate in the study, will be randomized into intervention and wait list control groups, using an online software &quot;Research Randomizer&quot;. The wait list control group will not receive any special treatment during the study. Both groups will be asked to answer the online questionnaires, and after the end of the intervention period the wait list control group will get access to the Facebook group also, to compensate them for participation.</masking_description>

    <description>Design for wellness is an online Facebook intervention. During 3 months intervention period, participants in the intervention group will be exposed to contents on their newsfeed (posts on Facebook wall), and also be expected and encouraged to create new content themselves. The contents will be interactive and involve different modes of delivery, as audio and video, to reinforce active learning. Participants will be part of DWELL Facebook group community and will be empowered to read and control cues in the environment, by developing skills to enhance their self-efficacy.</description>
