  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed Tomography (CT) is widely used in abdominal imaging for a variety of indications.
      Contrast media (CM) is used to enhance vascular structures and organ parenchyma. Attenuation
      of the liver makes it possible to recognize hypo- and hypervascular lesions, which are often
      invisible on unenhanced CT images. Lesions can only be detected in case they are large enough
      and the contrast with the background is high enough. Heiken et al. showed already in 1995
      that a difference in Hounsfield Units (HU) of at least 50 HU is needed to be able to
      recognize liver lesions [1]. On the other hand, patients should not receive more CM than
      necessarily, because of possible underlying physiological effects [2-4]. Although there has
      been some controversy about this recently, there is no need to give patients more CM than
      needed, because of increased costs, no quality improvement and their might still be a
      relationship with contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) [5].

      Recent publications suggested individualization of injection protocols that can be based on
      either total body weight (TBW) or lean body weight (LBW) [6-9]. In the investigators
      department an injection protocol based on TBW is currently used.

      Besides the CM injection parameters, scanner parameters are of influence on the attenuation
      as well. Because of recent technical developments it became possible to reach a good image
      quality (IQ) at lower tube voltages [10]. When the x-ray output comes closer to the 33 keV
      k-edge of Iodine, attenuation increases. In short, decreasing the tube voltage increases the
      attenuation of iodine. Scanning at a lower tube voltage therefore gives rise to even lower CM
      volumes. Lastly, it would be revolutionary to accomplish a liver enhancement that is
      homogenous, sufficient for lesion detection and comparable between patients and in the same
      patients, regardless of weight and scanner settings used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Computed Tomography (CT) is a non-invasive imaging tool, used for a great variety of
      indications. Contrast media (CM) is used to enhance vascular structures and organ parenchyma.
      The visibility of liver lesions depends mainly on the ratio between the size and the
      difference of the lesion to the background. A large lesion might be visible without
      administration of CM, whilst a smaller lesion needs the addition of CM to become visible.
      Additionally, CM can be useful in the characterization of liver lesions. Heiken et al. (1995)
      found that an attenuation of the parenchyma after CM administration of at least ∆ 50
      Hounsfield units (HU) compared to an unenhanced scan (in the same patient) is necessary to
      recognize liver lesions. This study proposed a dosing factor of 0.521 g I/kg to be necessary
      to reach such attenuation at a tube voltage of 120 kV [1].

      The parenchymal enhancement depends on patient, CT scanner and CM factors. Weight, height,
      cardiac output, age, gender, venous access, breath-holding, renal function and comorbidity
      all fall under patient factors [8]. Recently much research showed preferable outcomes for
      individualized CM injection protocols, in which the contrast bolus is adapted to patient TBW,
      LBW or body surface area (BSA) [6, 7, 9, 13-15]. In a recent feasibility study in the
      department of the investigators, the attenuation of the liver parenchyma was evaluated.
      Results showed that a body weight adapted CM injection protocol resulted in more homogeneous
      liver enhancement compared to a fixed CM dose (not published yet).

      With recent technological developments in X-ray tube technology it became possible to use
      lower tube voltages. As a result making it possible to perform scans with a sufficient image
      quality (IQ) and a low tube voltage and therefore a lower radiation dose [10]. Another
      advantage lies in the fact that reducing the tube voltage, approaching 33 keV k-edge of
      iodine, results in an increase in attenuation of the iodine. The new technological
      developments make it possible to reduce the radiation dose and CM volume at the same time. So
      reducing the tube voltage, makes it also possible to reduce the CM volume.

      As recommended by the supplier, it is possible to calculate the total iodine load (TIL) that
      can be spared with the use of lower kV settings [16]. A reduction of 10 kV should result in a
      10% reduction in CM volume. Reducing the tube voltage from 120 to 90 kV should therefore lead
      to a 30% reduction in CM volume. As mentioned before it is preferred to use an individualized
      CM injection protocol based on TBW or LBW. For this study, this theory is adapted to the
      concept of TBW. The following indicates which dosing factors should be used for each kV
      setting, based on the recommendations mentioned in the above.

      120 kV -&gt; 0.521 g I/kg 110 kV -&gt; 0.469 g I/kg 100 kV -&gt; 0.417 g I/kg 90 kV -&gt; 0.365 g I/kg 80
      kV -&gt; 0.313 g I/kg 70 kV -&gt; 0.261 g I/kg

      The aim of present study is to investigate if adapting the dosing factor based on TBW and
      therefore the CM volume to the tube voltage used, results in a more homogeneous liver
      enhancement. The hypothesis is to find a more homogeneous enhancement between patients and in
      the same patient, regardless of body composition and tube voltage used.

    <description>The attenuation of the liver parenchyma as assessed by measuring the Hounsfield units (HU) of the liver parenchyma in an unenhanced CT scan and a scan in portal venous phase. The difference between the enhanced and unenhanced CT scan is the Δ HU. It is expected that scans in all groups have a Δ HU of at least 50 HU, which is considered sufficient. Therefore it is a non-inferiority outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Measurement for each scan is performed within 1 month after the scan.</time_frame>
    <description>The objective image quality parameters consist of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). SNR is calculated by dividing the attenuation of the liver parenchyma by the corresponding standard deviation (SD) of the attenuation. The attenuation of the left erector spinae muscle is measured at the level of the liver to calculate CNR using the following established formula: liver segment attenuation minus intramuscular attenuation, divided by the SD of the intramuscular attenuation. For both a higher number indicated a better image quality. The outcome should not be significantly different between groups.</description>

A 5-point Likert scale is used, in which 1= excellent; 2= good; 3 = moderate; 4 = poor; 5 = very poor. So a higher number is a worse outcome. The scale does not have a particular name.</description>
