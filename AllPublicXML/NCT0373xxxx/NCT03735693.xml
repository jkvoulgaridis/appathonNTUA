  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to diagnose earlier and more precisely the occurrence of a weakness
      neuromuscular syndrome at the end of intensive care, or within 28 days if the stay is longer
      than 28 days. The amyotrophy has been shown to be proportional to muscle strength in healthy
      subjects. The amyotrophy can be reliably evaluated by measuring the cross-sectional area of
      the right femoral muscle. The hypothesis is that amyotrophy measured by muscle ultrasound can
      allow an early and reliable diagnosis of neuromuscular weakness syndrome (NMWS), even though
      the measurement of the MRC score (the Gold Standard), has shown its limitations in intensive
      care in terms of reliability and delayed diagnosis.

      Moreover, this syndrome is associated with a loss of functionality and a deterioration of
      long-term quality of life. One of the objectives is thus to determine if the muscular
      ultrasound allows a prediction of the occurrence of these alterations far from the intensive
      care.

      Early rehabilitation has shown a benefit on mortality, duration of stay, mechanical
      ventilation and on functional alteration after intensive care. This is why an earlier and
      more precise means of diagnostic of this pathology is searched.

      The target population is therefore patients from 18 to 80 years hospitalized in intensive
      care for prolonged stay (&gt; 5 days), and prolonged ventilation (&gt; 48H).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular weakness syndrome post intensive care is a generalized muscular weakness with
      amyotrophy caused by the stay in the intensive care unit. This pathology is frequent, under
      diagnosed, increases the length of stay and mortality in intensive care and alters the
      functional status in the long term (mobility, autonomy, cognitive abilities). The gold
      standard is the MRC score. It must be under 48/60. But this means of diagnostic is unreliable
      and tardive (problem of voluntary cooperation, confusion, sedation).

      This study allows the earlier diagnosis of neuromuscular weakness syndrome, by muscular
      ultrasound. Ultrasound of the right femoral muscle allows evaluation of the amyotrophy, which
      is related to the maximum muscular strength.

      The early rehabilitation enable improved prognosis. This is an observational, prospective,
      single-center, blinded, observational study.

      The objective is to determine the day of ultrasound examination with the highest diagnostic
      performance to predict with a maximum of specificity the occurrence of post-intensive care
      neuromuscular weakness syndrome, defined by an MRC score &lt;48/60 at the end of intensive care
      or if the duration of stay exceeds 28 days on the 28th day of hospitalization in intensive
      care unit.
