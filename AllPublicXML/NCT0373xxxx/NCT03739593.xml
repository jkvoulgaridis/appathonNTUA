  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AR-1105 (dexamethasone
      implant) for the treatment of macular edema (ME) due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO). A more
      durable intravitreal implant containing a low dose of dexamethasone may result in less
      frequent retreatments, and potentially lower the incidence of steroid-related side effects
      without compromising efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AR-1105 is a dexamethasone containing implant drug delivery system that is injected into the
      back of the eye. It is designed to dissolve slowly over time, continuously releasing a
      consistent low dose of steroid to treat the symptoms of RVO and associated inflammation with
      a goal of halting further visual disturbance and damage, and also possibly restoring some
      vision as symptoms are controlled. In this study, 2 different formulations are being tested
      to find the optimum combination of efficacy, safety and durability that will offer patients a
      potential treatment option that is as safe and effective as the treatments currently
      available, but which requires less frequent injections and potentially has a lower risk for
      certain side-effects.

    <intervention_model_description>Single injection of either of 2 formulations of AR-1105 dexamethasone intravitreal implant (CF1 or CF2) administered in a single eye. An initial safety cohort of up-to 5 subjects may be enrolled onto CF1 prior to the randomized phase. During the randomized phase of the study, subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either CF1 or CF2. Each subject will complete a 6-month primary evaluation period. Residual implant assessment will be performed by 3-field fundus photography at Day 7 and at Months 3, 4, 5, and 6, and if necessary at monthly visits thereafter until the subject requires retreatment, or until 1 month after the implant is no longer visible, or to Month 9, whichever comes first.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age

          2. Vision loss due to clinically detectable macular edema (ME) associated with either
             central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).
             Subjects may be treatment-naïve, or if previously-treated with a steroid, must have
             demonstrated response to treatment

          3. Duration of macular edema (ME) ≥9 months in subjects with CRVO and ≥12 months in
             subjects with BRVO. If both eyes are eligible, the study eye will be the eye with
