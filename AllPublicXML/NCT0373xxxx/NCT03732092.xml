      Analyze the behavioral response of patients with disorders of consciousness through olfactory
      stimulation, compare the response of olfactory stimulation in patients with different
      consciousness, and analyze the impact of olfactory stimulation on diagnosis; After the first,
      third, and sixth months of initial enrollment, the recovery of prognosis was tracked by the

      Previous studies suggested that olfactory stimulus have some effect on some patients with
      disorders of consciousness. Then, the aim of the present study is to know the prognostic
      value of olfactory stimulation and the diagnosis for DOC patients. DOC patients were
      recruited (standard diagnosis procedure is 5 times CRS-R testing within 10 days). The
      different stimuli were as follows: 1) 1-octene-3-ol, odor. 2) pyridine, odor. 3) water. We
      presented these stimuli randomly, and we recorded the patient's CRS-R scale behavioral
      response and response to olfactory stimulation. Analyze the behavioral response of patients
      with disorders of consciousness through olfactory stimulation, compare the response of
      olfactory stimulation in patients with different consciousness, and analyze the impact of
      olfactory stimulation on diagnosis; After the first, third, and sixth months of initial
      enrollment, the recovery of prognosis was tracked by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revision
      (CRS-R).

    <description>The CRS-R consists of 23 items grouped in six subscales addressing auditory, visual, motor, oromotor, communication and arousal functions. The higher items represent conscious related behaviour while the lower items for each sub-scale represent reflexive activity. Basis for scoring was the presence or absence of the specific behaviour in response to standard stimuli. Patients were followed up for 1, 3, and 6 months to track the prognosis of patients by CRS-R.</description>

    <description>Patients with disorders of consciousness were assessed by Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). In addition, we selected three stimuli: 1) 1-octene-3-ol, 2) pyridine, 3) water. We presented these three stimuli in front of the patients nose for 3 seconds.</description>
