  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      investigators assume that administration of preoperative melatonin will reduce the required
      dose of propofol in participants undergoing loco-regional chronic subdural hematoma
      evacuation, it may as well provide better postoperative analgesia and decrease the incidence
      of delirium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies showed that premedication with melatonin was associated with sedation
      without impairment of cognitive and psychomotor skills or prolonging recovery. Some studies
      demonstrated that melatonin decreases the amount of propofol required to produce an adequate
      depth of hypnosis at induction time

      The effects of the oral administration of melatonin on the dose of propofol sedation in
      participants undergoing loco-regional chronic subdural hematoma evacuation have not been
      documented before.

      The present study will be conducted to detect the efficacy of oral administration of
      melatonin on the reduction of the sedative dose of propofol in participants undergoing
      loco-regional chronic subdural hematoma evacuation.

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>(N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland. It is primarily responsible for the sleep awake cycle as its level decreases in the morning and increases by night; owing to reduced light intensity, leading to circadian rhythm. It provides circadian and seasonal timing through activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in target tissues. Melatonin exerts its hypnotic effects through the activation of the MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Randomization will be done via computer generated numbers and concealed by serially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes. The details of series will be unknown to the investigators and the group assignment will be kept in a set of concealed envelopes each bearing only the case number on the outside. Prior to the start of the study, the appropriately numbered envelopes will be opened by the nurse, the card will determine the assigned intervention for each patient, which will be prepared by a clinical pharmacist with no other role in the study</masking_description>
