  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no standard management to guide the clinicians in treating patients with
      fibrostenotic disease. European Crohns and Colitis Organization [ECCO] recently developed a
      topical review on prediction, diagnosis and management of fibrostenosing Crohns disease. The
      review suggests endoscopic balloon dilation, strictureplasty, and intestinal resection as
      reasonable treatment options for short strictures based on the low grade of evidence.

      Study Population All patients with Crohns disease and a short stricture (&lt;5 cm) within the
      reach of upper or lower GI endoscopy

      Study Timeline

        1. Pre-recruitment phase including proposal, IRB approval, staff training, budget transfer
           - 9 months

        2. Recruitment of patients: 2 years

        3. Follow up: 2 years

        4. Analysis and preparing report: 6 months

      Study Design Single blind randomized controlled trial The data will be blindly analyzed.
      Double blinding is not possible due to the nature of the study.

      Study Methods Please see the study flow diagram below. Randomization will be done using
      computer software generating random numbers. Outcome Measures - A research associate will
      contact patients on weeks 1,2,4 and months 3,6,12,18 and 24 to record the items mentioned as
      secondary objectives of the study.

      - An interim analysis will be performed after 20 cases complete the study Sample Size 40
      patients randomized to two arms undergoing TTS dilation or surgical managements

      Statistical analysis Comparisons between groups will be done using Student's t-test.
      Qualitative variables will be summarized as a percentage of the group total and comparisons
      between groups will be based on the chisquared test. The cumulative relapse rate of each
      treatment group will be estimated by the KaplanÂ±Meier method and the difference between
      treatment groups will be tested by the log rank test. Time to relapse will be compared
      betweens two groups using a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. A P value of less
      than 0.05 is considered to be signicant.
