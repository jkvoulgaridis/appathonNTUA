  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health
      benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet,
      about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight
      regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self-reported eating instances
      that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is
      understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. The investigators
      therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools:
      ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a
      wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating
      characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary
      recalls. The investigators will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one
      additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and an additional 12-week
      period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol
      to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants
      will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly,
      participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between
      days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and
      beverages consumed. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by
      measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known
      lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change,
      and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses. The study approach is consistent
      with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve
      CVD and related risk factors.

    <description>Self-monitoring. Participants will be taught to record their weight, the calories of each food item, and physical activity using a method of their choice (e.g., commercial smartphone app, paper diary). The clinician will review dietary intake and provide personalized feedback at the outset of session.
Diet. Per national guidelines for weight loss, a daily goal of 1200-1800 kcal/day will be prescribed depending on baseline weight. A Mediterranean diet will be prescribed to meet the recommended calorie goal and be consistent with dietary recommendations for CVD patients.
Exercise. Participants will be encouraged to achieve 250 minutes/week of moderate intensity activity in accordance with current national recommendations for physical activity among individuals attempting weight loss. Participants will be encouraged to gradually increase activity level to achieve approximately 50 minutes of activity over five days per week.</description>
