  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves individuals who are currently participating in the Wounded Warrior
      Recovery Project and underwent aeromedical evacuation (AE) due to injury during deployment in
      Iraq or Afghanistan. The goal of the study is to understand how best to engage wounded
      warriors in research activities studying long-term health. Based on the results from this
      study, the investigators can plan a larger study with the goal to better understand the
      long-term health conditions of individuals who were injured in combat and improve patient
      care.

      As part of the study, participants will be asked to provide two sets of lab work over the
      course of a year. Each set of lab work will include one blood draw, one urine sample, and
      height, weight, and blood pressure measurements. In order to track long-term health,
      information from participants' lab work will be linked with study-related health data, as
      well as surveys they have completed with the Wounded Warrior Recovery Project (WWRP).
