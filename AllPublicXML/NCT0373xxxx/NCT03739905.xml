      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ExAblate® Model 4000
      Type 2.0 system as a tool to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in patients with probable
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

      This study is a prospective, open label, single-arm, non-randomized, phase IIa trial to
      evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of repeated, BBB opening using the ExAblate®
      Model Type 2.0 (220 kHz) system. Patients with diagnosis of Probable Alzheimer's Disease may
      qualify for a clinical trial to have three serial ExAblate BBB disruption procedures in
      specific areas in the brain.This study will be conducted at a single center in Canada and
      will enroll up to 30 patients.
