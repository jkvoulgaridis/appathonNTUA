      Evaluating the benefit of dry needling of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in subjects with
      cervicogenic headaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals with cervicogenic headache
      respond favorably to a program of manual therapy in combination with dry needling of the
      major muscle between chest bone and the head (sternocleidomastoid muscle) compared to manual
      therapy directed to the upper body quadrant alone.

      The researchers will conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a
      manual therapy and dry needling approach (group 1) vs. manual therapy only. (group 2)
