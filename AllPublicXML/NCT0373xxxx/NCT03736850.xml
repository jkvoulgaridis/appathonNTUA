      This is a multicenter, open label, sequential-cohort, dose escalation &amp; expansion phase I
      study to evaluate the clinical safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of CS3006
      and to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD）, if any, Recommended Phase II Doses (RP2Ds)
      and regimen of CS3006. The study is composed of two parts: Part 1 for dose escalation and
      Part 2 for dose expansion.
