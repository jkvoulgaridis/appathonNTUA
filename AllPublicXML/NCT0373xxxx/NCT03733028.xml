    <textblock>
      Anger is the mostly commonly reported reintegration concern among combat Veterans, especially
      those with PTSD. Problematic anger is associated with significant functional impairment. In
      the current project, the investigators will pilot-test a newly developed mobile app, entitled
      Mobile Intervention for Reducing Anger (MIRA), among Veterans with PTSD and problematic
      anger. The project will compare the MIRA app to a contact control condition. The
      investigators hypothesize that Veterans with PTSD and problematic anger will find the MIRA
      app acceptable and will be willing to use it to reduce their anger difficulties and improve
      psychosocial and occupational functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anger is the mostly commonly reported reintegration concern among combat Veterans, especially
      those with PTSD. Problematic anger is associated with significant functional impairment. One
      of the mechanisms associated with problematic anger and aggression is hostile interpretation
      bias, i.e., a tendency to interpret ambiguous interpersonal situations as hostile. The
      investigator has previously developed and piloted a computer-based interpretation bias
      modification intervention that successfully reduces both hostile interpretation bias and
      anger outcomes. In the current project, the investigators will pilot-test a mobile
      application version of the existing computer-based intervention, entitled Mobile Intervention
      for Reducing Anger (MIRA), among Veterans with PTSD and problematic anger. The project will
      compare the MIRA app to a contact control condition to evaluate the feasibility of
      recruitment, randomization, and retention procedures. The investigators will also utilize
      psychophysiological and electronic diary monitoring to determine whether this assessment
      could be used as an outcome or mechanistic variable in a subsequent randomized clinical trial
      application focused on evaluating the efficacy of the MIRA intervention.

    <description>This is a mobile intervention that uses interpretation bias modification (IBM) techniques to reduce the hostile interpretation bias. Participants will be given a mobile device with the MIRA app and instructed to complete 5 treatment sessions each week for a period of 4 weeks. Each session takes approximately 10 minutes. The app also includes a Nightly Diary to track symptoms, a calendar to program session reminders, and a My Progress feature to track use and performance.</description>

    <description>This is a mobile intervention that uses the Mindful Breathing and Body Scan exercises from the &quot;Mindfulness Coach&quot; app. These audio-guided exercises take approximately 10 minutes each. Participants will be given a mobile device with the Mindfulness app and instructed to complete 5 exercises (i.e., Body Scan or Mindful Breathing) each week for a period of 4 weeks. The app also includes a Nightly Diary to track symptoms, a calendar to program reminders, and a My Progress feature to track use and performance.</description>
