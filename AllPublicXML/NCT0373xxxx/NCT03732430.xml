      This phase II study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT-based adaptive radiation
      therapy followed by adjuvant anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy in treating patients with
      different types and stages of thoracic malignancies. (CARTAI)

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibition
      consolidation therapy after radiation therapy for multiple thoracic malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of adjuvant anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy after radiotherapy.

      II. To understand the dynamics and interactions of IDO with others immune pathway biomarkers.

      III. To evaluate whether IDO immune status could predict the treatment outcomes of radiation
      and immune combined therapy.
