  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether being randomized to an aggressive
      postoperative non-narcotic pain regimen that treats pain from multiple different pathways may
      decrease postoperative pain levels, decrease constipation, and decrease the dependency on
      opioid medications after anorectal surgery versus the standard of care for managing pain.
      This use of a more aggressive pain regimen is considered an enhanced recovery after surgery
      (ERAS) protocol because it is theorized to improve or &quot;enhance&quot; postoperative recovery by
      both decreasing the use of narcotics and their detrimental effects as well as increasing the
      benefit of using additional non-narcotic pain medication.

    <textblock>
      Although pain is a predictable part of the postoperative experience, inadequate management of
      pain is common and can have profound implications Most patients who undergo surgical
      procedures experience acute postoperative pain, but evidence suggests that less than half
      report adequate postoperative pain relief. Many preoperative, intraoperative, and
      postoperative interventions and management strategies are available for reducing and managing
      postoperative pain. Mostly, pain is treated with opioids which are narcotics. medically they
      are primarily used for pain relief and these are historically considered &quot;safe&quot; drugs as they
      do not impose an increased risk of bleeding, kidney, or stomach problems. However, many
      patients taking high dose opioids have a higher risk of constipation. Unrelieved
      postoperative pain may result in economic and medical implications such as extended lengths
      of stay, readmissions, and patient dissatisfaction with medical care. With the rising concern
      over narcotic use, physicians are increasingly seeking alternative ways to help patients
      manage pain throughout their hospital stay and beyond However, few studies in anorectal
      surgery have shown that using an aggressive postoperative non-narcotic pain regimen (ERAS)
      can help reduce postoperative pain and decreased returns to emergency care.
