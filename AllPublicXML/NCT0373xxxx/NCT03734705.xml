  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will test a potential new treatment strategy, imaginal exposure, for
      hoarding disorder. Although cognitive behavioral therapy often reduces hoarding, some people
      do not want to start, or cannot handle, that option. To help such individuals, the present
      study will provide imaginal exposure therapy to people with hoarding disorder, wherein they
      imagine discarding possessions as a way of becoming acclimated to the idea. We predict that
      imaginal exposure will improve hoarding symptoms as well as two psychological experiences
      linked to the condition: intolerance of uncertainty and emotional avoidance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hoarding disorder is a common mental illness characterized by difficulty parting with
      possessions and by clutter that makes living spaces unusable. Cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) is an effective treatment for hoarding disorder, but new approaches are needed to
      engage those who are reluctant to start or cannot tolerate CBT. Both intolerance of
      uncertainty and emotional avoidance are linked to hoarding disorder and may interfere with
      treatment engagement. Imaginal exposure, a therapeutic technique which involves repeatedly
      imagining feared scenarios and experiencing the evoked emotions, effectively targets both
      intolerance of uncertainty and emotional avoidance. The present study is the first to test
      whether imagining discarding possessions can improve hoarding symptoms more than does a
      control exercise. We hypothesize that compared to a control exercise, imaginal exposure will
      improve hoarding symptoms, intolerance of uncertainty and emotional avoidance.

    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>Gold-standard 23-item self-report measure of hoarding disorder symptoms. Scale scores range from 0 to 92, with higher scores indicating more severe hoarding symptoms. More severe hoarding symptoms are considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report 18-item measure of behaviors associated with hoarding disorder (i.e., acquiring).Scale scores range from 18 to 126, with higher scores indicating more severe hoarding behaviors. More severe hoarding behaviors are considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (Buhr &amp; Dugas, 2002)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report 27-item measure of a cognitive process related to hoarding called intolerance of uncertainty. Scale scores range from 27 to 135 (some items are reverse scored), with higher scores indicating more severe intolerance of uncertainty. More severe intolerance of uncertainty is considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report 7-item measure of a cognitive process related to hoarding called experiential avoidance. Scale scores range from 7 to 49, with higher scores indicating more severe experiential avoidance. More severe hoarding behaviors are considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Continuous Performance Task</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>A CPT administered by computer will be given to assess attention difficulties, a hallmark feature of hoarding disorder. The scoring of the task will include 1) reaction time, with slower reaction times indicating worse attention, and 2) omission errors, which is when a stimulus is presenting and the participant does not respond. Higher omission errors indicate worse attention.</description>
