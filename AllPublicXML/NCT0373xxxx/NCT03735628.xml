  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the dose escalation part of this study is to determine the feasibility of
      using the combination of copanlisib and nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors, and
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose of copanlisib in combination with nivolumab. The
      maximum tolerated dose will then be used in Phase 2 (dose expansion) of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of:

        Phase 1b:

          -  Advanced solid tumors where nivolumab is indicated as per the latest nivolumab
             Prescribing Information,

        Phase 2:

          -  Metastatic NSCLC, relapsed after prior platinum containing chemotherapy, irrespective
             of PD-L1 expression AND non-responding (no CR/PR) nonprogressing (no PD) on current
             nivolumab treatment. Patients with Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or
             Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor aberrations should have disease
             progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations. Participants must have been
             on nivolumab therapy for at least 3 months prior to screening.

             chemotherapy

          -  Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/ Mismatch repair deficient) dMMR metastatic
             CRC that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and

          -  HCC previously treated with Sorafenib

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with vitiligo, type I
             diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring

             administration of study intervention. Central line surgery is not considered major
             surgery

          -  Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal carcinomatosis or tumors unless the
             participant is &gt; 6 months from definitive therapy (surgery or radiotherapy), has no
             evidence of tumor growth on an imaging study and is clinically stable with respect to
             the tumor at the start of study intervention.

          -  Other malignancy within the last 5 years except for the following, which are
             permitted:

               -  curatively treated basal cell/squamous cell skin cancer,

               -  carcinoma in situ of the cervix,

               -  superficial transitional cell bladder carcinoma (if BCG [Bacillus
                  Calmette-Guerin] treatment was given, there should be a minimum of 6 months
                  between last dose and enrollment),

               -  in situ ductal carcinoma of the breast after complete resection,

               -  participants with localized, resected and/or low-risk prostate cancer may be
