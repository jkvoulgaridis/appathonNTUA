      Open, multicenter, non randomized, single arm, pilot trial. The study is aimed at patients
      infected with HIV in triple antiretroviral therapy based on Dolutegravir (DTG) who experience
      neuropsychological adverse effects related to the treatment. After signing the informed
      consent, DTG will be replaced by Raltegravir (RAL) 1200 QD, maintaining the other two drugs
      that constituted the triple therapy established before the inclusion of the patient in the
      study.
