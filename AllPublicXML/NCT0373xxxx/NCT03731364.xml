    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      design study evaluating, in a pilot stage of the study, up to 3 ascending dose level cohorts
      each evaluating a single dose of CA-008 vs. placebo injected/instilled during an elective
      TKA. Up to 54 subjects will be randomized in the pilot stage. During the second stage of the
      study, subjects will be randomized to one of either 2 or 3 CA-008 dose levels (to be
      determined) or placebo.

               2. have active skin disease or other clinically significant abnormality at the
                  anticipated site of surgery that could interfere with the planned surgery.

          2. Have a known allergy to chili peppers, capsaicin or the components of CA-008,
             ropivacaine, ketorolac, acetaminophen, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine or oxycodone.

          3. Have significant medical, neuropsychiatric or other condition.

          4. The following are considered disallowed medications:

               2. capsaicin-containing products or foods.

               3. central nervous system active agent as an analgesic adjunct medication

               4. antiarrhythmics except beta-blockers, digoxin, warfarin, lithium, or
                  aminoglycosides or other antibiotics for an infection

               5. parenteral or oral corticosteroids.

               6. antianginal, antihypertensive agent or diabetic regimen at a dose that has not
                  been stable for at least 30 days or which is not expected to remain stable while
                  participating in the study.

          5. Have positive results on the alcohol breath/saliva test indicative of alcohol abuse or
             urine drug screen indicative of illicit drug use at screening, and/or prior to
