  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cooling
      anesthesia application to the eye as anesthesia for intravitreal injection using a novel
      cooling anesthesia device and determine the effects of temperature and duration of
      application on subjective pain after intravitreal injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injections have become the standard of care for administering medications for
      retinal diseases such as age related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. There
      is considerable apprehension among patients receiving these injections, primarily revolving
      around adequate anesthesia during the injection. Current methods of anesthesia involve
      topical anesthetic drops, lidocaine gels, or subconjunctival injections of lidocaine, which
      suffer from either poor anesthetic effect, corneal irritation, or subconjunctival hemorrhage,
      as well as significant time for the onset of anesthesia.

      Recens Medical has developed a novel medical device which can precisely and rapidly cool the
      surface of the eye This device cools to a temperature around -5 to -10 degrees Celsius, about
      the temperature of a cold ice cube, and thus has an excellent safety profile compared to
      conventional ophthalmic cryotherapy units. The value of such a device is both improved
      patient comfort, as well as increased efficiency and workflow for retina specialists
      administering intravitreal injections.

      This device has been extensively tested in animal safety studies as well as pilot human
      studies and has not demonstrated any serious adverse effects and has shown anesthetic effects
      comparable to current standard of care.

      This dose escalation study will test various temperatures and duration of temperatures to
      evaluate for safety as well as determine the optimal temperature for anesthesia during
      intravitreal injection.
