      The investigators aim to investigate the feasibility of using mobile application platform for
      sonographic education.

      Junior physicians at the National Taiwan University Hospital will be enrolled in this study.
      To design and develop a secure mobile application platform (consisting of mobile device and a
      cloud-based server) for interactive teaching, remote social-based consultation and
      discussion. The information exchange through the platform carries images and simulated cases.

      This pioneer study can provide experience of mobile sonographic education and contribute to
      current medical education. Moreover, it can improve decision-making process and quality of
      care, and could lessen crowdedness at emergency departments. Furthermore, the integrated
      platform can be used in other educational programs in the future.

      As usual, it takes time for junior emergency physicians to have good diagnostic accuracy
      through traditional sonographic education. Applying the technology built in this project,
      junior emergency physicians will be provided with intelligent learning programs anywhere and
      anytime.

      Junior physicians at the National Taiwan University Hospital will be enrolled in this study.
