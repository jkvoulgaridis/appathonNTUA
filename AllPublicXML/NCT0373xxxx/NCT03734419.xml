  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a big change in our understanding of aging in recent years. Recent researches has
      revealed clock-like patterns of epigenetic change across in humans. The aging involves a
      timed epigenetic reprogramming. However, this biological clock which ticks in our DNA is
      affected by our experience, diet, stress, etc. and it could be changed by experience and life
      style potentially.

      The purpose of this study is to develop and test non-invasive biomarkers based on methylation
      changes in ELOVL2-AS1 gene in saliva samples using a next generation sequencing.

    <description>We will develop the linear model and a threshold value correlated with chronological age of the individuals participated in the current study. The model will be provided to the researchers:
Methylation score=(CG1*b1+CG2*b2+ CG3*b3+CGn*n) + e
CG1 is the methylation value of the first CG b1 is the regression coefficient for the first CG and e equals the intercept. n-is a number of CGs in the model
We will develop the regression coefficient and intercept as well as the DNA methylation values for each individual for each CG.</description>
