  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The thrombectomy is an emergency care provided as soon as possible to selected patients
      suffering from ischemic strokes. Many steps are necessary to prepare this specialized
      procedure of interventional neuroradiology, including installation and preparation of the
      patient for this act. This first and essential time required the intervention of many health
      professionals.

      The approach consists of a series of formation through in situ simulations for these health
      professionals, in order to improve and optimize this first step of the procedure (from the
      installation of the patient to the percutaneous punch by the neuroradiologist).

    <description>Team involved in thrombectomy procedures will be trained by in situ simulation. Simulation will reproduce the initial step of a thrombectomy procedure, i.e from from the installation of the patient to the percutaneous punch by the neuroradiologist. Simulation will be followed by a debriefing focused on the team performance. Three in situ simulation sessions will be realized by each team.</description>
