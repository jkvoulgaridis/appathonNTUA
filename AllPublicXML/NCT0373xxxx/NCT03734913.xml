    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, and
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of ZSP1602 in participants with basal cell carcinoma,
      adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction, small cell lung cancer, neuroendocrine neoplasm
