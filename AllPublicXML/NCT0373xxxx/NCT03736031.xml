  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite being strongly recommended, the integration of palliative care in oncology has not
      been widely adopted. Very few people have access to comprehensive palliative care. Access is
      even lower in rural and Hispanic communities. Even in communities with access, uptake is
      often low due to a lack of education on the part of both patients and providers regarding
      palliative care. This study aims to use an innovative approach to provide quality palliative
      care to oncology Hispanic patients by using community health workers also known as
      promotoras.

      Palliative care has been highly recommended to be an integral part of oncology yet very few
      people have access to comprehensive palliative care. Access is even lower in rural, low
      socio-economic and Hispanic communities. Palliative care has been shown to decrease
      healthcare costs. This study will use an innovative approach to provide quality palliative
      care to gynecology-oncology Hispanic patients by using community health workers also known as
      promotoras. The promotora model has been shown to be successful in several behavioral
      modification programs. The investigators aim to use promotoras to deliver a comprehensive and
      culturally sensitive educational intervention that covers self-care in the presence of
      cancer, advance directives, pain management, and care taker awareness. The goal of the
      intervention will be to decrease number of emergency department visits and hospital
      admissions of patients with advanced cancer, and increase the rate of completion of advanced
      directives, as well as improve overall quality of life (as measured by standardized scales)
      when comparing the intervention group vs. the control (usual care) group. The investigators
      will additionally assess the cost effectiveness of this intervention.

    <time_frame>up to six months</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be analyzed using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating scale. The scale will measure from 0 (No Hurt) to 10 (Hurts worst). The lower scale values (0,1,2) are considered to be a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to six months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale will measure from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). The lower scale value of 0 indicates a better outcome. The score can range from 0 - 27.</description>

Scores of 0,1 are considered to be a better outcome for each question, however, the score can range from 0-28. The sum of individual item scores is calculated, multiplied by 7, and divided by the number of items answered to give the PWB subscale score.</description>

    <description>Social/ Family Well-Being with a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very Much). Scores of 3,4 are considered to be better outcomes for each questions, however, the score can range from 0 - 28. The sum of individual item scores is calculated, multiplied by 7, and divided by the number of items answered to give the (SWB) subscale score.</description>

    <description>Emotional Well-being (EWB) with a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very Much). Scores of 0,1 are considered to be better outcomes for each questions except for Question 2, where 3,4 scores are considered to be a better outcome. The score ranges from 0-24. The sum of individual item scores is calculated, multiplied by 6, and divided by the number of items answered to give the (EWB) subscale score.</description>
