  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation
      emitter device for superficial cutaneous, mucosal or soft tissue neoplasia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, controlled study, assessing the safety
      and efficacy of diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through
      radioactive seeds inserted into the tumor.

      This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used
      in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that
      will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in
      patients.

      Superficial lesions with histopathological confirmation of malignancy will be treated using
      DaRT seeds.

      Reduction in tumor size 70 days after DaRT insertion will be assessed. Safety will be
      assessed by the incidence, severity and frequency of all Adverse Events (AE).
