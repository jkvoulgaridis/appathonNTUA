  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human study to identify whether FP-1305 is suitable to use in humans. The
      previous pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that FP-1305 binds to a receptor known as
      CLEVER-1. CLEVER-1 has been shown to support tumour growth. No significant adverse events
      were witnessed in primates and the dose used will be 300 fold lower than the dose provided to
      primates which showed no toxicity.

      The patients with advanced melanoma, uveal melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer,
      ER+ breast, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal or liver cancer who have exhausted all
      licenced therapeutic options will die due to their disease. Based on the investigator's
      existing data CLEVER-1 is expressed in these tumour types. Inhibition of CLEVER-1 with
      FP-1305 may have an anti-tumour effect in these patients.

             measurements taken during the screening period must be within the required limits for
             the patient to be considered eligible (i.e. criteria met once during the screening
             period are not sufficient if there are more recent measurements available that are not

             measurements are within the required limits). However, once a subject is out of the
             screening period, and has had eligibility confirmed and been enrolled, the pre-dose
             laboratory assessments are not subjected to inclusion criteria limits, but only for
