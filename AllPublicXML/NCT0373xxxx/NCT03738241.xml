  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial in up to 420 males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 70 years
      of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical
      trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of one dose of a
      monovalent inactivated split influenza 2017 A/H7N9 virus vaccine (2017 A/H7N9 IIV),
      administered intramuscularly (IM) at 3.75 mcg hemagglutinin (HA) per dose, given with or
      without AS03 adjuvant to subjects primed with a monovalent inactivated split influenza 2013
      A/H7N9 virus vaccine (2013 A/H7N9 IIV) in DMID Protocols 13-0032 and 13-0033, or to those who
      are A/H7 IIV-naïve. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) diluent will be used to achieve the
      targeted dosage. The study will be conducted at 9 Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit
      (VTEU) sites (including their subcontractors). Study duration is approximately 17 months with
      subject participation duration up to 13 months. The primary objectives are: 1) to assess the
      safety and reactogenicity of 2017 A/H7N9 IIV given with or without AS03 adjuvant following
      receipt of one dose of study vaccine; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition
      (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses following receipt of the study vaccine.

      This is a Phase II clinical trial in up to 420 males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 70 years
      of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria, which include a
      screening erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) laboratory evaluation. This clinical trial is
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of one dose of a monovalent
      inactivated split influenza 2017 A/H7N9 virus vaccine (2017 A/H7N9 IIV) manufactured by
      Sanofi Pasteur (SP), administered intramuscularly (IM) at 3.75 mcg hemagglutinin (HA) per
      dose, given with or without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK),
      to subjects primed with a monovalent inactivated split influenza 2013 A/H7N9 virus vaccine
      (2013 A/H7N9 IIV) in DMID Protocols 13-0032 and 13-0033, or to those who are A/H7 IIV-naïve.
      Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) diluent manufactured by Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC
      will be used to achieve the targeted dosage. Subjects who received the 2013 A/H7N9 IIV in
      DMID Protocols 13-0032 and 13-0033 or are A/H7 IIV-naïve will be stratified by prior receipt
      of 2013 A/H7N9 IIV, as well as by site and prior receipt of licensed, seasonal influenza
      vaccine (defined as receipt of at least one of the 2017-2018 and/or 2018-2019 licensed,
      seasonal influenza vaccines versus none), then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2
      treatment arms to receive 1 dose of 2017 A/H7N9 IIV at 3.75 mcg HA per dose with or without
      AS03 adjuvant. The study will be conducted at 9 Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU)
      sites (including their subcontractors). Study duration is approximately 17 months with
      subject participation duration up to 13 months. The primary objectives are: 1) to assess the
      safety and reactogenicity of 2017 A/H7N9 IIV given with or without AS03 adjuvant following
      receipt of one dose of study vaccine; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition
      (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses following receipt of the study vaccine.
      Secondary objectives are: 1) to assess unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) following
      receipt of the study vaccine; 2) to assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs),
      including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs) and potentially immune-mediated
      medical conditions (PIMMCs), following receipt of the study vaccine; 3) To assess the
      kinetics and durability of serum HAI and Neut antibody responses following receipt of the
      study vaccine.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible to participate in this trial must meet all of the following inclusion
        criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          3. Must agree to the collection of venous blood per protocol.

          4. Must agree to have residual specimens and samples/specimens collected during this
             trial specifically for the purpose of future research stored for future research use.

          5. Are males or non-pregnant females, 19 to 70 years of age, inclusive.

          6. Are in good health* *As determined by medical history and physical examination to
             evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined
             as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the
             assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations.
             Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no
             hospitalizations, emergency room or urgent care for condition and no adverse symptoms
             that need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This
             includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose or frequency as a result
             of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to
             enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,
             insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as
             determined by the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a
             deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)
             medications if, in the opinion of the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they
             pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and
             immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition.
             Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are
             acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical
             condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk to
             the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination.
             Note: Topical, nasal and inhaled medications (except inhaled corticosteroids as
             outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria as well as herbals, vitamins and
             supplements are permitted.

          7. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

          8. Pulse is 47 to 100 beats per minute, inclusive.

          9. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive.

         10. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive.

         11. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is less than 30 mm per hour.

         12. Women of childbearing potential** must use an acceptable contraception method*** from
             30 days before study vaccination until 60 days after study vaccination.

             **Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy,
             hysterectomy, or successful Essure(R) placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal
             sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after
             the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt;1 year has passed since the last menses if
             menopausal.

             ***Includes non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a
             male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been
             vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving the study
             vaccination, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms/cervical cap with
             spermicide, effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing(R), and licensed hormonal methods
             such as implants, injectables or oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;).
