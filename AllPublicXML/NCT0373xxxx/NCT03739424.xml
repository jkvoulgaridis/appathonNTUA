  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is the first egg feeding randomized controlled trial (RCT) in children. The goal
      of this RCT is to determine if eating formulated whole egg products for 9 months improves
      bone health and cognitive function in children ages 9-13 years more than children consuming
      products made of milk powder or gelatin.

    <textblock>
      This 9-month randomized controlled trial is an egg product intervention in otherwise healthy,
      9-13 year-old children in the early stages of puberty (N=120). It will assess changes in bone
      material and geometric properties using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Cognitive function will be measured by the National
      Institute of Health's Toolbox. Participants will be randomized to one of 3 treatment (i.e.,
      whole egg powder, whole milk powder, or gelatin) groups, and instructed to consume the food
      projects 10 times/week in substitute for other similar food products in their diet for
      9-months. Five product choices per treatment group will be provided. The food products were
      developed specifically for this study by the University of Georgia's Food Product Innovation
      and Commercialization center and consumer tested. Additionally, these food products will be
      micro-tested prior to distribution to participants. We hypothesize that children consuming
      whole egg products will have enhanced bone outcomes and cognitive abilities in comparison to
      those consuming whole milk powder or gelatin.

    <description>Three-dimensional cortical and trabecular bone geometry measures will be assessed via pQCT at the tibia and radius. Outcome measures from the pQCT will include cortical and trabecular bone mineral density, cortical bone mineral area, total area, periosteal circumference, endosteal circumference, strength strain index, and bone strain index. DXA will be used to assess two-dimensional bone measurements at the lumbar spine, non-dominant hip, forearm, and total body.</description>

This toolbox for which validity evidence and national norms for children have been provided (Tulsky et al., 2013; Akshoomoff et al., 2014; Weintraub et al., 2013; Zelazo et al., 2013), will measure six cognitive domains: Executive Function, Episodic Memory, Working Memory, Attention, Language Ability, and Processing Speed.</description>
