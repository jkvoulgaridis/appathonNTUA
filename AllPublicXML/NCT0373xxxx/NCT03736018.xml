  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients with symptomatic ischaemic heart disease undergo coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) to alleviate their symptoms and improve prognosis. Given the
      progressive nature of coronary disease, bypass grafts can narrow or block over time, leading
      to chest pain and the need for further invasive coronary angiography. Invasive coronary
      procedures in patients with bypass grafts can be more complicated due to the variation in
      bypass graft ostia. This can lead to longer procedure times, with higher doses of contrast
      and radiation and more discomfort for the patient. The aim of this study is to see if the use
      of computed tomography cardiac angiography (CTCA) in patients with previous bypass grafts
      prior to invasive coronary angiography will help make their procedure safer and quicker.

      The BYPASS-CTCA trial is a single-centre, randomised controlled trial, which plans to recruit
      688 patients who have had previous bypass grafts and require invasive coronary angiography
      over a period of 30 months.

      Patients will be randomised to receive either computed tomography cardiac angiography (CTCA)
      prior to their invasive coronary angiogram, or invasive coronary angiography alone.

      The primary endpoints will be the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy, the duration of
      the invasive coronary angiographic procedure and patient satisfaction. A number of secondary
      endpoints will also be looked at.

      Findings from BYPASS-CTCA will potentially demonstrate that a CTCA prior to invasive coronary
      angiography in this cohort of patients reduces the incidence of contrast-induced kidney
      injury, the length of procedure and improves patients satisfaction. The results of this trial
      may influence future clinical practice guidelines in coronary artery bypass graft patients
      undergoing invasive coronary procedures.
