  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Mindfulness has been applied to improve after cancer care by enhancing
      psychological well-being; however, little is known about its impact on cognitive impairment
      experienced by cancer patients after chemotherapy. Mindfulness may be relevant in tackling
      cognitive impairment by decreasing emotional distress and fatigue, by decreasing
      inflammation, and by strengthening brain functional connectivity. The aim of the present
      study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of a mindfulness-based intervention
      to reduce cognitive impairment in breast-cancer patients after chemotherapy.

      Methods: The present study is a three-group randomized controlled trial with assessments at
      baseline, one-three weeks after the intervention and at three months follow-up. One hundred
      twenty breast cancer patients who ended treatment minimum 6 months and maximum 5 years before
      and who have cognitive complaints will be enrolled. They will be randomized into one of the
      following three study arms: (1) a mindfulness-based intervention group (n=40), (2) an active
      control condition based on physical training (n=40), or (3) a waitlist control group (n=40).
      Both the mindfulness-based intervention and the active control condition exist of four group
      sessions (3 hours for the mindfulness condition and 2 hours for the physical training) spread
      over 8 weeks. The primary outcomes will be cognitive complaints as measured by the cognitive
      failure questionnaire and changes in brain functional connectivity in the attention network.
      Secondary outcomes will be (1) levels of emotional distress, fatigue, mindfulness; (2)
      neurocognitive tests; (3) structural and functional brain changes using MR imaging, and (4)
      inflammation.

      Discussion: The study will examine the impact of a mindfulness-based intervention on
      cognitive impairment in breast-cancer patients. If the findings of this study confirm the
      effectiveness of a mindfulness-based program to reduce cognitive impairment, it will be
      possible to improve quality of life for ex-cancer patients. We will inform health care
      providers about the potential use of a mindfulness-based intervention as a
      non-pharmaceutical, low-threshold mental health intervention to improve cognitive impairment
      after cancer.

    <description>The mindfulness-based intervention adheres to a standardized protocol developed from the MBSR curriculum (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). The program consists of four 3h group sessions spread over 8 weeks. Each session consists of guided experiential mindfulness exercises (e.g. focus on the breath, body scan, breathing space, mindful movement, sitting meditation), sharing of experiences of these exercises, reflection in small groups, psycho-education (e.g. stress, depression, fear of cancer recurrence, self-care) and review of home practices.</description>

    <description>This intervention is based on the recommended levels of physical activity for adults aged 18 - 64 year from the World Health Organization. These recommendations are the same for women after a breast cancer treatment (Schmitz et al., 2010). Just as the mindfulness intervention this will consist of four 2h group sessions spread over 8 weeks. Each session will consist of psycho-education (e.g. basics of movement, advantages of physical activity, training-principles), endurance and resistance training, stretching, balance and relaxation exercises, sharing of experiences of these exercises and review of home practices.</description>
