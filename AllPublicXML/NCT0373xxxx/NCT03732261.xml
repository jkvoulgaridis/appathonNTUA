  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in America has risen to epidemic levels over the past 20 years. For women,
      childbearing itself could be a contributing factor to this high prevalence of excess weight.
      In addition, for women who breastfeed, lactation is a time of rapid bone loss due to
      hyperprolactinemia, amenorrhea, and increased bone turnover, especially in the lumbar spine
      and hip. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first
      6 months, continue to at least 12 months with the introduction of complementary foods and up
      to 2 years. Breastfeeding helps reduce long term maternal weight retention from pregnancy,
      the risk of childhood obesity and provides a number of immunological factors to promote the
      immune system and gastrointestinal system of the neonate.

      Bone loss due to lactation is usually reversed with weaning; however, not all women recover
      from this bone loss which increases the risk of osteoporosis later in life. Weight bearing
      exercise and dairy intake (milk, yogurt, cheese) plus vitamin D supplementation may provide
      some protection from bone loss. Thus, the objective of this study is to promote long-term
      lifestyle changes that support healthy lifelong weight management through a community based
      exercise intervention and daily yogurt consumption program aimed at overweight- to- obese
      lactating postpartum women.

      The specific aims of this project are to evaluate in overweight lactating women at 6 and 20
      weeks postpartum (PP) whether an exercise and yogurt supplementation intervention, compared
      to a minimal care group, will:

        1. Improve body composition. The working hypothesis for this aim, based on previous studies
           (Lovelady et al 2009; Colleran et al 2012), is thatthe intervention group will have less
           loss of lean body mass and bone mineral density but more fat loss compared to the
           minimal care group at 20 weeks PP.

        2. Promote an increase in cardiovascular fitness. The working hypothesis for this aim,
           based on previous studies (Lovelady et al 2009; Colleran et al 2012), is that the
           intervention group will exhibit an increase in predicted maximal oxygen consumption and
           maximal strength compared to the minimal care group at 20 weeks PP.

        3. Increase immunological factors within breastmilk. The working hypothesis for this aim,
           based on a previous study (Lovelady et al 2003), is that the intervention group will
           exhibit an increase in IgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme and Bidfidus factor concentrations in
           breast milk which will improve immunological benefits to the nursing infant.

    <description>Intervention Group: Women randomized to the intervention group will be given a 3month membership to a community based exercise program, a pedometer and individual dietary recommendations. They will be asked to attend a minimum of three 45 minute to 60 minute exercise sessions per week but no more than five and will gradually build to walk 10,000 steps per day. Childcare and breastfeeding support will be provided. Trained research assistants will lead all group sessions. Weekly workout volume will be calculated and weekly steps will be monitored by research assistants. For the dietary intervention, the women will be provided 6oz of plain yogurt fortified with vitamin D post workout for the 12-week intervention. If any yogurt is out of date (expired), we will dispose of the expired yogurt. Weekly monitoring for the consumption of the yogurt and energy intake will be conducted by face-to-face or telephone interviews by research assistants.</description>

    <description>Minimal Care Group: Women randomized into the minimal care group will be asked not to participate in any structured exercise or make any changes in their diet. They will be permitted to walk their infants in strollers at a leisurely pace (no faster than 2 mph) for no more than 30 minutes per day. After the endpoint measurements of the 12-wk intervention, the minimal care group will be asked to join the community based program provided to the intervention group. The participants will be given the pedometer, individual dietary recommendations and yogurt. Additionally, support by the PI and research assistants for exercise and diet will be provided until the one-year postpartum laboratory measurement.</description>

    <description>The 12-week study invention will take place between 6 to 8-weeks postpartum and 18 to 20-weeks postpartum, with a follow-up at one year postpartum. The six-week postpartum time point is to allow for exercise clearance from the participant's obstetrician. The exercise clearance is needed prior to the baseline laboratory measurement. Women will be randomized to an intervention group or minimal care group after all baseline measurements (anthropometrics, cardiovascular fitness test, human milk and blood samples and DXA) at six-weeks postpartum. A random numbers table will be used to stratify by parity and determine groups.</description>
