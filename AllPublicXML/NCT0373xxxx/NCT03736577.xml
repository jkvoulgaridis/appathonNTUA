  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to explore if a structured drug review will change clinical
      symptoms and the psychotropic drugs prescription rate in the elderly living in nursing homes
      (participants of the study). The study will examine how training of nursing home physicians
      on reviewing prescription lists using the Norwegian general practice criteria - Nursing homes
      (NorGeP-NH) will influence the participants` clinical symptoms such as cognition, depression,
      anxiety and their quality of life. Secondary, we will analyse how a structured drug review
      will influence further psychotropic drug prescribing rates in nursing homes.

      The hypothesis for this study are:

        1. Training of nursing home physicians on doing a systematic drug review will decrease the
           participants' clinical symptoms and improve their Quality of Life.

        2. A systematic drug review will decrease the psychotropic drug prescription rates compared
           to before the drug review.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Norwegian national guidelines recommend a very cautious use of psychotropic drugs in the
      elderly, especially for treating dementia-related symptoms. These drugs should be used at a
      very low dosage and for as short a time as possible. Despite these strict guidelines,
      patients with and without dementia living in nursing homes still receive a high amount of
      psychotropic drugs. Thus, there should be a higher focus on lowering the use of psychotropic
      medications in nursing homes. A reduction of prescription of potential harmful and
      inappropriate drugs for the elderly may improve the clinical symptoms of the patients, reduce
      the interaction between drugs and the side-effects, and thereby improving the quality of life
      of the patients.

      In 2018 the Norwegian Institute of Public Health updated a report about the general health in
      the Norwegian elderly population. This report shows that prescription rates for the majority
      of drugs in the population above 65 years of age have increased in the past 11 years.
      Unfortunately, Norway does not have a prescription registry for patients living in nursing
      homes and according to the same report the drug use and the increase of prescription rates in
      nursing homes is underestimated. During the last years Norwegian authorities, media and user
      organizations have shown a particular interest in this subject, showing how clinical practice
      still differs from national and international guidelines, and focusing on the severity of
      polypharmacy in the elderly living in institutions, particularly concerning patients with
      dementia receiving psychotropic drugs.

      As a result of missing data concerning the real use and increase of drug prescriptions in
      nursing homes, our study will keep exploring the psychotropic drug use in the elderly
      population living in Norwegian nursing homes, and it will increase the knowledge about risk
      factors associated to higher prescription rates. The effect of structured reviews with NorGeP
      is understudied, and the proposed randomized controlled trial could therefore add valuable
      knowledge to the field, by exploring how specific training for health personnel working in
      nursing homes will affect drug prescription in the future.

As the intervention is to introduce a new way to do drug chart reviews, to prevent contamination bias within the nursing home the whole nursing home will have to be treated as a cluster. The recruited nursing homes will be randomized by a statistician to either intervention or control. Before randomization, both physicians working in the recruited facilities and selected personnel, i.e. specialized nurses, will attend a three hours lecture on dementia, depression and anxiety and psychosis on the elderly.</intervention_model_description>
