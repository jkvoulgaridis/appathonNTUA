  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the potential GLP-1-mediated contribution to
      the well-established glucose-lowering effect of sevelamer-induced bile acid sequestration .
      Exendin9-39 has been demonstrated to act as a potent and specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist
      with no partial agonistic potential and is considered a useful tool in the assessment of
      GLP-1 physiology. The aim is to evaluate any contribution of sevelamer-induced GLP-1
      secretion to the reduced plasma glucose concentrations observed after treatment with
      sevelamer. A randomised placebo-controlled cross-over study involving two 17-day treatment
      periods with sevelamer and placebo, respectively, in metformin-treated patients with type 2
      diabetes, will be conducted. The impact of bile acid sequestration on GLP-1 secretion and
      effect will be examined during two randomised experimental days after 15 and 17 days of
      treatment with sevelamer (1,600 mg three times a day) and placebo, respectively. During each
      of these two experimental days, a meal test with concomitant exendin9-39 infusion or placebo
      will be performed (for evaluation of any GLP-1-mediated effects). Postprandial plasma glucose
      excursion is the primary endpoint, and secondary endpoints include postprandial plasma/serum
      excursions of insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic
      polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), peptide YY (PYY), oxyntomodulin, ghrelin,
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-19, FGF-21, C4 (an intermediate in the de novo synthesis of
      bile acids), cholecystokinin (CCK), bile acids and plasma lipids. Furthermore, gastric
      emptying, gallbladder emptying, liver fat content, appetite and ad libitum food intake will
      be examined.
