    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies the side effects of endobronchial ultrasound guided interstitial
      photodynamic therapy work in treating patients with lung cancer that has spread to nearby
      tissues or lymph nodes. Photodynamic therapy consists of injecting a light sensitive drug
      called a photosensitizer, such as porfimer sodium, into the vein, waiting for it to
      accumulate in the tumor, and then activating it with a red laser light. Giving photodynamic
      therapy with Porfimer sodium may reduce the tumor size in patients with lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle (EBUS-TBN)
      guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (EBUS-TBN I-PDT) and/or I-PDT and/or photodynamic
      therapy (PDT) in patients with locally advanced lung cancer (LALC) in the central airway,
      using porfimer sodium as a photosensitizer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. To assess the tumor response to treatment.

        -  II. To evaluate local progression-free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine porfimer sodium retention in the target tumor tissue. II. Examine the relationship
      between immune biomarkers and response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes 2-4 hours prior to the
      delivery of I-PDT. Patients then undergo EBUS-TBN guided I-PDT over 30-45 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks.
