  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy is a cornerstone in the management of patients with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary disease (COPD), and supervised walking exercise three times a week over 12 weeks
      improves walking ability and quality of life. Despite this, very few patients exercise on a
      regular basis. The underuse of exercise in COPD patients can partly be explained by
      discomfort during exercise because it evokes dyspnea, and thereby explain lack of
      participation in exercise. If the goal is to offer the best medical therapy to these
      patients, new and effective exercise training methods must be explored and defined since
      exercise training is an important part of pulmonary rehabilitation.

      Intention is to study a new training method called sprint interval training (SIT), which
      consists of high intensity bouts with very short duration. The idea behind SIT is to avoid
      the dyspnea associated with traditional endurance training, thus maximizing exercise power
      without excessive discomfort. The investigators will study training adaptations in patients
      with COPD and compare the results with age-matched controls.

      It is expected that both COPD-patients and healthy elderly will improve exercise cycle time
      until exhaustion after SIT training, and also that the improvement will be larger in the
      healthy group due to higher absolute training intensity.

    <description>Each training session will be performed 3 times per week for 3 weeks. Each session consists of 3-5x20 sec all-out cycling efforts against a load corresponding to 0.05-0.07 kg/kg body mass, separated by 3-5 min of low intensity cycling (20-50 W), on a lode bicycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport V2.0, Groningen, the Netherlands). All training sessions includes a 5 min warm-up and 3 min cool-down.</description>
