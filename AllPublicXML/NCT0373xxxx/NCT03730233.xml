  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-hundred and fifty-nine patients undergoing Nissen fundoplication for symptomatic
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), who had a concomitant hiatal hernia of &gt; 2 cm axial
      length, were randomized to closure of the diaphragmatic hiatus with either crural sutures
      alone or tension-free closure with a non-absorbable mesh. Primary outcome variable was the
      incidence of radiologically verified recurrent hiatal hernia. Secondary outcomes were per-and
      postoperative complications and courses, symptomatic recurrence rate, use of PPI,
      postoperative oesophageal acid exposure and Quality of Life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The basic principles behind successful surgical repair of the anatomy and function of the
      gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is not only to
      encircle the distal oesophagus and GOJ by the fundic wrap but also to complete a transhiatal
      reduction of a concomitant hiatal hernia (type I, HH), aiming for a 2 - 3 cm intra-abdominal
      length of the of oesophagus and to transact a tension-free hiatal closure. The physiological
      and morphological characteristics of the diaphragmatic hiatus, however, carry a challenge for
      the selection of the ideal technique for surgical repair. The diaphragmatic hiatus consists
      of a three-dimensional structure in constant motion, which creates a border between the
      counteracting pressures prevailing in the abdominal and chest cavities, respectively.
      Following hernia reduction, the structural quality of the diaphragmatic pillars is usually
      weak, offering poor support for the subsequent closure with risk for high recurrence rates.
      These and other considerations have encouraged the exploration of mesh reinforcement to
      enhance the durability of the hiatal closure.

    <masking_description>The randomization process was initiated after general anesthesia had been induced and the group affiliation was determined by opening of a sealed envelope specifying the group assignment. The subsequent operation report, with information on the specific type of repair performed, was not included in the digital patient-chart. Instead, a hard copy was printed and kept in a sealed envelope, which was filed in a locked archive to maintain the patient, staff and clinical assessors blinded to the study group allocation.</masking_description>

Thereafter three sagittal spot films (35 x 35 cm) of the distal esophagus and GEJ were exposed 1, 2 and 5 minutes after the start of the barium ingestion (16). In</description>
