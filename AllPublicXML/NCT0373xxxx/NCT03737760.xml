    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the central neural control of mobility in older
      adults by acquiring data with multiple modalities of neuroimaging (EEG, fNIRS, MRI) and
      associating these data with a comprehensive set of diverse mobility outcomes (clinic-based
      walking, complex walking and community mobility measures).

      This study is a longitudinal, prospective cohort study with a follow-up period of 1.2 - 3.5
      years, dependent on when the participant enrolls. Participants will be assessed at baseline,
      and then every six months for 3.5 years or until the study ends, whichever comes first.

      The investigators plan to enroll 200 community-dwelling men and women age 70+ years.
