  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with known or suspected primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may be
      eligible for this study. Subjects may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years
      of age. Most participants will be receiving care at the clinical practices of the University
      of Pennsylvania Health System.

      Positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate soft tissue sarcoma
      hypoxia using an investigational radiotracer, 18F-FMISO Subjects will also undergo an 18F-FDG
      PET/CT scan close to the time of their initial hypoxia PET/CT to compare in vivo measures of
      hypoxia to 18F-FDG uptake. The FDG PET/CT may be performed as part of standard clinical care
      or as a research scan. Both PET/CT scans will occur prior to starting new therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Known or suspected soft tissue sarcoma seen on at least one type of standard imaging
             (e.g. CT, ultrasound, MRI, or 18F-FDG PET/CT)

          2. At least 18 years of age

          3. Subjects with local disease or advanced/metastatic disease will be eligible

          4. Willing to consent to use of tissue from biopsy or surgery for the purposes of this
             study

          5. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be
             willing and able to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to study-specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:
