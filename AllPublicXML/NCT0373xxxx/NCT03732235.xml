  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective, minimally invasive therapy that is
      widely used for unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRC-LM) treatment.
      Chemoembolization, however, induces a hypoxic micro-environment, which increases
      neo-angiogenesis, and may promote early progression. For this reason, efficacy may be
      improved by associating TACE with an angiogenesis inhibitor, such as bevacizumab.

      The use of FOLFIRI associate to Bevacizumab is part of clinical practice and is commonly used
      for the therapy of patients with CRC-LM both wild type and mutant.

      This case-control observational study aim to compare patients treated with TACE using
      Irinotecan-loaded embolics followed by systemic Bevacizumab versus patients treated with
      FILFIRI+ Bevacizumab

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TACE is indicated for the treatment of unresectable CRC_LM, patients who are refractory to
      systemic chemotherapy, elderly, or have a poor performance status, and is usually performed
      using irinotecan (IRI) covalently loaded onto embolics.

      Although chemoembolization with irinotecan-loaded embolics results in an objective response,
      this method creates a hypoxic micro-environment. Hypoxia induces and activates the HIF-1 and
      HIF 2 hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, which promote high-level VEGF expression and
      subsequent neo-angiogenesis.

      This may provide a mechanism for early relapse and progression following TACE and strongly
      support a rational for following TACE therapy with a therapeutic inhibitor of angiogenesis,
      such as bevacizumab.

      The use of FOLFIRI associate to Bevacizumab is part of clinical practice and is commonly used
      for the therapy of patients with CRC-LM both wild type and mutant.

      This case-control observational study aim to compare patients treated with TACE using
      Irinotecan-loaded embolics followed by systemic Bevacizumab versus patients treated with
      FILFIRI+ Bevacizumab

    <description>TACE was performed, using 2 ml of LifePearl® with 100 micron diameter (Terumo Europe NV, Leuven, Belgium) loaded with Irinotecan (100 mg), diluted in 5 ml of non-ionic contrast solution and 5 ml of distilled water, infused at fixed speed of 1ml/minute for a median time of 12 minutes (range 8-16 minutes). A second TACE was performed after 30 days if needed according to physician choice.
Bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) therapy was initiated 15 days after first round of TACE and was repeated every two weeks, for a total of 8 cycles.</description>

        This was a prospective observational single center study.that involved CRC-LM patients
        treated with TACE, using irinotecan-loaded PEG embolics (LIFIRI), followed by the
        intravenous administration of bevacizumab. This group was compared to CRC-LM patients
        treated with FOLFIRI+Bevacizumab.

        CRC-LM patients were instructed by physician about the study procedures and after signing
        informed consent choose the type of theratment TACE+bevacizumab or FOLOFIRI+bevacizumab
