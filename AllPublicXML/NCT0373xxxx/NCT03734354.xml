      This study is a single-center, open-label study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, tolerability
      and safety of single dose oral brexpiprazole tablets in healthy Chinese subjects. A total of
      30 healthy adult subjects are to be enrolled into the study. Three dose groups will be set
      up, with about 10 subjects in each dose group. Subjects will enter 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg dose
      groups in sequence.

      A total of 30 healthy adult subjects are to be enrolled into the study. Three dose groups
      will be set up, with about 10 subjects in each dose group. Subjects will enter 1 mg, 2 mg and
      4 mg dose groups in sequence.

      After the clinical trial responsible physicians obtain the informed consent forms from
      subjects, the subjects will be screened 14 days to 1 days prior to taking the study drug
      (D-14~D-1).

      One day prior to dosing in each group (D-1), the included subjects are hospitalized On the
      next day (D1), after completed the hospitalization inspection, eligible subjects will be
      assigned subject numbers to start with the first dose, complete corresponding examination,
      stay in hospital for observation and be discharged on Day 4 of medication. On days 6, 8, 10,
      12 blood samples are collected and safety evaluation will be performed. Telephone follow-up
      will be performed on day Day31.

      Blood samples are collected to determine and evaluate blood concentrations of Brexpiprazole
      and its main metabolite DM-3411 before dosing, and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72,
      96, 120, 168, 216, 264 hours after dosing, with 18 sampling points in total.
