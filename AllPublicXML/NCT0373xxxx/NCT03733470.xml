    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the events leading to smoking-associated
      centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema are caused by a failure of the lungs' inherent
      mechanisms to block hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) in areas of smoking-induced
      inflammation.

      Overall goals of this study are to 1) determine the effects on sildenafil on the
      heterogeneity perfused blood volume in smokers susceptible to emphysema using dual energy CT
      2) utilize pulmonary blood volume heterogeneity as an image-based biomarker to differentiate
      normal and susceptible smokers.

          <description>22 subjects recruited. Pre-sildenafil we imaged with no contrast at TLC and 20% vital capacity (VC). To assess perfused blood volume (PBV), we imaged at 20% VC . For the intervention, the subject were administered 20 mg of oral Sildenafil and PBV imaging was repeated one hour after sildenafil.
One group was labeled emphysema non-susceptible (NS) and another was emphysema susceptible (SS) based upon visual identification of emphysema in non-contrast CT scans. Of 22 subjects, 3 were eliminated because of blood pressure or asthma medications and two more were eliminated after scanning because of mis-matched pre and post sildenafil lung volumes, leaving 7NS and 10SS subjects. The study was designed to determine if the NS subjects have a greater coefficient of variation (CV) within 30x30x40 regions (approximately the size of an acinus) and whether sildenafil would eliminate the difference between medians of the per block CV histograms for NS and SS.</description>
