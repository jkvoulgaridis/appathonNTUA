  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WHO: 40 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) able to engage in
      moderate physical activity.

      WHY: The purpose of this study is to evaluate two computerized brain training tools, which
      include light physical activity, to see if they can help improve cognitive functions, such as
      memory and attention, for patients with MS.

      WHAT: Complete a set of tests (physical and cognitive) at baseline, wear a Fitbit Flex device
      at home for the duration of the study, 3 supervised sessions for 4 weeks at UCSF, one visit
      for physical and cognitive tests at one week after the final supervised session, and one
      final visit 6 months after the final supervised session.

      WHERE: 20 participants at the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences (675 Nelson Rising Lane,
      San Francisco, CA); 20 participants at Lausanne University Hospital (Rue du Bugnon 46, 1005
      Lausanne, Switzerland)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dual-site trial with identical study activities taking place at both locations. If
      you live in/near San Francisco, study visits will take place at UCSF; if you live in/near
      Lausanne, Switzerland, study visits will take place at the Lausanne University Hospital.

      You will be asked to attend one initial session for cognitive tests and answer questions
      regarding your medical history to see if you are eligible for the study. This process takes
      about 20 minutes. If you are eligible you will be asked to schedule the following
      appointments to participate:

      First you will be randomized into one of two different training programs. You will not be
      able to choose which program you are placed in, but have equal chances of being randomized
      into each:

        -  Program 1 involves brain training games displayed on a large screen. Participants will
           use whole-body movements to complete game tasks. Tasks involve movements such as
           reaching, stepping, and jogging in place. These movements are tracked by a motion
           sensor. Stretching, warm-up, and cool down sessions will be mandated prior to and
           following the tasks.

        -  Program 2 involves brain training and guided, light physical exercise games on a tablet
           device. The exercise involves movements such as reaching, stepping, and stretching.
           Stretching, warm-up, and cool down sessions will be mandated prior to and following the
           tasks.

      Baseline Visit: This session should take about two hours. You will be given some cognitive,
      visual and physical tests. You will be given questionnaires about your mood, fatigue and
      function. You will receive a Fitbit Flex to be worn daily for the duration of the study. The
      Fitbit will track daily active step count, number of active minutes, quality/length of sleep
      cycles.

      Week 1-4 Visits (12 sessions in total): These sessions will be 1 hour and 30 minutes each
      (Note: the first session will be 2 hours to account for calibrations). You will come in three
      times a week for four weeks to attend on-site sessions. You will be asked to complete
      digital, cognitive and physical training at each one of these visits.

      Post-Training Visit: You will be asked to come in for an assessment 1 week after completing
      your last training session. This visit will take about 2 hours. You will be asked to complete
      some cognitive, visual, and physical tests. You will be given questionnaires on mood,
      fatigue, and everyday function. You will also return the Fitbit you received at the start of
      the study.

      A final follow-up visit will occur 6 months after you have completed your last training
      session. This visit will take about two hours. You will be asked to complete some cognitive,
      visual and physical tests. You will be given questionnaires on mood, fatigue and function.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in processing speed after 4 weeks of treatment with computerized gaming rehabilitation paired with physical activity 'Program 1', vs. 'Program 2'.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Processing speed is being measured by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score. SDMT measures the time to pair abstract symbols with specific numbers. The test requires visuoperceptual processing, working memory, and psychomotor speed. The score is the number of correctly coded items in 90 seconds. (max=110, min=0). Higher scores indicate improvement. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attention after 4 weeks of treatment with computerized gaming rehabilitation paired with physical activity 'Program 1', vs. 'Program 2'.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Attention is measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA). This computerized culture- and language-free test uses both visual and auditory stimuli to assess the speed and accuracy of attentional processing deficits in the domain of attention (Greenberg, 1998). Initially devised for ADHD in children, its predictive power has been demonstrated in other patient groups with attention and memory impairments (Braverman et al., 2006): domains also largely impaired in MS. The TOVA has furthermore been chosen here because positive effects following BBT training in young adults have been observed on this test (ongoing study at the Neuroscape Center at UCSF, unpublished data).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mood after 4 weeks treatment with Program 1 vs. Program 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mood is measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression (CES-D), which asks participants to rank 20 different symptoms on a severity scale of 0 to 3. The score is the sum of these subscales (max=60, min=0). Scores of 16 or greater are indicative of higher risk for clinical depression.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fatigue after 4 weeks treatment with Program 1 vs. Program 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue is being measured by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) which has participants rank 21 items on 0 to 4 (never to always) scale. The score is the sum of these subscales. (max=84, min=0) Lower scores indicate improvement. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in MS-related outcomes after 4 weeks treatment with Program 1 vs. Program 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>These outcomes will include MSQOL54 that has patients rank responses to 12 sub-scales: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. This provides a composite score (min=0, max=100) which can be broken down into two summary scores for physical health and mental health. These scores are derived from a weighted combination of scale scores.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attentional behavior after 4 weeks of treatment with Program 1 vs Program 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Rating Scale of Attentional Behavior (RSAB) is a 14-item questionnaire and validated standard assessment of everyday life attention. A higher composite score (min=0, max=75) indicates poor attentional behavior.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety after 4 weeks of treatment with Program 1 vs Program 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both state and trait anxiety are measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The outcome is a composite score (min=20, max=80) for STAI-state and STAI-trait sub-scales. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety levels.</description>
