  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is reported to have significant beneficial effects in Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      patients, particularly with respect to cardiovascular function, aerobic capacity, muscular
      strength and ambulatory performance. Inflammation-mediated synaptic alterations have been
      measured by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and found to correlate with
      disability level in MS. Due to their plastic nature, synapses represent a good therapeutic
      target that is sensitive to environmental stimulation, such as physical exercise.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise in reducing peripheral
      inflammation that drives the synaptic pathology and neurodegeneration occurring in the brain
      of MS patients. Recruited patients will be given a therapeutic exercise program, consisting
      of 3 hours of treatment per day, 6 days/week for 4 weeks. The program will be applied on
      hospitalised patients to ensure adherence to the program and reducing the risk of
      abandonment. The rehabilitation program will be planned by a physician specialised in
      physical and rehabilitation medicine and will consist of both passive and active therapeutic
      exercises specifically aimed at restoring or maintaining muscular flexibility, range of
      motion, balance, coordination of movements, postural passages and transfers, and ambulation.
      The day of recruitment (t0) patients will undergo radiological and neurological examination.
      The effect of exercise will be evaluated with respect to neurologic function, mood and
      neurophysiological parameters, autonomic system function, and peripheral marker levels
      assessed at t0 and after 4 weeks (t1). A second time point will be included (t2, 8 weeks
      after the end of the treatment) to address long-term effects, with analysis limited to
      neurologic and mood measurements and peripheral marker levels.

    <textblock>
      Clinical manifestations of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) indicate the involvement of motor,
      sensory, visual, and autonomic systems as well as brain circuits implicated in cognition and
      emotion.

      Due to the complexity and the heterogeneity of the disease course and the clinical symptoms,
      the search for the appropriate personalized treatment and the disease management remains a
      challenging issue. Nowadays, it is increasingly recognized that MS treatment and care demand
      a multi-disciplinary approach, including non-pharmacological interventions, aimed to improve
      quality of life (QoL) and engagement in daily-life activities. Active-rehabilitation or
      exercise is currently considered as the form of non-medical interventions that best meets
      these requirements.

      In the context of MS, there is now general agreement on the positive effects of exercise for
      both relapsing remitting (RR) and progressive (P) MS patients. Significant effects have been
      described for cardiovascular functions, aerobic capacity, muscular strength and ambulatory
      performance. Even if clear conclusions cannot be drawn, other outcomes, like balance and
      depression seem to be positively influenced by exercise. Symptoms linked to autonomic
      dysfunction caused by sympathovagal imbalance, like altered heart rate variability (HRV) and
      correlating with the load of inflammation in MS may benefit from exercise, being the physical
      activity an important modulator of the peripheral nervous system. However, the DMT potential
      of exercise is still overlooked, since only few studies have investigated the influence of
      exercise on inflammation and neurodegeneration, the main pathogenic events in MS with unclear
      and, to some extent, contrasting data.

      This longitudinal study aims is designed to enrol at least 35 MS patients to perform a
      conventional 4 weeks rehabilitation program. Physical therapy will be performed for 6
      days/week for 4 weeks and will consist of 3 hours of treatment. The rehabilitation program
      will be planned by a physician specialized in physical and rehabilitation medicine and will
      consist of both passive and active therapeutic exercises specifically aimed at restoring or
      maintaining muscular flexibility, range of motion, balance, coordination of movements,
      postural passages and transfers, and ambulation. According to the patient's disability
      status, different therapeutic exercises will be performed by qualified physiotherapists.
      Moreover, intensity of exercise will be tailored to the level of patient's disability. To
      avoid fatigue and to increase patient's tolerance to the exercises, compensative pauses will
      be included. Moreover, genotype analysis from peripheral blood cells will be performed to
      identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions and/or gene regulators
      (microRNA or proteins) involved in MS synaptic transmission alterations, like NGF, PDGF,
      which might correlate to clinical parameters described as both primary and secondary
      outcomes.

      Statistical analysis will be performed by IBM SPSS Statistics 15.0. Data will be tested for
      normality distribution through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences between pre- and
      post-values will be analyzed using parametric Student's t-test for matched pairs, or if
      necessary, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched pairs. Changes in categorical
      variables will be assessed by McNemar test. Correlation analysis will be performed by
      calculating Pearson or Spearman coefficients as appropriate. Data will be presented as the
      mean (standard deviation, sd) or median (25th- 75th percentile). The significance level is
      established at p&lt;0.05.

      Sample size calculation was performed according to the following criteria. Supposing that in
      MS patients the cytokine values in particular the TNF levels after exercise therapy decrease
      in a manner similar to that showed in the study by Hedegaard et al (2008), the investigators
      can estimate that the therapy will have a medium effect on TNF values, d=0.59, calculating a
      pre-mean value equal to 2611.2 (standard deviation, sd=1586.96) and post-exercise equal to
      1249.1 (sd=1261.89), a correlation between pre-post values equals to -0.326. To detect as
      significant a moderate effect with a power of 95%, assuming a two-sided a=0.05 and applying a
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched pairs, the investigators estimate a total number of 35
      patients. The analysis was performed by G*POWER v3.1.9.2.

    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is a three-part composite clinical measure. Three variables were recommended as primary measures: Timed 25-Foot walk; 9-Hole Peg Test; and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT-3&quot;). The results from each of these three tests are transformed into Z-scores and averaged to yield a composite score for each patient at each time point.
There are 3 components:
the average scores from the four trials on the 9-HPT;
the average scores of two 25-Foot Timed Walk trials;
the number correct from the PASAT-3. The scores for these three dimensions are combined to create a single score that can be used to detect change over time. This is done by creating Z-scores for each component.
MSFC Score = {Zarm, average + Zleg, average + Zcognitive} / 3.0 (Where Zxxx =Z-score) Increased scores represent deterioration in the 9-HPT and the 25-Foot Timed Walk, whereas decreased scores represent deterioration in the PASAT-3.</description>

    <description>Cortical excitability will be probed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using Magstim devices (The Magstim Company, Whitland, Dyfed, UK). One stimulator will be connected to a figure-of-eight coil (external wing diameter 70 mm) placed tangentially over the scalp in the optimal position for eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the dominant hand. To test the interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) we will apply a paired-pulse (conditioning-test) TMS paradigm. Paired pulses will be given with interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 10 and 40 ms. LTP will be assessed by the intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol. iTBS consists of three-pulse bursts given at 80% AMT and 50 Hz frequency, repeated every 200 ms (i.e. at 5 Hz) and delivered over the FDI muscle hot spot, for a total number of 600 stimuli. We will record and average fifteen MEPs of about 1 mV peak-to-peak in amplitude at baseline before iTBS.</description>

    <description>Heart rate variability (HRV) will be assessed under standardized environmental conditions. ECG will be recorded by standard methods. The analysis will be performed in the frequency domain using a dedicated software. Stable heart rate (HR) periods of 5 minutes duration will be chosen in the last 6 minutes of a 30-minute supine rest. Power spectral analysis will consider a high frequency (HF) component, reflecting mostly vagal activity, and a low frequency (LF) component, reflecting mostly sympathetic activity. Spectral components in normalized units (LFnu, HFnu) will be considered. As an index of sympathovagal balance, we will use the LF/HF ratio.</description>

    <description>Within few hours after the withdrawal, the peripheral blood will be processed to isolate plasma, serum and cells.
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) will be isolated by Ficoll hystopaque gradient centrifugation, according to standard techniques and soon frozen in -80 and next processed to isolate T cells by magnetic immunosorting with FITC-CD3 antibody and microbeads-conjugated anti-FITC antibody (Miltenyi, Biotec). TNF and IL-1b released by T cells in culture medium will be measured by using commercial ELISA kit. Data will be expressed as picograms per milliliter (pg/ml).</description>
