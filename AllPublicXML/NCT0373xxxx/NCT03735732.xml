      The current proposal aims to investigate neuronal correlates of implicit and explicit priming
      paradigms for changing cue-dependent and goal-directed nutritional behavior.

      Food choice and intake is a daily and throughout normal subject. However, for more and more
      people eating habits and the question of food choice are of increasing interest and in
      several cases even a problem. The prevalence of obesity has tripled in the last decades and
      it is even spoken of an obesity epidemic. Life style interventions to lose weight often fail
      on the long run, also because people fall back into former unhealthy eating habits. Various
      factors influence our daily food choice, not all of which are apparent to ourselves. Thus,
      food choice might be goal-directed and therefore conscious and reflective, yet in other
      circumstances the choice to eat something specific might be based on cue dependent processes
      which are automatic and thus difficult to control. Since a change in eating-behavior and
      long-lasting weight loss is most problematic to achieve, the current proposal aims to
      investigate neuronal correlates of implicit and explicit priming paradigms for changing
      cue-dependent and goal-directed nutritional behavior.
