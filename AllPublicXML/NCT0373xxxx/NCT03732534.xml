  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, rollover study to collect long-term safety, tolerability, and
      investigator- and participant-reported pharmacodynamic (PD) data after chronic administration
      of NBI-98854 in pediatric participants with Tourette Syndrome (TS), as well as to provide
      open-label access to NBI-98854 for the treatment of TS for pediatric participants who have
      taken part in a Phase 2 NBI-98854 study.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Study stopped early due to investigational drug not meeting primary endpoint in the main study
    T-Force GOLD (NBI-98854-TS2003); no safety concerns identified.
