      This study evaluates a mindfulness-based treatment to concurrently target cigarette smoking
      and alcohol use behaviors in adults.

      Aim 1: Modify an existing mindfulness-based treatment to include a focus on smoking cessation
      and reduced alcohol use.

      Aim 2: Evaluate benchmarks regarding the feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness Based
      Relapse Prevention -Smoking and Alcohol Use.

      Aim 3: Collect and examine descriptive data on proximal and distal variables associated with
      increased smoking abstinence and reduced drinking.
