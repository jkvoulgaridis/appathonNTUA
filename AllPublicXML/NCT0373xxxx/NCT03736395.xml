  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine the scale-up of Schoolwide Positive Behavior Intervention Supports
      (SWPBIS), specifically focusing on rural schools in Idaho. The Idaho Rural Implementation
      Model (I-RIM) is an approach designed to improve SWPBIS implementation in rural schools, via
      strategies such as capacity-building, regional coordination, online learning modules, and
      technical assistance. The study uses a cluster randomized design to allocate 40 schools to
      one of two conditions: control and intervention. Schools in the control condition will
      receive basic SWPBIS training. Schools in the intervention condition will receive the basic
      SWPBIS training plus additional I-RIM supports. To assess SWPBIS implementation and outcomes,
      process and outcome measures will be collected. Outcomes will include school implementation
      observations, and teacher and staff implementation measures. Student-level outcomes will
      include behavior, perceived climate, and academic achievement as measured by the standardized
      state test. Student-level data include those that are part of standard data collection by
      schools (such as academic outcomes) and will be de-identified by school officials before
      sending to the researchers for analysis.

      The long-term goal of this project is to support rural schools in implementing practices that
      can improve student safety and social-emotional outcomes, through the use of Schoolwide
      Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (SWPBIS). Rural schools experience challenges in
      implementing systems-changes, and the Idaho Rural Implementation Model (I-RIM) is an approach
      specifically designed to improve SWPBIS implementation in rural schools through strategies
      such as capacity-building, regional coordination, online learning modules, and technical
      assistance. These approaches are all designed to meet the unique challenges and strengths of
      schools in rural settings.

      The study uses a cluster randomized design to allocate 40 schools to one of two conditions:
      control or intervention. Schools in the control condition will receive basic SWPBIS training.
      Schools in the intervention condition will receive the basic SWPBIS training plus additional
      I-RIM supports. This trial is designed to address several aims:

      Aim 1: To test the impact of the I-RIM intervention on student-level outcomes, including
      behavioral outcomes, academic test scores, and perceived safety/climate.

      Aim 2. To examine whether changes in student outcomes are mediated by school-level
      improvements in the speed and fidelity with which SWPBIS is implemented.

      Aim 3. To identify school-level factors that are associated with SWPBIS implementation
      (moderators of intervention effectiveness).

      At all schools, baseline data collection will begin in early 2019. The intervention will
      begin in the spring of 2019 with selected elements of the I-RIM intervention (regional
      meetings, and a coaching institute) for schools in the intervention condition. All schools
      will begin SWPBIS implementation in the 2019-20 school year, which will continue through the
      2020-2021 school year. Data collection points will be identical for schools in both
      conditions. Primary student outcome measures include data that are already gathered by
      schools, including: behavioral outcomes including office disciplinary referrals, suspensions,
      and expulsions; academic test scores; and perceived climate.

    <description>The Idaho Rural Implementation Model (I-RIM) includes several aspects to support implementation of schoolwide positive behavioral interventions and supports (SWPBIS). In the first year, schools will send a staff member to a coaching institute to build internal capacity. Schools will also receive technical assistance (on-site twice per year and virtual support as needed). Schools will also receive statewide professional learning opportunities, through one group meeting per year, and through access to an invitation-only professional learning community.</description>
