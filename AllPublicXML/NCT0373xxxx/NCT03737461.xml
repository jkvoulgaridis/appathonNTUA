  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, prospective, double blind, randomized phase 2/3 trial comparing
      culture-expanded allogeneic adult BM-MSCs with sham-treated controls.

      This trial will evaluate the efficacy of intradiscal injection of BM-MSCs in chronic low back
      pain due to lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) unresponsive to conventional therapy .

      Visual analog scale (VAS) and functional status (by Oswestry Disability Index - ODI) will be
      evaluated 12 months after treatment, defining responders in case of improvement of VAS for
      pain of at least 20% and 20 mm between baseline and month 12, or improvement of ODI of 20%
      between baseline and month 12.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative disc disease (DDD) presents a large, unmet medical need. One of the most
      important public health problems, it affects 70 million Europeans, accounts for 42% of
      patients with chronic low back pain and costs over $100 billion each year in the European
      Union. DDD results in a disabling loss of mechanical function. Today, no efficient therapy is
      available. The disease results from degeneration of cartilage discs with loss of the collagen
      matrix and nucleus pulposus chondrocyte. Chronic cases often receive surgery, which may lead
      to biomechanical problems and accelerated degeneration of adjacent segments. Our consortium
      partners have developed and studied stem cell-based, regenerative therapies with encouraging
      results in phase 1 and 2 trials. Patients exhibited rapid and progressive improvement of
      functional and pain indexes by 50% within 6 months and by 65% to 78% after 1 year with no
      side effects. In addition, MRI T2 relaxation measurements demonstrated a significant
      improvement of cartilage signal. To develop the world's first effective treatment of DDD,
      RESPINE aims to assess, via a randomized, controlled, phase 3 clinical trial including 112
      patients with DDD, the efficacy of an allogenic intervertebral mesenchymal stem cell
      (MSC)-based therapy. This innovative therapy aims to rapidly (within 3 months) and durably
      (at least 24 months) reduce pain and disability. In addition, the consortium aims to provide
      new knowledge on immune response &amp; safety associated with allogeneic BM-MSC intradiscal
      injection.

The &quot;quality&quot; of the patient's lumbar disc will be monitored non invasively using T2-weighted MRI sagittal images (Orozco et al., 2011) and, in T1spin/echo MRI. Lumbar disc grading will be performed in the sagittal T2 weighted images by two physicians independently who were experienced in MRI of the spine. They will review each intervertebral disc from L1-2 to L5-S1 by the modified Pfirrmann criteria. The modified Pfirrmann grading system assesses degenerated intervertebral discs by MRI for the asymmetry in disc structure, distinction of the nucleus and the annulus, signal intensity of intervertebral discs and height of intervertebral discs and assigns grade 1 to 8 for disc degeneration (Table by Griffin et al.

For this purpose, resource use in each arm will be collected in physical units in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) at each clinical centre as follows:
Acute care medical hospitalisations related to DDD
Acute care surgical hospitalisations related to DDD
Rehabilitation hospitalisations related to DDD
