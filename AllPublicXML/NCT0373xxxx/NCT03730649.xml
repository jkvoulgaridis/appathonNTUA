  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to compare the expression of both keratin 16 and 17 before and after application
      of sulforaphane on both photoprotected and photoexposed area, and to determine whether these
      findings alter skin aging as well as skin response to ultraviolet (UV) and visible light
      exposure.

      The study is to compare the expression of both keratin 16 and 17 before and after application
      of sulforaphane on both photoprotected and photoexposed area, and to determine whether these
      findings alter skin aging as well as skin response to ultraviolet (UV) and visible light
      exposure.

      Each study participant will have up to eight study visits. Topical sulforaphane will be
      applied for up to 6 months. Photography, clinical assessment, UV light irradiation, Visible
      light treatment, Skin biopsies, non invasive elasticity measurements such as cutometer and
      ballistometer, and others will be involved in this study.
