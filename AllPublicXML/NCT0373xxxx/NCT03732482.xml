  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the improvement of systemic therapeutic effect(especially in the population with driver
      gene mutation), the incidence of brain metastases had significantly increased. Conventional
      Whole Brain radiotherapy(WBRT) was less effective, the stereotactic radiosurgery(SRS)
      technique had improve the local efficacy for 1-3 lesions, but the probability of intracranial
      recurrence was increased, Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy With Simultaneous Integrated
      Boost(SIB-IMRT) is a new radiotherapy technology, Giving a standard radiation dose of whole
      brain ,at the same time can boost the high-risk region in target, So that it can
      significantly shorten the treatment time, at the same time can improve the local control rate
      of brain metastases. In the aspect of normal tissue protecting, SIB was better than WBRT plus
      SRS sequential treatment pattern. 30Gy to the whole brain had a negative effects on cognitive
      function, the investigators previous study found that 25Gy to the whole brain while the tumor
      bed Simultaneous push to 50Gy was safe and effective, while reducing the impact on cognitive
      function. Hippocampus is a part of the brain located in the temporal lobe, Mainly responsible
      for long-term memory storage conversion and orientation. Many investigators point out that
      hippocampus is the main commander of neurocognitive function, Reduce the dose of hippocampus
      can significant improve the neurocognitive function. Temozolomide capsule is an anti-tumor
      alkylation agent for glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma. In recent years,
      some researchers find that Temozolomide capsules combine with radiotherapy such as SRS, WBRT
      or The two combined, can improve Objective response(OR) and prolong the Progress Free
      Survival(PFS),while with tolerable therapeutic toxicity. In order to better reduce the impact
      on cognitive function and improve the local control rate, the investigators present this
      trial, under the SIB-IMRT technique, the investigators want to explore the effect of
      temozolomide in brain metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer with the hippocampal
      protection technology.
