  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Silk
      Peptide for the evaluation of efficacy on immune function enhancement.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate Silk Peptide's efficacy on immune function in healthy volunteers who
      white blood cells count is in between 4000/㎕ and 8000/㎕ by assessing improvements in certain
      immune indices (i.e. NK cell activity, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, 2, 12, IgG1, IgG2).
