    <textblock>
      Participants with moderate to severe Crohn's disease will be enrolled in this study.

      The study will include screening period, remission-induction period (double-blind), rescue
      period (open-label), extension period (open-label), post-observation period, and a follow-up
      period.

      At the end of remission-induction period, participants with reduction in Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) score of 70 points or more when compared to baseline will move on to
      the open-label extension period, and participants with less than 70 points reduction in CDAI
      score will move on to the rescue period. At the end of the rescue period, participants with a
      reduction in the CDAI of 70 points or more will move on to the open-label extension period
      and with less than 70 points reduction in the CDAI score will be discontinued.

      The post-observation period will include in-person assessment after the completion or
      discontinuation of the extension period, and participants will be contacted by telephone,
      etc. after the last dose of study drug administration. Participants will be contacted over
      phone after the last dose of study drug administration for follow up assessments.
