          -  Sensitivity to peanut, defined as one of the following:

        No known history of peanut ingestion and has serum IgE to peanut ≥ 5 kUA/L within 12 months
        before randomization.

        Documented history of physician-diagnosed IgE-mediated peanut allergy that includes the
        onset of characteristic* signs and symptoms of allergy within 2 hours of known oral
        exposure to peanut or peanut-containing food, and has a mean wheal diameter on skin prick
        test (SPT) to peanut of at least 3 mm greater than the negative control (diluent) or serum
        IgE to peanut ≥ 0.35 kUA/L, obtained within 12 months before randomization.

          -  Development of age-appropriate dose-limiting allergy symptoms after consuming single
             doses of peanut protein &gt; 3 mg to ≤ 300 mg in a screening DBPCFC.

          -  A palatable vehicle food to which the subject is not allergic must be available for
             administering study product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe or life‑threatening anaphylaxis anytime before the screening DBPCFC.

          -  History of biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of EoE; other eosinophilic GI disease; chronic,
             recurrent, or severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); or symptoms of dysphagia
             (eg, difficulty swallowing, food &quot;getting stuck&quot;).

          -  Recurrent GI symptoms considered clinically significant in the opinion of the
             investigator.

             idiopathic or chronic physical urticaria beyond simple dermatographism (eg, cold
             urticaria, cholinergic urticaria), and hereditary or idiopathic angioedema.

          -  Moderate or severe persistent asthma (criteria steps 3-6; National Heart, Lung, and
             Blood Institute [NHLBI], 2007).

          -  Recurrent urticaria.

          -  History of failure to thrive or any other form of abnormal growth, or developmental or

             immunomodulatory therapy (including immunosuppressive medications).

          -  Treatment with any form of immunotherapy for any food allergy anytime before
             screening.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the

             psychological disorders) or reason that may interfere with the ability to participate
             in the study, cause undue risk, or complicate the interpretation of data, in the
