  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability and has been described as a
      worldwide epidemic (1). Stroke survivors are affected by impairments and limitations of
      cognitive, language, perceptual, sensory, and motor functions. After a stroke, patients can
      improve spontaneously within the first 3 months (2) and then more slowly in the following
      year. The first day, decreased oedema and partial reperfusion of the ischemic penumbra may
      possibly explain these phenomena, but the improvement of neurological deficit in the
      following weeks suggests plasticity phenomena and brain cortical reorganization (3). While
      most recovery is thought to be made in the first few weeks after stroke, patients may make
      improvements on functional tasks many months after having a stroke (4). Restoring arm and
      hand skill after a stroke remains challenging, even though stroke rehabilitation programs
      have proven partial efficacy Repetitive task training has been shown to be effective in some
      aspects of rehabilitation, such as improving walking distance and speed and improving upper
      limb function (5).

      In this project, the investigators will use &quot;Gloreha ARIA&quot; (7) a new sensor-based therapy
      device designed for motor recovery of impaired upper limb Gloreha Aria offers specific
      programs that help patients to move arm, wrist and fingers. Therapists can customize therapy
      by focusing on a specific motor task.

      The hypothesis was that rehabilitation with this device could be not inferior in comparison
      with hands-on physiotherapy, in the reeducation of upper arm in the patient affected by
      stroke from cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage that had occurred â‰¤ 30 days before.

      The principle purpose of this study will be to evaluate:

        1. The feasibility of this new device

        2. Efficacy in improving arm function abilities in the rehabilitation of patients with
           stroke in the sub-acute phase.

      Post-stroke patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation to the Neurological Rehabilitation
      will be screened for enrolment and randomized in a controlled trial.

      All the patients will be informed about the aim and experimental procedures before enrolment,
      thus written informed consent will be obtained from all of them. Patients included in the
      study will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group according to simple
      randomization technique (computerized random numbers).

    <description>The specific hand intervention consisted of 30 sessions, lasting 60 min/ day, for 6 days/week. All patients will be educated by physiotherapist to perform the movements for wrist, hand and arm in complete autonomy.
In Treatment Group, the movements will be performed using Gloreha ARIA. Gloreha Aria is a sensor-based therapy device designed for motor recovery of impaired upper limb. Gloreha Aria is equipped with sensors that can detect any movements in space: the software processes and displays them on the screen.</description>
