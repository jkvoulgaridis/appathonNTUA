      The study's investigators will record all data related to the immediate postoperative period
      during the child's stay in the post anesthetic recovery room (PAR).

      Just prior to discharge home, the child's discomfort will be measured using Face, Legs,
      Activity, Cry, and Consolability Pain Assessment Tool (FLACC).

      Postoperative data is collected by the same investigator who contacted caregivers by phone at
      4 postoperative times: 1, 3, 7, and 30 days after the DRGA using The Dental Questionnaire.

      When a participant cannot be reached on the scheduled day, the information is collected on
      the nearest subsequent day.

      The postoperative assessment included: the questioner and an inquiry about the use of
      medications; the child's ability to eat a regular diet; and &quot;mouth-related&quot; complaints other
      than dental discomfort.

      Dental discomfort is assessed in this study by 2 scales:

      the FLACC (Table 1) and The Dental Questioner (Table 2).

      FLACC pain assessment tool. The FLACC scale was originally developed to quantify
      postoperative pain in infants from 2 months old to children up to 7-years-old.(7) This scale
      assesses 5 aspects of behavior: (F) facial expression; (L) leg movement; (A) activity; (C)
      cry; and (C) consolability. The range for the total score is from 0 (no pain) to 10 (intense
      pain). The examiner is standardized to use of the FLACC by a PAR nurse who was experienced in
      scoring pain with this scale.

      The Dental Questioner. The questionnaire covered the following items: did the Child have
      pain, bleeding from dental origin, sore throat, fever, vomiting, inability to eat,
      sleepiness, drowsiness, cough, nausea or psychological changes?
