  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resuscitated cardiac arrest (CA) is a frequent cause of admission in intensive care unit
      (ICU). Neurological state of postanoxic comatose patients can evolve either towards the
      absence of awakening or towards a more or less altered state of consciousness, ranging from
      the vegetative state to the full recovery of cognitive functions. Most of the deaths result
      from active withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, based on poor neurological outcome
      prediction. Neurological prognostication needs therefore a multimodal approach based on
      reliable parameters, which should be easy to access and available at the early stage of care,
      in attempt to limit false poor outcome prognostication and help to not prolong futile active
      care in patient with severe post anoxic cerebral lesions. Nowadays the prediction of
      neurological outcome relies on a multimodal strategy including clinical examination,
      biomarkers and electroencephalography (Guidelines ESICM 2015). Early standard
      electroencephalography (EEG) is currently recommended and some features, notably absence of
      reactivity, status epilepticus or burst suppression after rewarming are strongly predictive
      of poor outcome. But those features require a precise analyze of the EEG usually performed by
      specialist. EEG patterns can be simplified and classified in five grades according to the
      Synek classification, ranging from dominant reactive alpha activity (grade 1) to isoelectric
      encephalogram (grade 5). Grade 1 and two are considering as good prognostic, grade 3 as
      intermediate and grade 4 to five as poor prognostic. Nevertheless, few data are available on
      the performance of this classification since generalization of TTM use.

      We hypothesize that a multimodal strategy combining clinical examination, NSE concentration
      and the Synek score would bring a high degree of prediction. We aimed to assess the
      performances of the combination of clinical examination, NSE analysed at 48-72h and the Synek
      score to predict hard outcome defined by a cerebral performance category (CPC) 3-5, in
      postanoxic comatose patients treated with induced hypothermia
