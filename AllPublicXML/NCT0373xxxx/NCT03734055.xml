  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Peer Approaches to Lupus Self-Management (PALS) study is a randomized, controlled in
      which 360 African American women with lupus will be recruited from the MUSC SLE database (60
      mentors and 300 mentees). The peer mentoring intervention (patients will be matched with peer
      mentors who are considered competent in the management of their condition to provide modeling
      and reinforcement to participants) will occur by telephone for approximately 60 minutes every
      two weeks for 24 weeks. All participants will be assessed at baseline, mid-intervention (12
      weeks post-enrollment), immediately following the intervention (24 weeks post-enrollment),
      and 12 months post-enrollment. The study will last 60 months with recruitment and enrollment
      over 48 months, 6 months for intervention delivery and 6 months for data analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Peer Approaches to Lupus Self-Management (PALS) study is a randomized controlled trial
      designed to examine whether a new, culturally tailored peer mentoring intervention improves
      disease self-management, indicators of disease activity, and health related quality of life
      (HRQOL) in African American women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). African American
      women with active SLE will be recruited as mentees and peer mentors. The investigators will
      recruit 300 mentees (150 mentored and 150 support group) and up to 60 mentors. As part of
      each wave, mentors (n=20) will be trained to deliver intervention content, prior to being
      paired with up to three mentees (n=50). The peer mentoring intervention will occur by twelve
      60-minute telephone or video sessions carried out across the course of 24 weeks. In each
      wave, social support controls (n=50) will participate in a lupus support group created for
      this project, on the same schedule as peer mentoring sessions. Both conditions will be
      delivered via Webex, which has several advantages for this intervetion: 1) Sessions are
      easily accesible via phone or computer, allowing participants to choose their preferred
      interaction style; 2) A study coordinator can host the support groups and drop in/out for
      monitoring purposes; 3) There are video- or voice-call options for up to 25 paricipants at a
      time; and 4) This application ensures concordiant delivery methods across both arms of the
      study and the ability to document the frequency that voice and video options are used to
      adjust for participant choices in analyses. All participants (mentees, mentors, and social
      support controls) will be assessed using validated measures of patient reported outcomes and
      clinical indicators of disease activity at baseline, mid-intervention (3 months from
      baseline), immediately post-intervention (6 months from baseline), and 6 months
      post-intervention (12 months from baseline). For each wave, outcomes for mentees randomized
      to the mentored group will be compared with the outcomes of mentees randomized to the support
      group. A booster session will be incorporated for all participants (mentored and support
      group) at 3 months post-intervention to encourage retention.

    <measure>Satisfaction in Quality of Life as assessed by the LUP-QOL (Lupus Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by using The LUP-QOL (Lupus Quality of Life Questionnaire), which assesses areas of the participant's life that may be affected by lupus. The score ranges from 0-100. A score of '0' indicates the lowest quality of life, and a score of 100 indicates the best quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction in Quality of Life as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Measurement System</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) survey is a 13-question subset of the 41-question Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire, with each question having 5 possible answers (not at all; a little bit; somewhat; quite a bit; very much), scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. The full range of FACIT-Fatigue scores is from 0 to 52. Higher scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly lower scores are considered to indicate greater fatigue.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-management</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) assesses an individual's knowledge, skill, and confidence for managing their health and healthcare. Individuals who measure high on this assessment typically understand the importance of taking a proactive role in managing their health and have the skills and confidence to do so. The PAM survey measures patients on a 0-100 scale and can segment patients into one of four activation levels along an empirically derived continuum, including &quot;Believes Active Role Important&quot;, &quot;Confidence and Knowledge to Take Action&quot;, &quot;Taking Action&quot;, and &quot;Staying Course Under Stress&quot;. Each activation level reveals insight into an array of health-related characteristics, including attitudes, motivators, behaviors, and outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Credibility</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To assess for differences in outcome expectancy, a modified treatment credibility scale developed by Borkovec and Nau (1972) will be used. Four of the questions will be used for this study, with 10-point Likert scales. These include questions regarding how logical the treatment seems, how confident participants are about treatment, and their expectancy of success</description>

    <description>Satisfaction with Care will be measured with a previously validated general scale to measure satisfaction/dissatisfaction with health care. The 2-item scale ranges from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree).</description>

    <description>The program will consist of 12 sessions of peer mentoring that will include one standard educational session by telephone or video for approximately 60 minutes every 2 weeks. Additional interaction will be discouraged, but mentees and mentors will be asked to report any additional social interaction should it occur. The bi-weekly educational session will be generally structured in three parts: introduction, structured education, and problem solving. 60-minute calls are necessary for the delivery of educational content and mentors and mentees to be able to discuss their own experiences and potential solutions.</description>
