      Title Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in the Treatment of NSAID-Refractory Axial
      Spondyloarthritis: A Clinical Trial

      Background:

      Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease
      affecting mainly sacroiliac joints and spine. There are limited options for treatment.
      Initial treatments are patient's education, regular physical exercise and nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs(NSAID). If the patients do not respond to at least two NSAIDs in full
      dosages for at least one month then it is called NSAID refractory axSpA. In these cases
      biologics like-tumor necrosis factor α blockers are the options for treatment. Tofacitinib is
      a new drug has been proven to be effective for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis
      , inflammatory bowel disease and supposed to be effective in spondyloarthritis. This study is
      aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in NSAID refractory ax SpA with a view
      to find a safe, effective and affordable treatment modality.

      Method:

      This open label uncontrolled clinical trial with tofacitinib will be conducted in NSAID
      refractory axSpA (age &gt;18 years) patients. Study participants will be enrolled after having
      informed written consent from the outpatient department of Rheumatology, Bangabandhu sheikh
      mujib medical university. Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS)
      criteria will be followed for diagnosis of ax SpA. Patients failing a trial of 2 different
      NSAID each for at least 2 weeks with optimum dosage without response or with partial response
      and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of ≥4 (range, 0-10) or
      Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score-C reactive protein(ASDAS-CRP)&gt;2.1 will be
      considered as primary entry criteria for this study.

      Baseline evaluation will include Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Functional Index
      (BASFI) , Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score-C reactive protein(ASDASCRP) and
      Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score-erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ASDAS-ESR).

      Laboratory tests like CBC, ESR, CRP, SGPT, Serum creatinine and X-ray pelvis A/P view or
      X-ray both SI joints modified Ferguson veiw (to see both SI and hip joints ), HLA-B27(if
      needed), CXR P/A view and MT test or Interferon Gamma Release Assay(IGRA) will be done.

      After considering inclusion and exclusion criteria eligible patients will be included for
      this study. All patients will be put on 5mg tofacitinib BD. NSAID and adjuvant analgesics
      will be used if needed. Follow up will be done at 4th, 12th and 24th week. Response to
      treatment will be evaluated by assessement of spondyloarthritis society (ASAS) response
      criteria. More than 20% improvements from baseline will consider as primary response at the
      end of 12th week. Those patients who will not achieve ASAS20 response at 12th week, will be
      given 10 mg tofacitinib BD. Efficacy will be assessed at the end of 24th week by ASAS20,
      ASAS50, ASAS70, ASDAS-ESR, ASDAS-CRP, BASDAI, Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional
      index(BASFI). Adverse effects will be assesed by history, Physical examinations and
      investigations.

      The entire study subjects will be informed about the nature, purpose and implication of the
      study as well as whole spectrum of benefits and risk of the study. Ethical clearance will be
      taken from the IRB of BSMMU.

      INTRODUCTION Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is one of the most prevalent forms of chronic
      inflammatory arthritis. It affects approximately 0.01-2.5% in the World wide. Estimated
      prevalence of SpA in India is between 0.1 to 0.2% and prevalence in Bangladesh is about 1.2%
      .

      Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of intracellular, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that transduce
      cytokine-mediated signals via theJAK-signal transduction and activation of transcriptors(
      JAK-STAT) pathway. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway transmits information from extracellular
      chemical signals to the nucleus resulting in DNA transcription and expression of genes
      involved in immunity, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and oncogenesis .

      Tofacitinib acts by inhibiting JAK-STAT pathway particularly JAK1 and/JAK3 of multilineage
      cells thereby inhibiting lymphocytes. It inhibits interleukin IL-17, IL-21, IL-23 and
      interferon IFN-γ productions by CD4 T cells acts on dendritic cells(DCs) and suppressed
      inflammatory cytokine productions and expression of costimulatory molecules, also supprressed
      T cell stimulatory capacity of DCs. These indicate that wide range of biological effects of
      tofacitinib that directly and indirectly affect cytokine pathway thereby modulate immunue
      response and reduce inflammations.

      Axial SpA patients treated with tofacitinib experienced clinically meaningful reductions in
      axial MRI inflammations and thereby an increased clinical response rates. A 16-week, phase
      II, randomized trial on AS patients with tofacitinib showed 80.8 % patients achieved ASAS 20
      response .

      As the therapeutic options of NSAID refractory axial SpA are limited, we want to assess the
      efficacy of tofacitinib in refractory axial SpA. In our country there are no studies of
      tofacitinib on axial spondyloarthritis. In Bangladesh, tofacitinib is cheaper than anti TNF
      biologics so it will reduce the treatment cost.

      Rationale of the Study There are limited options for treating NSAID refractory axial SpA.
      Therefore, choosing the appropriate therapeutic options, efficacy, long term safety, and
      tolerability should be considered. Recently, biological agents having anti tumor necrosis
      factor-α (TNF-α) activity are now considered as 1st line treatment for refractory axial SpA.
      But these drugs are costly difficult to afford by most of the people of our country and there
      is also increase risk of activation of the latent tuberculosis, other adverse effects like
      malignancies, hematological disorders and various infections are still a problem. n our
      country this drug is less costly affordable by many people and as it is available as tablet
      form so drug compliance will be better than biological drugs.

      Research Hypothesis

      Null hypothesis:

      Tofacitinib is not effective in NSAID refractory axial SpA.

      Alternative hypothesis:

      Tofacitinib is effective in the treatment of NSAID refractory axial SpA. Tofacitinib is safe
      in the treatment of NSAID refractory axial SpA.

      Objectives Primary Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in the
      treatment of NSAID refractory axial SpA

      Secondary Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of 10 mg and 20 mg tofacitinib in the
      treatment of NSAID refractory axial SpA.

      30 patients with NSAID refractory axial SpA will be enrolled in the study. Informed written
      consent will be obtained from all participants.

      The study subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria will receive tofacitinib 5mg BD.

      All the patients in the study group will go through disease history, clinical examination and
      baseline investigations. Baseline charachteristics and variables will be recorded at
      initiation of therapy, 4th, 12th and 24th week. Primary endpoint of efficacy will be assessed
      using ASAS 20 response at the end of 12 th wk. At the end of 12 th week, those patients will
      achieve primary endpoint will continue with the same dose and those patients who will not
      achieve primary endpoint will be put on tofacitinib10 mg BD. Those patients who will not
      respond to treatment at the end of 24 th wk will discontinue the therapy and put on
      alternative treatment. All the baseline variables will be recorded and statistical analysis
      will be done.

      Patients who develop serious drug related adverse effect like life threatening infection with
      organ involvement or requiring hospital admission will be withdrawn from the the study.

      Safety assessment:

      Clinical and laboratory parameters will be monitor at 1st, 3rd and 6th month.

      Patient follow-up schedule:

      Follow up will be done at the end of 4th, 12th and 24th week. At every follow up detailed
      history, thorough physical examination and some investigations will be done to evaluate the
      adverse effects.

      Laboratory Investigations:

      CBC, ESR, and CRP, S. creatinine, S. ALT and urine RME will be done during follow up.

      Criteria for discontinuing a study participant:

      A participant will be excluded from the study under following circumstances .If any patient
      fails to come for follow-up routinely. If patients develop toxicity -Severe adverse drug
      reactions, Infections (TB) etc. If patients stop to take the drug by themselves .

           analysis The degrees of statistical significance between the intragroup values of the
           endpoints will be analyzed by paired t test if the observations are normally
           distributed, otherwise it will be compared with paired Wilcoxon signed rank test.
           Probabilities of associations will be assessed by calculating Spearman's rank
           correlation coefficient. P values will be regarded as significant if they will &lt;0.05.

      Quality assurance strategy This will be uncontrolled clinical trial. Extensive literature
      search was done. Direct supervision by guide and co-guides will be done. Investigator will be
      sufficiently trained. Patient will purchase the drugs from pharmacy execpt tofacitinib which
      will provide free of cost and all of these drugs will be checked by the investigator. Monthly
      pill count will be done to ensure drug adherence. Patients will be educated properly not to
      take other medications that interact with tofacitinib(Rifampicin,ketoconazole) during the
      whole study period .During his/her follow up visit every time it will be ensured that he/she
      is not taking any other medication except those suggested by us. To prevent loss of follow
      up, telephone number of patient and caregiver will be collected, permanent and present
      address will be noted meticulously. They will advise to come for a follow up visit monthly.
      If any patient will miss it then he/she will be contacted over telephone to know their where
      about. If they are not available by telephone then a letter will be send to their present and
      permanent address. If they failed to reply and if they live nearby then I myself or a
      volunteer will be send to his/ her resident. Review of the study status will be done every
      fortnightly by the investigator with Guide. 10% data will be checked randomly by the guide.
      It will be an unbiased study. After collection, all data will be checked for inadequacy,
      irrelevancy and inconsistency. Irrelevant and inconsistent data will be discarded.
