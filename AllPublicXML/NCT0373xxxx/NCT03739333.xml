  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pseudoprogression is a phenomenon related to post-treatment rearrangements (including
      radiation necrosis). It appears early in the first year after treatment and accounts for 30
      to 50% of patients followed with glioblastoma. On MRI (current gold standard with
      international therapeutic response evaluation criteria RANO 2010), pseudoprogression is
      manifested by a progression of morphological abnormalities (contrast enhancement, FLAIR
      hypersignal) and can simulate tumor recurrence, even though the corticosteroid improved or
      kept clinical symptoms stabilized. In view of prognosis, the current diagnostic tools have
      not enough diagnosis accuracy for differentiation between pseudo-progression and early tumor
      recurrence, and are based on MRI retrospective analysis (2-3 months after). Recurrence of
      glioblastoma, is characterized by a higher amino acid metabolism than pseudoprogression, also
      11C-Methionine (11C-MET), positron emitting radiotracer, showed promising results to
      differentiate these two entities. To date, hybrid 11C-MET PET-MRI studies remains limited to
      small sample size (a few dozen patients), and none focuses exclusively on glioblastoma.

      Hypothesis of our study is that 11C-MET PET-MRI may be performed as a first-line MRI for
      suspected pseudoprogression and may changes therapeutic decision making and also patient
      prognosis.

      The main objective is to evaluate the performance of hybrid PET-MRI imaging with 11C-MET to
      differentiate pseudoprogression from glioblastoma recurrence in patients treated with surgery
      and radiochemotherapy, compared to multimodality MRI).
