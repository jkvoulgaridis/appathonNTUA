      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of
      long-acting cabotegravir (CAB LA) plus the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody,
      VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS), in adults living with HIV-1 with suppressed plasma
      viremia.

      The study will be conducted in three steps. At Step 1 entry, all participants will
      discontinue their current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen except for nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and initiate oral CAB.

      During Step 1, participants tolerating oral CAB plus their current two NRTIs, and displaying
      viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL), will register to Step 2. At entry into Step 2,
      eligible participants will stop their oral CAB and NRTIs and will receive a VRC07-523LS
      infusion plus CAB LA injection. After entry in Step 2, participants will receive CAB LA every
      4 weeks through Week R2+44 plus VRC07-523LS every 8 weeks through Week R2+40.

      At the last visit in Step 2 (Week R2+48), or at premature study treatment discontinuation,
      all participants who received any CAB LA or VRC07-523LS will enter Step 3 and switch to
      standard of care (SOC) oral ART for approximately 48 weeks.

      Participants will attend a number of study visits throughout the study. Study visits may
      include a physical examination, clinical assessment, pregnancy testing, and blood and urine
      collection. Participants will remain in the study for up to 101 weeks, including
      approximately 5 weeks in Step 1, 48 weeks in Step 2, followed by 48 weeks in Step 3.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Step 1 Inclusion Criteria

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

               -  NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US Food and Drug Administration
                  (FDA)-approved kit, which is required for all IND studies.

               -  World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                  (CDC) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a
                  test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive
                  initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or
                  an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test
                  principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma
                  HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Clinically stable (i.e.,in the opinion of the site investigator, doing well and not
             sick from treatment) for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry on a three-drug ART
             regimen that includes a boosted protease inhibitor, a nonnucleoside reverse
             transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor, plus two NRTIs, with no
             history of a switch due to virologic failure.

               -  NOTE: Previous switches for reasons other than virologic failure prior to
                  screening are allowed.

          -  Screening CD4+ T-cell count greater than or equal to 350 cells/mm^3 obtained within 60
             days prior to study entry at any US laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory
             Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent.

          -  All available HIV-1 RNA measurements must be less than 50 copies/mL within the 2 years
             prior to study entry except as allowed by the note below.

               -  NOTE: One plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/mL but less than
                  200 copies/mL is allowed if followed by a subsequent HIV-1 RNA value below 50
                  copies/mL.

          -  Participants must have at least two documented HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL within
             12 months prior to study entry.

               -  NOTE: The HIV-1 RNA level obtained at the screening visit can be used as the
                  second measurement, but must meet the requirements of screening plasma HIV-1 RNA
                  criterion below.

          -  Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL by any FDA-approved assay with
             minimum limit of detection of 50 copies/mL or lower obtained within 60 days prior to
             study entry by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 60 days prior to entry at any US
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 750/mm^3

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 11.0 g/dL for men or greater than or equal to
                  10.0 g/dL for women

               -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula) greater than or equal
                  to 50 mL/min

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) less than or equal to 2.0 x ULN

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.0 x ULN

          -  For females of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test within
             48 hours prior to entry by any clinic or laboratory that has a CLIA certification or
             its equivalent, or is using a point of care (POC)/CLIA-waived test.

               -  NOTE A: Reproductive potential is defined as girls who have reached menarche and
                  women who have had menses within the prior 12 months, and have not undergone
                  surgical sterilization. If no menses for a year or longer, the
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) should be less than or equal to 40 IU/mL to be
                  considered of reproductive potential. If an FSH is not available, and they have
                  not had menses in 24 or more consecutive months, they would be considered not to
                  be of reproductive potential. Women who have undergone surgical sterilization
                  (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal micro-inserts, tubal ligation
                  or salpingectomy) are considered not to be of reproductive potential.

               -  NOTE B: Participant-reported history of hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy,
                  tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal micro-inserts, and menopause is
                  acceptable documentation.

               -  Female participants of reproductive potential, who are participating in sexual
                  activity that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to use an effective form of
                  contraception from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication, while
                  receiving the study drugs, and for 30 days after stopping oral medications, or
                  the duration specified in the product label if receiving ARV drugs not supplied
                  by the study, or for approximately 48 weeks after last dose of CAB LA or
                  VRC07-523LS. Acceptable methods of contraception include:

                    -  Contraceptive subdermal implant

                    -  Intrauterine device or intrauterine system

                    -  Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive

                    -  Injectable progestogen

                    -  Contraceptive vaginal ring

                    -  Percutaneous contraceptive patches

               -  Women who are not of reproductive potential are eligible to start study treatment
                  drugs without requiring the use of contraceptives. Refer to above criterion for
                  definition of female who is not of reproductive potential.

               -  NOTE: All participants in the study should be counseled on safer sexual practices
                  including the use and benefit/risk of effective barrier methods (e.g., male
                  condom) and on the risk of HIV transmission to a partner without HIV.

          -  Men and women aged greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant to provide written informed consent.

             sample obtained at the screening visit.

               -  NOTE: Participants who were in screening as of March 16, 2020 and had their
                  samples drawn for PhenoSense susceptibility testing to VRC07-523LS or completed
                  on or before this date do not need to repeat this testing as part of the
                  re-screening when the study re-opens, provided that there is no documented
                  detectable HIV viral load since the original screen.

          -  Adequate venous access in at least one arm.

          -  Willingness to continue current two NRTIs and expects to have continued access to
