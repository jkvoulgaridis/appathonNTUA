    <textblock>
      SEACOAST 1 is a prospective, randomized, blinded endpoint trial comparing collateral vigor
      and clinical outcomes, with different forms of GA in patients with acute ischemic stroke due
      to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. The
      study compares GA with normocarbia (GAN) versus GA with mild hypercarbia (GAH), with a
      primary outcome of collateral robustness at measured at catheter angiography and clinical
      efficacy as secondary outcome. It is anticipated that the SEACOAST 1 will be followed by a
      larger, pivotal trial, SEACOAST 2, with primary clinical endpoints, in which the best method
      of GA identified in SEACOAST 1 is compared with the alternative strategy of anesthesia care
      (MAC) with minimal or no sedation. The current study focuses uppn SEACOAST 1, which is to be
      conducted in University of California, Los Angeles Ronald Reagan Medical Center and Santa
      Monica Medical Center. All acute stroke patients who arrive to one of these two stroke
      centers and are deemed eligible for thrombectomy will be considered for the proposed study.
      Physician-investigators will determine study eligibility. Informed consent to participate in
      the study will be obtained from legally authorized representatives or competent patients. For
      non-competent patients without on-scene legally authorize representatives, the consent
      process will utilize enrollment in emergency circumstances with exemption of informed consent
      (EFIC).

      Study design:

      SEACOAST 1 is a prospective, randomized, blinded endpoint trial comparing collateral vigor
      and clinical outcomes, focusing on two distinct sedation strategies:

        1. General anesthesia with mild hypercarbia (GAH) during the sedation up until full
           revascularization versus

        2. General anesthesia with normocarbia (GAN) during the sedation up until full
           revascularization

      Neuroanesthesia protocol, focused on maintenance of baseline BP, avoidance of hypotension
      during induction, and targeted partial pressure of carbon monoxide (PCO2) levels (normocarbia
      or mild hypercarbia):

        -  Anesthesia must not delay target initiation of procedure (groin puncture) of 90 min from
           ED arrival

        -  Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitoring: 5 lead ECG, end-tidal
           CO2 (ETCO2), Pulse oximeter, BP monitor, Body temperature per esophageal probe, ET gas
           analyser

        -  Neuromuscular block (NMB) monitor for depth of neuromuscular blockade

        -  Arterial line placement is encouraged if it can be inserted within 5 min. Otherwise
           noninvasive BP per cuff. If arterial line has not been placed prior to induction monitor
           noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) every 1 min per cuff until arterial line becomes
           available.

        -  BP goals - keep at baseline with goal of no more than 10% drop (last recorded BP prior
           to induction) and cannot exceed 185/105 if patients received intravenous tissue
           plasminogen activator (IV TPA).

           *BP can be lowered to desired goal only after revascularization as deemed necessary by
           the neurointerventional physician

        -  Induction with propofol or etomidate and rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg or succinylcholine

        -  Short acting vasoactive drugs (Phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Esmolol, Clevidipine) should be
           readily available to maintain BP in the predefined range throughout procedure.
           Phenylephrine drip recommended to maintain BP

        -  Anesthesia maintenance with volatile anesthetic and fentanyl; doses to be titrated to BP
           per anesthesiologist

        -  Qualitative end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) measurement

        -  Immediately upon groin puncture interventionalist will provide blood gas sample to test
           arterial C02

      A. Normocarbia arm:

      Controlled ventilation with PCO2 levels 40 (±5%)

      B. Mild hypercarbia arm:

      Controlled ventilation with PCO2 levels 50 (±5%)

        -  Normalize PCO2 levels to 40 (±5%) immediately after adequate revascularization (TICI 2B)

        -  Baseline arterial blood gas values for correlation/correction with PCO2 level detected
           on ETCO2 measurements

        -  Mandatory extubation attempt within 60 minutes after procedure completion. Reasons for
           failed extubation should be documented

    <description>Modified American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology (ASITN) grading scale is an ordinal 0-4 scale for angiographic collateral assessment. It runs from 0 (no collaterals) to 4 (excellent collaterals) as follows: 0: No visible collaterals to the ischemic site; 1: Slow collaterals to the periphery of the ischemic site with persistence of some defect; 2 (-): rapid collaterals to the periphery of the ischemic site with collateral filling in &lt;50% of the territory; 2 (+): rapid collaterals to the periphery of the ischemic site with collateral filling &gt; 50% of the territory; 3: Collaterals with slow but complete angiographic blood flow of the ischemic bed by the venous phase; 4: Complete and rapid collateral blood flow to the vascular bed in the entire ischemic territory by retrograde perfusion.</description>

    <measure>infarct growth assessed by blinded core lab</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first brain imaging upon arrival to emergency department (ED) up to 72 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Infarct growth will be determined by the difference in volume (cc) between baseline and post revascularization (24-72h) infarct volume. For patients assessed with MRI at the time of arrival to emergency department (ED), baseline infarct size will be determined on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging. Final infarct size measurement will performed using a T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence with additional reference to the DWI or ADC imaging at 24-72h after intervention. For patients assessed with CT at the time of ED arrival, baseline and final (24-72h) core infarct will be determined by RAPID perfusion imaging software.</description>

    <measure>modified Rankin Scale assessed by a blinded investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death:
0 - No symptoms.
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Dead</description>
