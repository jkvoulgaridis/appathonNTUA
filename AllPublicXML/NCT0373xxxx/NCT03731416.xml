  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aiming to evaluate clinically, radiographically ,and histologically GBR using
      collagen membrane in combination with a mixture of ABBM and autogenous particulated bone
      compared to collagen membrane with ABBM in atrophied anterior maxilla.

      Guided bone regeneration (GBR) has been proposed as a possible alternative for patients with
      severe horizontal bone atrophy, to overcome the drawback of bone blocks techniques.6,8 To
      protect and prevent the invasion of the clot by nonosteogenic cells, maintaining an adequate
      biological space for the regeneration of bone tissue, the use of resorbable membranes, in
      combination with autologous or heterologous particulate bone have been proposed. Expanded
      polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) membranes are the most used non-resorbable membranes with
      the longest published follow-up, considering them the gold standard in the reconstructions of
      major horizontal bone defects. However, a second surgery is needed to remove them and they
      may get exposed in the oral cavity and contaminate with possible infection and graft loss.
      Conversely, the resorbable membranes most advantages are an ability to merge with the host
      tissues, as well as a rapid resorption in case of exposure, thereby reducing the risk of
      bacterial contamination. Resorbable membranes in combination with particulated anorganic
      bovine bone (ABB) can be used for the augmentation of horizontally deficient ridges.
      Particulated autogenous bone can be mixed with bone substitutes to add more osteogenic
      factors.

    <description>Patients of both groups will be subjected to CBCT (diagnostic for upper arch).
Intra operative procedures (for both groups) followed by CBCT will be taken for every patient.
Local anesthesia will be given to the patient.
Scrubbing and draping of the patient will be carried out in a standard fashion for intra oral procedures.
Flap will be done.
In the study group: bone decortication will be done using surgical round bur, anorganic bovine bone derived mineral will be packed then covered at the defected area by a native collagen membrane which will be stabilized by tacks.
• The site will then be copiously irrigated with saline in preparation for closure.
The flap will then be closed using interrupted 4/0 resorbable sutures.</description>
