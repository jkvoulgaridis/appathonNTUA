  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a five year multi-site, cross sectional, observational study designed to examine
      chronic pain and pain treatment after moderate to severe TBI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to: 1) Determine chronic pain classification (musculoskeletal,
      headache, central/neuropathic), prevalence, location, duration, and associations with
      demographic, injury severity, current level of functioning and comorbidities in participants
      followed in ten Centers participating in the National Institute on Disability, Independent
      Living and Rehabilitation Research and the Department of Veterans Affairs TBIMS Databases; 2)
      Identify extreme groups based on responses to pain (interference and perception of
      improvement with treatment), or chronic pain extreme phenotypes, in order to define the key
      differences between those who have a good outcome and those who do not, across factors
      related to injury, pain severity/location, demographics, and treatment history; and 3)
      Identify treatment practices by clinicians who treat comorbid TBI and chronic pain to
      determine gaps in availability/accessibility of guideline level treatment, highlighting
      underserved populations where applicable.

      Results from this study will provide a more detailed picture of the problem of chronic pain
      after TBI by examining the types of pain that occur after TBI, which may be multiple types of
      pain for a subset of individuals, as well as the frequency of comorbid conditions.
      Identifying extreme phenotypes, such as demographic, individual, and treatment factors
      associated with those who have chronic pain but have minimal interference compared to those
      who are significantly impacted by pain, will allow us to identify treatment targets
      (behavioral, cognitive, biological, and molecular) to advance a personalized medicine
      approach to treatment unlike any approach in TBI and chronic pain to date. Outcomes from this
      study will include educational materials on chronic pain and pain treatment to benefit
      patients, family members, clinicians, and policymakers. Data from this study will have a
      direct impact on clinical practice, informing future work, and promoting understanding of
      constituent factors in extreme phenotypes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will complete assessment one time during 4 years of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI will be used to determine pain intensity as well as interference related to pain. Intensity of pain is rated by participant on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) when the pain is at it's &quot;worst,&quot; &quot;least,&quot; &quot;average,&quot; and &quot;right now.&quot; Pain interference is assessed with seven items using a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference). Participants are asked to rate how much pain has interfered with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>painDetect Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will complete assessment one time during 4 years of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>This self report survey consists of seven questions about location and quality of neuropathic pain. Scores range from 0-38 with scores above 18 indicating neuropathic pain and higher scores indicating more severity of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will complete assessment one time during 4 years of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item, self-rating scale that provides a quick and accurate measure of PTSD symptoms. Responses are scored on Likert scale (0 = &quot;Not at All&quot; to 4 = &quot;Extremely&quot;). Total score of 0 to 80 with higher scores indicating more PTSD symptomatology</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire-2 (PSEQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will complete assessment one time during 4 years of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>PSEQ-2 is designed to assess the level of confidence the respondent has in their ability to accomplish daily activities despite their pain. items are rated on a 7-point scale (0 = not at all confident to 6 = completely confident).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will complete assessment one time during 4 years of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated version of the CSQ will be used to reduce patient burden. This version uses only two items per domain to assess four coping strategies associated with adjustment to chronic pain: catastrophizing, ignoring pain sensations, increasing behavior, and using coping self-statements. Each item is scored from 0 to 6, with 0 representing 'no use' and 6 representing 'regular use' of the coping strategy. Scores for each domain are the mean score of the two items in that domain.</description>

        All participants have sustained a moderate to severe TBI and are now being followed at the
        collaborating centers as part of the TBIMS NDB which is a study collecting observational
        data after TBI.
