  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopy is the best means of finding early stage of upper gastrointestinal diseases,
      especially early cancer and benign ulcers. Currently, most people still undergo upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy due to discomfort, rather than a regular physical examination at a
      certain age. This study prospectively investigated the reason for undergoing the first upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients and found the correlation of endoscopic findings and
      symptoms.
