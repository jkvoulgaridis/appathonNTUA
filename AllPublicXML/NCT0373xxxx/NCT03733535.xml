  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a drug called benralizumab in
      individuals with severe, poorly controlled asthma with eosinophilic airway inflammation.
      Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that help fight off infections. Some people with
      asthma have too many eosinophils in their airways and blood, which can cause airway
      inflammation. Benralizumab is a new drug that is Health Canada approved and has been shown to
      rapidly eliminate eosinophils. It has been used in patients with severe asthma to improve
      lung function and reduce flair-ups, also known as exacerbations. Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) is an imaging tool that can look at the structure of the lungs when a subject inhales a
      xenon gas mixture. In healthy individuals, the gas fills the lungs evenly, but in individuals
      with lung disease, some of the areas of the lungs are not filled by the gas and the image
      looks patchy. These patchy areas are called ventilation defects and they contribute to
      reduced lung function. The goal of the study is to see if treatment with benralizumab will
      improve these ventilation defects, overall lung function and blood and sputum eosinophil
      levels. Subjects will receive treatment with benralizumab a total of 3 times, 4 weeks apart.
      Before and after treatment, subjects will undergo a series of MRI tests, breathing tests,
      blood and sputum analysis and a series of questionnaires to evaluate daily quality of life.
      The hypothesis is that ventilation defects will significantly improve after benralizumab
      treatment, and that this improvement will be different based on how long the patient has had
      asthma.

      This is an open-label, single arm, pilot study in patients with severe, poorly-controlled
      eosinophilic asthma to quantify hyperpolarized 129-Xenon MRI ventilation defect percent (VDP)
      before and after benralizumab therapy administered every 4 weeks for the first three
      injections (subcutaneous injection). Male and female patients between 18 and 70 years of age
      will be screened (Enrolment, Visit 1) and those that satisfy all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will undergo five additional two-hour study visits (Visit 2=Day 0/baseline, Visit
      3=Day 14±2 days and Visit 4=Day 28±2 days, Visit 5=Day 56±2 days, Visit 6=112±2 days) which
      will involve spirometry, plethysmography for airways resistance (Raw) and lung volumes,
      forced oscillation technique (FOT), multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) for the lung
      clearance index (LCI) and 129-Xenon MRI pre- and post-bronchodilator, with the exception of
      Visit 5, which will not include MRIs. At all visits fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)
      will be measured pre-bronchodilator. The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6), the Asthma
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SQRQ)
      will be completed at all visits except Visit 3. Sputum induction will be performed on Visits
      2 and 4 to measure sputum eosinophils, and blood samples will be performed on Visits 1 and 4
      to measure blood eosinophils. Participants that satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria
      will complete a total of six study visits. Upon study enrolment, all participants will be
      allocated to a benralizumab treatment arm (30 mg injection after completion of study
      assessments on Visit 2/Day 0, Visit 4/Day 28 and Visit 5/Day 56). After Visit 6/Day 112, all
      participants will be offered participation in the AstraZeneca Patient Support Program to
      receive benralizumab therapy on Day 112 and every 8 weeks thereafter.
