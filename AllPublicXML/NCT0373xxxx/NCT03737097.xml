  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive and neurodegenerative inflammatory disease
      that affects young adults. In many countries it has been described as the main cause of
      neurological incapacity in this age group. Due to the neurological impairment, patients with
      multiple sclerosis have a high incidence of fall. According to studies, MS patients fall
      three times more than general population. In the present study, the question to be answered
      is: education of individuals with MS on fall prevention using the method of online spaced
      education provides better retention of knowledge than the traditional method? This is a
      clinical trial to compare two methods of education of MS patients for prevention of fall.
      First stage: Development and validation of materials. Step two: Pilot questions with MS
      patients. Step three: Intervention and evaluation of outcome.

    <description>The study will apply the Falls Prevention Strategies Survey in both cohorts in weeks 1, 12 and 24. It is a self-report instrument addressing protective behaviors related to fall risk among adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (eg, monitoring MS symptoms, wearing proper footwear, modifying activities). Response options reflect the frequency with which the respondent engages in the behavior (ie, never, sometimes, regularly)</description>

We will consider fallers the individuals, in both groups, that have at least one reported fall in the past six months in the enrollment in the study.</description>

    <description>Investigators created a set of fall prevention strategies for multiple sclerosis patients into an evidence-based form of online education, termed 'spaced education' (SE). Based upon two psychology research findings (the spacing and testing effects), spaced education has been shown in randomized trials to improve knowledge acquisition, boosts learning retention for up to two years, and durably improves changes in behavior.</description>
