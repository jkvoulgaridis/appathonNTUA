  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the how well fractionated gemtuzumab ozogamicin works in treating
      measurable residual disease in participants with acute myeloid leukemia. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, may help the body's immune system
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 7. Treatment
      continues for 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Responders and non-responders, without significant adverse events during the first course,
      may receive a second course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin within 60 days after course 1.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior diagnosis of AML based on 2016 World Health Organization criteria.

          -  Patients must have MRD-level disease only and otherwise meet criteria for complete
             response (CR) or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) per the
             2017 European Leukemia Net response criteria (&lt; 5% blasts in the marrow without a
             requirement for peripheral blood count recovery). MRD must be measurable by
             multiparameter flow cytometry (MPFC) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
             molecular markers and/or karyotypic markers (e.g., classical cytogenetics or
             fluorescence in situ hybridization). MRD status will be centrally confirmed by the
             UW/FHCRC clinical laboratory in order to standardize response assessment following
             administration of study therapy.

          -  Patients must have received at least 1 cycle of standard induction chemotherapy prior
             to enrollment on the study. However, adult patients (&gt;= 18 years of age) are eligible
             for participation at any time point in treatment (after induction, during or after
             consolidation, pre-transplant, or post-transplant). Pediatric patients (2-18 years of
             age) must have MRD positivity during/after consolidation or post-transplant.

          -  Age &gt;= 2 years of age

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 3 (for adults) or
             Lansky performance status &gt;= 40 (for children).

          -  Patient's AML blasts must have CD33 expression.

          -  For adults (&gt;= 18 years of age): Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL.

          -  For adults (&gt;= 18 years of age): Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of
             normal for age (unless known history of Gilbert's disease).

          -  For adults (&gt;= 18 years of age): Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal for age (unless
             thought to be related to resolving infectious complications).

          -  For children (&lt; 18 years of age): Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in ml/min (age 2:
             63-175; age 3-12: 89-165; females 13 and older: 75-115; males 13 and older: 85-125).

          -  For children (&lt; 18 years of age): Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of
             normal for age (unless known history of Gilbert's disease).

          -  For children (&lt; 18 years of age): AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of
             normal for age (unless thought to be related to resolving infectious complications).

          -  Ability of patient or representative to provide written informed consent.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             receiving GO.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 14 days prior to
             entering the study.

          -  Subjects may not be receiving other investigational agents.

          -  Uncontrolled or concurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
