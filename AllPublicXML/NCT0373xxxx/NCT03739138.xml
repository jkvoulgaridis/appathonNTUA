      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      preliminary antitumor activity of intratumoral (IT) / intralesional injections of MK-4621
      delivered via the JetPEI™in vivo linear polyethylenimine nucleic acid delivery system
      (MK-4621/JetPEI™) as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with
      advanced/metastatic solid tumors.

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to first two 21-day treatment cycles (up to 42 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs are toxicities that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy; that meet pre-defined severity criteria; and result in a change in the given dose. The number of participants who experience DLTs will be reported for each arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be reported for each arm.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported for each arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of MK-4621/JetPEI™</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of 21-day Cycles 1, 2, and 3 (Arm 3 only): pre-dose, end of IT injection up to +5 minutes (0.0 hours), 0.5, 1.0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours (Cycle 1 Day 1 only) after MK4621/JetPEI™ dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC is the area under the plot of plasma concentration of drug against time after drug administration and is of particular use in estimating bioavailability of drugs, and in estimating total clearance of drugs. Blood samples will be collected at multiple time points (pre-dose and post-dose) during the study to assess the AUC of MK-4621/JetPEI™.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimum concentration (Cmin) of MK-4621/JetPEI™</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of 21-day Cycles 1, 2, and 3 (Arm 3 only): pre-dose, end of IT injection up to +5 minutes (0.0 hours), 0.5, 1.0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours (Cycle 1 Day 1 only) after MK4621/JetPEI™ dose</time_frame>
    <description>Cmin is the minimum or &quot;trough&quot; concentration of a drug observed after its administration and just prior to the administration of a subsequent dose. Blood samples will be collected at multiple time points (pre-dose and post-dose) during the study to assess the Cmin of MK-4621/JetPEI™</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum concentration (Cmax) of MK-4621/JetPEI™</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of 21-day Cycles 1, 2, and 3 (Arm 3 only): pre-dose, end of IT injection up to +5 minutes (0.0 hours), 0.5, 1.0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours (Cycle 1 Day 1 only) after MK4621/JetPEI™ dose</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is the maximum or &quot;peak&quot; concentration of a drug observed after its administration. Blood samples will be collected at multiple time points (pre-dose and post-dose) during the Dose Escalation phase to assess the Cmax of MK-4621/JetPEI™.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response ([CR], disappearance of all evidence of disease) or Partial Response ([PR], regression of measurable disease and no new sites) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Modified RECIST 1.1 for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST) will be used by the site to confirm radiographic progression and tumor response. ORR will be determined for each treatment arm.</description>
