  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of gilteritinib given
      in combination with atezolizumab in participants with relapsed or treatment refractory
      FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutated AML and to determine the composite complete
      remission (CRc) rate for participants who either discontinued the study or completed 2 cycles
      of gilteritinib given in combination with atezolizumab.

      This study will also evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), response to treatment, remission and
      survival. Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory results, vital signs, electrocardiograms
      (ECGs), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scores will also be
      assessed.

      This study will have 2 phases.

      Phase 1:

      The phase 1 portion of this study is to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      gilteritinib given in combination with atezolizumab.

      Phase 2:

      The phase 2 portion of the study will treat patients with gilteritinib and atezolizumab at
      the RP2D and will enroll in two stages. The first stage will evaluate the remission rate and
      if a minimum rate is achieved, a second stage of enrollment will continue.
