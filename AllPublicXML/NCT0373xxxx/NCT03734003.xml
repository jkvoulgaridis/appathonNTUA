  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local hyperthermia at 44℃ can promote some alterations of immulogical indicators. The
      procedure is convenient in clinic, has high tolerance with less trauma and less pain. Based
      on domestic and abroad clinical practice, the investigators observed initially that local
      hyperthermia brought great benefits to cutaneous warts. In comparison with liquid nitrogen,
      the safety and efficacy of controllable infrared bioeffect system to treat skin disease has
      been evaluated. This proved it could be used in treatment of skin warts, and clinical trial
      met the requirements of Standards for quality control of clinical trials on medical devices,
      and can be used in product registration and declaration.

      Mild local Hyperthermia with a certain temperature range has been successfully used in the
      treatment of some diseases. It has been utilised in the treatment of some neoplasm, fungal
      and HPV infections. Investigators' study found that local hyperthermia at 44°C could cleared
      HPV in more than half of the patients with plantar warts. Investigators also note the fact
      that in patients with multiple lesions, the clearance of the target lesion is commonly
      followed by clearance of other distant lesions, a phenomenon suggesting that local
      hyperthermia could aid in establishing a specific immune response to eliminate HPV.So the
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of controllable infrared
      bioeffect system to treat cutaneous warts. This trial was designed into two groups, one was
      experimental group (thermal therapy group), the other one was control group (liquid nitrogen
      cryotherapy group). The ratio of participants was 1:1 in experiment group and control group.
      The main evaluation indicator was the recovery rate after 4 months of initial treatment.
