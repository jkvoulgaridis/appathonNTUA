  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small intervention study with healthy males aged 20-65 years old who habitually
      sleep 7-9 hours/night.This study investigates if and how sleep restriction, independent of
      circadian misalignment (e.g. shift work, jet lag), induces a decrease in the bone formation
      marker Procollagen I Intact N-Terminal Propeptide (PINP). The specific aim is to evaluate the
      mechanistic underpinnings for the relationship between sleep restriction and suppression of
      bone formation. The study will enroll 12 healthy male participants and have a two-week
      intervention after enrollment.

    <description>Participants in this arm will sleep for 8 hours at their habitual time for 1 week outpatient. Food will be provided for the outpatient week by the study. After the outpatient week participants will check into our inpatient Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) for a 9 day inpatient stay. During their inpatient stay participants will be sleep restricted to a 5 hour/night sleep opportunity for nights 2-7 of their inpatient stay. Outcome measures include a 24-hour serum draw (urine and blood) which will occur on night 1 (pre) and night 8 (post). Patients will be given a 10 + hour recovery sleep period on night 8 of their inpatient stay.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        o Adult men aged 20-65 years old who habitually sleep 7-9 hours/night.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Regularly go to sleep after midnight;

          -  Shift work 1 year prior to study;

          -  Travel &gt;1 time zone 4 weeks prior to study or need to travel during study;

          -  More than moderate activity level (&gt;3 days of exercise per week &gt;30 min of exercise
             per session);

          -  Current smokers (or within the previous year of study);

          -  Positive drug test at screening or laboratory admission;

          -  BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2;

          -  Individuals who are concurrently participating in another research protocol that would
             influence their safe participation in this study. For example, participants involved
             in a study that requires blood draws or ingestion of experimental medication as this
             would increase the risk of participation in our study and/or compromise study results.

          -  Any clinically significant unstable medical or surgical condition within the last year
             (treated or untreated), including history of a clinically significant abnormality of
             the neurological system (including cognitive disorders or significant head injury) or
             any history of seizure (including febrile seizure—sleep loss has been used clinically
             to induce seizures in patients with epilepsy). Given the wide range of illnesses that
             are encountered in medical practice, it would not be possible to provide a
             comprehensive list of each and every disease that could serve as grounds for exclusion
             for the subject. However, the following is a list of illness categories that would
             certainly be grounds for exclusion: Connective Tissue and Joint Disorders;
             Neurologic/cognitive Disorders; Musculoskeletal Disorders; Immune Disorders;
             Chronobiologic Disorders; Cardiovascular Disorders; Respiratory Disorders; Kidney
             Disorders; Infectious Diseases; Hematopoietic Disorders; Neoplastic Diseases; and
             Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases.

          -  Self-reported or newly diagnosed medical condition that is still being investigated or
             is not under good control, including those identified on screening labs such as:

               -  Out-of-range values measured on a fasting blood sample: glucose &gt; 100 mg/dl,
                  thyroid stimulating hormone &lt;0.5 or &gt;5.0 uU/ml, abnormal alkaline phosphatase &lt;39
                  or &gt;117 U/l, creatinine, or hemoglobin &lt;14.5 g/dl men

          -  Any clinically significant psychiatric condition, as defined by DSM-V. Individuals
             with a history of most psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric disorders will be
             excluded, such as but not limited to depression, anxiety, alcoholism, drug dependency,
             schizophrenic disorders, and personality disorders (performed by medical history and
             physician interview). However, a personal history of limited prior counseling,
             psychotherapy (e.g., for adjustment reactions) will NOT be exclusionary. Evaluation of
             Psychiatric/Psychological Suitability:

               -  Subjects must demonstrate a full understanding of the requirements and demands of
                  the study.

               -  Each subject will complete psychological screening questionnaires. Exclusionary:
                  Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) ≥ 16;. Subject responses to
                  the CES-D are reviewed immediately and appropriate referrals are made if
                  necessary.

               -  Individuals who are unaware of specific psychiatric diagnoses who have a history
                  of having been treated with antidepressants, neuroleptic medications or major
                  tranquilizers will be excluded from study.

               -  Use of anti-depressants or any like therapeutics prescribed by a physician is
                  exclusionary

          -  Individuals with any clinically significant sleep disorder; Diagnosis or symptoms of
             sleep disorders (history of significant parasomnia as an adult [night terrors,
             frequent sleep walking], insomnia, including but not limited to hypersomnias such as
             apnea, periodic limb movements, narcolepsy). Sleep disorders will be screened by
             self-report and physician interview including use of validated sleep questionnaires
             (PSQI, Epworth sleepiness scale, and Berlin sleep questionnaire for sleep apnea).

          -  Individuals on medications known to affect bone turnover (e.g. glucocorticoids,
             osteoporosis medications);

          -  Use of medications/supplements/drugs that impact sleep or bone metabolism (such as but
             not limited to sleep medications, marijuana etc.) within one month (participants can
             be studied at a later date).

          -  Dwelling below Denver altitude (1,600 m) 6 months prior to testing;

          -  Greater than moderate caffeine (&gt;500 mg/day) or alcohol use (&gt;14 standard drinks/week
             or &gt;5 drinks in one sitting);

          -  Subjects with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or an allergy to
             heparin;

          -  Inability to travel to the CU-AMC campus for study visits.

          -  Individuals with restrictive diets (e.g., vegan)

          -  Individuals with 25OHD &lt; 20 ng/mL;

          -  Individuals with eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 as this is known to affect CTX measurements;

          -  T-score ≤ -2.5 (men ≥50 years old) or Z-score &lt; -2.0 (men &lt;50 years old) for bone
             mineral density (BMD) at the L-spine, femoral neck, or total hip on baseline DXA as
             compared to the DXA machine's normative database;

          -  Symptoms of active illness (e.g., fever); note that subject can be studied at a later
             date.
