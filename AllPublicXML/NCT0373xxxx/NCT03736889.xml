    <textblock>
      In this Phase 2, Single-Arm, Multi-Center, Open-Label Study, participants with previously
      treated locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with mismatched repair
      deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) will be treated with anti-PD-1
      Monoclonal Antibody Tislelizumab (BGB-A317). Efficacy and safety will be assessed. A short
      description of the clinical study, including a brief statement of the clinical study's
      hypothesis, written in language intended for the lay public.
