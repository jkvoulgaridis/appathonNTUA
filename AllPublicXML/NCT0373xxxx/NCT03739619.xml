    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine, bendamustine,
      and nivolumab when given together and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      classic Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and bendamustine, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving gemcitabine, bendamustine, and nivolumab may work better in
      treating patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined
      gemcitabine, bendamustine, and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory classical
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      II. To determine the efficacy of bendamustine, gemcitabine, and nivolumab in patients with
      relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival for
      patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma who receive gemcitabine,
      bendamustine, and nivolumab, including those who receive nivolumab maintenance.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, bendamustine IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2, and nivolumab over 60 minutes IV on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment with
      single agent nivolumab repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented classical Hodgkin lymphoma that is recurrent or refractory
             after standard chemotherapy. Core biopsies are acceptable if they contain adequate
             tissue for primary diagnosis and immunophenotyping. Bone marrow biopsies as the sole
             means of diagnosis are not acceptable. At least one biopsy-proven relapse is required
             for enrollment, but patients who have multiply relapsed disease do not require repeat
             biopsy if not clinically indicated

          -  Prior treatment: patients must have relapsed or progressed after at least one prior
             therapy

               -  Patients with relapsed or refractory disease following autologous stem cell
                  transplantation are permitted. Due to the risk of treatment-refractory graft
                  versus host disease (GVHD), patients who have previously completed an allogeneic
                  transplant are excluded.

               -  Patients may have received gemcitabine, bendamustine, or nivolumab in the past
                  but may not have discontinued therapy due to toxicity felt to be related to that
                  specific drug

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          -  Measurable disease must be present either on physical examination or imaging studies.

                       x 1.0 cm by computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography
                       (PET)/CT (positron emission tomography/CT), or magnetic resonance imaging
                       (MRI).

                    -  If identified by PET/CT, there must be at least one lesion that demonstrates
                       abnormal fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity, consistent with active disease.
                       Ultrasound or physical examination alone may not be utilized to confirm
                       measurable disease

               -  Non-measurable disease

                    -  All other lesions, including small lesions (less than 1.0 x 1.0 cm) and
