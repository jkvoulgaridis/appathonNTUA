  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evelo will investigate the safety and tolerability of EDP1815 and its potential to be a
      medicinal product in healthy volunteers and individuals with mild to moderate psoriasis and
      atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study with dose
      escalations to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effect of EDP1815. Since this
      clinical study is the first study in humans, the participants will be healthy volunteers or
      subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis or atopic dermatitis who are otherwise well.
      Investigation of EDP1815 in this patient population provides an opportunity to gain
      pharmacodynamic information using a range of tissue biopsies and composite clinical
      endpoints.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a double-blind dose escalation cohort study in healthy volunteers and participants with either mild to moderate psoriasis or mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The study consists of 7 cohorts and will test doses of EDP1815 versus placebo. The safety and tolerability of EDP1815 will be tested in participants with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis alongside pharmacodynamic effects on the systemic immune system and observation of any clinical effects.</intervention_model_description>

                  aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or iii. Alkaline
                  phosphatase (ALP) and/or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN

               2. For participants with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis or psoriasis: i. For
                  women, serum creatinine level ≥ 125 μmol/L; for men, ≥ 135 μmol/L, or ii. ALT or
                  AST &gt; 2 x ULN and/or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN
