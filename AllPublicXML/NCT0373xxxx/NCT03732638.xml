        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has at least 1 year history of migraine (with or without aura) consistent with
             a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd
             Edition, including the following:

               1. Age of onset of migraines prior to 50 years of age

               2. Migraine attacks, on average, lasting 4 - 72 hours if untreated

               3. Per subject report, 4 - 18 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity per
                  month within the last 3 months prior to the Screening Visit

               4. 6 or more migraine days during the Observation Period

               5. Not more than 18 headache days during the Observation Period

               6. Ability to distinguish migraine attacks from tension/cluster headaches

               7. Subjects on prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to remain on 1
                  medication with possible migraine-prophylactic effects if the dose has been
                  stable for at least 3 months prior to the Screening Visit, and the dose is not
                  expected to change during the course of the study.

             Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Subject with a history of HIV disease

          3. Subject history with current evidence of uncontrolled, unstable or recently diagnosed
             cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, and
             cerebral ischemia. Subjects with Myocardial Infarction (MI), Acute Coronary Syndrome
             (ACS), Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), cardiac surgery, stroke or transient
             ischemic attack (TIA) during the 6 months prior to screening

          4. Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), or uncontrolled diabetes (however
             subjects can be included who have stable hypertension and/or diabetes for at least 3
             months prior to screening).

          5. Subjects with major depressive episode within the last 12 months, major depressive
             disorder or any anxiety disorder requiring more than 1 medication for each disorder.
             Medications to treat major depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder must have been
             at a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to the Screening visit.

          6. Subjects with other pain syndromes, psychiatric conditions, dementia, or significant
             neurological disorders (other than migraine) that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             might interfere with study assessments

          7. Subject has a history of gastric, or small intestinal surgery (including Gastric
             Bypass, Gastric Banding, Gastric Sleeve, Gastric Balloon, etc.), or has disease that
             causes malabsorption

          8. Body mass index ≥ 33 kg/m2

          9. Subject has current diagnosis of major depressive disorder requiring treatment with
             atypical antipsychotics, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or borderline personality
             disorder

         10. History of gallstones or cholecystectomy.

         11. The subject has a history or current evidence of any unstable medical conditions
             (e.g., history of congenital heart disease or arrhythmia, known or suspected
             infection, hepatitis B or C, or cancer) that, in the investigator's opinion, would
             expose them to undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE) or interfere with
             assessments of safety or efficacy during the course of the trial.
