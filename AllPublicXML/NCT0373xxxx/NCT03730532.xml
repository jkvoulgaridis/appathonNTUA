  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supporting patients in exerting choice over their treatment is a central aspect of modern
      healthcare. In Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services, then patients
      treated at step 2 are only and always offered cognitive-behaviourally informed guided
      self-help (GSH), when they are deemed suitable for treatment at step 2 of IAPT services
      (termed CBT-GSH). Step 2 interventions are guided self-help (GSH) delivered by Psychological
      Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs). Recently, a new type of GSH has been developed and found to
      be feasible and effective in IAPT services - this is called cognitive-analytic guided
      self-help (CAT-GSH). This research aims to test the efficacy of CAT-GSH by comparing outcomes
      over time achieved in both types of GSH and interviewing participants about their experience
      of the GSH. The methodology to support patient choice is a patient preference trial. In this
      method, then patients that meet inclusion criteria for the trial are offered and choose
      between either CAT-GSH and CBT-GSH. Those patients that are unconcerned with the type of
      treatment are randomised to either CAT-GSH or CBT-GSH. The primary outcome measure is the
      Beck Anxiety Inventory. No changes to the standard practice of the PWPs will occur during the
      trial, the trial will be situated in a standard IAPT service and be a therefore conducted in
      a routine practice setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients have self-referred or been referred by their GP or other health or social
             care professional for a step 2 intervention for treatment of a common mental health
             problem,

          -  patients meet criteria for an anxiety disorder on MINI screening interview assessment
             and also met caseness on the BAI (as defined by a score of &gt;10 on the BAI at
             assessment).

          -  Patients want to engage in GSH to address the anxiety disorder

          -  patients are motivated to engage in treatment and can attend six sessions of
             face-to-face GSH.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  engaging in any another IAPT step 2 interventions.

          -  Do not meet criteria for an anxiety disorder as defined by the MINI and the BAI score.

          -  Meet criteria for depression and a comorbid anxiety disorder, as identified by the BAI
             and MINI, where the depression is more severe and is the patient's main concern.

             secondary care mental health services.

          -  Have substance misuse issues that would interfere with engagement with the GSH.

          -  Have a diagnosed learning disability that precludes engagement in GSH.

          -  Have a diagnosis of social phobia or PTSD
