      antibody SHR-1210 plus apatinib as second-line treatment of advanced esophageal squamous
      cell.

    <textblock>
      The incidence of esophageal cancer is ranked seventh in the world, and the mortality rate
      ranks sixth in the world. At present, the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer
      is mainly based on the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the
      failure of first-line treatment, there is no standard second-line treatment. We designed a
      single-arm, open phase II clinical trial of anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 plus arpatinib as
      second-line treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell. The purpose of this study is to
      observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 plus apatinib as
      second-line treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18~75 years.

          2. Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) confirmed diagnosis of esophageal
             squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)， and locally advanced unresectable, local recurrence or
             distant metastasis.

          3. Patients undergoing first-line systemic chemotherapy (which may include platinum,
             lavender or fluorouracil) progression or intolerance (progress in maintenance therapy
             after first-line chemotherapy can also be included). Synchronous chemoradiotherapy for
             postoperative recurrence or metastasis is considered as first-line treatment; For
             radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or
             chemoradiotherapy), if disease progression occurs during treatment or within 6 months
             after stopping treatment, Count it as a first-line treatment failure.

          4. At least one measurable/evaluable lesion by RECIST v1.1. And the measurable lesions
             should not have received local treatment such as radiotherapy (The lesion located in
             the previous radiotherapy area, if confirmed to progress, and meets the RECIST 1.1
             standard, can also be used as a target lesion).
