  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basal-bolus insulin therapy is recommended for patients with poorly controlled type 2
      diabetes (T2D) and HbA1c &gt;9%. However, basal-bolus insulin is labor intensive and associated
      with increased risk of hypoglycemia, glycemic variability, weight gain and poor compliance.
      Thus, there is a critical need for a simpler treatment regimen that could overcome these
      limitations. IDegLira, a fixed-ratio combination (FRC) therapy consisting of insulin degludec
      and liraglutide, is an attractive option for this population given its proven benefits on
      glycemic control, weight and compliance. This study aims to show that a simpler regimen using
      a novel FRC agent (IDegLira) can improve glycemic control, decrease hypoglycemia, reduce the
      burden of diabetes care, and improve satisfaction/adherence in patients with poorly
      controlled T2D with HbA1c between ≥ 9-12%. This open-label, treat-to- target, two-arm
      parallel, controlled trial will randomize participants with T2D and HbA1c ≥ 9%, treated with
      oral anti-diabetic agents and/or basal insulin therapy to lDegLira or basal-bolus insulin for
      26 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive literature has shown that persistent hyperglycemia is associated with short- and
      long-term complications. Sustained hyperglycemia, also known as glucotoxicity, leads to
      progressive loss of beta-cell function and is considered a key pathophysiological process in
      the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients with severe hyperglycemia may respond
      poorly to oral anti-diabetic agents (OAD) alone initially and frequently require insulin to
      achieve glycemic targets. Current guidelines recommend to initiate therapy with basal insulin
      and progressively step up to basal-bolus insulin in patients with high HbA1c &gt;9%,
      particularly if symptomatic or with catabolic symptoms.

      A basal-bolus insulin regimen increases the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain and glycemic
      variability, which are limiting factors in achieving glycemic targets. A basal-bolus insulin
      regimen is also labor intensive and often requires multiple daily injections, further
      increasing the burden of diabetes care and decreasing patient adherence. In contrast,
      simplified treatment plans may improve adherence, leading to glycemic targets achievement.
      Thus, there is a critical need for simpler regimens that could overcome clinical inertia,
      improve patient adherence, and decrease glycemic variability in patients with poorly
      controlled type 2 diabetes. This prospective randomized control trial will compare IDegLira
      to basal-bolus insulin regimen in achieving glycemic control, while reducing hypoglycemia,
      glycemic variability, and weight gain in patients with uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c ≥9%.

    <measure>Change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c will be compared between study groups. HbA1c measures the average percentage of blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months and HbA1c can reduce with management of diabetes through diet, exercise, and medication. HbA1c levels below 5.7% are considered normal. Persons with values between 5.7% and 6.4% are considered at high risk of developing diabetes while those with values of 6.5% and above are diagnosed with diabetes. Persons with diabetes aim to get their HbA1c in the range of 7.0 to 7.5% or lower, with below 7.0% being preferable.</description>

    <measure>Change in fasting blood glucose</measure>

    <description>Mean fasting blood glucose will be compared between study arms. Participants will perform an 8-point, self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) check by testing their blood sugar at 8 different time points. The measurement taken before breakfast is used to assess fasting blood glucose. For people without diabetes, fasting blood glucose is typically between 70-100 mg/dL while fasting blood glucose for those with diabetes is in the range of 70-130 mg/dL.</description>

    <measure>Change in daily blood glucose</measure>

    <description>Mean daily blood glucose will be compared between study arms. Participants will perform an 8-point, self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) check by testing their blood sugar at 8 different time points. Blood glucose levels vary depending on when and what food has been consumed. A blood glucose level taken regardless of timing of meals of greater than 200 mg/dL often indicates diabetes. Blood glucose decreases with improved diabetes management.</description>
