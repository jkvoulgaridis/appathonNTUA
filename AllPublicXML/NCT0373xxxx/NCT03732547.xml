  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When multi-kinase inhibitors based therapies (sorafenib and regorafenib) are limited in
      late-stage liver cancer patients, there is no alternative options. PD-1 blockade has became a
      promising immunotherapeutic strategy in many cancers. While it showed limited efficacy in
      liver cancer. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyIC) has been widely studied as a new
      anti-tumor drug and recent study showed that polyIC and PD-L1 mAb has a quite synergetic
      effect on the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study is aimed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the combination of PolyIC and PD-1 mAb in unresectable late-stage HCC patients.

      Nowadays, primary liver cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the
      second leading cause of cancer-related death. Unfortunately, the therapeutic strategies are
      still limited for HCC. For HCC patients at advanced stage, up to now, sorafenib and
      regorafenib are applied for palliative therapy to prolong the patients' life. PD-1 blockade
      has became a promising immunotherapeutic strategy in many cancers. While it showed limited
      efficacy in liver cancer. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyIC) has been widely studied as
      a new anti-tumor drug and recent study showed that polyIC and PD-L1 mAb has a quite
      synergetic effect on the treatment of HCC. This study is aimed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the combination of PolyIC and PD-1 mAb in unresectable late-stage HCC patients.
