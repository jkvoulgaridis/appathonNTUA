  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CTZ Paste in primary teeth, compared to
      endodontic treatment with Guedes-Pinto Paste. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind
      (patient), controlled and non-inferiority clinical study on 174 primary molars and 174
      primary incisors of 3-6 years-old children with carious lesions with pulp involvement. The
      sample unit will be the tooth, which will be randomized into two groups. The teeth allocated
      to the experimental group will be treated with CTZ Paste, whereas the treatment of those
      teeth allocated to the control group will employ the Guedes-Pinto Paste. The procedures
      performed will be evaluated clinically and radiographically at 6 and 12 months. Secondary
      outcomes such as cost, discomfort, satisfaction and quality of life will also be evaluated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical and radiographical efficacy of the endodontic treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The tooth will be evaluated according to the presence of mobility (yes or no) and regarding radiolucency area on initial and final radiography (measured and compared with the program ImageJ).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The costs of each treatment procedure will be calculated and compared with thresholds values for intervention cost-effectiveness by region, determined by World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/choice/costs/CER_levels/en/). These values will be combined with the evaluated efficacy of the treatments (according description of Outcome 1).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's satisfaction with treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction of each treatment will be evaluated using the Wong-Baker Facial Scale (Wong &amp; Baker, 1988). The patient will be asked to choose the face that is more similar to how he/she felt during the treatment. The answer should be given solely by the child, which means no parental or professional interferences.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parents/Guardians' satisfaction with children's treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The parents' satisfaction with each treatment will be evaluated using the Parent's Questionnaire about Teeth Appearance (Furtado et al., 2012).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of treatment on children's quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The oral health related quality of life will be measured using a validated questionnaire according to the children's age. The &quot;Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale&quot; (ECOHIS) (Tesch et al., 2008) will be applied with 4-5 years old patients. The &quot;Child Perceptions Questionnaire&quot; (CPQ) will be used for 6-9 years old patients (Martins et al., 2009). The same questionnaire will be applied immediately before the procedure and on 12 months follow-up. Only one type of questionnaire will be used with each child, according to its age.</description>
