  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective interventional study, open, non-comparative and non-randomized. The research
      concerns physiological parameters of the coronary and ocular blood circulation.

      At the coronary level, the curves of pressure and Doppler flow will be extracted from
      ComboMap® (Philips). The coronary microvascular resistances, basal and hyperemic, will be
      determined by the average ratio of the distal pressure and flow.

      At the ocular level, a fundus oculi and an OCTA (angiography by tomography in optical
      coherence) examination will be performed. The measures of the FFR and the coronary
      microvascular resistance will be determined by a specific guidewire allowing simultaneous
      measures of pressure and Doppler flow (ComboWire®, Philips), in 200 patients with
      intermediate stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LDA). Topological parameters
      characterizing the retinal area and choriocapillaries will be determined by statistical
      approaches and mathematical morphology.

      To establish a predictor of the coronary microvascular resistance from the eye vascular
      parameters, we shall use a non-linear regression by supervised machine learning. The main
      cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, age, sex) will be part of
      predetermined input features for the machine learning.

    <description>The study concerns patients with intermediate stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LDA). A fundus oculi and an OCTA (angiography by tomography in optical coherence) examination will be performed; it's a non-invasive imaging test. OCT uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of your retina and then ophthalmological examination data will correlate with coronary angiography.</description>
