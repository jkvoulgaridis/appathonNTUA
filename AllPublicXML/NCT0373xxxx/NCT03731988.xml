  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) ablative fractional laser-assisted photodynamic
      therapy (AFL-PDT) has shown significant benefit for the treatment of actinic keratosis(AK).
      Er:YAG ablative fractional laser ablates the epidermis and dermis without significant thermal
      injury, creating microscopic ablation zones (MAZ) in the portion of the skin that the laser
      is applied to. The formed MAZ depends on the laser parameters such as laser depth, laser
      density and laser passes, which affect the treatment outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated whether different laser densities influenced the efficacy, side effects,
      cosmetic outcomes, and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation of AFL-PDT for facial AK in a
      randomized clinical trial.

    <measure>Differences of short-term complete response rates between 3 groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Short-term complete response rates were evaluated at 3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Lesion responses were classified as either a complete response (complete disappearance of the lesion) or a noncomplete response (incomplete disappearance)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences of long-term complete response rates between 3 groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Long-term complete response rates were evaluated at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In all cases of complete response, the patients were reviewed at 12 months to check for recurrence. Recurrence was assessed by inspection, dermoscopy, photography, palpation, and histologic findings. For the histopathologic evaluation of treatment response, at the 12-month follow-up visit, a 3-mm punch biopsy of the treated AK lesion was performed in all cases of clinically incomplete response.</description>

    <measure>Differences of the fluorescence intensity between 3 groups</measure>
    <time_frame>After 3 hours of application with MAL, fluorescence intensity imaging was assessed 10 minutes before illumination.</time_frame>
    <description>After 3 hours of application with methyl aminolevulinate(MAL), Fluorescence imaging analysis was performed on treatment area with ultraviolet examination light (model 31602,356 nm; Burton Medical Products Crop.) at 10 cm height above the base of each lesion. The red fluorescence was separated and extracted by Matlab program and then used to measure the amount of 633 nm fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences of cosmetic outcomes between 3 groups</measure>
    <time_frame>The overall cosmetic outcome was assessed 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cosmetic outcomes were graded as excellent (slight redness or pigmentation change), good (moderate redness or pigmentation change), fair (slight-to-moderate scarring, atrophy, or induration), or poor (extensive scarring, atrophy, or induration)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference of adverse events (erythema, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, edema, itching, oozing, bleeding) rates between 3 groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 12 months after each treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events reported by the patient were noted at each follow-up visit, including severity, duration and need for additional therapy. All events due to PDT were described as phototoxic reactions (i.e., erythema, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, oedema, itching, oozing, bleeding and so forth).</description>
