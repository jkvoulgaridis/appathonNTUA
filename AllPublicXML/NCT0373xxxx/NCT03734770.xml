  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Luteal phase support in &quot;in vitro fertilization&quot; (IVF) cycles has been shown to improve
      pregnancy rates and became a standard of treatment, and progesterone is the first choice
      considering its safety profile and effectiveness. There are many studies demonstrating that
      vaginal progesterone is equally efficacious and better tolerated compared to intramuscular
      progesterone for luteal phase support in IVF cycles. Conversely, although different studies
      showed that subcutaneous progesterone is equally efficacious compared to vaginal
      progesterone, patient use satisfaction and compliance were less studied with few evidences
      are available, that may guide the choice of vaginal progesterone instead of subcutaneous
      progesterone and other way around. Considering the paucity of published data about the
      patient's preference and use satisfaction about subcutaneous progesterone, the investigators
      will conduct a prospective randomized study aimed to compared adverse effects rates, impact
      on quality of life, use satisfaction and administration preference in women undergoing luteal
      phase support with vaginal progesterone versus subcutaneous progesterone during IVF cycles,
      that may guide the choice for luteal phase support in IVF cycles.
