    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Solicited injection-site AEs will be redness/erythema, swelling, pain/tenderness, and hard lump/induration.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment.

Relatedness of an SAE to the study vaccine will be determined by the investigator.</description>
