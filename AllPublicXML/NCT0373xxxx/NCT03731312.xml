  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodine status in populations is assessed using urinary iodine concentration (UIC) measured in
      spot urine samples. The iodine intake is classified as deficient, sufficient, or excessive
      iodine based on the median UIC (mUIC). However, this approach has limitations, as it does not
      quantify the prevalence of individuals with habitually deficient or excess iodine intakes.
      The EAR cut-point method has the potential to quantify prevalence of iodine deficiency and
      excess. However, little is known about the effects of the inter- and intra-individual
      variance of UIC.

      The aim of the study is to quantify the intra-individual variability in dietary iodine
      intake. The overall goal is to estimate the prevalence of iodine deficiency and excess in the
      study population and propose sample size recommendations for future iodine nutrition
      population studies. The results will provide evidence guiding international recommendations
      for iodine nutrition studies.
