  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This ancillary study will determine if early administration of a single high-dose (540,000
      IU) oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) treatment improves 12-month global cognition and
      executive function as determined by comprehensive neuropsychological testing in 140
      critically ill patients with Vitamin D deficiency at enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VIOLET-BUD is an ancillary study to a parent double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized
      control trial (RCT) evaluating how a single, high-dose (540,000 IU) oral Vitamin D3 treatment
      affects 90-day mortality in patients who are at high risk for ARDS and have Vitamin D
      deficiency (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 20 ng/ml) at enrollment. The parent RCT (Vitamin D
      to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging Early Treatment [VIOLET], NCT03096314) is part of the
      Clinical Trials Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL)
      sponsored by the NHLBI. The VIOLET trial completed enrollment in July 2018 with 1,360
      randomized to either high dose, enteral Vitamin D3 or placebo.

      This ancillary study will provide additional funding to perform comprehensive
      neuropsychological (cognitive) evaluations, which were not part of the parent trial. These
      neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted 12 (+/- 4) months after randomization among
      a subset of 140 survivors enrolled in VIOLET. This ancillary study will conducted in 7 (out
      of 42) sites.

    <measure>12-month cognition as measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 (+/- 4) months</time_frame>
    <description>The RBANS is a comprehensive neuropsychological battery for the evaluation of global cognition and has been validated in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries, vascular dementias, and Alzheimer's disease. It specifically tests for for immediate and delayed memory, attention, visuospatial construction, and language.</description>

    <measure>12-month executive function as measured by the components of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) subscales.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 (+/- 4) months</time_frame>
    <description>The D-KEF's Proverbs, Number-Letter Switching, and Verbal Fluency Category Switching subscales will measure conceptual flexibility, inhibition, and monitoring, respecitvely, which encompasses the majority of executive function. The average of the three subscales will provide an executive function composite</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>12-month functional status as measured by the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 (+/- 4) months</time_frame>
    <description>The Katz ADL quantifies basic ADLs such as bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding. The Lawton IADL quantifies instrumental ADLs such using the telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, medication management, and finances. For the analysis, the Katz ADL and Lawton IADL scales will be summed to provide a functional status score.</description>

    <ipd_description>This data sharing plan is only pertinent to data collected specifically for VIOLET-BUD. Because VIOLET-BUD is an ancillary study to a Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) network study, the same data sharing plan will be instituted as the PETAL Clinical Coordinating Center. Limited access data sets will be prepared and provided to the NHLBI in accordance with National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) policies on data sharing: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human-subjects/set-preparation-guidelines.
VIOLET-BUD data will be made available on the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC). In addition to the data, documentation such as data collection forms, study procedures and protocols, data dictionaries and algorithms for calculated data elements and descriptions of all variable recoding performed will also be provided.</ipd_description>
