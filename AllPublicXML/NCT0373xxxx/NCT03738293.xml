  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women undergoing late preterm birth are at high risk of delivering a newborn with neonatal
      hypoglycemia. The investigators plan to monitor interstitial glucose levels prior to delivery
      in these women in order to develop a better understanding of the relationship between
      maternal hyperglycemia and neonatal hypoglycemia.

        Pregnant women admitted in the late preterm period who are at high risk for late preterm
        birth and receiving betamethasone in accordance to current American College of Obstetrician
        and Gynecologist guidelines are screened.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy admitted to labor and delivery between 34w0d and 36w5d

          -  English speaking women

          -  High probability of delivery in late preterm period defined by any of the following:

               1. Membrane rupture by 2 criteria (pooling, positive nitrazine, or ferning) OR
                  leaking amniotic fluid from the cervix

               2. Preterm labor with intact membrane, defined as at least 6 uterine contractions in
                  60 minutes and at least: cervical dilation greater than or equal to 3cm dilated
                  OR 80% effaced OR planned delivery by induction of labor or cesarean in no less
                  than 24 hrs and no more than 7 days, for any indication as deemed necessary by
                  the provider

          -  Received at least one dose of corticosteroid within twelve hours of enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior antenatal corticosteroid course in current pregnancy

          -  Systemic corticosteroid administration during current pregnancy

          -  Fetal demise or known major fetal anomaly, including cardiac anomaly or hydrops

          -  Maternal contraindication to betamethasone: hypersensitivity reaction to any component
             of the medication, idiopathic thrombocytopenic, purpura, systemic fungal infection, or
             current use of amphotericin B

          -  Diabetes, pregestational or gestational

          -  Preexisting plan for intrapartum monitoring of maternal glucose levels for any reason

          -  Delivery expected within 12 hours of randomization, because of insufficient time for
             corticosteroids to confer benefit, including:

               1. Ruptured membranes with cervical dilation ≥ 3cm or with more than 6 contractions
                  per hour unless Pitocin is deferred for at least 12 hours

               2. Chorioamnionitis

               3. Cervical dilation ≥ 8cm

               4. Evidence of non-reassuring fetal status requiring immediate delivery

          -  To ensure that there is an adequate proportion of women presenting at 34 to 35 weeks
             gestation, enrollment will be restricted so that no more than 50% of the women in the
             trial present at 36 weeks.
