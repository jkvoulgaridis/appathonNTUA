      The UCB transplant is a type of stem cell transplant used to treat cancer of the blood or
      lymph glands. The UCB transplant has advantages over other types of transplants such as ease
      of obtaining the umbilical cord blood, absence of donor risks, reduced risks of contagious
      infections, and the availability for immediate use. The UCB transplant is also associated
      with a lower incidence of graft versus host disease, or GvHD (in GvHD, the transplanted graft
      attacks the recipient organs).

      However, UCB as a graft source for a bone marrow transplant has drawbacks related to the
      limited cell dose available for transplant and defects in homing. Homing is the process of
      UCB stem cell lodging in the bone marrow. If the homing is not efficient it could delay the
      re-population of the stem cells (or engraftment), possibly lead to engraftment failure, and
      delay the rebuilding of the immune system after transplant. This could, in turn, provide a
      higher risk to infection after the UCB transplant.

      This research study is aimed at investigating the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy
      prior to the UCB transplant to find out if it will improve the stem cell homing, and
      subsequently, the engraftment. HBO therapy involves breathing 100% pure oxygen while in a
      sealed chamber that has been pressurized at 2 ½ times the normal atmospheric pressure.

      There is a specific hormone which tells stem cells in the bone marrow to make more red blood
      cells. This hormone (called EPO) is increased when blood oxygen levels are low. When the EPO
      is increased, it might impair the bone marrow homing process of your transplant. Therefore,
      the researchers conducting this study hope to determine if providing 100% pure oxygen to you
      prior to your UCB transplant will decrease this hormone, and in turn, improve the homing
      process after your transplant.
