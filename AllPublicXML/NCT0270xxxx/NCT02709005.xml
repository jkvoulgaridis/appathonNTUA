    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a disease of the vagina caused by bacteria. The most common
      symptom of BV is an abnormal homogeneous off-white vaginal discharge (especially after sex)
      with an unpleasant smell. This is a Phase II, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled,
      Multi-center Trial enrolling 120 women, 18-50 years old, with clinical evidence of bacterial
      vaginosis. Subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive active test article (5%
      Monolaurin Vaginal Gel) or placebo (vehicle) as outpatient therapy. Subjects will be
      stratified by first time episode of bacterial vaginosis or recurrent bacterial vaginosis. The
      primary objectives of this study are: 1) To assess the safety and tolerability of 5%
      Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to Vehicle Placebo Gel (excipients only) and 2) To assess the
      efficacy by clinical cure rate of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to Vehicle Placebo Gel
      at Visit 2. The secondary objectives are : 1) To evaluate the therapeutic cure rate of 5%
      Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to Vehicle Placebo Gel at Visits 2 and 3, 2) To evaluate the
      clinical cure rate of 5% Monolaurin Vaginal Gel compared to Vehicle Placebo Gel at Visit 3,
      3) To evaluate the changes in Nugent's criteria of vaginal bacterial flora at Visits 2 and 3.
      This study is expected to last for 13 months, with subject participation duration being 4
      weeks.

    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Day 8-15)</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical cure was defined by normal Amsel criteria, including: normal physiological vaginal discharge, whiff test negative for any amine &quot;fishy&quot; odor, saline wet mount less than 20% for clue cells, and vaginal pH is &lt;=4.5. All four criteria had to be normal with none of the clinical failure criteria met to be considered a clinical cure. A clinical failure was defined by at least one of the following: one or more abnormal Amsel criteria, early discontinuation of study therapy due to lack of treatment effect, use of any vaginosis therapy other than study product during the study, or in the investigator's opinion, required additional treatment for vaginosis.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Solicited Urogenital Adverse Events (AEs) Following the First Dose of the Study Product</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 5</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited event assessments were captured on a memory aid starting on Day 1, the first day of therapy and continuing for 5 days. The participant recorded the presence and intensity of vulvovaginal solicited events on the memory aid. Any symptom that was present at the time that the participant was screened was considered as baseline and not reported as a solicited urogenital AE. However, if the symptom deteriorated during the reporting period, it was considered an AE. If a symptom was reported that was not present at baseline, it too was considered an AE. Any symptoms still present on Day 5 were followed by participant memory aid notations until symptom resolution. Solicited events collected include vaginal odor, vaginal pain, vaginal tenderness, vaginal itching, vaginal dryness, vaginal discharge, and vaginal inflammation. Severity of solicited events symptoms were graded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the grading table in the protocol.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Considered Product-related</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Day 1) through Visit 3 (Day 22-31)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants in each treatment group with product-related SAEs was assessed. An AE was considered &quot;serious&quot; if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalizations could be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they could jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed. An AE was considered related if there was a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the AE, meaning that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the AE.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Day 8-15)</time_frame>
    <description>Therapeutic cure was defined as both a clinical cure and a bacteriological cure. All four Amsel criteria had to be normal with none of the clinical failure criteria listed met to be considered a clinical cure, including normal physiological vaginal discharge, whiff test negative for any amine &quot;fishy&quot; odor, saline wet mount less than 20% for clue cells, and vaginal pH is &lt;=4.5. A clinical failure was defined by at least one of the following: one or more abnormal Amsel criteria, early discontinuation of study therapy due to lack of treatment effect, use of any vaginosis therapy other than study product during the study, or in the investigator's opinion, required additional treatment for vaginosis. A vaginal swab for bacteriological assessment of BV by Nugent criteria was performed. The Nugent score can range from 0 to 10. Bacteriological cure of BV was defined as a normal Nugent score of 0-3. Participants who were clinical failures, or had a Nugent score &gt;3 were therapeutic failures.</description>

        <description>Solicited event assessments were captured on a memory aid starting on Day 1, the first day of therapy and continuing for 5 days. The participant recorded the presence and intensity of vulvovaginal solicited events on the memory aid. Any symptom that was present at the time that the participant was screened was considered as baseline and not reported as a solicited urogenital AE. However, if the symptom deteriorated during the reporting period, it was considered an AE. If a symptom was reported that was not present at baseline, it too was considered an AE. Any symptoms still present on Day 5 were followed by participant memory aid notations until symptom resolution. Solicited events collected include vaginal odor, vaginal pain, vaginal tenderness, vaginal itching, vaginal dryness, vaginal discharge, and vaginal inflammation. Severity of solicited events symptoms were graded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the grading table in the protocol.</description>

        <description>Therapeutic cure was defined as both a clinical cure and a bacteriological cure. All four Amsel criteria had to be normal with none of the clinical failure criteria listed met to be considered a clinical cure, including normal physiological vaginal discharge, whiff test negative for any amine &quot;fishy&quot; odor, saline wet mount less than 20% for clue cells, and vaginal pH is &lt;=4.5. A clinical failure was defined by at least one of the following: one or more abnormal Amsel criteria, early discontinuation of study therapy due to lack of treatment effect, use of any vaginosis therapy other than study product during the study, or in the investigator's opinion, required additional treatment for vaginosis. A vaginal swab for bacteriological assessment of BV by Nugent criteria was performed. The Nugent score can range from 0 to 10. Bacteriological cure of BV was defined as a normal Nugent score of 0-3. Participants who were clinical failures, or had a Nugent score &gt;3 were therapeutic failures.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Nugent Score of 4-6 (Intermediate BV) in Each Study Arm</title>
        <description>A vaginal swab for bacteriological assessment of BV by Nugent criteria was performed. The Nugent score utilizes a 10-point scale for evaluation of vaginal flora. The Nugent score can range from 0 to 10. A score of 7 to 10 is consistent with BV while 4-6 is considered intermediate and 0-3 is negative for BV. Bacteriological cure of BV was defined as a normal Nugent score of 0-3.</description>

        <description>A clinical cure was defined by normal Amsel criteria, including: normal physiological vaginal discharge, whiff test negative for any amine &quot;fishy&quot; odor, saline wet mount less than 20% for clue cells, and vaginal pH is &lt;=4.5. All four criteria had to be normal with none of the clinical failure criteria met to be considered a clinical cure. A clinical failure was defined by at least one of the following: one or more abnormal Amsel criteria, early discontinuation of study therapy due to lack of treatment effect, use of any vaginosis therapy other than study product during the study, or in the investigator's opinion, requires additional treatment for vaginosis. Participants who did not have enough information to determine a clinical cure or clinical failure status were not evaluable for clinical cure.</description>

      <time_frame>Solicited urogenital AEs were collected following the first dose of the study product (Day 1) through Day 5. Laboratory AEs were collected at Visit 2 (Day 8-15). Serious adverse events and non-laboratory non-solicited AEs were collected following the first dose of the study product (Day 1) through Visit 3 (Day 22-31).</time_frame>
      <desc>Solicited symptoms were counted as AEs if they developed or worsened after the baseline symptom toxicity. Laboratory abnormalities for protocol-specified labs were considered AEs if they worsened at Visit 2 from the baseline value and increased in laboratory toxicity grading from the baseline toxicity grading. Protocol-defined laboratory parameters collected were white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils, creatinine, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and glucose (random).</desc>
