  <brief_summary>

      Identify, by Lipidomics approaches, biochemical markers of fertility / infertility in sperm
      and seminal plasma linking the success or failure of the artificial insemination (IUI)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Analyze lipid profiles in samples of sperm and seminal plasma of three populations:

        1. male sperm donors

        2. men assigned to a program of assisted reproduction with normal sperm / slightly abnormal
           successfully in the IUI;

        3. attached to a program of assisted reproduction with male semen Normal / slightly
           abnormal unsuccessfully in IUI

      Establish partnerships between the composition of fatty acids, especially fatty acids
      polyunsaturated (PUFA) of the omega-3 (w3) series of samples analyzed parameterssemen and
      results of the IA to identify biochemical markers of fertility.

      Assess markers found by checking the increase in the rate of success in the IA.
