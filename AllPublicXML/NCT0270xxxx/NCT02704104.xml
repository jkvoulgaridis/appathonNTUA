    <textblock>
      This study is designed to monitor patient safety after excision of skin lesions and
      subsequent application of AC5 topical hemostatic agent and to assess the performance of AC5
      for controlling bleeding in skin wounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled single-blind pilot study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of AC5 following excision of lesions from the trunk or upper limbs under local
      anesthetic, in patients currently prescribed or not prescribed antiplatelet monotherapy.

      Each patient had sequential shave excision of two lesions (one treatment, one Control) at the
      same sitting. The sequence of wound treatment (AC5 first or Control first) was randomized.

      Study and Control treatments were administered immediately after lesion excision, followed by
      determination of time to hemostasis (TTH), and application of an occlusive water-resistant
      dressing

    <description>The Additional treatment, the presence of Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, and Separation of the deep tissues, the Isolation of bacteria, and the duration of inpatient Stay longer than 14 days (ASEPSIS) Wound Score (reference 1) was used to assess wound healing and overall wound sepsis. This multipoint system is reported as a total score ranging from 0 to 30 points in the first 7 days postoperatively. Additional points after 7 days can be added for additional treatments such as use of antibiotics, drainage of pus under local anesthesia, and debridement of the wound; and isolation of bacteria or duration of stay, for a total score of from 0 to 70 points by day 30. Total scores from 0-10 indicate satisfactory healing, from 11 to 20=disturbance of healing, from 21 to 30=minor wound infection, from 31 to 40=moderate wound infection, and &gt;40 points signifies severe infection. For this study, the number of wounds with ASEPSIS score = 0 was counted.</description>

        <title>Number of Wounds With ASEPSIS Wound Scores of 0 at Day 7 and Day 30</title>
        <description>The Additional treatment, the presence of Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, and Separation of the deep tissues, the Isolation of bacteria, and the duration of inpatient Stay longer than 14 days (ASEPSIS) Wound Score (reference 1) was used to assess wound healing and overall wound sepsis. This multipoint system is reported as a total score ranging from 0 to 30 points in the first 7 days postoperatively. Additional points after 7 days can be added for additional treatments such as use of antibiotics, drainage of pus under local anesthesia, and debridement of the wound; and isolation of bacteria or duration of stay, for a total score of from 0 to 70 points by day 30. Total scores from 0-10 indicate satisfactory healing, from 11 to 20=disturbance of healing, from 21 to 30=minor wound infection, from 31 to 40=moderate wound infection, and &gt;40 points signifies severe infection. For this study, the number of wounds with ASEPSIS score = 0 was counted.</description>
