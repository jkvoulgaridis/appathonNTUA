  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) as monotherapy in
      participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two cohorts: participants with advanced
      HCC and with no curative option after disease progression on sorafenib or intolerance of
      sorafenib (Cohort 1) or who had not received treatment for systemic disease (Cohort 2). Study
      participants may receive pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks for up to 35 initial cycles (up to
      approximately 2 years) and a potential additional 17 cycles in a re-treatment phase
      (approximately an additional 1 year of treatment) .

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of
      pembrolizumab given as monotherapy in participants with HCC.

    <description>Participants with previously systemically treated HCC receive a pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for up to 35 administrations. Participants who stop pembrolizumab as a result of obtaining a confirmed complete response (CR) or those who stop after receiving 35 trial treatments may be eligible for an additional 17 trial treatments (approximately an additional 1 year of treatment) after progressive disease if they meet the criteria for re-treatment.</description>
