  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the actions of nerve growth
      factor (NGF). The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class may offer an important
      breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the
      treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and
      2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks versus placebo at Week 24 in subjects
      with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The 2.5 mg dose was shown to provide efficacy
      benefits with a favorable safety profile when administered intravenously in previous Phase 3
      clinical trials. The 5 mg dose is expected to provide added efficacy benefit over the 2.5 mg
      dose based on data from previous studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group multicenter Phase 3
      study of the efficacy and safety of tanezumab when administered by SC injection for 24 weeks
      compared to placebo in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. A total of
      approximately 810 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio
      (ie, 270/group). The randomization will be stratified by index joint (hip or knee), and most
      severe Kellgren-Lawrence grade (of any knee or hip joint) at study entry (grade 2, 3 or 4).
      Subjects will receive up to three SC doses of one of the following treatments at an 8-week
      interval between each injection:

        1. tanezumab 2.5 mg;

        2. tanezumab 5 mg;

        3. Placebo to match tanezumab. The study is designed with a total (post-randomization)
           duration of 48 weeks and will consist of three periods: Screening (up to 37 days),
           Double-blind Treatment (24 weeks) and Safety Follow-up (24 weeks). The Screening Period
           (beginning up to 37 days prior to Randomization) includes a Washout Period (lasting a
           minimum of 2 days for all prohibited pain medications), if required, and an Initial Pain
           Assessment Period (the 7 days prior to Randomization/Baseline).

      Week 24 is the landmark analysis in this study. Subjects who do not complete the Double-blind
      Treatment period will enter and complete the 24-week Early-termination follow-up period.

    <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

    <description>WPAI is 6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine the impact of OA on absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity, and daily activity impairment for a period of 7 days prior to a visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism), overall work impairment (work productivity) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are expressed as an impairment percentage (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. The health utility score for a participant with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a participant reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>

The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
          <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

          <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0% ; &gt;= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC pain subscale from Baseline to Weeks 16 and 24 were reported, participants (%) are reported more than once in categories specified. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Reduction &gt;=30 Percent (%), &gt;=50%, &gt;=70% and &gt;=90% Response</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC pain intensity of at least (&gt;=) 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 32 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC pain subscale and are reported here. WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale Reduction &gt;=30%, &gt;=50%, &gt;=70% and &gt;=90% Response</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC physical function of at least (&gt;=)30%,50%,70% and 90% at weeks 2,4,8,12,16,24 and 32 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC physical function subscale. WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function:Participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

          <description>Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC physical function of at least (&gt;=)30%,50%,70% and 90% at weeks 2,4,8,12,16,24 and 32 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC physical function subscale. WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function:Participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Percent Change From Baseline Reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 16 and 24</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0 %; &gt;= 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90%; =100 %) in WOMAC physical function subscale from Baseline to Weeks 16 and 24 were reported. WOMAC:Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale:17-item questionnaire to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Percent Change From Baseline Reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 16 and 24</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0 %; &gt;= 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90%; =100 %) in WOMAC physical function subscale from Baseline to Weeks 16 and 24 were reported. WOMAC:Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale:17-item questionnaire to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>
          <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either tanezumab or placebo). Here, ‘Overall number of participants analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: &quot;Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, where, 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition. Percentage of participants with improvement of at least 2 points from Baseline in PGA of OA were reported. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Improvement of &gt;=2 Points in Patient's Global Assessment (PGA) of Osteoarthritis</title>
          <description>PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: &quot;Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, where, 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition. Percentage of participants with improvement of at least 2 points from Baseline in PGA of OA were reported. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either tanezumab or placebo). Here ‘Overall number of participants analyzed’ = participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and ‘Number analyzed’ = participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time points.</population>

        <description>Participants assessed their average pain in the index hip/knee in the past 24 hours using a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Higher scores indicated higher pain. Data represents averages of the values reported during the 8-week interval up to and including the given week. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between each post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to OA in the index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC stiffness subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale at Week 32</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to OA in the index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 2 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC stiffness subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA of index joint (knee or hip). WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [no difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and WOMAC stiffness subscale assess the amount of stiffness experienced (score: 0 [no stiffness] to 10 [extreme stiffness], higher score = higher stiffness). WOMAC average score was the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated worse response.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA of index joint (knee or hip). WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [no difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and WOMAC stiffness subscale assess the amount of stiffness experienced (score: 0 [no stiffness] to 10 [extreme stiffness], higher score = higher stiffness). WOMAC average score was the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated worse response.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA in index joint (knee or hip). Participants answered a question: &quot;How much pain have you had when walking on a flat surface?&quot;. Participants responded about the amount of pain they experienced when walking on a flat surface by using a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

Participants responded about the amount of pain they experienced when walking on a flat surface by using a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>
          <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either tanezumab or placebo). Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time points.</population>

        <description>WPAI is 6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine the impact of OA on absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity, and daily activity impairment for a period of 7 days prior to a visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism), overall work impairment (work productivity) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are expressed as an impairment percentage (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Osteoarthritis (WPAI:OA) Impairment Scores at Weeks 8, 16 and 24</title>
        <description>WPAI is 6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine the impact of OA on absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity, and daily activity impairment for a period of 7 days prior to a visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism), overall work impairment (work productivity) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are expressed as an impairment percentage (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either tanezumab or placebo). Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure for specified categories.</population>

        <title>European Quality of Life- 5 Dimension-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Dimensions Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. The health utility score for a participant with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a participant reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life- 5 Dimension-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Overall Health Utility Score/ Index Value</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Responses from the five domains were used to calculate a single utility index (the Overall health utility score) where values are less than equal to (&lt;=) 1. The Overall health utility score for a participant with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a participant reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-Modified (mPRTI) Score at Weeks 16 and 24: Participant Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-Overall, How Satisfied Are You With The Drug That You Received in This Study?</title>
        <description>The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant reported treatment impact assessment (to assess participant satisfaction), participant global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant willingness to use drug again assessment. For participant satisfaction, participants responded using interactive response technology (IRT) on a 5 point likert scale from 1-5, where 1=extremely dissatisfied, 2=dissatisfied, 3=neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4=satisfied and 5=extremely satisfied. Higher scores indicated greater satisfaction.</description>

          <title>Patient Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-Modified (mPRTI) Score at Weeks 16 and 24: Participant Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-Overall, How Satisfied Are You With The Drug That You Received in This Study?</title>
          <description>The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant reported treatment impact assessment (to assess participant satisfaction), participant global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant willingness to use drug again assessment. For participant satisfaction, participants responded using interactive response technology (IRT) on a 5 point likert scale from 1-5, where 1=extremely dissatisfied, 2=dissatisfied, 3=neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4=satisfied and 5=extremely satisfied. Higher scores indicated greater satisfaction.</description>
          <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either tanezumab or placebo). Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time point.</population>

        <title>Patient Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-Modified (mPRTI) Score at Weeks 16 and 24: Participant Global Preference Assessment- Overall, do You Prefer The Drug That You Received in This Study to Previous Treatment?</title>
        <description>The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant reported treatment impact assessment (to assess participant satisfaction), participant global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant willingness to use drug again assessment. To assess preference to continue using the investigational product, participants responded using interactive response technology (IRT) on a 5 point likert scale from 1-5, where, 1= yes, I definitely prefer the drug that I am receiving now, 2= I have a slight preference for the drug that I am receiving now, 3= I have no preference either way, 4= I have a slight preference for my previous treatment, 5= No, I definitely prefer my previous treatment. Higher scores indicate lesser preference to use the investigational product.</description>

        <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either tanezumab or placebo). Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time point.</population>

        <description>Orthostatic hypotension was defined as postural change (supine to standing) that met the following criteria: For systolic BP &lt;=150 mmHg (mean supine): Reduction in systolic BP&gt;=20 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP&gt;=10 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. For systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg (mean supine): Reduction in systolic BP&gt;=30 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP&gt;=15 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. If the 1 minute or 3 minute standing BP in a sequence met the orthostatic hypotension criteria, then that sequence was considered positive. If 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences were positive, then orthostatic hypotension was considered confirmed.</description>

If 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences were positive, then orthostatic hypotension was considered confirmed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Survey of Autonomic Symptom (SAS) Scores at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SAS is a 12 item (11 for females) questionnaire, from which the total number of symptoms (0-12 for males and 0-11 for females) is calculated. Each positive symptom is rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot). The total impact score was the sum of all symptom rating scores, with 0 assigned where the participant did not have the particular symptom. The range for the total impact score is 0-60 for males and 0-55 for females, higher scores indicating higher impact.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 and 48</title>
        <description>NIS is a standardized instrument used to evaluate participant for signs of peripheral neuropathy. NIS is the sum of scores of 37 items, from both the left and right side, where 24 items scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score indicated higher abnormality/impairment and 13 items scored from 0 (normal), 1 (decreased) and 2 (absent), higher score indicated higher impairment. NIS possible overall score ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 244 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased impairment.</description>
