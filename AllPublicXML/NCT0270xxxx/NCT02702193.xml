    <textblock>
      The study conducts a community-based randomized trial comparing an adaptation of Structural
      Ecosystems Therapy (SET), &quot;Healthy Home&quot;, as an enhancement of substance abuse or mental
      health outpatient treatment, to outpatient treatment as usual (TAU) among approximately 172
      Black, Hispanic and White nonHispanic mothers enrolled in outpatient substance abuse or
      mental health services. The study is conducted with a community partner, Banyan Health
      Systems, that delivers substance abuse/mental health treatment and primary care. Data is
      collected at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 months postrandomization. The Specific Aims of the
      proposed study are to: 1) test the effectiveness of Healthy Home for improving physical and
      mental health and reducing relapse of mothers in substance abuse/mental health recovery; 2)
      test the effectiveness of Healthy Home for improving health and mental health outcomes of
      children of mothers in recovery; 3) test mechanisms of action of Healthy Home (self care,
      environmental risk, family functioning and stigma); 4) assess implementation and
      sustainability factors and the relationship between fidelity and outcomes; and 5) examine the
      interactions of ethnicity and ethnicity related factors on outcomes. Healthy Home is a
      manualized, strength-based, directive and process oriented family ecosystemic home health
      intervention developed to address the needs of mothers and their children affected by
      substance abuse and other mental health disorders.
