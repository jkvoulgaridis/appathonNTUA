    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well abiraterone acetate,
      prednisone, and apalutamide work with or without ipilimumab or cabazitaxel and carboplatin in
      treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places
      in the body. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as
      abiraterone acetate and apalutamide may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as prednisone, cabazitaxel, and carboplatin work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving
      abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and apalutamide with or without ipilimumab or cabazitaxel
      and carboplatin may be a better way to treat patients with castration-resistant prostate
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall survival (OS) of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC) who have SATISFACTORY features after to 8 weeks of maximal androgen receptor
      (AR)-inhibitory therapy and receive treatment with abiraterone acetate, prednisone and
      apalutamide plus or minus ipilimumab.

      II. To estimate the OS of men with mCRPC who have UNSATISFACTORY features after to up to 8
      weeks of maximal androgen receptor (AR)-inhibitory therapy and receive treatment with
      abiraterone acetate, prednisone, apalutamide, cabazitaxel and carboplatin.

      III. To determine the TOXICITY PROFILE of the following combinations in men with mCRPC:

      IIIa. Abiraterone acetate, prednisone, apalutamide. IIIb. Abiraterone acetate, prednisone,
      apalutamide and ipilimumab. IIIc. Abiraterone acetate, prednisone, apalutamide, cabazitaxel
      and carboplatin.

      IV. To determine whether the BASELINE &quot;AR RESPONSE SIGNATURE&quot; correlates with SATISFACTORY or
      UNSATISFACTORY features after up to 8-weeks of treatment with abiraterone, prednisone and
      apalutamide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To &quot;pick the winner&quot; in terms of time to treatment failure (TTF) between the following two
      combinations, in men with mCRPC and satisfactory features after 8 weeks of maximal
      AR-inhibitory therapy:

      Ia. Abiraterone acetate, prednisone, apalutamide. Ib. Abiraterone acetate, prednisone,
      apalutamide and ipilimumab. II. To determine the TTF in men with mCRPC and unsatisfactory
      features after up to 8 weeks of maximal AR-inhibitory therapy ted with abiraterone acetate,
      prednisone, apalutamide, cabazitaxel and carboplatin.

      III. To determine whether the &quot;baseline AR response signature&quot; predicts for benefit by
      prognostic grouping (satisfactory/unsatisfactory) and treatment arm.

      IV. To investigate therapy-specific marker signatures (immune based, bone based and
      anaplastic) and their link to outcome.

      V. To collect and archive bone marrow biopsy, bone marrow aspirate, serum, plasma, and tissue
      samples in study patients for later hypothesis generating associations.

      OUTLINE: After an 8-week lead-in phase, patients with satisfactory decline in serum markers
      are randomized to 1 of 2 arms (Arm 2A or 2B), and patients with unsatisfactory decline in
      serum markers are assigned to Arm 3.

      LEAD-IN PHASE: Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) daily, prednisone PO twice
      daily (BID), and apalutamide PO daily for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unexpected toxicity.

      ARM 2A: Patients receive abiraterone acetate PO daily, prednisone PO BID, and apalutamide PO
      daily in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      ARM 2B: Patients receive abiraterone acetate PO daily, prednisone PO BID, and apalutamide PO
      daily. Patients also receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 of
      courses 4-7. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unexpected
      toxicity.

      ARM 3: Patients receive abiraterone acetate PO daily, prednisone PO BID, and apalutamide PO
      daily. Patients also receive cabazitaxel IV over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 60
      minutes on day 1 of courses 4-13. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 and 30 days, and then
      every 6 months thereafter.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt;= 140 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;=

             arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, severe or unstable angina, history of
             clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia,
             ventricular fibrillation, or torsades de pointes), New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             class III-IV heart disease or cardiac ejection fraction measurement of &lt; 40% at
             baseline

          -  Autoimmune disease: patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (including
             Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid
             arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic progressive
             sclerosis [scleroderma and variants], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis] or autoimmune neuropathies (such as
             Guillain-Barre syndrome) are excluded from this study; vitiligo and adequately
             controlled endocrine deficiencies such as hypothyroidism are not exclusionary

          -  Patients who have had a history of illness which put them at current risk for bowel
             perforation such as acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, gastrointestinal
             (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis

          -  History of seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (including but
             not limited to prior stroke or, loss of consciousness within 1 year prior to
             randomization, brain arteriovenous malformation; or intracranial masses such as
             schwannomas and meningiomas that are causing edema or mass effect)

          -  Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption

          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events

          -  Untreated symptomatic spinal cord compressions

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated
