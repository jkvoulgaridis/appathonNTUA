  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label cohort study in adult patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing pemphigus
      vulgaris, with intra-patient dose-adjustment based on clinical response and BTK occupancy,
      and with conventional immunosuppressive &quot;rescue treatment&quot;, if indicated. The duration of
      therapy in Part A will be 12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of follow up. The extension phase,
      Part B includes 24 weeks of therapy, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up.

      Primary Objectives:

      To evaluate the safety of PRN1008 in patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) To evaluate the
      clinical activity of PRN1008 in patients with PV, per criteria in the European Academy of
      Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2014 Pemphigus S2 Guideline (Hertl et al. 2015)

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      multiple doses of PRN1008 in patients with PV To evaluate the relationship of PK and PD to
      each other and to efficacy and safety in this patient population
