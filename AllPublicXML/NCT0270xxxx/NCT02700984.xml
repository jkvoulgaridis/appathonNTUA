  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of the CyPass Micro-Stent in
      subjects who completed Study Protocol TMI-09-01, COMPASS Trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COMPASS Trial (TMI-09-01) was a prospective, randomized, comparative multicenter study to
      assess the safety and effectiveness of the CyPass Micro-Stent in subjects with primary open
      angle glaucoma who were undergoing cataract surgery. In the study, 505 subjects were
      randomized to either the CyPass group, who underwent cataract surgery and received the CyPass
      Micro-Stent, or the Control group, who underwent cataract surgery alone. All subjects
      randomized were to be followed for 2 years postoperatively. Four hundred eighty (480)
      subjects completed this study.

      The COMPASS-XT (TMI-09-01-E) Trial is designed to collect safety data beyond 24 months
      postoperatively for subjects who completed the COMPASS Trial. In COMPASS-XT, clinical data
      will be collected at 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months postoperatively for a total of 5
      year follow-up across the 2 studies.

    <measure>5-year Annualized Rate (Percentage) of Sight-threatening Adverse Events, by Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 60 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Sight-threatening adverse events occurring in the study eye included, but were not limited to: BCVA loss of ≥ 3 lines, endophthalmitis, corneal decompensation, severe retinal detachment, severe choroidal hemorrhage, severe choroidal detachment and aqueous misdirection. The number of events at the end of Year 5 was divided by the number of eyes at risk at the beginning of Year 1 for a 5-year annualized rate. The 5-year annualized rate is reported as a percentage, with the last annual non-censored rate divided by 5. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>

A larger denominator indicates a lower visual acuity. Baseline, Month 12, and Month 24 data derived from previous COMPASS trial. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Reduction From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 36, 48, 60 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters mercury (mmHg). A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). A higher reduction from baseline (ie, a greater postitive number) indicates greater improvement. Baseline was derived from COMPASS trial. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With ≥ 20% Reduction in IOP From Baseline (COMPASS Trial) Without the Use of Ocular Hypotensive Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 36, 48, 60 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Not Using Ocular Hypotensive Medication With IOP ≥ 6 mmHg and ≤ 18 mmHg</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 36, 48, 60 postoperative</time_frame>

        <description>Best corrected (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) VA was assessed using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts at 1 or 4 meters and determined by total number of letters read correctly. 20/20 Snellen is considered 'normal' vision. A larger denominator indicates a lower visual acuity. Baseline, Month 12, and Month 24 data derived from previous COMPASS trial. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>

        <description>Iris Rubeosis (abnormal blood vessels (formed by neovascularization) found on the surface of the iris) was assessed by the investigator during slit-lamp examination and rated on a 4-point scale: None, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. Only the categories with reported data are included. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>

        <description>For subjects in the CyPass group, gonioscopic examination was performed to assess the position of the CyPass Micro-Stent in the angle and with respect to the iris and the corneal endothelium. A visible CyPass Micro-Stent indicated a lack of adhesions (favorable). One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>

        <description>Visual field (how much one can see to each side while focusing the eyes on a central point (peripheral vision)) deviations were obtained with a Humphrey automated perimeter using the 24-2 SITA standard testing method. Normal deviation values are typically within 0 to -2 decibels (dB) and become more negative as the overall field worsens. Month 24 data derived from COMPASS trial. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>

        <title>Central Corneal Endothelial Cell Density (ECD) by Visit</title>
        <description>The endothelium maintains corneal hydration and reduced cell density can disrupt vision. Central endothelial cell counts were assessed using non-contact specular microscopy. Specular images were taken of the corneal endothelium and submitted to a reading center in order to standardize readings across all sites and optimize reading reliability. Baseline through Month 24 data were derived from COMPASS trial. A higher cell density indicates improvement. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Subjects Not Using Ocular Hypotensive Medication With IOP ≥ 6 mmHg and ≤ 18 mmHg</title>
          <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Inferential testing was not planned for this endpoint.</description>
