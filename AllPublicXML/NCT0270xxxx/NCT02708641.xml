  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab on the duration of remission
      in acute myeloid leukemia. Pembrolizumab is given after complete remission is obtained in
      those with AML at least 60 years old who are not candidates for allogeneic stem cell
      transplant. The primary purpose of this study is determine if the time to relapse can be
      extended. Additionally, the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab will be closely
      monitored.

Relapse of AML is defined as patients reaching remission (bone marrow contains &lt;5% blast cells, blood cell counts return to within normal limits, no signs disease) followed by a return of leukemia cells in the marrow and a decrease in normal blood cells.</description>
