  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the functional and physiological effects associated
      with the use of High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring
      (HIRREM), as supplemental care, for symptoms of neurological, cardiovascular, and
      neuropsychological disorders. This is a non-randomized, open label, and unblinded
      before-and-after trial, evaluating the effect of HIRREM on an objective, physiological common
      denominator (heart rate variability, HRV), across a variety of relevant conditions, as well
      as changes in clinical symptoms inventories, to generate hypotheses and pilot data for
      investigation in future proposals.

    <description>This is a single site, single-arm, open-label, developmental study. Participants are recruited to receive eight to twenty sessions of High-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM), in addition to their usual care.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>HIRREM</intervention_name>
    <description>HIRREM is a noninvasive, closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neuro-technology to facilitate recipient-unique relaxation, auto-calibration, and self-optimization of cortical neural oscillations by reflecting auditory tones in near real time. After an initial HIRREM assessment, evaluating patterns of brain electrical rhythms, subjects get a series of 90-120 minute HIRREM sessions, including 5 to 9 individualized protocols. A protocol is a combination of sensor montage and specific software design, during which dominant brain frequencies, recorded at high spectral resolutions, are translated to audible tones, and reflected back via earphones with as little as 8 milliseconds delay. Protocols are received sitting or reclining in a chair, some with eyes open, others eyes closed.</description>

          <description>The CES-D is a 20-item survey assessing affective depressive symptomatology to screen for risk of depression. Scores range from 0-60, with a score of 16 commonly used as a clinically relevant cut-off. Higher scores suggest the presence of more symptomatology.</description>
          <population>CES-D was temporarily removed as approved measure of depression (35 subjects). Other entries were excluded if there was incomplete or missing data. Late data collection visit was added at after participant 65. Out of town subjects typically were not able to make it back for late data collections.</population>

        <description>Reaction testing is measured by a drop-stick apparatus that has been validated as a way to quantify the impact of athletic concussion on psychomotor performance. Following two practice trials, participants perform eight trials, and a mean distance value is calculated. Better reaction time is denoted by a lower score.

          <description>Reaction testing is measured by a drop-stick apparatus that has been validated as a way to quantify the impact of athletic concussion on psychomotor performance. Following two practice trials, participants perform eight trials, and a mean distance value is calculated. Better reaction time is denoted by a lower score.
