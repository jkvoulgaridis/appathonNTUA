    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Clinically Relevant Decrease in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with a clinically relevant decrease in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) Score is defined as participants with absolute decrease of ≥ 3-points in ESSDAI score. ESSDAI is physician-assessed disease activity index developed by EULAR consortium consisting of 44 items in 12 organ-specific 'domains' (constitutional,lymphadenopathy, articular,muscular,cutaneous,glandular,pulmonary,renal,peripheral nervous system,central nervous system,hematological,biological). Each domain is assessed for activity level (i.e., no, low, moderate, high) and assigned a numerical score based on pre-determined weighting of each individual domain. Overall score is calculated as sum of all individual weighted domain scores (ranges from 0 (best) to 123 (worst activity). A score ≥ 5 is considered moderate or severe disease activity and a clinically relevant change in ESSDAI score is defined as absolute decrease of ≥ 3-points.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Clinically Relevant Decrease in EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient-Reported Index (ESSPRI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of RO5459072 in patients with primary Sjogren's Syndrome Disease is evaluated in terms of the percentage of participants with a clinically relevant decrease in EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient-Reported Index (ESSPRI) Score, where a clinically relevant decrease in ESSPRI score is defined as a decrease of ≥ 1 point. The ESSPRI is a patient-reported, subjective symptom index for primary Sjögren's syndrome developed by the EULAR consortium. It consists of 3 questions covering cardinal symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome: dryness, fatigue and pain (articular and/or muscular). Each domain scored on scale of 0-10 (0 =no symptom at all and 10 = worst symptom imaginable), and overall score is calculated as the mean of 3 individual domains where all domains carry same weight.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) Score is defined as the change in score between baseline (Week -1) and Week 12. The ESSDAI is a physician-assessed disease activity index for primary Sjögren's syndrome developed by the EULAR consortium. It consists of 44 items in 12 organ-specific 'domains' contributing to disease activity (constitutional, lymphadenopathy, articular, muscular, cutaneous, glandular, pulmonary, renal, peripheral nervous system, central nervous system, hematological, biological). Each domain is assessed for activity level (i.e., no, low, moderate, high) and assigned a numerical score based on pre-determined weighting of each individual domain. An overall score is then calculated as the sum of all individual weighted domain scores. Overall score is calculated as sum of all individual weighted domain scores (ranges from 0 (best) to 123 (worst activity).</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient-Reported Index (ESSPRI) Score is defined as the change in score between baseline (Week -1) and Week 12. The ESSPRI is a patient-reported, subjective symptom index for primary Sjögren's syndrome developed by the EULAR consortium. It consists of three questions covering the cardinal symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome: dryness, fatigue and pain (articular and/or muscular). Each domain scored on scale of 0-10 (0 =no symptom at all and 10 = worst symptom imaginable), and an overall score is calculated as the mean of the three individual domains where all domains carry the same weight.</description>

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Clinically Relevant Decrease in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) Score</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with a clinically relevant decrease in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) Score is defined as participants with absolute decrease of ≥ 3-points in ESSDAI score. ESSDAI is physician-assessed disease activity index developed by EULAR consortium consisting of 44 items in 12 organ-specific 'domains' (constitutional,lymphadenopathy, articular,muscular,cutaneous,glandular,pulmonary,renal,peripheral nervous system,central nervous system,hematological,biological). Each domain is assessed for activity level (i.e., no, low, moderate, high) and assigned a numerical score based on pre-determined weighting of each individual domain. Overall score is calculated as sum of all individual weighted domain scores (ranges from 0 (best) to 123 (worst activity). A score ≥ 5 is considered moderate or severe disease activity and a clinically relevant change in ESSDAI score is defined as absolute decrease of ≥ 3-points.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) Score is defined as the change in score between baseline (Week -1) and Week 12. The ESSDAI is a physician-assessed disease activity index for primary Sjögren's syndrome developed by the EULAR consortium. It consists of 44 items in 12 organ-specific 'domains' contributing to disease activity (constitutional, lymphadenopathy, articular, muscular, cutaneous, glandular, pulmonary, renal, peripheral nervous system, central nervous system, hematological, biological). Each domain is assessed for activity level (i.e., no, low, moderate, high) and assigned a numerical score based on pre-determined weighting of each individual domain. An overall score is then calculated as the sum of all individual weighted domain scores. Overall score is calculated as sum of all individual weighted domain scores (ranges from 0 (best) to 123 (worst activity).</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) Mental score is defined as the change in score between baseline (Week -1) and Week 12. The SF-36 was used to assess health-related quality of life at baseline and at on-treatment visits. The SF-36 consisted of 36 questions covering 8 domains (general health, physical functioning, role-functioning physical, bodily pain, social functioning, role-functioning emotional, mental health, and vitality), with each domain scoring on a scale 0-100 (a score of 0 = maximum disability and a score of 100 = no disability). Reported here is the mental health domain score.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient-Reported Index (ESSPRI) fatigue component score is defined as the change in score between baseline (Week -1) and Week 12. The ESSPRI score consists of three questions covering the cardinal symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome: dryness, fatigue and pain (articular and/or muscular). Each domain scored on scale of 0-10 (0 =no symptom at all and 10 = worst symptom imaginable).</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in mechanically stimulated salivary flow rate is defined as the change in flow (mL/min) between baseline (Week -1) and Week 2, Week 6 and Week 12. Using a mechanical stimulation method of a piece of neutral wax, paraffin, silicone, unflavored chewing gum, or similar chewable, unflavored, nonabsorbent material, patients were instructed to chew for a period of 5 minutes. The stimulated salivary flow rate was calculated assuming a specific gravity of 1 (i.e., 1 mL saliva = 1 g) and expressed in mL per minute.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
