    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of a video based mindfulness intervention for stress reduction
      and to evaluate the cortisol response in persons with PD and their caregivers. The data from
      this project will be used for a future grant application of a stress reduction intervention
      in persons with PD.

      Participants will be enrolled at the VA Portland and have a baseline assessment. The baseline
      will assess neurological disorders (including Parkinsonism) and current stress. All
      participants will attend 10 weeks of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) through video
      feed on the Portland VA campus. During the week prior to the first class and the week after
      the last class, participants will complete questionnaires regarding stress, collect saliva
      samples, and, for the Parkinson's patient, monitor motor symptoms of PD using diaries and
      inertial sensors. A final visit will assess stress, neurological diseases, and Parkinsonism.

          <description>The MoCA is a short cognitive screening test designed to assist health care professionals for the detection of mild cognitive impairment. The MoCA assesses cognitive function across a variety of domains, such as visuospatial /executive functioning, naming (animals), memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. The MoCA is scored on a 0 to 30 scale, with lower numbers indicating more cognitive impairment. Scores ranging from 26 - 30 are normal, 18 - 26 mild impairment, 10 - 17 moderate impairment, and less than 10 severe cognitive impairment.</description>

Each item on the scale is rated from 0 (normal) to 4 (Can barely perform the task) several motor areas including speech, facial expression, tremor, rigidity, hand movements, agility, posture, and gait. Total score ranges from 0 to 108 with higher values on this scale represent a more severe stage of the disease.</description>

          <title>Hoehn &amp; Yahr</title>
          <description>This is an objective staging scale for rating the clinical functioning of Parkinson’s disease patients, combining functional deficits (disability) and objective signs (impairment). This staging scale is commonly used in both research settings and clinical practice. The Hoehn &amp; Yahr is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no signs of disease) to 5 (wheelchair bound/bedridden). The modified version of the scale includes increments of 0.5. The HY has shown good inter-rater reliability and, although it is used worldwide, the clinimetric validity has not been established</description>

          <description>The HAM-A is a widely used measure of the severity of anxiety symptoms in adults, adolescents and children. The 14-item scale asks about a series of symptoms and measures both psychic anxiety (mental/psychological) and somatic anxiety (physical). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe) with a total range 0-56. Greater than 17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity, and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

          <title>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM - D)</title>
          <description>The HAM-D is a widely used measure of the severity of depression. The HAM-D must be administered by a trained professional using a semi-structured interview. The HAM-D has been validated in a community sample of Parkinson's disease patients and has shown good convergent validity in de novo Parkinson's patients. Scoring is based on the first 17. Nine items are scored 0-2 with 0 indicating no difficulty. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). Scores range from 0 to 53 with higher scores indicating more severe depression.</description>

          <description>This is a self-administered quality of life questionnaire specifically designed for the caregiver of a Parkinson's disease patient. The 29-item represents four discrete scales social and personal activities, anxiety and depression, self-care, and stress. All items are asked about the influence of caring on specific areas of life over the past four weeks and are rated on a 0 &quot;Never&quot; to 4 &quot;Always&quot; scale. Raw scores are summed and range from 0 to 100 with 100 being worst/maximum level of a problem.</description>
