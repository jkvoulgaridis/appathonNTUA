    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study being conducted as a postmarketing
      requirement to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate whether there is a lower
      starting dosage of lenvatinib 24 mg once daily (QD) that provides comparable efficacy but has
      a better safety profile in participants with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid
      cancer RR-DTC with radiographic evidence of disease progression within the prior 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 phases, the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The
      Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days and will include a Screening Period
      to establish protocol eligibility and a Baseline Period to confirm eligibility and establish
      disease characteristics prior to randomization and treatment.

      The Randomization Phase will consist of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. It will
      begin at the time of randomization of the first participant and will consist of 28-day
      blinded study treatment cycles. The data cutoff for the primary analysis will occur at the
      end of the Randomization Phase, which is defined as when the last participant enrolled
      completes the Week 24 tumor assessments or discontinues study treatment if before Week 24.

      Participants on treatment at the time of data cutoff for the primary analysis will remain on
      blinded investigational product until the primary analysis has been completed, after which
      they will transition to commercial lenvatinib outside the study. The last participant's last
      assessment (Off-treatment visit) will be the End of Study.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with 1 of 2 blinded dosages of lenvatinib
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive lenvatinib 18 mg or 24 mg orally once daily (QD). Dose reductions
      will occur in succession based on the previous dose level (24, 20, 14, 10, and 8 mg QD, or
      18, 14, 10, 8, and 4 mg QD, respectively). Once the dose has been reduced, it may not be
      increased at a later date.

                  such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation must show evidence of progressive disease
                  based on RECIST 1.1 to be deemed a target lesion.

          3. Participants must show evidence of disease progression within 12 months (an additional
             month will be allowed to accommodate actual dates of performance of screening scans,
             ie, within ≤13 months) prior to signing informed consent, according to RECIST 1.1
             assessed and confirmed by central radiographic review of CT and/or MRI scans.

                  within 12 months (an additional month will be allowed to accommodate actual dates
                  of performance of screening scans, ie, within ≤13 months) after Iodine-131
                  therapy, despite demonstration of radioiodine avidity at the time of that
                  treatment by pre- or posttreatment scanning. These participants must not be
                  eligible for possible curative surgery.

             stereotactic radiosurgery or complete surgical resection, will be eligible if they
             have remained clinically stable, asymptomatic, and off steroids for one month.

          6. Participants must be receiving thyroxine suppression therapy and thyroid stimulating
             hormone (TSH) should not be elevated (TSH should be ≤5.50 mcIU/ML). When tolerated by
             the participant, thyroxine dose should be changed to achieve TSH suppression (TSH
             &lt;0.50 mcIU/ML) and this dose may be changed concurrently upon starting study drug
             treatment.

          7. All chemotherapy or radiation-related toxicities must have resolved to Grade &lt;2
             severity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03), except

               3. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL

         12. Adequate blood coagulation function as evidenced by an International Normalized Ratio
             (INR) ≤1.5.

         13. Adequate liver function:

               1. Bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) except for unconjugated
                  hyperbilirubinemia or Gilbert's syndrome.

                  (in presence of liver metastases) AND the participant also is known to have bone
                  metastases, the liver-specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the
                  total and used to assess the liver function instead of total alkaline
                  phosphatase.

         14. Males or females age ≥18 years at the time of informed consent.

             25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG. A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug.

         16. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically

             surgery at least 1 month before dosing).

         17. Females of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant and use highly
             effective contraception while on treatment with lenvatinib and for at least 1 month
             after finishing treatment. Females of childbearing potential must not have had
             unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use
             a highly effective method of contraception (eg, total abstinence, an intrauterine
             device, a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner
             with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after
             study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have
             been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks
             before dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for
             30 days after study drug discontinuation. Women using oral hormonal contraceptives
             should add a barrier method.

         18. Participants must voluntarily agree to provide written informed consent.

         19. Participants must be willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol.
