    <description>Tooth samples of human enamel are placed in a retainer and worn by each study subject. Enamel block samples will be x-rayed and analyzed for mineral level (volume % of micrometer of lesions, vol % µm) before being placed in the retainer. These baseline values will be compared with the post use delta mineral change ( ΔZ).</description>

    <description>Tooth samples of human enamel are placed in a retainer and worn by each study subject. After 2 weeks of brushing while wearing the study oral retainer, samples from the retainer will be x-rayed and analyzed for mineral level (volume % of micrometer of lesions, vol % µm). These post use values will be compared to the baseline values to give a delta mineral change ( ΔZ).</description>
