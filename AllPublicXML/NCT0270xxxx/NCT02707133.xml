  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choroidal nevomelanocytic lesions have a high prevalence affecting up to 7% of the entire
      population and are increasingly incidentally identified during routine eye check- ups in
      community optometry services. Given the tendency to err on the side of caution, there is
      evidence of excessive referrals challenging service delivery in both tertiary eye units and
      specialist ocular oncology services. Although previous studies have examined the natural
      history and risk factors for growth of choroidal nevomelanocytic lesions, optimal delivery of
      management remains uncertain. Management approaches display diversity with respect to the
      number and type of baseline investigations, the duration and frequency of monitoring of
      relevant patients. Utilisation of the skills of allied health professionals in appropriate
      cases would allow streamlining service delivery in a socialised healthcare system, maximise
      capacity, and allow community services to play an enhanced role. However, the evidence for
      this model of delivery is lacking. Within existing models of care for these lesions, patients
      are faced with delays, need for more than one attendances to the hospital and increased
      anxiety around prognosis.

      This project aims to answer the question of whether these low-risk, bland incidental findings
      might possibly be managed by allied health professionals with the use of clinical imaging and
      specific algorithms to make appropriate management decisions. We aim to validate a model of
      service delivery on a virtual basis that will accommodate for capacity pressures to accept
      all relevant referrals, while offering a safe service and optimising patient experience of
      care. We will thus validate the setting up of a virtual choroidal nevomelanocytic clinic in
      terms of safety and patient acceptability. More specifically, the degree of agreement between
      management decisions made by non-medical graders on the basis of imaging data alone as
      opposed to gold standard decisions (clinical and imaging tests combined) is examined. Health
      economics analysis of the proposed service delivery model will be undertaken to demonstrate
      cost-effectiveness.

        Patients under the care of MREH and MEH for ocular nevomelanocytic lesions (CNL) will be
        recruited prospectively into the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All patients attending the CNL clinics of MREH/MEH who have offered informed consent will
        be included in the study. Patients who are then diagnosed with alternate pathologies other
        than CNL (erroneous referrals) will be excluded from agreement analysis. Recognition of
        alternate pathologies by non-medical graders will, however, be an additional outcome
        measure for this project. Cases of Congenital Hypertrophy of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium
        (CHRPE) will be classified as 'alternate pathology' for the purposes of this study.
        Exclusion criteria will be media opacities (cornea, lens, vitreous body) precluding
        adequate visualisation of fundus and incomplete set of imaging data.
