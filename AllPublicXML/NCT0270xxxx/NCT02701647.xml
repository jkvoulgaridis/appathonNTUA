  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the beneficial effect of treadmill
      training on people with Parkinson's disease can be enhanced by high- and low-frequency
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Fifty-one participants with Parkinson's
      disease (PD) will be recruited from the Hong Kong PD association, a self-help group and
      movement disorders clinic of 3 local hospitals. Written informed consent in accordance with
      the Declaration of Helsinki will be obtained from all participants. Eligible participants
      will be randomly assigned into one of the three groups: 1Hz-TT, 25Hz-TT, and sham-TT upon
      recruitment. Randomisation will be generated by a computer program and group assignment will
      be blinded to both participants and assessor. Participant will receive either 1-Hz, 25-Hz, or
      sham rTMS which will last for about 20 minutes followed by 30 minutes treadmill walking
      training for 12 sessions, 4 times per week for 3 weeks. All assessments will be conducted 1
      week before intervention and 1 day after completion of intervention, after 1-month training
      and at 3-month post training.

      The sample size calculation is based on the significant findings of the gait speed reported
      by Yang et al (2013). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA design with between-subject group
      effect (3 levels) and within-subject time effect (4 levels) determines that 15 subjects per
      group are required to achieve 85% power to test the interaction effect between groups and
      time effect with a 5% significance level and the effect size is 0.2. By assuming 10% dropout
      rate, 17 subjects will be required per group.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cortical Silent Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 day post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Ten suprathreshold TMS stimuli (i.e. 130% RMT) will be delivered while participant performing a 20% isometric maximal contraction of Tibialis Anterior of the more affected side. Cortical silent period (CSP) measures the duration of interruption of electromyography (EMG) activity in the contracting muscle produced by TMS. CSP duration will be determined as the period between the onset of MEP and the return of baseline EMG activity measured 50 ms before the TMS stimulus.</description>

    <measure>Gradient of the Recruitment Curve ( Also Known as Stimulus-response Curve)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 day post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>TMS stimuli will be applied at 10% steps between 100% to 160% RMT. 10 stimuli will be delivered at each intensity. Peak to peak amplitude of 10 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) at each stimulus intensity will be averaged offline.The cut-off intensity is set at 75% of maximum stimulator output due to discomfort perceived by majority of the participants. MEPs will be normalised with the maximal muscle action potential (MMax), which is determined by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the fibular nerve. A scatter graph will be generated with the average amplitude of MEPs as a function of stimulation intensity. The linear trend will be added to generate the linear recruitment curve slope.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Short-interval-intracortical Inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 day post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Short-interval-intracortical inhibition (SICI) is another measure of cortical inhibition. In a paired- pulse TMS paradigm, a test pulse will be adjusted to produce MEP of at least 0.5 millivolts which will be delivered preceded by a brief conditioned pulse set at a lower intensity of 80% RMT with inter-stimulus interval of 2 milliseconds. Two stimulators connected via a Bistim module ( Magstim Co.,Whitland, UK) will be used in this test. Ten conditioned MEPs and unconditioned MEPs will be obtained in a random order and were averaged for each condition. SICI is expressed as percentage of unconditioned test MEP amplitude.</description>

    <description>Participants will proceed to 30 minute of treadmill training after rTMS. A safety harness without body weight support will be provided. 80% of participant's over ground maximum walking speed will be halved and used for warm-up. After warming up, walking speed will be increased by 0.2 km/h every 5 minutes. Progression will be given if patients could tolerate the belt speed with appropriate step length and walk with good stability for 5 minutes. Participants will maintain the maximum speed achieved for the rest of the session or adjusted as needed. Positive verbal feedback will be given to encourage large strides and upright posture during training. The participants will be instructed to walk on treadmill without holding onto the handrails if possible. Participants will perform warm up and cool down exercise to minimize training related-injury.</description>

        <title>Gradient of the Recruitment Curve ( Also Known as Stimulus-response Curve)</title>
        <description>TMS stimuli will be applied at 10% steps between 100% to 160% RMT. 10 stimuli will be delivered at each intensity. Peak to peak amplitude of 10 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) at each stimulus intensity will be averaged offline.The cut-off intensity is set at 75% of maximum stimulator output due to discomfort perceived by majority of the participants. MEPs will be normalised with the maximal muscle action potential (MMax), which is determined by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the fibular nerve. A scatter graph will be generated with the average amplitude of MEPs as a function of stimulation intensity. The linear trend will be added to generate the linear recruitment curve slope.</description>

        <title>Short-interval-intracortical Inhibition</title>
        <description>Short-interval-intracortical inhibition (SICI) is another measure of cortical inhibition. In a paired- pulse TMS paradigm, a test pulse will be adjusted to produce MEP of at least 0.5 millivolts which will be delivered preceded by a brief conditioned pulse set at a lower intensity of 80% RMT with inter-stimulus interval of 2 milliseconds. Two stimulators connected via a Bistim module ( Magstim Co.,Whitland, UK) will be used in this test. Ten conditioned MEPs and unconditioned MEPs will be obtained in a random order and were averaged for each condition. SICI is expressed as percentage of unconditioned test MEP amplitude.</description>
