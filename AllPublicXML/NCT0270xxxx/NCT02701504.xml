    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a prevalent disorder in patients with coronary artery disease. Previous
      studies suggested sleep apnea was associated with coronary plaque burden and future adverse
      cardiovascular events after percutaneous coronary intervention. In the SABOT study, the
      investigators used a FDA-approved portable sleep device to diagnose sleep apnea, and evaluate
      the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular outcomes after non-urgent coronary
      artery bypass surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SABOT Study is an observational study designed to study the impact of sleep apnea on
      cardiovascular outcomes after non-urgent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Patients
      between the ages of 18 and 90 who are scheduled undergo an non-urgent CABG were eligible for
      the study

      The recruited patients participants were scheduled to undergo a hospital-based overnight
      sleep study using a US Food and Drug Administration-approved portable monitoring devices: the
      Watch-PAT (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). Watch-PAT is a four-channel unattended sleep
      monitoring device that measures peripheral arterial tone (PAT), pulse oximetry, heart rate,
      and actigraphy from a built-in actigraph. Respiratory events are identified by digital
      vasoconstriction mediated by α-adrenergic receptors that are sensitive to surges in
      sympathetic activity. Respiratory events are considered to be present when one of the
      following three criteria was met: a reduction in PAT amplitude with an acceleration of the
      pulse rate or an increase in wrist activity; a reduction in PAT amplitude with ≥3%
      oxyhemoglobin desaturation; and ≥4% oxyhemoglobin desaturation only. Although manual scoring
      and editing of the Watch-PAT signals are possible, we adopted results generated by the device
      algorithm alone with no intervention by the operator. The diagnosis of sleep apnea is
      confirmed if the AHI was greater than 15 events/h.

      End Points The pre-specified primary end point is a major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular
      event (MACCE), defined as a composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, non-fatal stroke, and repeat revascularization.

      The secondary end point comprised sudden cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest,
      all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure.
