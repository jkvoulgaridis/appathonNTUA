  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, single-arm, window of opportunity pilot trial of pembrolizumab
      in patients with resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. All patients will undergo a
      pretreatment PET/CT scan for clinical staging and a VATS procedure to acquire pretreatment
      tissue.

      Three cycles of pembrolizumab will then be administered (200 mg IV every 21 days). A PET/CT
      scan will then be repeated to assess response to pembrolizumab and then surgical resection
      will be performed at least 4 weeks after the third dose of pembrolizumab. Standard adjuvant
      chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and pemetrexed for 4 cycles (every 21 days) will be
      given following surgery. After the completion of standard chemotherapy, optional adjuvant
      treatment with pembrolizumab will be given to eligible patients for 1 year post-surgery.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Is on anticoagulation that cannot be discontinued in the perioperative stage.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
