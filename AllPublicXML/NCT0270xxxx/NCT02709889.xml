    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study involving multiple specific advanced solid tumor
      types, consisting of a dose escalation Part A followed by an expansion Part B. Cancer
      subtypes will be studied in separate disease-specific cohorts in both Parts. Eight separate
      cohorts will enroll malignant melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), glioblastoma, large
      cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), high-grade
      gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), other NEC, and solid tumors
      other than the above.

             Investigator.

          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1

          -  DLL3-expressing malignancy based on central immunohistochemical (IHC) testing of
             representative baseline tumor tissue (archived tissue or on-study biopsy). Positive is
             defined as staining in ≥ 1% of tumor cells.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

             completion of definitive treatment and within 2 weeks prior to first dose of Study
             Drug, off or on a stable dose of corticosteroids. Definitive treatment may include
             surgical resection, whole brain irradiation, and/or stereotactic radiation therapy.
             (Applicable to tumor types of non-CNS primary origin only)

          -  Adequate hematologic and organ function as confirmed by laboratory values

          -  Last dose of any prior therapy administered by the following time intervals before the

             greater than 1 year or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant medical condition, including any suggested by screening laboratory
             findings that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, may place the subject at

             study drug.

          -  Recent or ongoing serious infection, including:

               1. Any active grade 3 or higher (per NCI CTCAE version 4.03) viral, bacterial, or

                  antimicrobial prophylaxis is permitted.

               2. Known seropositivity for or active infection by human immunodeficiency virus
                  (HIV).

                  or C (by polymerase chain reaction) infection or on hepatitis-related antiviral
                  therapy within 6 months of first dose of study drug.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Systemic therapy with corticosteroids at &gt;20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent within 1
             week prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  History of another invasive malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 3
             years. Exceptions to the 3year limit include non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively
             treated localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, and cervical cancer in
             situ on biopsy or squamous intraepithelial lesion on PAP smear.

          -  Prior exposure to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)-based drug, prior participation in a
             rovalpituzumab tesirine clinical trial, or known hypersensitivity to rovalpituzumab
             tesirine or excipient contained in the drug formulation, unless undergoing retreatment
             with rovalpituzumab tesirine in the context of this protocol
