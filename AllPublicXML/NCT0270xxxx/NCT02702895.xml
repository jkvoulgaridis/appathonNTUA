      MTN-032 is an exploratory sub-study of the ASPIRE and HOPE trials that will utilize
      qualitative In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) and Focus-Group Discussions (FGDs) to explore
      socio-contextual and trial specific issues which affected participants' adherence to the
      dapivirine vaginal ring (VR), as well as male partner attitudes towards and experiences with
      the dapivirine VR and their perspective of their female partner's attitudes and experiences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MTN-032 trial is a two-phase exploratory sub-study of the ASPIRE and HOPE trials. A total
      of 187 former ASPIRE participants aged 19-48 years were enrolled in Phase 1 of this study. Up
      to 156 HOPE participants and up to 120 male partners of HOPE participants will be selected
      for participation in Phase 2 of this study. There were approximately 4-6 months allotted for
      recruitment and follow-up at each site for Phase 1, and 9-12 months allotted for recruitment
      and follow-up at each site for Phase 2..

      MTN-032, an observational study, using interviews and focus group discussions, is primarily
      designed to identify factors that may have affected participant adherence to study product in
      ASPIRE and HOPE, including male partner attitudes. MTN-032 will also elicit perceptions about
      various participant engagement and adherence promotion interventions implemented in ASPIRE
      and may also explore the potential use of incentives to promote adherence to VR use.

      MTN-032 will use study product adherence results from ASPIRE and HOPE, qualitative in-depth
      interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) to explore study product adherence
      behaviors and strategies used to overcome adherence challenges. An in-depth understanding of
      the various socio-behavioral factors that contribute to product use adherence may assist in
      the interpretation of past and ongoing study results and inform implementation of future
      studies.

        A sample of 187 former ASPIRE participants was selected to take part in Phase 1 of the
        study. A sample of up to 156 HOPE participants will be selected for participation in Phase
        2. In addition, a sample of up to 120 male partners of HOPE participants who provided
        consent to have their male partners contacted will be selected for participation in Phase
        2. Participants will all be adult women and their adult male partners from seven sites in
        three African countries: South Africa, Uganda and Malawi. It is anticipated that
        participants and their male partners will be representative of the overall ASPIRE and HOPE
        trials by enrolling participants from each of the participating ASPIRE and HOPE countries.
