  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, widely inclusive, largely virtual, single-center, open-label pilot trial
      utilizing a historical control group. Participants will receive a Lunasin regimen and will be
      asked to register for an account of PatientsLikeMe website, where after the initial in-clinic
      visit, they will be asked to enter specific data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that a supplement regimen containing Lunasin (referred to as the
      Lunasin regimen) can decrease the rate of ALSFRS-S progression by 50% relative to matched
      historic controls.

      ALS is a devastating motor neuron disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness,
      disability and premature death. In spite of a large number of attempted ALS trials, there are
      no significant disease-modifying therapies for this condition.

      It was recently reported that a patient with a validated diagnosis of ALS, had experienced
      dramatic objective improvement in speech, swallowing and limb strength while taking a
      supplement regimen containing Lunasin. Several other patients with ALS have also reported
      improvement on this Lunasin regiment, though records were not obtainable to validate these.

      The Lunasin regimen will consist of:

        -  LunaRich X Capsules

        -  Reliv NOW - a mixture of 'vitamins, minerals and super-powered antioxidants'

        -  Pro-Vantage - a mixture of 'soy protein, medium chain triglycerides, creatine, CoQ10 and
           supercharged amino acids'

      Dosages will be titrated up to target over the first 6 days. The subject will take the
      highest tolerated dosing for the remainder of the 12-month study.

      There are 3 in-clinic visits which occur at screening/baseline, Month 1 and Month 12. For
      Months 2-11, participants will make &quot;virtual visits&quot; by measuring their own ALSFRS-R score
      and weight and will record it in the PatientsLikeMe website. They will also self-report any
      perceived efficacy, compliance, adverse events and changes in concomitant medications.

    <measure>Change in Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/baseline - 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (five minute) ordinal rating scale used to determine patient's assessment of their capability and independence in 13 functional activities. All 13 activities are relevant in ALS. Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability, with a total score of 52 points. Reported is the rate of change in total points per month.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in H3 Histone Acetylation</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/baseline, Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants, ALS controls (not on Lunasin) and healthy controls (not on Lunasin) had blood drawn at baseline and 1 month time points. Histones were extracted from blood cells. Western blots were used to look at specific histone acetylation patterns that Lunasin had reportedly altered in cell cultures (H3K9K14ac2 and H4K5K8K12K16). Integrated density values for AcH3 protein bands were normalized for total H3. Percent H3 values for the 1 month time point were normalized to that of the baseline visit. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA.</description>

    <measure>Percent Agreement Between the Weights Obtained by Patients and Study Coordinator</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>To confirm that participants can accurately measure their own weight, even as they become more disabled by ALS, the investigators will compare the participant-generated weight with the weight obtained by the study coordinator at the Month 1 and Month 12 visits. A simple description of the accuracy (percent agreement between the weights) will be used.</description>

    <description>To confirm that participants can accurately measure their own ALS Functional Rating Scale (Revised, ALSFRS-R), the investigators will compare the ALSFRS-R obtained by the coordinator with that obtained by the participants themselves at the Month 1 Visit. Correlational analysis between these 2 scores will be performed with Spearman's rho.</description>

        <description>ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (five minute) ordinal rating scale used to determine patient's assessment of their capability and independence in 13 functional activities. All 13 activities are relevant in ALS. Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability, with a total score of 52 points. Reported is the rate of change in total points per month.</description>

It will be suggested that patients open the LunaRich X capsules and mix the contents of these as well as the other 2 ingredients in water to make a shake. If patients do not tolerate advancing to the next dosage, they will be asked to drop back to the highest dosage they could tolerate.

        <description>Participants, ALS controls (not on Lunasin) and healthy controls (not on Lunasin) had blood drawn at baseline and 1 month time points. Histones were extracted from blood cells. Western blots were used to look at specific histone acetylation patterns that Lunasin had reportedly altered in cell cultures (H3K9K14ac2 and H4K5K8K12K16). Integrated density values for AcH3 protein bands were normalized for total H3. Percent H3 values for the 1 month time point were normalized to that of the baseline visit. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA.</description>

Reliv NOW – a mixture of ‘vitamins, minerals and super-powered antioxidants’ (3 scoops per day)
Pro-Vantage – a mixture of ‘soy protein, medium chain triglycerides, creatine, CoQ10 and supercharged amino acids’ (2 scoops per day)
It will be suggested that patients open the LunaRich X capsules and mix the contents of these as well as the other 2 ingredients in water to make a shake. If patients do not tolerate advancing to the next dosage, they will be asked to drop back to the highest dosage they could tolerate.
