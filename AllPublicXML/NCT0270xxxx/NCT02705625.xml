    <measure>Normalised Western Ontario &amp; McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Visit 2 (Baseline) to Visit 8 (Week 26) in normalised WOMAC pain score. The WOMAC responses are scored using an 11-point NRS where 0=none and 10=extreme. There are 5 questions in the WOMAC pain scale which is summed up for the total WOMAC score, leading to a range of 0 to 50. The total WOMAC pain score has been standardised to a scale with a range from 0 to 100 (where 100 is extreme pain):
- Normalised WOMAC pain score = Total WOMAC pain score multiplicated with 2.</description>

    <description>Change from Visit 2 (Baseline) to Visit 8 (Week 26) in normalised WOMAC difficulty score. The WOMAC responses are scored using an 11-point NRS where 0=none and 10=extreme. There are 17 questions in the WOMAC difficulty scale which is summed up for the total WOMAC difficulty score, leading to a range of 0 to 170. The total WOMAC difficulty score has been standardised to a scale with a range from 0 to 100 (where 100 is extreme pain):
- Normalised WOMAC difficulty score = Total WOMAC difficulty score divided with 1.7</description>

There are 2 questions in the WOMAC stiffness scale which is summed up for the total WOMAC stiffness score, leading to a range of 0 to 20. The total WOMAC stiffness score has been standardised to a scale with a range from 0 to 100 (where 100 is extreme pain):
- Normalised WOMAC stiffness score = Total WOMAC stiffness score multiplicated with 5</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current average knee pain, defined as pain in either knee, within 1 week before visit
             1, for which the patient gives a severity score of â‰¥4, &lt;10 on a 0-10 NRS (Numeric
             Rating Scale).

          -  Inclusive of 40-80 years old.

          -  Diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any inflammatory arthritis

          -  Any generalized pain condition that may interfere with the evaluation of the target
             knee pain (e.g., fibromyalgia) as judged by the investigator.

          -  Any clinically severe or significant uncontrolled concurrent illness, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would impair ability to give informed consent or take
             part in or complete this clinical study.

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational product,
             closely related compounds, or any of the stated ingredients.

          <title>Creatinine Corrected Urine C-terminal Telopeptide of Collagen Type II (CTX-II) at Week 26</title>
          <description>Change from Visit 2 (baseline) to Visit 8 (week 26) in creatinine corrected urine CTX-II, a biomarker for cartilage degradation.</description>
          <population>As there were discontinuations in the study, not all patients in the mITT population had an assessment at week 26. In addition, there was two missing samples for urine CTX-II. The analysis population is therefore smaller than in the Participant Flow.</population>
