    <measure>MMSE Total Score: Change From Baseline to Week 8 and Week 24 (Full Analysis Set)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, weeks 8 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of rivastigmine patch with 1-step titration on cognitive function measured as change from baseline to week 24 in the total score of MMSE in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients who failed to benefit from other cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs)
The MMSE is a screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement from baseline.

    <measure>MMSE Total Score: Change From Baseline to Week 8 and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, weeks 8 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the safety, tolerability of rivastigmine patch with 1-step titration for up to 24 weeks.
Per Protocol, The MMSE is a brief, practical screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The MMSE consists of 2 parts: language (time orientation, registration and attention) and performance (recall, response to written/verbal commands, writing ability and reproduction of complex polygons), and the total possible score is 30. Lower score indicates more severe impairment. It is the most common and simple cognitive scale for Alzheimer's disease.

Minimum values - 0 Maximum value - 30 Higher Value means a better outcome
Positive change score from baseline indicates improvement in cognitive function</description>

    <measure>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory - 10 Item (NPI-10) Score From Baseline to Week 8 and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 8, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of rivastigmine patch with 1-step titration measured as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - 10 Item (NPI-10) score at week 8 and week 24.
Per protocol, Neuropsychiatric The NPI-10 total score is a sum of the 10 items, where the score for a domain is defined as the product of frequency (range: 1-4) and severity (range: 1-3). Each domain has a maximum score of 12 and all domains are equally weighted for the total score (thus the range for the total score is 0 to 120).
A higher score indicates more severe impairment.
Neuropsychiatry Inventory - 10 Minimum Score = 0 Maximum Score = 120
Higher Score indicates worse outcome</description>

    <measure>Change in QOL-AD Score From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of rivastigmine patch with 1-step titration measured as QOL-AD score at week 24.
Unabbreviated Scale Name: Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease Minimum Score = 13 Maximum Score = 52
Higher value indicates a better outcome
QOL-AD is a 13-item questionnaire to assess the quality of life of Alzheimer's patients from the perspectives of patients and their caregivers. It covers several aspects, for example, the perception of health status, mood, functional capacity, personal relationships and leisure, financial situation, and life as a whole. Each item is quantified using a Likert scale with score one classified as poor, and score four as excellent where total scores range from 13 to 52. A lower score indicates more severe impairment.</description>

    <measure>Formulation Usability Questionnaire Form Score up to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the formulation usability of rivastigmine patch for up to 24 weeks as measured by the formulation usability questionnaire answered by caregiver.
The Formulation usability preference questionnaire had been used to compare the previous oral AD drugs versus the patch The caregiver selects one of the following answers (1. Very easy to use, 2. Easy to use, 3. No change, 4. Not easy to use, 5. Not easy to use at all, 6. Unknown).
This questionnaire data is used to assess if the usability of rivastigmine patch was preferred by the majority (&gt; 50%) of AD patient caregivers or not.
Unabbreviated Questionnaire title:
Formulation Usability questionnaire Minimum Score = 1 Maximum Score = 6
A higher score indicates its not easy to use and worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of rivastigmine patch with 1-step titration on cognitive function measured as change from baseline to week 24 in the total score of MMSE in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients who failed to benefit from other cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs)
The MMSE is a screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement from baseline.

        <description>Evaluation of the safety, tolerability of rivastigmine patch with 1-step titration for up to 24 weeks.
Per Protocol, The MMSE is a brief, practical screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The MMSE consists of 2 parts: language (time orientation, registration and attention) and performance (recall, response to written/verbal commands, writing ability and reproduction of complex polygons), and the total possible score is 30. Lower score indicates more severe impairment. It is the most common and simple cognitive scale for Alzheimer's disease.
Unabbreviated Scale : MMSE - Mini Mental State Evaluation:
Minimum values - 0 Maximum value - 30 Higher Value means a better outcome
Positive change score from baseline indicates improvement in cognitive function</description>

        <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of rivastigmine patch with 1-step titration measured as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - 10 Item (NPI-10) score at week 8 and week 24.
Per protocol, Neuropsychiatric The NPI-10 total score is a sum of the 10 items, where the score for a domain is defined as the product of frequency (range: 1-4) and severity (range: 1-3). Each domain has a maximum score of 12 and all domains are equally weighted for the total score (thus the range for the total score is 0 to 120).
A higher score indicates more severe impairment.

Unabbreviated Scale Name: Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease Minimum Score = 13 Maximum Score = 52
Higher value indicates a better outcome
QOL-AD is a 13-item questionnaire to assess the quality of life of Alzheimer's patients from the perspectives of patients and their caregivers. It covers several aspects, for example, the perception of health status, mood, functional capacity, personal relationships and leisure, financial situation, and life as a whole. Each item is quantified using a Likert scale with score one classified as poor, and score four as excellent where total scores range from 13 to 52. A lower score indicates more severe impairment.</description>

        <description>Evaluation of the formulation usability of rivastigmine patch for up to 24 weeks as measured by the formulation usability questionnaire answered by caregiver.
The Formulation usability preference questionnaire had been used to compare the previous oral AD drugs versus the patch The caregiver selects one of the following answers (1. Very easy to use, 2. Easy to use, 3. No change, 4. Not easy to use, 5. Not easy to use at all, 6. Unknown).
This questionnaire data is used to assess if the usability of rivastigmine patch was preferred by the majority (&gt; 50%) of AD patient caregivers or not.

A higher score indicates its not easy to use and worse outcome.</description>
