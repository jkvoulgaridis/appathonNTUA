      The primary objective of the Corrona Psoriasis Registry is to study the comparative safety of
      approved psoriasis therapies in a North American cohort of psoriasis subjects treated by
      dermatologists. This includes assessing the incidence and nature of adverse events of special
      interest, including malignancy, in a real world population of psoriasis patients on new
      biologic therapies (e.g. secukinumab). Secondary objectives include analyzing the
      epidemiology and natural history of the disease, comorbidities, current treatment practices,
      and comparative effectiveness.

      Based on the operating procedures established by the Corrona Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
      Registry, the Psoriasis Registry will use a parallel structure based on a design and strategy
      developed by Corrona, LLC. This registry will be cooperatively managed by scientific,
      operational, and quality leaders at Corrona and medical leaders appointed by the National
      Psoriasis Foundation (NPF).

      Investigators may enroll patients who have started on or switched to a systemic agent for
      psoriasis within the previous twelve months. Currently approved subcutaneous biologics are
      indicated for adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are
      candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The currently approved intravenous biologic
      agent is indicated for adult patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates
      for systemic therapy, and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. All
      patients will receive standard of care treatments prescribed by the investigator, in
      accordance with the FDA-approved drug labeling, and all treatment decisions are the sole
      responsibility of the investigator.

      This study will be conducted at approximately 200 sites across North America. Sites are
      assessed and selected through interviews with potential investigators and a corresponding
      site feasibility survey that includes information on the investigator's qualifications,
      previous research experience, and the availability of support staff, sub-investigators, and
      patient population.

      The Corrona Psoriasis Registry is a longitudinal, observational study; therefore, the
      duration is indefinite with no pre-determined stop date. The enrollment period is estimated
      to take approximately four years, and subjects will be followed for a minimum of eight years
      beginning from the time the subject is enrolled.

      The design is a prospective, multicenter, observational registry for subjects with psoriasis.
      Longitudinal follow-up data is obtained via Corrona Questionnaires completed by both subjects
      and their treating dermatologists (also known as &quot;Providers&quot; for a Corrona registry study)
      every 6 months (+/- 30 days). The registry is designed to collect data on patient
      demographics, smoking history, disease duration, disease severity, disease activity, history
      of prior psoriasis treatment, comorbidities, hospitalizations, adverse events of special
      interest, medication use, and laboratory results.

      The registry is linked to external data sources including the Centers for Disease Control's
      National Death Index (NDI), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and other
      administrative data sources to support drug safety monitoring and other research activities.

      Any adverse events that are spontaneously volunteered by the subject or discovered as a
      result of general questioning by the investigator should be recorded on the Provider
      Follow-up Questionnaire for that visit.

        Patients are enrolled in the Psoriasis Registry during regularly-scheduled office visits.
        Selected dermatologists are invited to participate as investigators in the Registry.
        Physicians are selected carefully in an effort to ensure enrollment of subjects that
        represent a reasonable representation of a cross-section of the population throughout North
        America with Psoriasis. All potential sites are screened for clinical research experience
        and adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA∗ To be eligible for enrollment into the Corrona Psoriasis Registry, a
        patient must satisfy all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
        listed below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The patient must:

          1. Have been diagnosed with psoriasis by a dermatologist.

          2. Be at least 18 years of age or older.

          3. Be willing and able to provide written consent for participation in the registry.

          4. Be willing and able to provide Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that includes
             the following types of personal information at a minimum: 1) Full Name and 2) Date of
             Birth.

          5. Meet one of the following criteria.

        Have started on or switched to a systemic psoriasis treatment within the previous 12
        months†▲:

          1. Eligible medications± for enrollment include the FDA-approved biologic and biosimilar
             treatments for psoriasis (adalimumab (Humira), adalimumab Biosimilar, brodalumab
             (Siliq), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), etanercept Biosimilar,
             guselkumab (Tremfya), infliximab (Remicade), infliximab Biosimilar, ixekizumab
             (Taltz), risankizumab (Skyrizi), secukinumab (Cosentyx), tildrakizumab (Ilumya), and
             ustekinumab (Stelara) are allowed.

             OR

          2. Eligible medications for enrollment include apremilast, methotrexate, cyclosporine and
             acitretin. If enrolling on one of these medications the patient must also be
             biologic-naïve.

             Exclusion Criteria:

             1. Patient is participating in or planning to participate in a double-blind randomized
             of a psoriasis drug. Of note, concurrent participation in another observational
             registry or open-label Phase 3b/4 trial is not excluded.

             EARLY Follow-Up Visit Criteria:

             A registry Follow-Up Visit should be conducted whenever a patient is prescribed or
             starts a new eligible medication (FDA-approved biologic and biosimilar treatments for
             psoriasis) that has not been used in the previous 12 months, regardless of when the
             last registry visit submission was made.Ω

               -  Past use of an Eligible Medication does not exclude a patient from an Early
                  Follow-Up Visit.

               -  The next anticipated visit that registry CRFs should be completed is then
                  calculated from the Early Follow-Up Visit date (≥ 150 days).

             Follow-Up Visit Criteria:

             Registry Follow-Up data collection should be done at the time of routine clinical
             encounters approximately every 6 months. Routine or standard of care clinical
             encounters may occur between two Corrona visits, but the data collected in the
             Follow-Up CRFs should cover the time period since the last Corrona visit. For planning
             purposes, each subsequent Follow-Up Visit is anchored to the date of the last eligible
             Corrona visit.

             A Follow-Up Visit is eligible for payment as long as 150 days have passed since the
             last visit submission. A Follow-Up Visit is not eligible for payment if conducted less
             than 150 days since the last registry visits except when the &quot;Early&quot; Follow-Up Visit
             criteria is satisfied.

             † If a potential subject is being prescribed an eligible systemic psoriasis treatment
             on the day of the Enrollment Visit, the subject is eligible for enrollment into the
             registry the same day. If a subject is prescribed an eligible medication at the
             enrollment visit, in order for the subject to remain in the registry, one of the
             following conditions must be met at the time of the first registry follow-up visit or
             within 6 months (180 days) of the enrollment visit, or which occurs first:

             1) The eligible medication was started; OR 2) Another eligible medication was started
             that has not been used in the previous 12 months.

               -  If a patient has experienced an interruption in treatment of an eligible
                  medication in the 12 months after initiation, in order for the patient to be
                  eligible for enrollment the following two conditions must be met:

                    1. The interruption in treatment lasted &lt;180 days; AND

                    2. No other systemic psoriasis medications were initiated during the time
                       period when the eligible medication was not in use.

                       If both conditions are not met, the patient is ineligible for enrollment
                       based on the interrupted eligible medication. In order for the patient to be
                       eligible for enrollment by this medication, they would need to be off the
                       drug for at least 12 months prior to restarting therapy and enrolled within
                       12 months from the time they restart the drug.

                         -  An enrollment cap is placed on each TNF-inhibitor (Humira, Enbrel,
                            Remicade, Cimzia) and Stelara at 150 patients per year.

                       NOTE: Corrona will monitor annual enrollment for each TNF-inhibitor and
                       Stelara and provide updates as needed. The cap is for the overall registry.
                       Biosimilars will not count toward the originator biologic

                         -  Once clinical trial participation has ended, a patient is permitted to
                            enroll in the registry if they satisfy the eligibility requirements. If
                            exited from the registry for the exclusion, the patient is not
                            permitted to re-enroll once their clinical trial participation ends. Ω
                            Only one (1) early Follow-Up Visit is allowed for each new eligible
                            medication initiated during long-term follow-up. This means that the
                            early registry visit can either be conducted on the day the patient is
                            prescribed the new medication or on the day the drug is started (i.e.
                            when the first does is received).

                              -  These criteria are subject to change with the needs of the
                                 registry at the sole discretion of the Sponsor (Corrona).
