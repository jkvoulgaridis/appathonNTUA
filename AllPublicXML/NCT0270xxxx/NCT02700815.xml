  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised, controlled multi-centre parallel group trial will assess the efficacy and
      tolerability of a topical formulation gel of the combination of diclofenac and capsaicin in
      comparison to gels with diclofenac alone, capsaicin alone, and placebo for the treatment of
      acute back pain or neck pain

    <measure>Change in POM Between Baseline and Day 2 Evening, 1 Hour After Drug Application</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Pain on movement (POM) was used to assess pain measurement for back and neck pain. The standardized movements have been established for which the measurement was taken. POMwp was the POM measure that gave the highest score at baseline; i.e. POM of worst procedure. Pain intensity was assessed at rest after standing in an upright position relatively motionless for 1 minute. The pain was evaluated by asking patient 'How would you rate your pain right now?' and by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0-10 centimeters (cm) wherein 0 cm = no pain to 10 cm = worst pain possible. The results presented here are adjusted mean change from baseline and standard error for POMwp in cm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>POMwp Area Under the Curve (AUC) Calculated From 0 to 72 Hours (h) (POMwp AUC(0-72 h))</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 72 hours after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a key secondary endpoint. AUC for POMwp calculated from 0 to 72 h that is for first three treatment days using the trapezoidal rule divided by the observation time. The results presented here are adjusted mean and standard error for POMwp AUC (0-72 h) in centimeters (cm). The AUC represents POMwp as an average over the first 3 treatment days (Day 1 until Day 4 morning) - it is not meant here as a pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter (concentration over time).</description>

    <measure>POMwp Area Under the Curve (AUC) Calculated From 0 to 120 Hours (h) (POMwp AUC(0-120 h))</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 hours after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a key secondary endpoint. AUC for POMwp calculated from 0 to 120 h that is for first five treatment days using the trapezoidal rule divided by the observation time. The results presented here are adjusted mean and standard error for POMwp AUC (0-120 h) in centimeters (cm). The AUC represents POMwp as an average over the first 5 treatment days (Day 1 until Day 6 morning) - it is not meant here as a PK parameter (concentration over time).</description>

Out of 757 enrolled patients with acute back or neck pain, 746 were randomised and treated with 4 topical treatments administered twice daily for 4 to 7 days.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Subjects attended specialist sites which would then ensure that all subjects met all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

          <title>Pain on movement of worst procedure (POMwp)</title>
          <description>Pain on movement (POM) was used to assess pain measurement for back and neck pain. The standardized movements have been established for which the measurement was taken. POMwp was the POM measure that gave the highest score at baseline; i.e. POM of worst procedure. Pain intensity was assessed at rest after standing in an upright position relatively motionless for 1 minute. The pain was evaluated by asking patient 'How would you rate your pain right now?' and by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0-10 cm wherein 0 cm = no pain to 10 cm = worst pain possible.</description>

        <title>Change in POM Between Baseline and Day 2 Evening, 1 Hour After Drug Application</title>
        <description>Pain on movement (POM) was used to assess pain measurement for back and neck pain. The standardized movements have been established for which the measurement was taken. POMwp was the POM measure that gave the highest score at baseline; i.e. POM of worst procedure. Pain intensity was assessed at rest after standing in an upright position relatively motionless for 1 minute. The pain was evaluated by asking patient 'How would you rate your pain right now?' and by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0-10 centimeters (cm) wherein 0 cm = no pain to 10 cm = worst pain possible. The results presented here are adjusted mean change from baseline and standard error for POMwp in cm.</description>

        <title>POMwp Area Under the Curve (AUC) Calculated From 0 to 120 Hours (h) (POMwp AUC(0-120 h))</title>
        <description>This is a key secondary endpoint. AUC for POMwp calculated from 0 to 120 h that is for first five treatment days using the trapezoidal rule divided by the observation time. The results presented here are adjusted mean and standard error for POMwp AUC (0-120 h) in centimeters (cm). The AUC represents POMwp as an average over the first 5 treatment days (Day 1 until Day 6 morning) - it is not meant here as a PK parameter (concentration over time).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in POMwp (cm) at Day 6 Morning</title>
        <description>Pain on movement (POM) was used to assess pain measurement for back and neck pain. The standardized movements have been established for which the measurement was taken. POMwp was the POM measure that gave the highest score at baseline; i.e. POM of worst procedure. Pain intensity was assessed at rest after standing in an upright position relatively motionless for 1 minute. The pain was evaluated by asking patient 'How would you rate your pain right now?' and by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0-10 cm wherein 0 cm = no pain to 10 cm = worst pain possible. The results presented here are adjusted mean change from baseline and standard error for POMwp in centimeters (cm).</description>
