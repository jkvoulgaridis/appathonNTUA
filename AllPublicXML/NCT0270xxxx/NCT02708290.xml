  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual puzzles have been used for centuries to facilitate early development in kids. Mental
      Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children
      with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The app includes bright, interactive puzzles designed to
      help children learn how to mentally integrate multiple features of an object, an ability that
      has proven to lead to vast improvements in general learning. Success with MITA puzzles could
      overtime result in significant improvements in a child's overall development, specifically in
      the realms of language, attention and visual skills.

      SCIENCE BEHIND THE PROJECT:

      MITA verbal activities start with simple vocabulary-building exercises and progress towards
      exercises aimed at higher forms of language, such as noun-adjective combinations, spatial
      prepositions, recursion, and syntax. For example, a child can be instructed to select the
      {small/large} {red/ blue/green/orange} ball or to put the cup {on/under/behind/in front of}
      the table. All exercises are deliberately limited to as few nouns as possible since the aim
      is not to expand a child's one-word vocabulary, but rather to teach him/her to integrate
      mental objects in novel ways using active imagination.

      MITA nonverbal activities aim to provide the same active imagination training visually
      through implicit instructions. E.g., a child can be presented with two separate images of a
      train and a window pattern, and a choice of complete trains. The task is to find the correct
      complete train and place it into the empty square. This exercise requires not only attending
      to a variety of different features in both the train and its windows, but also combining two
      separate pieces into a single image (in other words, mentally integrating separate train
      parts into a single unified gestalt). As levels progress, the exercises increase in
      difficulty, requiring attention to more and more features and details. Upon attaining the
      most difficult levels, the child must attend to as many as eight features simultaneously.
      Previous results from our studies have demonstrated that children who cannot follow the
      explicit verbal instruction can often follow an equivalent command implicit in the visual
      set-up of the puzzle.

      As a child progresses through MITA's systematic exercises, he or she is developing the
      ability to simultaneously attend to a greater number of features, reducing the propensity
      towards tunnel vision, and thus developing an essential component of language. The ability to
      mentally build an image based on a combination of multiple features is absolutely necessary
      for understanding syntax, spatial prepositions and verb tenses.

      MITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is designed to
      be engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities
      of each child.

    <measure>Reduction of Autism Severity as Measured by Autism Therapy Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). Reference: Rimland, B. &amp; Edelson, S. Autism Research Institute. Autism Treat. Eval. Checkl. ATEC (1999)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to three years, assessed at 3 months intervals</time_frame>
    <description>Autism Therapy Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) is completed by parents every three months. ATEC is comprised of four subscales: 1) Speech/Language/Communication, 2) Sociability, 3) Sensory/Cognitive Awareness, and 4) Physical/Health/Behavior. The first subscale, Speech/Language/Communication, contains 14 items and its score ranges from 0 to 28 points. The Sociability subscale contains 20 items within a score range from 0 to 40 points. The third subscale, Sensory/Cognitive awareness, has 18 items and scores range from 0 to 36 points. Finally, the Health/Physical/Behavior subscale contains 25 items and scores range from 0 to 75 points. The scores from each subscale are combined in order to calculate a Total Score, which ranges from 0 to 179 points. A lower score indicates lower severity of ASD symptoms and a higher score correlates with more severe symptoms of ASD.</description>

        <title>Reduction of Autism Severity as Measured by Autism Therapy Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). Reference: Rimland, B. &amp; Edelson, S. Autism Research Institute. Autism Treat. Eval. Checkl. ATEC (1999)</title>
        <description>Autism Therapy Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) is completed by parents every three months. ATEC is comprised of four subscales: 1) Speech/Language/Communication, 2) Sociability, 3) Sensory/Cognitive Awareness, and 4) Physical/Health/Behavior. The first subscale, Speech/Language/Communication, contains 14 items and its score ranges from 0 to 28 points. The Sociability subscale contains 20 items within a score range from 0 to 40 points. The third subscale, Sensory/Cognitive awareness, has 18 items and scores range from 0 to 36 points. Finally, the Health/Physical/Behavior subscale contains 25 items and scores range from 0 to 75 points. The scores from each subscale are combined in order to calculate a Total Score, which ranges from 0 to 179 points. A lower score indicates lower severity of ASD symptoms and a higher score correlates with more severe symptoms of ASD.</description>
        <time_frame>up to three years, assessed at 3 months intervals</time_frame>
        <population>The framework for evaluation of ATEC score changes over time was explained in Mahapatra et al. Autism Dev Disord, 2018. In short, changes in the score were modeled by applying the Linear Model with repeated measures. Least squares means differences generated by the model are reported below. Participants were matched using propensity score analysis.</population>

            <groups_desc>The concept of a “Visit” was developed by dividing the three-year-long observation interval into 3-month periods. All evaluations were mapped into 3-month-long bins (Reference: Mahapatra, S. et al. Autism Dev. Disord. 2018, 1). It was then hypothesized that there was a three-way interaction between an age group, Visit, and treatment. This hypothesis was modeled by applying the Linear Model with repeated measures, where a three-way interaction term was introduced to test the hypothesis.</groups_desc>
