  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether the probiotic Visbiome Extra Strength
      reduces inflammation in HIV-infected men and women when compared to a placebo (inactive
      medication like a dummy pill). The study evaluated whether taking Visbiome Extra Strength by
      mouth for 24 weeks was safe and well-tolerated for HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral
      therapy (ART). Probiotics are germs such as yeast or bacteria that are found in food and
      supplements that are used to improve the health of the digestive system. Many people refer to
      probiotics as &quot;helpful bacteria.&quot; These bacteria live in the body and help the body work
      normally. In some medical conditions, including HIV infection, helpful bacteria are replaced
      with bacteria that can change the normal intestinal function and increase inflammation. The
      investigators tested whether giving a probiotic restored normal intestinal function and
      decreased inflammation.

      This was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, two-arm study to evaluate whether there is a
      significant change in sCD14 after 24 weeks of probiotic Visbiome Extra Strength (ES) therapy,
      and to determine the safety and tolerability of this agent in HIV-infected participants on
      stable antiretroviral therapy (ART). Participants were randomized 1:1 to Visbiome ES and
      placebo arms. Both arms initiated study treatment at Week 2 and took 1 sachet per day for the
      first 2 weeks and then 1 sachet twice daily for the next 22 weeks. All participants were
      followed for an additional 12 weeks off study product.

      The study clinic visits included Entry (Week 0), and Weeks 2, 6, 14, 25, 26, and 38. Plasma
      for the primary outcome was collected at Weeks 0, 2, 25, and 26. The evaluations of safety
      (clinical assessment for signs and symptoms, diagnoses, and laboratory tests) were done at
      Weeks 2, 6, 14, 26, and 38.

      Currently, the results are entered for the primary outcome measure and select secondary
      outcomes only. The results on the remaining secondary outcomes will be posted when they
      become available.

Chao1 is a diversity index that reflects how many different quantifiable types (species, individuals, items, etc…) there are in a dataset (see Chao reference). Chao1 diversity is a richness measure which quantifies how many different types there are in a given dataset. The Chao 1 index can range from 1 to infinity as it is constrained only by the number of types defined as measurable. The greater a value is, the more diverse it is but only in direct comparison to groups considering the same parameters. That is, diversity indices are relative to the community (cohort or ecosystem) studied in part due to the definition of the &quot;types&quot; that are considered.</description>

Shannon is a diversity index that reflects how many different quantifiable types (species, individuals, items, etc…) there are in a dataset (see Lemos and Magurran references). The Shannon index is an estimator of richness and evenness. It quantifies uncertainty (entropy) within a dataset. The Shannon Index ranges from 0-5. The greater a value is, the more diverse it is but only in direct comparison to groups considering the same parameters.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
        chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
        confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the
        initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit.

        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg, indirect versus
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

        - Currently on continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥48 weeks prior to study entry
        with no change in the ART regimen within the 24 weeks prior to study entry except as noted
        below.

        NOTE A: Continuous ART is defined as continuous ART for the 48-week period prior to study
        entry with no ART interruption longer than 7 consecutive days.

        NOTE B: Modifications of ART during the 24 weeks prior to study entry are permitted in
        certain circumstances. For example, the change in formulation (eg, from standard
        formulation to fixed-dose combination including ART modifications switching from ritonavir-
        to cobicistat-boosted protease inhibitors or from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to
        tenofovir alafenamide) is allowed within 24 weeks prior to study entry. A within-class,
        single-drug substitution (eg, switch from nevirapine to efavirenz or from atazanavir to
        darunavir) is allowed within 24 weeks prior to study entry, with the exception of a switch
        between any other NRTI to/from abacavir. No other changes in ART within the 24 weeks prior
        to study entry are permitted.

          -  No plan to change ART regimen for the study duration.

          -  Screening CD4+ cell count &gt;200 cells/mm3 obtained within 45 days prior to study entry
             by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

          -  Screening HIV-1 RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL using a FDA-approved assay performed by any
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent within 45 days prior to
             study entry.

          -  HIV-1 RNA levels below the limit of quantification using a FDA-approved assay with a
             quantification limit of 50 copies/mL or lower for at least 48 weeks prior to study
             entry performed by any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

        NOTE: Single determinations that are between the assay quantification limit and 500
        copies/mL (ie, &quot;blips&quot;) are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent determinations
        are below the level of quantification. The screening value may serve as the subsequent
        undetectable value following a blip.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to entry by any US
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dL for men and 9.0 g/dL for women

               -  Platelet count ≥50,000/mm3

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) ≤5 x upper limit normal (ULN)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) ≤5 x ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤5 x upper limit normal ULN

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2.5 x ULN (if on atazanavir ≤5 x ULN)

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;60 mL/min, as estimated by the
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation.

        <description>IL-6 data are not available as of June, 2018. These data are based on assays which are to be tested in batch to minimize variability. Due to batch testing, shipment of samples for testing could not begin until after the study follow-up completion, which was 3 months after the primary completion date. Please note that these secondary outcomes were not included in the primary analysis report. There are many outcomes in this study and the labs had to give priority to the assays planned to be included in the primary manuscript.</description>

Absolute change was calculated as the value at Week 26 minus the value at Week 2. Mean changes were exponentiated to be back on the untransformed scale and corresponds to a mean fold change.</description>
          <population>Analysis used the per-protocol population. Participants 1) without Baseline AND Week 25/26 sCD14 values, or 2) with premature discontinuation of study treatment, or 3) or with HIV-1 virologic failure were excluded.

        <description>LBP data are not available as of June, 2018. These data are based on assays which are to be tested in batch to minimize variability. Due to batch testing, shipment of samples for testing could not begin until after the study follow-up completion, which was 3 months after the primary completion date. Please note that these secondary outcomes were not included in the primary analysis report.

        <title>Change in Chao1 Richness Index From Week 2 to Week 26.</title>
        <description>Absolute change was calculated as the value at Week 26 minus the value at Week 2.
Chao1 is a diversity index that reflects how many different quantifiable types (species, individuals, items, etc…) there are in a dataset (see Chao reference). Chao1 diversity is a richness measure which quantifies how many different types there are in a given dataset. The Chao 1 index can range from 1 to infinity as it is constrained only by the number of types defined as measurable. The greater a value is, the more diverse it is but only in direct comparison to groups considering the same parameters. That is, diversity indices are relative to the community (cohort or ecosystem) studied in part due to the definition of the &quot;types&quot; that are considered.</description>

Shannon is a diversity index that reflects how many different quantifiable types (species, individuals, items, etc…) there are in a dataset (see Lemos and Magurran references). The Shannon index is an estimator of richness and evenness. It quantifies uncertainty (entropy) within a dataset. The Shannon Index ranges from 0-5. The greater a value is, the more diverse it is but only in direct comparison to groups considering the same parameters. That is, diversity indices are relative to the community (cohort or ecosystem) studied in part due to the definition of the &quot;types&quot; that are considered.</description>
