  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators group has piloted a 6-week psycho-educational program, Growing Resiliency
      And CouragE with Cancer™ (GRACE), that bring together a variety of strategies and experiences
      from an inter-professional perspective to mitigate distress among patients with an advanced
      cancer diagnosis. GRACE is a six-session, empirically anchored intervention emphasizing a
      Logotherapy (Existential Therapy) and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy approach involving
      psycho-education and process-oriented experiences. The curriculum includes themes illustrated
      via PowerPoint slides with semi-structured delivery, video presentations, a variety of
      mindfulness meditation practices, and selected readings that serve to reflect and capture the
      theme for the week of the curriculum.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will be provided with all programmatic materials (including copies of power point presentations, copies of reading texts, and audio CDs) and classes will be held in group format, with a maximum of 9 participants per group. Classes will meet weekly, in a group, and at a set time. All classes will be facilitated jointly by the two Co-PIs. All participants will complete surveys before class, during class, at the end of class, 1 month after the end of class, 6 months after the end of class and 1 year after the end of the class. Additionally, those randomized to the intervention group will be asked to attend a 1 time focus group 1 week after the end of the class.</description>
