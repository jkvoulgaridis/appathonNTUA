      This study is a Phase Ib/II open label, single arm, adaptive multi-centre trial of copanlisib
      in combination with trastuzumab in pretreated recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast
      cancer.

      Patients with HER2 positive, metastatic or incurable recurrent breast cancer, following
      disease progression during, or after, treatment with at least one systemic treatment regimen
      in the metastatic or recurrent setting, will be treated with copanlisib (at 30, 45 or 60 mg
      flat dosing IV weekly - depending on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in the Phase
      Ib part of the study) plus trastuzumab (4 mg/kg IV Cycle 1 Day 1 and then 2 mg/kg IV weekly
      starting from day 8).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ib One of three dose levels of copanlisib is assigned at registration according to the
      dose escalation scheme.

      Phase II The copanlisib dose for the Phase II part of the trial will be based on the MTD
      established in the Phase Ib part of the study.

      Clinical and laboratory parameters will be assessed to evaluate disease response and toxicity
      of study therapy.

      Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study.

      Efficacy assessments (radiological examination) will be performed on all patients every 8
      weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter.

      Following baseline cardiac assessment, cardiac safety monitoring will include physical exam
      (with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification for patients with diagnosed
      congestive heart failure) during each cycle, Multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or
      Echocardiogram (ECHO) and 12 lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) within 7 days of Day 1 of every
      third cycle starting at cycle 3 (Cycle 3, Cycle 6, etc.).

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Adult women ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Histologically confirmed HER2-positive breast cancer:

             Documented HER2 overexpression by local laboratory (IHC 3+ or FISH or CISH positive).

             IHC 3+ or FISH/CISH positive on diagnostic breast biopsy or surgical breast resection
             sample or metastatic disease site biopsy.

          3. Recurrent incurable or metastatic breast cancer:

             Eligible recurrent disease is recurrent disease that is considered incurable by the
             treating oncologist. Many local-only recurrences are treated with curative intent; a
             treatment plan with curative intent for a local-only recurrence would indicate that
             the patient is not eligible for this clinical trial. A local-only recurrence must be
             considered incurable by the treating oncologist for the patient to be eligible.

          4. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria (Version 1.1). Patients
             with bone only disease are not eligible.

          5. Patient has received at least one trastuzumab-based or T-DM1-based treatment regimen
             in the setting of metastatic disease or incurable locoregional recurrence. A
             trastuzumab-based or T-DM1-based treatment regimen is considered as any treatment
             regimen that includes trastuzumab or T-DM1.

             Patients must have had at least 1 line of therapy for metastatic and/or incurable
             locoregional recurrent disease to be eligible. A patient is eligible regardless of the
             period of time from adjuvant therapy so long as she has disease that is progressing
             after at least 1 line of trastuzumab-based therapy in the setting of metastatic
             disease and/or incurable locoregional recurrence.

          6. Disease progression during or following at least 1 prior trastuzumab-based or
             trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) based treatment regimen in the setting of metastatic
             disease or incurable locoregional recurrence.

          7. ECOG performance status ≤ 2.

          8. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          9. Availability of fresh tissue and/or archival tumour tissue at screening.

         10. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception when sexually active. This applies from signing of the informed consent
             form until at least 100 days after the last study drug administration. The
             investigator or a designated associate is required to advise the patient how to
             achieve an adequate birth control. Highly effective contraception is defined in the
             study as methods that achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly. Such methods include:

             i. Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
             with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal).

             ii. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
             (oral, injectable and implantable).

             iii. Intrauterine device (IUD).

             iv. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).

             v. Bilateral tubal occlusion.

             vi. Successfully vasectomised partner.

             vii. Sexual abstinence.

         11. Adequate baseline laboratory values collected no more than 14 days before starting
             study treatment:

             Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (&lt; 3 x ULN for patients with metastatic disease in the
             liver).

             Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3.0 x ULN (≤ 5 x
             ULN for patients with liver involvement from breast cancer).

             Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 according to the Modification of
             Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula. If not on target, this evaluation
             may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the MDRD abbreviated
             formula or by 24 hour sampling. If the later result is within acceptable range, it may
             be used to fulfil the inclusion criteria instead.

             International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 x
             ULN. Patients who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or
             heparin will be allowed to participate provided that no prior underlying coagulopathy
             disorder. Close monitoring of these patients (Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each
             cycle) will be performed until INR/PTT is stable based on a measurement that is pre-
             dose as defined by the local standard of care.

             Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L. For patients with breast cancer bone marrow infiltration,
             platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L.

             Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 8 g/dL.

             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x 109/L. For patients with malignant bone marrow
             infiltration, ANC count ≥ 0.75 x 109/L.

             Fasting blood glucose ≤ 6.0 mmol/L if not diabetic or ≤ 8.9 mmol/L if diabetic.

         12. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), at or above the Institutions lower limit of
             normal, as determined by ECHO or MUGA.

         13. Patients must have recovered from clinically significant side effects associated with
             prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy with the exception of fatigue or neuropathy.
