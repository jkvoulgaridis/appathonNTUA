  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the potential effects of soy isoflavone
      supplements on cognitive function for men and women with Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
      Preliminary studies evaluating the effects of soy supplements on memory in cognitively
      healthy older adults have yielded promising results that are now being evaluated in patients
      with AD. It is hypothesized that isoflavone supplements will ameliorate cognitive declines
      for older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, when compared to subjects on placebo.

        <description>List of 15 semantically unrelated words is presented verbally to the participants once, after which they are asked to free recall as many words as possible. Subsequently, this presentation‐test routine (learning trials) is repeated four more times. A total recall score is determined by adding the number of recalled items for the five learning trials. After presentation of a distractor list and a delay of approximately 20 minutes, participants are asked to freely recall items from the original word list. A delayed recall score is then derived from this test.</description>

        <description>In the logical delayed memory test, participants are read a logically organized story. Approximately 20 minutes later, the participants are asked to recall the story from memory (Delayed Recall). The version used in this study uses only one story (Story A) read once to participants at each study visit. Possible scores for delayed recall trials range from 0 to 25, with higher scores reflecting more details recalled.</description>

        <description>Selective attention was evaluated with the Stroop Color Word Interference Test. In the interference portion of this test, the subject identifies the color of ink in which words (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, or &quot;blue&quot;) are printed, requiring the subject to inhibit their natural tendency to read the word. A subject's score is the time taken to identify 50 stimulus items.
The time taken to complete the maze is inversely proportional to the cognitive function.</description>

        <title>Visual Memory : Benton Visual Retention Test: Number of Correct Figures</title>
        <description>The Benton Visual Retention Test (or simply Benton test or BVRT) is an individually administered test for people aged from 8 years to adulthood that measures visual perception and visual memory. It can also be used to help identify possible learning disabilities among other afflictions that might affect an individual's memory. The individual examined is shown 10 designs, one at a time, and asked to reproduce each one as exactly as possible on plain paper from memory. The test is untimed, and the results are professionally scored by form, shape, pattern, and arrangement on the paper.
For the 'test of number of correct figures' score is calculated based on an all-or-nothing approach; points are awarded if the reproduction of the design matches the original.</description>

          <title>Cognitive Outcomes - Visual Motor : Time to Complete Grooved Pegboard Test Using the Non-Dominant Hand</title>
          <description>The Grooved Pegboard is a dexterity test consisting of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key on one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants are instructed to place all pegs into the 25 holes, picking up one at a time, and using just one hand. They use their non-dominant hand. Time taken to finish the test inversely correlates to the cognitive ability.</description>

        <description>During the MMSE, a health professional asks a participant a series of questions designed to test memory, ability to solve simple problems and other thinking skills.
The maximum MMSE score - 30 points. Score of 20 to 24 - mild dementia, 13 to 20 - moderate dementia, and &lt;12 indicates severe dementia.
On average, the MMSE score of a person with Alzheimer's declines about 2 to 4 points each year.</description>

        <title>Geriatric Depression Scale-Subject Report</title>
        <description>Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) has been tested and used extensively with the older population to measure depression.
Subject will self-report a short form GDS consisting of 15 questions. Out of 15 items, 10 indicate the presence of depression when answered positively, while the rest (question numbers 1, 5, 7, 11, 13) indicate depression when answered negatively.
Scores of 0-4 are considered normal, depending on age, education, and complaints; Scores of 5-8 indicate mild depression; 9-11 indicate moderate depression; and Scores of 12-15 indicate severe depression.
The Short Form is more easily used by physically ill and mildly to moderately demented patients who have short attention spans and/or feel easily fatigued. It takes about 5 to 7 minutes to complete</description>

        <description>The epsilon-4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) has been consistently associated with a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as an earlier onset of AD.
Determination of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was performed on a non-fasting blood sample collected at Baseline, using standard Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing techniques in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory. DNA extracted from whole blood was amplified by PCR using specific primers for the ApoE gene and the DNA then sequenced and analyzed for genotype using the FinchTV program (Version 1.3; Geospiza, Inc.)</description>

Novasoy capsules predominantly contain purified glycoside forms of isoflavones known genistein and diadzein. The plasma level of genistein and diadzine will be measured in the participants plasma.There is large inter-individual variations in the extent of intestinal metabolism, even when the quantity of isoflavone intake is standardized. Equol is a metabolite of isoflavones. Equol has high biological efficacy. Therefore, along with genistein and diadzein, plasma levels of equol will be measured to understand the isoflavone metabolism in the participants.</description>

        <title>Plasma Concentrations of Isoflavones at Month 6</title>
        <description>Isoflavone assays will be performed on non-fasting blood samples collected at month 6.
Novasoy capsules predominantly contain purified glycoside forms of isoflavones known genistein and diadzein. The plasma level of genistein and diadzine will be measured in the participants plasma.There is large inter-individual variations in the extent of intestinal metabolism, even when the quantity of isoflavone intake is standardized. Equol is a metabolite of isoflavones. Equol has high biological efficacy. Therefore, along with genistein and diadzein, plasma levels of equol will be measured to understand the isoflavone metabolism in the participants.</description>
