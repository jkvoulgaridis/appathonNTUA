    <textblock>
      This study will use measurements of depression symptoms and brain activity to determine what
      factors may influence an individual's response to treatment for depression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are using depression symptom measurements and measurements of brain electrical activity
      (EEG) to determine what factors may influence whether a patient is likely to show a response
      to antidepressant medication, placebo, or only clinical visits (without the use of pills)
      during a treatment trial for depression.

    <measure>Response as Assessed by Participants' Change in Depression Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of treatment arms (Medication + ICI, Placebo+ICI, and ICI only). The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) used here is a 17-item scale that measures severity of depression. Items are individually scored from 0-4 or from 0-2 depending on the item, and the individual scores for each item are added to comprise one score. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depression. Possible scores on the scale range from a minimum of zero (0) to a maximum of 52.Response is defined as a 50% decrease in HAMD-17 scoring. Remission defined as a HAMD-17 score of 7 or less.</description>

    <measure>Average Change in 3 Weeks of Participant Treatment Expectations</measure>
    <time_frame>Averaged over 3 time points (Baseline, randomization, and end of lead-in)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Attitudes and Expectations Form PAEF) used for assessing expectation. The California Pharmacotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS), a measure associated with outcomes of antidepressant pharmacotherapy, was used to measure participants' perceptions of: (a) participants' commitment to treatment; (b) participants' working capacity; (c) treatment providers' understanding and involvement; and (d) goal and working strategy consensus between participant and treatment provider. This is a 24-item questionnaire with a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very much so). Scoring ranges from a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 120. The CALPAS score is determined by a combination of negative and positive items. To assure negative items are reflected, subtract each of the negative item ratings from 8; for example, a rating of 1 becomes 7 (8 minus 1). The scores are computed by summing the items and dividing the total by 6 to procure the mean rating. A higher score indicates a positive outcome.</description>

    <description>Subjects assigned to the interpersonal clinical interaction (ICI) will undergo a one-week waiting period after the initial assessment. Visits will involve a session with a research nurse that will be approximately 20 minutes in length; visits at baseline, end of lead-in, and 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks also will include a brief (5-10 minutes) meeting with a physician.</description>

    <description>Subjects assigned to the placebo (PBO) or medication (MED) condition will enter double-blind treatment with either venlafaxine XR, duloxetine, escitalopram, or placebo after lead-in. They will undergo the same schedule, structure, and intensity of visits as in the ICI condition, but also will be randomized to receive treatment with a pill. Subjects randomized to medication will be started on one tablet each morning of either venlafaxine XR 75 mg., duloxetine 30 mg., or escitalopram 10 mg. Dosages will be increased in a double-blinded manner by increasing the number of pills administered by one pill every three to five days until the final dose is achieved (225 mg., 90 mg., and 30 mg. respectively for venlafaxine XR, duloxetine, and escitalopram). In order to maintain blinding during dosage increase, the number of tablets of placebo will be increased every three to five days as well.</description>

        <title>Response as Assessed by Participants' Change in Depression Rating</title>
        <description>Comparison of treatment arms (Medication + ICI, Placebo+ICI, and ICI only). The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) used here is a 17-item scale that measures severity of depression. Items are individually scored from 0-4 or from 0-2 depending on the item, and the individual scores for each item are added to comprise one score. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depression. Possible scores on the scale range from a minimum of zero (0) to a maximum of 52.Response is defined as a 50% decrease in HAMD-17 scoring. Remission defined as a HAMD-17 score of 7 or less.</description>

        <title>Average Change in 3 Weeks of Participant Treatment Expectations</title>
        <description>Patient Attitudes and Expectations Form PAEF) used for assessing expectation. The California Pharmacotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS), a measure associated with outcomes of antidepressant pharmacotherapy, was used to measure participants' perceptions of: (a) participants' commitment to treatment; (b) participants' working capacity; (c) treatment providers' understanding and involvement; and (d) goal and working strategy consensus between participant and treatment provider. This is a 24-item questionnaire with a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very much so). Scoring ranges from a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 120. The CALPAS score is determined by a combination of negative and positive items. To assure negative items are reflected, subtract each of the negative item ratings from 8; for example, a rating of 1 becomes 7 (8 minus 1). The scores are computed by summing the items and dividing the total by 6 to procure the mean rating. A higher score indicates a positive outcome.</description>

            <description>Placebo subjects received interpersonal clinical interaction (ICI) along with placebo treatment.
Placebo: Subjects assigned to the placebo (PBO) or medication (MED) condition entered double-blind treatment with either venlafaxine XR, duloxetine, escitalopram, or placebo after lead-in. They underwent the same schedule, structure, and intensity of visits as in the ICI condition, but also were randomized to receive treatment with a pill. Subjects randomized to medication started on one tablet each morning of either venlafaxine XR 75 mg., duloxetine 30 mg., or escitalopram 10 mg. Dosages will be increased in a double-blinded manner by increasing the number of pills administered by one pill every three to five days until the final dose is achieved (225 mg., 90 mg., and 30 mg. respectively for venlafaxine XR, duloxetine, and escitalopram). In order to maintain blinding during dosage increase, the number of tablets of placebo will be increased every three to five days as well.</description>
