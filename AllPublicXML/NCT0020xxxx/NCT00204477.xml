  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soy consumption has been associated with reduced risk for developing breast cancer. Ovarian
      hormones and breast density are considered breast cancer risk markers. We propose to test the
      hypothesis that consumption of soy protein reduces ovarian steroid hormones and results in a
      corresponding reduction in breast density comparing to casein protein.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims will be tested by conducting a randomized, double-blind study, with two arms and 100
      women in each arm. Premenopausal women will be recruited and randomly allocated to take one
      of two different dietary supplements daily for 2 years. The two test diets soy protein drink
      and caseinate protein drink. Multiple blood, urine, and breast fluid samples will be obtained
      before and during the dietary intervention period and analyzed for ovarian hormones. At
      baseline and after the intervention period, breast density, and bone density will be assessed
      by radiological techniques at baseline and 1 yr and 2 yr after protein drink supplementation.
      The efficacy of the dietary intervention will be determined by comparing mean changes of
      ovarian steroids, and density of the breast and bone tissues over the 2 year dietary
      intervention period in the two diet groups with adjustment for baseline values and individual
      patient characteristics of interest. We predict that 2 years of soya dietary supplements will
      reduce breast density, which will be explained by individual hormonal changes.
