    <measure>Percentage of Responders Before or at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 0 to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint assessed the percentage of responding subjects before or at Day 7. A responder was defined as a subject experiencing ≤2 vomiting episodes/day during at least 3 consecutive days at any timepoint between Day 0 and Day 7 (for subjects without NGT at baseline), or as a subject in whom the NGT had been removed during at least 3 consecutive days at any timepoint between Day 0 and Day 7 without vomiting recurrence (for subjects with NGT at baseline), as recorded on diary cards which were completed every day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Responders in Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint assessed the overall percentage of responding subjects at the Phase 1 timepoints of Days 14 and 28. A responder was defined as a subject experiencing ≤ 2 vomiting episodes/day during at least 3 consecutive days at any timepoint between Day 0 and Days 14 or 28 (for subjects without NGT at baseline) or as a subject in whom the NGT has been removed, during at least 3 consecutive days without vomiting recurrence, at any timepoint between Day 0 and Days 14 and 28 (for subjects with NGT at baseline), as recorded on diary cards which were completed every day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time Between First Lanreotide Autogel® Injection and Clinical Response in Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The time for clinical response in Phase 1 (up to Day 28) was defined as the time from inclusion (Day 0) to the date of clinical response. A response was defined as occurrence of ≤ 2 vomiting episodes/day for at least 3 consecutive days at any timepoint between Day 0 and Day 28 (for patients without NGT use at baseline) or the removal of NGT for at least 3 consecutive days at any timepoint between Day 0 and Day 28 without vomiting recurrence (for patients with NGT use at baseline). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time to clinical response are presented.</description>

    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) in Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life was assessed by both subject and investigator based on the ESAS. The ESAS scale evaluates 9 symptoms common in cancer subjects: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing and shortness of breath. The severity at the time of assessment of each symptom is rated from 0 to 10 on a numerical scale; 0 = symptom is absent and 10 = worst possible severity. Each symptom rating was interpreted independently and a total symptom distress score was calculated for both subject and investigator assessed scores as the sum of the 9 items. Median change from baseline (Day 0) in total symptom distress score, at each of the Phase 1 timepoints is presented and a positive change indicates a worsening condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in General Activity as Assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) Scale in Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The KPS scale was used to quantify subject's general well-being and activities of daily life. Subjects were classified based on their functional impairment and KPS scores range from 0 (death) to 100 (no evidence of disease). KPS scores are classified as 0-40 = unable to care for self; requires equivalent of institutional or hospital care; disease may be progressing rapidly; 50-70 = unable to work; able to live at home and care for most personal needs; varying amount of assistance needed; 80-100 = able to carry on normal activity and to work; no special care needed. Median change from baseline (Day 0) at each of the Phase 1 timepoints is presented and a negative change indicates a worsening condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Number of Daily Episodes of Nausea in Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of daily episodes of nausea were calculated as the sum of episodes of nausea reported the last 3 days before the corresponding visit, divided by 3.
The median change from baseline (Day 0) at each of the Phase 1 timepoints is presented and positive change indicates a worsening condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Abdominal Pain Scores Assessed Using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal pain was assessed using the VAS numeric pain distress scale. The VAS is a 100-millimetre (10-centimetre) scoring scale on which subjects marked on their perceived level of pain. Score range on VAS is from 0 to 100 where 0 = no pain and 100 = unbearable pain. Median change from baseline (Day 0) at each of the Phase 1 timepoints is presented and a positive change indicates a worsening condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Responders Before or at Phase 2 Timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 0 to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint assessed the overall percentage of subjects continuing from Phase 1 and confirmed as a responder at the end of Phase 1, showing a continued response at Days 35, 42 and 56. A responder was defined as a subject experiencing ≤2 vomiting episodes/day during at least 3 consecutive days at any timepoint between Day 0 and Days 35, 42, 56 (for subjects without NGT at baseline), or as a subject in whom the NGT had been removed during at least 3 consecutive days at any timepoint between Day 0 and Days 35, 42, 56 without vomiting recurrence (for subjects with NGT at baseline), as recorded on diary cards which were completed every day.</description>

        <title>Median Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) in Phase 1</title>
        <description>Quality of Life was assessed by both subject and investigator based on the ESAS. The ESAS scale evaluates 9 symptoms common in cancer subjects: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing and shortness of breath. The severity at the time of assessment of each symptom is rated from 0 to 10 on a numerical scale; 0 = symptom is absent and 10 = worst possible severity. Each symptom rating was interpreted independently and a total symptom distress score was calculated for both subject and investigator assessed scores as the sum of the 9 items. Median change from baseline (Day 0) in total symptom distress score, at each of the Phase 1 timepoints is presented and a positive change indicates a worsening condition.</description>

        <description>The KPS scale was used to quantify subject's general well-being and activities of daily life. Subjects were classified based on their functional impairment and KPS scores range from 0 (death) to 100 (no evidence of disease). KPS scores are classified as 0-40 = unable to care for self; requires equivalent of institutional or hospital care; disease may be progressing rapidly; 50-70 = unable to work; able to live at home and care for most personal needs; varying amount of assistance needed; 80-100 = able to carry on normal activity and to work; no special care needed. Median change from baseline (Day 0) at each of the Phase 1 timepoints is presented and a negative change indicates a worsening condition.</description>

        <title>Median Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by ESAS in Phase 2</title>
        <description>Quality of Life was assessed by both subject and investigator based on the ESAS. The ESAS scale evaluates 9 symptoms common in cancer subjects: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing and shortness of breath. The severity at the time of assessment of each symptom is rated from 0 to 10 on a numerical scale, 0 = symptom is absent and 10 = worst possible severity. Each symptom rating was interpreted independently and a total symptom distress score was calculated for both subject and investigator assessed scores as the sum of the 9 items. Median change from baseline (Day 0) in total symptom distress score, at each of the Phase 2 timepoints is presented and a positive change indicates a worsening condition.</description>

        <population>All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication (ITT population) and were continuing in Phase 2 of the study. Only subjects with data available for analysis at each timepoint are presented.</population>
