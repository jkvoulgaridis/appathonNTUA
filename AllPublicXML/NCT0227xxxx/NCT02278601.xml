  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is the gold standard of pain relief for labour pain. Despite this, more
      than 50% of parturients continue to experience pain leading to suffering and increased
      caregiver workload. Women who have increased pain tend to have lower successful patient bolus
      demands when patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is utilised and have dysfunctional
      labour requiring obstetric intervention such as Caesarean or instrumental delivery. Labour
      pain often escalates and worsens as labour progresses requiring an individualized, variable,
      flexible analgesic regimen. Bolus epidural administrations have been shown to improve uniform
      spread of local anaesthetics with better pain relief, compared to fixed background infusions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team developed two novel epidural delivery regimens: computer-integrated PCEA
      (CIPCEA) (variable flexible background infusion) and variable-frequency automated mandatory
      bolus (VAMB) focused on individualization of analgesic requirements. This phase 3
      double-blinded randomized controlled trial will compare the two novel regimens, and each with
      conventional PCEA, in reducing breakthrough pain (failure of the regimen to provide adequate
      pain relief, necessitating unscheduled epidural supplementation) incidence as the primary
      outcome in nulliparous term women requesting labour epidural analgesia. In addition, a
      discrete choice experiment (DCE) in the format of a survey will be administered to estimate
      the women's preferences in treatment attributes related to epidural analgesia, including
      control over epidural dosage, chance of having breakthrough pain, motor block, instrumental
      delivery and out-of-pocket cost for epidural analgesia.

    <description>Participants will be exposed to 8 pairs of hypothetical medical scenarios as per the design of DCE. Participants have to choose the ideal scenario (A or B) that provides the highest perceived benefits. Each pair of scenarios represents a comprehensive combination of possible attributes related to epidural analgesia, including control over epidural dosage, chance of having breakthrough pain, motor block, instrumental delivery and out-of-pocket cost for epidural analgesia. The most common factors associated with optimal perceived benefits will be assessed based on these experimental design. A weighted estimate will be calculated for each attribute.</description>

    <measure>Pain vulnerability: Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire before delivery. Pain catastrophizing refers to the negative thought processes patients have when they are exposed to pain or painful experiences. The PCS is a 13-item scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). It is broken into three subscales being magnification (0-12), rumination (0-16), and helplessness (0-24). A higher value in each subscale indicates a higher tendency to that subscale (worse outcome).</description>

    <time_frame>5-9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) before delivery, and again 5 to 9 weeks after delivery to assess patient's status on postnatal depression. The EPDS is a 10 item self-reported questionnaire validated for use as a screening tool for antenatal and postpartum depression in the clinical setting. Participants are asked to respond according to how they have felt in the past seven days, by which the questions correspond to common depressive symptoms. Each item is measured on a 4-point scale, with a total score in the range of 0 to 30. A higher total score indicates a greater degree of depressive symptoms. A score of 13 and above indicates clinically significant depressive symptom.</description>
