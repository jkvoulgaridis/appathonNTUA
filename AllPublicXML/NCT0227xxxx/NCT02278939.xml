      Filipino Americans (FA) are the second largest (3.4 million) Asian group in the US. and have
      one of the highest prevalences of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to
      non-Hispanic whites, African Americans and Hispanics. However, FA have been underrepresented
      in health related research, particularly in diabetes prevention. This proposed pilot study is
      the first clinical trial to assess preliminary estimates of the short-term effect of the
      novel social networking diabetes prevention program lifestyle intervention for this high-risk
      population.

    <textblock>
      Filipino Americans (FA) are the second largest (3.4 million) Asian group in the US, and the
      largest (1.5 million) in California, and have the highest prevalence of obesity and type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans and Hispanics.
      However, there has been little health related research among FA. Improving physical activity
      (PA) and diet can prevent or delay T2DM, as evidenced by the Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP) lifestyle intervention, resulting in reducing T2DM risks. However, implementing the DPP
      has been expensive and labor intensive. A more cost-effective approach may be the use of
      mobile technologies coupled with social networking. Filipinos (95%) are avid mobile phone
      users and the leading Facebook users. Thus, we propose to test a culturally competent mobile
      phone-based Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle and social networking (in-person and
      virtual) intervention in a pilot 3-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a wait list
      active control design for 50 overweight FA at risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

    <intervention_name>Filipinos Fit and Trim Weight Loss Program</intervention_name>
    <description>This 3-month pilot RCT with wait-list control Fit and Trim lifestyle intervention is designed to reduce weight by increasing physical activity, and health eating to improve fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c. This intervention will use a mobile phone health app diary to self-monitor weight, physical activity, and diet to improve health outcomes to reduce type 2 diabetes risks in Filipino Americans. Program goals are to lose 5% body weight, increase and maintain steps to 12,000 steps/day (20% increase in step-counts each week), reduce total daily fat intake (25% of total calories from fat), and sugar-sweetened beverages over 3 months.</description>

Filipinos Fit and Trim Weight Loss Program: This 3-month pilot RCT with wait-list control Fit and Trim lifestyle intervention is designed to reduce weight by increasing physical activity, and health eating to improve fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c. This intervention will use a mobile phone health app diary to self-monitor weight, physical activity, and diet to improve health outcomes to reduce type 2 diabetes risks in Filipino Americans. Program goals are to lose 5% body weight, increase and maintain steps to 12,000 steps/day (20% increase in step-counts each week), reduce total daily fat intake (25% of total calories from fat), and sugar-sweetened beverages over 3 months.</description>

At 3months, the Fit and Trim group transitions to a 3-month maintenance phase and completes the study at the 6-month visit.
Filipinos Fit and Trim Weight Loss Program: This 3-month pilot RCT with wait-list control Fit and Trim lifestyle intervention is designed to reduce weight by increasing physical activity, and health eating to improve fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c. This intervention will use a mobile phone health app diary to self-monitor weight, physical activity, and diet to improve health outcomes to reduce type 2 diabetes risks in Filipino Americans. Program goals are to lose 5% body weight, increase and maintain steps to 12,000 steps/day (20% increase in step-counts each week), reduce total daily fat intake (25% of total calories from fat), and sugar-sweetened beverages over 3 months.</description>
