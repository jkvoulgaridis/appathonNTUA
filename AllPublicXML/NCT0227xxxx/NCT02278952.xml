    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional cohort study to assess a novel assay to detect excessive or
      insufficient immunosuppression from the drug tacrolimus in lung transplant recipients. The
      assay measures mean residual expression (MRE) of genes downstream of nuclear factor of
      activated T cells (NFAT), a transcription factor regulated by tacrolimus. The investigators
      will assess whether MRE levels identify subjects at risk for rejection (insufficient
      immunosuppression) or infection (excessive immunosuppression).

    <time_frame>from 1 month up to 18 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The prescribed tacrolimus dosage was determined by the treating physician who was not aware of the study-assay values. For the study assay, two blood draws were collected at a study visit during the assessment period (from 1 month up to 18 months post-transplant). The first draw occurred before tacrolimus dosage (trough) and the second occurred 90 to 120 minutes after tacrolimus dosage (peak). To determine MRE, whole blood was stimulated, RNA was extracted, and residual expression of NFAT-related cytokines (NFAT: nuclear factor of activated T-cells) was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Researchers stratified blood draws based on subject's rejection pathology at time of blood draw and observed percentage distribution of MRE values within each rejection pathology group. Observed differences between MRE distributions within non-rejection group and rejection groups.</description>

    <description>Researchers observed percentage distribution of MRE values on the day of blood draws.

    <description>Researchers observed percentage distribution of MRE values on the day of blood draws and measured tacrolimus, prednisone, and mycophenolate dose at the time of blood draw. Researchers observed the association between percentage of MRE on the day of blood draw and tacrolimus, prednisone, and mycophenolate dose, respectively, at the time of blood draw.</description>
