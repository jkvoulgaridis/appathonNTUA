  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronx County, New York is the poorest urban county in the U.S.A., and residents are almost
      entirely Latino or African American. Cancer is the leading cause of premature death in the
      Bronx, with morality rates significantly higher than for New York City as a whole.
      Low-income/minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with preventable and
      late-stage cancers than the general population, in part, due to lower screening rates. While
      research has addressed screening barriers in low-income/minority groups, depression, a
      common,potentially critical barrier, has received scant attention. Research suggests that
      depressed women are less likely to engage in cancer screening, especially mammography and Pap
      testing. The link between mental health and cancer screening is particularly important to
      address in the Bronx, which has the highest rates of self-reported serious psychological
      distress (a measure closely related to depression) in New York City. Depression affects
      almost 1 in 4 minority women, and while minorities often seek help for depression in primary
      care, primary care depression management often does not meet evidence-based standards.
      Drawing on the expertise and close collaboration of Bronx medical and social service
      providers and patient stakeholders, this study will determine whether a collaborative care
      intervention that addresses both depression and cancer screening needs simultaneously among
      women ages 50-64 is more effective at improving cancer screening and patient-reported
      outcomes for women with depression than an existing evidence-based cancer screening
      intervention alone.

      To achieve this, the investigators will compare the effectiveness of these two interventions
      using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In partnership with six Bronx Federally Qualified
      Health Centers (FQHCs), the investigators will recruit approximately 800 women ages 50-64 who
      screen positive for depression and are non-adherent with recommended cervical, breast, and/or
      colorectal cancer screenings. The investigators specific aims are to: 1) compare the impact
      of the two interventions on patient-reported outcomes, including cancer screening knowledge
      and attitudes, self-efficacy, depression-related stigma, provider referrals, participation in
      mental health care, medication adherence, quality of life, satisfaction with care and
      treatment decisions, and depression; 2) compare the effectiveness of the two interventions in
      increasing breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening; 3) determine whether reducing
      depression increases the likelihood that low-income women 50-64 will receive cancer
      screening; 4) determine whether effectiveness of the two interventions in increasing cancer
      screening varies according to patient characteristics, such as duration of depression,
      presence of other chronic conditions, and obesity.

      This study is designed to increase the investigators understanding of how to enhance primary
      care systems' ability to improve a range of outcomes related to cancer screening and
      depression among low-income minority women, and how to best support this population in making
      cancer-screening decisions.

    <measure>Comparison of Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) Score by Intervention Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of change in depression between the CCI and PCM arm before and after intervention. (Self-Report).
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) is a well-validated measure of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for screening and diagnosing depressive episode, assessing severity, and monitoring treatment response. The PHQ9 score ranges from the minimum of 0 (no depression) to the maximum of 27 (severe depression). The detailed PHQ9 scores and corresponding level of depression severity are as follow: 0 (no depression), 1-4 (mild depression), 5-9 (medium-mild depression), 10-14 (moderate depression), 15-19 (moderately severe depression) and 20-27 (severe depression).
The mean change in PHQ9 score is the mean of the differences between PHQ9 score at baseline and the PHQ9 score at follow up for all cases in the respective intervention arm; the greater the change in PHQ9 score, the greater the improvement in depression severity.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) is a general measure of health status that assess the patient's perceived health status and whether health problems interfere with normal functioning. The SF-12 has demonstrated validity and test-retest reliability in the general population and in patients with chronic health conditions, and has been tested in five languages, including Spanish. It has been used extensively as a quality of life measure in collaborative care studies, including with low-income minority populations. It has also been used frequently in screening studies, for cancer and other conditions. The SF-12 has been validated as an indicator of effects of depression on quality of life in ethnically diverse patients.
The continuous summary score was converted into 4 categories using quartiles as cutoff points. The four categories are Best Health, Good health, Fair Health and Worst Health.</description>

        <description>Comparison of change in depression between the CCI and PCM arm before and after intervention. (Self-Report).
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) is a well-validated measure of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for screening and diagnosing depressive episode, assessing severity, and monitoring treatment response. The PHQ9 score ranges from the minimum of 0 (no depression) to the maximum of 27 (severe depression). The detailed PHQ9 scores and corresponding level of depression severity are as follow: 0 (no depression), 1-4 (mild depression), 5-9 (medium-mild depression), 10-14 (moderate depression), 15-19 (moderately severe depression) and 20-27 (severe depression).
The mean change in PHQ9 score is the mean of the differences between PHQ9 score at baseline and the PHQ9 score at follow up for all cases in the respective intervention arm; the greater the change in PHQ9 score, the greater the improvement in depression severity.</description>

        <title>Satisfaction With Decision to Participate in Screening and Mental Health Care as Assessed by Decision Scale</title>
        <description>The Satisfaction with Decision Scale is a 6-item measure that uses a five-point Likert-type scale; it is grounded in a conceptual model of an effective decision, i.e., one that is informed, consistent with the decision-maker's values, and behaviorally implemented. This scale has been tailored to healthcare decisions to receive treatment for emotional or mental health and to have cervical, breast, and colon cancer screening.The continuous summary score was converted into two categories using the median as a cut point. The two categories are high satisfaction and low satisfaction.</description>

        <description>This questionnaire, adopted from National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), assesses whether patients report that their primary care physician 1) has recommended cervical, breast, and colon cancer screening and 2) has recommended that the patient make an appointment with a mental health provider and/or take psychotropic medication. Two categories were created according to whether the patient received a physician recommendation (yes/no). The category of &quot;Recommendation&quot; for when they received a recommendation and a category of &quot;No Recommendation&quot; if they did not receive a recommendation</description>

The category of &quot;Recommendation&quot; for when they received a recommendation and a category of &quot;No Recommendation&quot; if they did not receive a recommendation</description>
          <population>Data are collected at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Not all participants completed the assessment at all time points.</population>

        <description>This Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale is based on diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) and measures probable anxiety disorder and severity of anxiety symptoms. Patients are asked to rate how often they have been bothered by 7 problems in the last 2 weeks on a 4-point scale. Standard cut points were used for the Generalized Anxiety Disorder measure. Minimal anxiety is (0-4). Mild Anxiety would be count as (5-9). Moderate Anxiety (10-14) and severe anxiety would be (15-21).</description>

        <title>Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey-Short Form</title>
        <description>The quality of life was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) is a general measure of health status that assess the patient's perceived health status and whether health problems interfere with normal functioning. The SF-12 has demonstrated validity and test-retest reliability in the general population and in patients with chronic health conditions, and has been tested in five languages, including Spanish. It has been used extensively as a quality of life measure in collaborative care studies, including with low-income minority populations. It has also been used frequently in screening studies, for cancer and other conditions. The SF-12 has been validated as an indicator of effects of depression on quality of life in ethnically diverse patients.
The continuous summary score was converted into 4 categories using quartiles as cutoff points. The four categories are Best Health, Good health, Fair Health and Worst Health.</description>

        <description>The Satisfaction with Decision Scale is a 6-item measure that uses a five-point Likert-type scale; it is grounded in a conceptual model of an effective decision, i.e., one that is informed, consistent with the decision-maker's values, and behaviorally implemented. This scale has been tailored to healthcare decisions to have cervical, breast, and colon cancer screening.The satisfaction with decision scale of cancer screening and its continuous summary score was converted into two categories (high satisfaction and low satisfaction) using the median as the cutoff point.</description>
