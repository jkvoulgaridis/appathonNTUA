  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results in over a million
      hospitalizations in the United States annually and COPD is the third leading cause of 30-day
      re-hospitalizations. Clinical trials have established the efficacy of treatments primarily
      dispensed via respiratory inhaler devices that reduce morbidity and health care utilization
      if they are used correctly. The effectiveness of these medications in real-world settings is
      limited by the fact that patients often do not use inhalers correctly. Current guidelines
      recommend assessing and teaching inhaler technique at all health care encounters, including
      hospitalization. Over 75% of hospitalized patients in an urban, predominantly underserved
      population misused their respiratory inhalers, highlighting a missed opportunity to educate
      these patients with high potential to benefit. Hospitalization, therefore, provides a
      potential 'teachable moment' to correct this misuse. My preliminary data indicate that one
      strategy, in-person teach-to-goal (TTG), is effective in teaching hospitalized patients
      proper inhaler technique and is more effective than simple verbal instruction. While TTG is a
      promising, several limitations prevent widespread adoption. TTG is time-consuming and costly.
      Also, reinforcement may be needed, which may be impractical with in-person TTG. One potential
      method to surmount TTG's limitations is use of interactive video module education (VME) that
      has the potential to be less costly, maintain fidelity, and be more easily extended into the
      post-discharge setting than in-person TTG. Before widespread implementation of VME, it is
      critical to rigorously develop and test VME for inhaler education in the hospital setting.
      Ultimately, it will also be important to understand patients' ability and willingness to use
      post-discharge VME for educational reinforcement to allow for this strategy to transition
      patients across care settings from hospital to home.

      We hypothesize that interactive VME will lead to non-inferior rates of ability to demonstrate
      correct inhaler use compared to rates with TTG among hospitalized patients with Asthma or
      COPD.

      For this study we are testing the preliminary efficacy of VME to teach respiratory inhaler
      technique prior to implementing a larger RCT to test the comparative effectiveness of VME
      versus TTG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim to test this hypothesis is:

      To iteratively test VME to teach correct use of metered dose inhaler (MDIs) and dry-powder
      DiskusÂ® devices to hospitalized patients with Asthma or COPD. We partnered with software
      development companies to develop VME modules that (self)-assess and teach respiratory inhaler
      technique to hospitalized participants. We have tested the VME in focus groups. Now that the
      VME is developed we will iteratively pilot test (n=30-40) the VME strategy (up to 3 rounds
      (90-120 total)) to obtain important patient feedback,preferences and preliminary efficacy
      estimates for the module.

      We hypothesize that participants' post-VME inhaler technique will be significantly better
      than their pre-VME inhaler technique.

The RE will provide technical support but will neither participate directly in the education nor help with the self-assessments. The participants will first complete the pre-assessment e-learning tool on the tablet. They will then watch the video instruction that will provide a complete demonstration with verbal instructions on correct inhaler technique. Next the participants will complete the post-assessment e-learning tool. Based on participantsâ performance, they will be directed to further tailored video-instruction. The cycle of self-assessment and video instruction will continue until sufficient mastery has been achieved.</description>
