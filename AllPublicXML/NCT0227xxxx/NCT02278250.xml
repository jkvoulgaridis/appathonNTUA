  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending
      doses of single-agent M4344 administered twice-weekly (BIW), twice daily (BID) or once daily
      dose schedule in participants with advanced solid tumors. This investigation is a three part
      study examining M4344 alone and in combination with carboplatin, and cisplatin to determine
      the safety and maximum tolerated dose.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part A and A2: Participants with one histologically or cytologically confirmed
             malignant advanced solid tumor, for which no standard therapy is available which may
             convey clinical benefit

          -  Part B1: Participants with one histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant
             advanced solid tumor, for which no standard therapy is available which may convey
             clinical benefit and/or participants must have progressed after at least 1 prior
             chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting, and for which carboplatin would be
             considered standard of care.

          -  Parts C1, C2, and C3: Participants with 1 histologically or cytologically confirmed
             malignant advanced solid tumors for which no recommended standard therapy is available
             (that is, participants who have exhausted all standard of care options according to
             National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] Guidance) which may convey clinical
             benefit, and whose tumor has at least 1 of the following biomarkers as determined by a
             central trial assay or by an assay with appropriate regulatory status: - C1:
             loss-of-function mutations in the gene ARID1A - C2: loss-of-function mutations in the
             genes ATRX and/or DAXX - C3: loss-of-function mutation in the gene ataxia
             telangiectasia mutated (ATM) - This mandatory biomarker assessment must be conducted
             during prescreening on a fresh tumor biopsy (or a biopsy obtained after the end of the
             previous treatment regimen). If this is not possible for medical reason(s), available
             archival tumor material can be used (historical data should not be used to confirm
             biomarker status)

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria (Version 1.1)

          -  WHO performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy of greater than or equal to (&gt;=)12 weeks

          -  Hematological and biochemical indices within acceptable ranges at Screening

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiotherapy, unless brief course for palliative therapy, endocrine therapy,
             target-specific therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy during the 4 weeks (6 weeks
             for nitrosoureas and Mitomycin-C, and 4 weeks for investigational medicinal products)
             or 4 drug half-lives before first dose of study drug, whichever is greater

          -  Part B1: More than 6 cycles of prior therapy with carboplatin

          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the investigator should not
             exclude the participant

             a. Part B1: Any known history of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with any prior chemotherapy
             regimen (not applicable for Parts C1, C2, and C3)

          -  Brain metastases unless asymptomatic, treated, stable, and not requiring steroids for
             at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug

          -  Female participants who are already pregnant or lactating, or plan to become pregnant
             within 6 months of the last dose of study drug are excluded. Female participants of
             childbearing potential must adhere to contraception guidelines. Female participants
             will be considered to be of nonchildbearing potential if they have undergone surgical
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or have been amenorrheic for over 2 years with
             a screening serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory's
             reference range for postmenopausal females.

          -  Male participants with partners of childbearing potential must agree to adhere to
             contraception guidelines. Men with pregnant or lactating partners or partners who plan
             to become pregnant during the study or within 6 months of the last dose of study drug
             are excluded.

          -  Major surgery less than or equal to (&lt;=) 4 weeks before first dose of study drug or
             incomplete recovery from a prior major surgical procedure

          -  Serious co-morbid medical conditions, including clinically-significant cardiac disease
