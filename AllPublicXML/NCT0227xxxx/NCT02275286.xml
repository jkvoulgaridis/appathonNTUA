      Phase I-II trial that combines trabectedin plus radiotherapy for tumor reduction response
      measure in two cohorts of patients:

      Cohort A: Patients with diagnosis of non-operable or unresectable or not oncologically
      recommended metastasectomy of limited to lung metastases soft tissue sarcoma.

      Cohort B: Patients with locally advanced resectable Myxoid Liposarcoma. Cohort C: Patients
      with retroperitoneal and resectable soft tissue sarcoma (liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma)
      Phase I: escalating dose of 1.3 or 1.5 mg/m2. Phase I for cohort C: de-escalating dose of 1.5
      or 1.3mg/m2 Radiotherapy for cohort A: 30Gy in 10 fractions (3Gy/fraction) Radiotherapy for
      cohort B: 45Gy in 25 fractions (1.8Gy/fraction) Radiotherapy for cohort C: 45Gy in 25
      fractions (1.8Gy/fraction) A translational substudy is developed to analyse different
      biomarkers predictive value.

    <textblock>
      In this study investigators plan to measure tumor response (RECIST and Choi criteria) when
      administering trabectedin standard dose or inferior with simultaneous radiotherapy treatment.
      The hypothesis states that administering trabectedin at 1.3mg/m2 or ≤1.5mg/m2 plus
      Radiotherapy 30-45Gy shows synergic activity that turns into tumor shrinkage.

      A phase I trial (dose escalation -or de-escalation for cohort C- level of 1.3 or 1.5 mg/m2)
      will provide the proper dose level to perform a phase II trial to measure RECIST and Choi
      response, progression free survival, overall survival and register safety and quality of life
      details.

      Three cohorts are indicated for this trial, A: Patients with diagnosis of non-operable or
      unresectable or not oncologically recommended metastasectomy of limited to lung metastases
      soft tissue sarcoma and cohort B: Patients with locally advanced resectable Myxoid
      Liposarcoma, C:Patients with retroperitoneal and resectable soft tissue sarcoma (liposarcoma
      and leiomyosarcoma).

      Unlimited cycles of chemotherapy are considered to be beneficial for cohort A patients,
      whereas cohort B and C only 3 cycles are indicated. About radiotherapy treatment, 30Gy will
      be given to cohort A patients, whereas cohort B and C will receive 45Gy. TCs and MRI are
      selected for imaging purposes.

      Phase I:

      For cohorts A and B:Trabectedin at two dose escalation levels:

      0 1.3 mg/m2 as a 24h I.V. infusion

      1 1.5 mg/m2 as a 24h I.V. infusion

      For cohort C:Trabectedin at two dose de-escalation levels:

      0 1.5 mg/m2 as a 24h I.V. infusion

      -1 1.3 mg/m2 as a 24h I.V. infusion

      Administration of trabectedin with a portable pump, i.v infusion of 24h, in cycles of 3
      weeks.

      Premedication:

        -  4 mg oral dexamethasone 24h and 12h before chemotherapy administration.

        -  20 mg I.V. dexamethasone 30minutes before treatment.

        -  Ondansetron or analogue will also be given prior to trabectedin.

      Pathology review, radiology review and radiotherapy review are performed to every patient.

      Several biomarkers are selected to perform FFPE tumor assays in relation to prediction

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must sign voluntarily the informed consent form before any study test is
             conducted that is not part of routine patient care.

          2. Aged equal or over 18.

          3. Patients must have a diagnostic of Soft Tissue Sarcoma with metastasis limited to
             lung, and not suitable for metastasectomy or surgery resection or not oncologically
             recommended metastasectomy.A centralized diagnostic will be performed, the tumor
             sample must be available and sent prior to inclusion.

          4. Disease distribution allows meeting with normal tissue constraints of radiation
             therapy. Radiation oncologist must confirm this point.

          5. Metastatic spread could be present in two organs at maximum (i.e. lungs and pelvic
             fosa).

          6. Those lesions considered for radiation therapy have to be considered as target lesions
             as well. (i.e. in a patient with nodules in lungs, those lesions selected for
             radiation therapy have to include at least the target lesions)

          7. It is allowed that not all the lesions will be under radiation fields. As a general
             rule, it will be prioritized to select, as target-irradiating lesions, those with
             greater increase in size and those largest lesions. It should be discouraged to
             irradiate pulmonary lesions with infiltration of pleural serosa.

          8. Patients must have documentation of disease progression within 6 months prior to study
             entry.

          9. The patient must have been considered eligible for systemic chemotherapy. A maximum of
             two previous lines for advanced/metastatic disease are allowed as long as trabectedin
             has not been included.

         10. Normal cardiac function with LVEF ≥50% by echocardiogram or MUGA.

         11. HBV and HCV serology must be performed before including the patient in the study. If
             HbsAg is positive, it is advisable to rule out a replicative phase (HbsAg*, DNA HBV+).
             If positive, the patient's inclusion in the trial is not recommended, and it is at the
             discretion of the investigator to administer preventive treatment with lamivudine. If
             a potential patient is positive to anti-HCV antibodies, the presence of the virus will
             be ruled out with a qualitative PCR, or the patient cannot be included in the study
             (if the qualitative PCR test cannot be performed on the patient, they cannot be
             included in the study).

         12. Patient may have had one previous chemotherapy line.

         13. The patient must have a central venous catheter for the administration of the
             treatment.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Unresectable tumours.

          2. Location other than the retroperitoneum

          3. Patients who have previously received systemic treatment (chemotherapy or
             trabectedin).

          4. Patients who underwent prior local treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma: surgery or
             radiotherapy in the tumour bed.

          5. ECOG performance status ≥2.

          6. Presence of metastasis or lymph node involvement of the tumour.

          7. Previous history of another neoplastic disease with less than 5 years free of disease
             except for basal cell carcinoma or properly treated in situ cervical cancer.

          8. Significant cardiovascular disease (e.g. dyspnoea &gt;2 NYHA).

          9. A significant grade 3 or greater systemic disease on the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 scale, which
             may limit the availability of the patient or which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may contribute to the toxicity caused by the study treatment.

         10. Uncontrolled viral, mycotic or bacterial infections.

         11. Known HIV-positive patients.

         12. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.

         13. Psychological, familial, social or geographical circumstances that limit the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol or informed consent form.

         14. Patients who have participated in another clinical trial and/or have received another
             investigational product in the 30 days prior to inclusion in the trial.
