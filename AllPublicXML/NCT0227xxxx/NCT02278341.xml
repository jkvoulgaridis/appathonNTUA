  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to explore a new therapy for anemia in participants with end stage
      renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Anemia is a reduced number of red blood cells or
      hemoglobin. Hemoglobin (which contains iron) is important for the transport of oxygen in your
      blood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if roxadustat is effective and safe in the
      maintenance treatment of anemia in ESRD participants on stable dialysis. Roxadustat was
      compared to epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa, commercially available medicines for treatment
      of anemia.

    <description>Baseline Hb was defined as the mean of four central laboratory Hb values; four latest Hb values prior or on the same date as the first study drug intake. For participants who did not have an available Hb value during the week 28-36 period, imputation rules were applied.

If no Hb value was available, an imputation technique was used, with the mean of all available values from Day 1 to minimum (End of Efficacy Emergent Period) carried forward.</description>

    <description>Safety was assessed by evaluation of the following variables: (TEAEs; frequency, severity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug), Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and weight), Clinical laboratory variables (hematology, biochemistry including liver enzymes and total bilirubin, and urinalysis), Physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and Vascular Access Thrombosis. All AEs collected during the Safety Emergent Period were counted as TEAE. The TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) if it was observed after starting administration of the roxadustat or ESA. Any clinically significant abnormalities were reported as an AEs. All reported deaths after the first study drug administration and up to 28 days after the Analysis Date of Last Dose and considering last dosing frequency.</description>

    <description>Participants received roxadustat three times a week (TIW) for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks. Participants received initial dose of roxadustat in doses of 100 mg, 150 mg or 200 mg, according to the average weekly dose of epoetin or darbepoetin alfa prior to randomization. Participants' roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain Hb level within the target range 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL. Dose adjustment steps were as follows: 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 mg. Oral iron treatment of 200 mg was allowed for supplementation to support erythropoiesis. Treatment with intravenous iron was allowed only if certain protocol criteria were met.</description>
