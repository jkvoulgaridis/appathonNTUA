    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the safety of intravenous (IV) and/or oral 6-day 200
      mg tedizolid phosphate with 10-day comparator in participants 12 to &lt;18 years with cSSTI.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, single-blind, multicenter, Phase 3 study of IV and/or oral tedizolid phosphate
      200 mg once per day for 6 days compared with IV and/or oral comparator for 10 days for the
      treatment of cSSTI, also known as acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, in
      participants 12 to &lt;18 years. cSSTI includes major cutaneous abscess, cellulitis/erysipelas,
      and wound infection.

          <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve Time 0 to 24 Hours (AUC0-24h) of Tedizolid</title>
          <description>AUC0-24h is a measure of the total tedizolid exposure in the plasma from the dose to 24 hours after last dose. AUC0-24h was estimated based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of observed pharmacokinetic data. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis at specific time points.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received a dose of tedizolid phosphate. Pharmacokinetic analysis was not performed with participants receiving antibiotic comparator drug.</population>
