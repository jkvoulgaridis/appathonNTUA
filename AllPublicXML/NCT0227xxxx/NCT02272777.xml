    <textblock>
      The extension study followed the core study CAMN107ECN02 (NCT01275196). which is an
      open-label, two armed study. All patients enrolled in this extension study were able to
      benefit from the treatment given in CAMN107ECN02 per investigator's evaluation. Therefore, in
      this extension study patient continued treatment of the drug (imatinib or nilotinib) which
      they were taking at the end of CAMN107ECN02. Treatment arms in CAMN107ECN02 were retained. As
      long as EC approval and agreement from investigators were obtained, the selected sites for
      CAMN107ECN02 were applied in this extension study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 230 patients who benefited from the core study treatment (imatinib or nilotinib), at
      Investigator's discretion, were enrolled into this extension study. The patients continued
      receiving the open-label drugs that they were taken by the end of core study. Treatment arms
      in the core study were retained. No crossover between the arms was allowed.

      The extension study started from the first patient last dose date in the core study and ends
      at the time of nilotinib was commercially available in China as a first line treatment.
      Eligibility evaluations were given for each patient before the enrollment. Follow-up visits
      at a frequency of 6 months were required to report AE, SAE and pregnancy only. No efficacy
      data were collected in the extension study since full efficacy had already been analyzed in
      the core study.

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patient is currently on treatment in the core study CAMN107ECN02

          2. Patient who continues to derive benefit more than risk from the study treatment he/she
             takes in CAMN107ECN02, in the opinion of the investigator at the end of the study

          3. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to enrolling in the extension study

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Progression to CML-AP or BC

          2. Patient whose treatment assigned in CAMN107ECN02 is not appropriate any longer, per
             investigator's assessment.

          3. History of non-compliance to medical regimens, or patients who are considered
             potentially unreliable and/or not cooperative.

             effective methods of contraception during dosing and at least 14 days after last dose
             of study medication. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of

                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)
