  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent chronic condition that gradually leads
      to the three dimensional deformity of the spine. Spinal curvature increases in youths as
      puberty progresses. Generally, only observation is suggested for adolescents with early
      scoliosis (Cobb's angle ≤ 20°). Rigid brace treatment is too draconian for them due to the
      high corrective force which nearly constrains all movements. Flexible brace treatment is an
      alternative; however, its efficacy is still controversial. Functional intimate apparel with a
      specialized design for teenagers with scoliosis is limited and most part of them can only
      provide some improvement for bad postures, such as hunchback. A scientific approach should be
      used to design and develop functional intimate apparel as a treatment option for adolescents
      with early scoliosis.

      This project aims to combine clinical experience with textiles and materials sciences to
      research and develop a functional intimate apparel for adolescents with early scoliosis. As a
      result, this will reduce the future likelihood of brace wear or surgery.

      In this study, the eligible subjects will be given a functional intimate apparel to wear for
      8 hours a day. Monitoring and observation will be provided during a 6-month wear trial. The
      effectiveness of the functional intimate apparel will be evaluated by pre- and post-
      treatment X-ray radiography and sonography.

      This project aims to combine clinical experience with textiles and materials sciences to
      research and develop a functional intimate apparel for adolescents with early scoliosis. As a
      result, this will reduce the future likelihood of brace wear or surgery.

      The design of functional intimate apparel will incorporate different mechanisms, such as a)
      compression and pulling forces through a close fit of the intimate apparel, b) lumbar flexion
      by using a supporting belt, c) transverse forces applied by inserting pads inside the pocket
      lining with the principle of the 3-point pressure system, d) axial rotation or coupled motion
      by using a system with uneven straps, and e) an active mechanism that aims to shift the trunk
      away from areas of pressure.

    <measure>Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the quality of life by the validated questionnaire, Euroqol (EQ-5D-5L) .The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions in 5 questions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 0-no problems, 1-slight problems, 2-moderate problems, 3-severe problems and 4-extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number by summed that describes the patient's health state.Total score are ranged from 0 to 20. The higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of life (SRS-22)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the quality of life by the validated questionnaire, SRS-22. The questionnaire consists of 22 questions and each question has 5 levels. The SRS-22r measures quality of life across 5 domains - Function (5 questions), Pain (5 questions) Self-Image (5 questions), Mental Health (5 questions), Satisfaction/Dissatisfaction (2 questions). The maximum score in each domain is 5 and minimum score is 1, with higher scores representing greater patient quality of life. The scores of each questions are summed to compute a total score. Total score are ranged from 22 to 110.The higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Measure the subjective impression of trunk deformity by the calidated questionnaire, Trunk Appearance Perception Scale (TAPS). The TAPS includes 3 sets of figures that depict the trunk from 3 viewpoints: looking toward the back, looking toward the head with the patient bending over and looking toward the front. Drawings are scored from 1 (greatest deformity) to 5 (smallest deformity), and a mean score is obtained. The mean score are ranged from 1 to 5. The higher mean scores represent a better outcome.</description>
