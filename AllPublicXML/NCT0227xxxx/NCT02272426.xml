  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 2 out of 3 patients with a stroke have some problems with their memory,
      difficulties performing certain tasks, making decisions and learning new things. In addition,
      many stroke patients do not get regular exercise and are often sedentary. Both physical and
      cognitive exercise have the potential to improve quality of life, cognition, and overall
      health, but the safety and tolerability of such interventions is not clear in stroke
      patients. The investigators will examine these outcomes by allocating stroke survivor
      participants to one of two groups: a combined exercise and cognitive training program and a
      sham control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is well recognized as the leading cause of disability in the United States. Cognitive
      deficits after stroke are common, even in those without dementia prior to the event, and
      stroke patients with worse cognition on hospital admission have worse outcomes. Cognitive
      deficits contribute to stroke-related disability and mortality. Evidence suggests an
      interaction between cognitive deficits and physical limitations, and cognitive rehabilitation
      may improve functional outcomes post stroke. Recent data also suggest that both cognitive
      training and exercise interventions improve cognition in stroke patients, but few randomized
      trials of these interventions, alone or in combination, have been conducted.

      We will study the effects of a Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Training (CARET)
      program and CTI interventions on the primary outcome of safety, feasibility, and adherence
      among ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke survivors with mild to moderate disability. We
      hypothesize that these interventions are safe and tolerable, and that they will lead to
      improvements in our secondary outcomes of cognitive performance and quality of life. We will
      also explore the role of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor in cognitive changes related to
      the physical exercise intervention.
