    <textblock>
      Investigates whether a family-based intervention for adolescents with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) will improve adherence to prescribed medication regimen in
      adolescents with history of medication nonadherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will evaluate a dual component family-based intervention for adolescents with ADHD to
      improve medication adherence (Supporting Teen Adherence and Responsibility; STAR). STAR pairs
      Motivational Interviewing with parent-teen behavioral contracting. In the proposed study,
      adolescents with ADHD and a history of chronic nonadherence to their ADHD medication will be
      randomly assigned to medication alone (medication as usual: MAU) or MAU+STAR. They will be
      treated for 6 months with a 12 month maintenance period and 12 month followup. All
      interventions will occur at the offices of participants primary care physicians.
