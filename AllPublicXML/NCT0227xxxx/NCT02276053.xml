    <measure>Change From Visit 1 (Baseline) to Visit 3 (Month 6 or End of Observation Period) in the 5 Level EuroQol-5 Dimension Quality of Life Assessment (EQ-5D-5L) Change in Utility as Converted From the 5 Dimensions</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline) to Visit 3 (Month 6 or end of Observation Period)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L: 5 Level EuroQol-5 descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression with five response levels for each dimension: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. This 5-dimension health status is converted into a numerical utility value using the UK value set, as per EuroQOL guidelines. The utility score ranges from 0 to 1 (0=worst imaginable health state, 1=best imaginable health state). The Change from Baseline is calculated for this endpoint, negative values indicate worsening and positive values indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Visit 1 (Baseline) to Visit 3 (Month 6 or End of Observation Period) in the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline) to Visit 3 (Month 6 or end of Observation Period)</time_frame>
    <description>MDASI-BT is a 2-part patient completed questionnaire where patients have to answer 22 questions about their brain tumor-related symptoms and 6 questions about how these symptoms interfere with their life. The mean core symptom severity is derived as the mean of the 13 core symptom items, the mean module symptom severity is derived as the mean of the 9 brain tumor specific symptom items and the mean total symptom severity is derived as the mean of all 22 symptom items. The mean interference is derived as the mean of the 6 interference items. For each score, at least 50% of the items needs to be answered for the score to be calculated. Mean core, mean module and mean total symptom severity scores are ranging from 0 to 10 (0=not present 10=as bad as you can imagine). Mean interference score is ranging from 0 to 10 (0= did not interfere 10= interfered completely). The Change from Baseline is calculated, negative values indicate improvement, positive values indicate worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline) to Visit 3 (Month 6 or end of Observation Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The actual change in seizure frequency from Baseline to Month 6 is calculated as the seizure frequency at Month 6 minus the seizure frequence at Baseline.
The seizure frequency at each time point is calculated as number of seizures per 28 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Seizure Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline) to Visit 3 (Month 6 or end of Observation Period)</time_frame>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L: 5 Level EuroQol-5 descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression with five response levels for each dimension: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. This 5-dimension health status is converted into a numerical utility value using the UK value set, as per EuroQOL guidelines. The utility score ranges from 0 to 1 (0=worst imaginable health state, 1=best imaginable health state). The Change from Baseline is calculated for this endpoint, negative values indicate worsening and positive values indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>MDASI-BT is a 2-part patient completed questionnaire where patients have to answer 22 questions about their brain tumor-related symptoms and 6 questions about how these symptoms interfere with their life. The mean core symptom severity is derived as the mean of the 13 core symptom items, the mean module symptom severity is derived as the mean of the 9 brain tumor specific symptom items and the mean total symptom severity is derived as the mean of all 22 symptom items. The mean interference is derived as the mean of the 6 interference items. For each score, at least 50% of the items needs to be answered for the score to be calculated. Mean core, mean module and mean total symptom severity scores are ranging from 0 to 10 (0=not present 10=as bad as you can imagine). Mean interference score is ranging from 0 to 10 (0= did not interfere 10= interfered completely). The Change from Baseline is calculated, negative values indicate improvement, positive values indicate worsening.</description>

The category 'Improved' represents the sum of Very Much Improved, Much Improved, and Minimally Improved.
