  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, four-arm lead-in safety and efficacy study in which adavosertib will
      be combined in four separate treatment arms as follows: adavosertib plus gemcitabine (Arm A);
      adavosertib plus weekly paclitaxel (Arm B); adavosertib plus carboplatin (Arm C); and
      adavosertib plus PLD (Arm D). A subset of patients will be evaluated for the safety
      assessment of each treatment arm.

      The adavosertib plus paclitaxel arm (Arm B) will enrol approximately 30 additional patients
      at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging data that
      suggests clinical activity.

      In addition, the adavosertib plus carboplatin arm (Arm C) will enrol approximately 23
      patients overall at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging
      data that suggests clinical activity.

      To further optimise the dosing schedule of adavosertib in Arm C, a safety expansion arm
      (referred to as Arm C2) of approximately 12 additional patients will be enrolled at selected
      sites to explore emerging pre-clinical and clinical data that suggest that prolonged
      adavosertib exposure may increase the clinical activity.

      <recruitment_details>This multi-center study was conducted at 20 sites: 18 in the USA, 1 in Canada, and 1 in The Netherlands. Ninety-five (95) patients were enrolled; 94 patients received treatment. The first patient started treatment on 2 Feb 2015; the final patients were still receiving treatment and were censored at the time of database lock on 14 Dec 2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>One hundred twenty-six (126) patients consented and underwent screening; 94 patients passed screening, whereas 32 patients failed screening tests and were not eligible. The Full Analysis Set consists of 94 patients.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (Median, 80% CI)</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the elapsed time from date of first dose of AZD1775 until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST assessment.
Progression-free survival was derived based on scan/assessment dates, not visit dates.</description>

          <title>Progression Free Survival (Median, 80% CI)</title>
          <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the elapsed time from date of first dose of AZD1775 until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST assessment.
Progression-free survival was derived based on scan/assessment dates, not visit dates.</description>
