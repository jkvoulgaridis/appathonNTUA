      This trial, evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of brivaracetam, will give
      subjects suffering from epilepsy, who may have benefited from brivaracetam, the opportunity
      to continue the treatment. The study will also evaluate the maintenance of efficacy over time
      of brivaracetam for subjects with partial onset seizures (POS)/primary generalized seizures
      (PGS).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Entry Visit until Last Visit (up to 162 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as those events which started on or after the date of first dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP), or events in which severity worsened on or after the date of first dose of study medication. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Withdrew Due to an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Entry Visit until Last Visit (up to 162 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or trial participant that is administered a drug or biologic (medicinal product) or that is using a medical device. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Entry Visit until Last Visit (up to 162 months)</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an infection that requires treatment parenteral antibiotics
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardize the patients or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above.</description>

    <measure>Partial Onset Seizure (POS) (Type I) Frequency Per 28 Days During the Evaluation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Entry Visit until Last Visit (up to 162 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The 28 day adjusted seizure frequency was calculated by dividing the number of partial seizures by the number of days for which the diary was completed, and multiplying the resulting value by 28.
Baseline values for seizure frequency were calculated based on the seizure diary data collected during the baseline period of the previous double-blind studies: N01114 [NCT00175929], N01252 [NCT00490035] and N01254 [NCT00504881].</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Partial Onset Seizure (POS) (Type I) Frequency Per 28 Days From Baseline of the Previous Study to the Evaluation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Entry Visit until Last Visit (up to 162 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The percent change from the previous study baselines, in Partial Onset Seizure (POS) (Type I) frequency per 28 days is defined as:
(the value at the previous study baselines) minus (the value at each time-points during the evaluation period) divided by the value at the previous study baselines.
Baseline values for seizure frequency were calculated based on the seizure diary data collected during the baseline period of the previous double-blind studies: N01114 [NCT00175929], N01252 [NCT00490035] and N01254 [NCT00504881].</description>

    <measure>Responder Rate in POS (Type I) Frequency Over the Evaluation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Entry Visit until Last Visit (up to 162 months)</time_frame>
    <description>A responder is defined as a participant with a ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline Period of the previous study.
Baseline values for seizure frequency were calculated based on the seizure diary data collected during the baseline period of the previous double-blind studies: N01114 [NCT00175929], N01252 [NCT00490035] and N01254 [NCT00504881].</description>

    <description>10 mg and 25 mg tablets. Flexible dosing up to 200 mg/day, twice daily. For each subject, the study will last from study entry until either regulatory approval of brivaracetam has been granted by any Health Authority in an indication of adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures; or until the Sponsor decides to close the study; until a managed access program, named patient program, compassionate use program, or similar type of access program is established as allowed per country-specific requirements in addition to legal and regulatory guidelines, or until the investigational product development is stopped by the Sponsor.</description>
