  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      quetiapine SR monotherapy and divalproex sodium ER monotherapy in comparison to placebo in
      the treatment of ambulatory bipolar disorder with co-morbid lifetime panic disorder or
      generalized anxiety disorder and current at least moderately severe anxiety.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of
      quetiapine SR monotherapy compared to divalproex sodium ER monotherapy in outpatient subjects
      with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or not otherwsise specified (NOS) disorder, a lifetime panic
      or generalized anxiety disorder, and current diagnosis at least moderately severe anxiety
      symptoms. Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized to obtain 90 subjects who complete
      the 8-week trial (30 completers per treatment group). This calculation is based on drop out
      rates in a similar patient population carried out by this group of collaborators. Subjects
      will be randomized to quetiapine SR or divalproex sodium ER or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. No
      concomitant psychotropic medication will be allowed throughout the study except for prn
      lorazepam during the first two weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms,
      prn zolpidem and zaleplon for the management of insomnia and benztropine for the management
      of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Throughout the study, psychiatric scales will be used
      to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be
      monitored and recorded.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the CGI-21 Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks (using LOCF Repeated Measures ANOVA)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-21 Anxiety is a 21-point clinician-rated global improvement for anxiety symptoms. Response range: -10 to +10. The higher the score the more improvement. At Baseline all patients have a score of &quot;0&quot; (zero), against which any subsequent improvements or deterioration is assessed. The relative efficacy of the 3 treatments was tested with a last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The focus was on the &quot;treatment-by-time&quot; effect showing whether the trajectory of response differed over time by treatment group. Also, group differences in baseline-to-endpoint changes in the efficacy measure were tested using LOCF ANOVA followed by pairwise planned comparisons (t-tests). The least square means shown here are from the LOCF baseline-to-endpoint ANOVA. Outcomes showing scores above zero indicate that patients did better, i.e. showed improvement on this scale.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) measures severity of anxiety symptoms - range of scores is 0-56. A higher score means worse anxiety. The relative efficacy of the 3 treatments was tested with a last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in which baseline and each of the 8 weekly assessments were the within subject factors (labeled &quot;time&quot;) and treatment group (labeled &quot;treatment&quot;) was the between-subjects factor with 3 levels. The focus was on the &quot;treatment-by-time&quot; effect showing whether the trajectory of response differed over time by treatment group. Also, group differences in baseline-to-endpoint changes in the efficacy measure were tested using LOCF ANCOVA followed by pairwise planned comparisons (t-tests). The least square means shown here are from the LOCF baseline-to-endpoint ANCOVA. Outcome results with a &quot;minus&quot; score indicate that patients did better, i.e. had a reduction in symptoms on this scale.</description>

          <title>Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S)</title>
          <description>Among the most wide used brief assessments in psychiatry, the Clinical Global Impression – Severity scale (CGI-S) is a measure of symptom severity for patients with psychiatric disorders. The range of response is from 1 (normal) through 7 (among the most severely ill patients). A higher score indicates greater severity.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the CGI-21 Anxiety</title>
        <description>The CGI-21 Anxiety is a 21-point clinician-rated global improvement for anxiety symptoms. Response range: -10 to +10. The higher the score the more improvement. At Baseline all patients have a score of &quot;0&quot; (zero), against which any subsequent improvements or deterioration is assessed. The relative efficacy of the 3 treatments was tested with a last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The focus was on the &quot;treatment-by-time&quot; effect showing whether the trajectory of response differed over time by treatment group. Also, group differences in baseline-to-endpoint changes in the efficacy measure were tested using LOCF ANOVA followed by pairwise planned comparisons (t-tests). The least square means shown here are from the LOCF baseline-to-endpoint ANOVA. Outcomes showing scores above zero indicate that patients did better, i.e. showed improvement on this scale.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Scores</title>
        <description>Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) measures severity of anxiety symptoms - range of scores is 0-56. A higher score means worse anxiety. The relative efficacy of the 3 treatments was tested with a last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in which baseline and each of the 8 weekly assessments were the within subject factors (labeled &quot;time&quot;) and treatment group (labeled &quot;treatment&quot;) was the between-subjects factor with 3 levels. The focus was on the &quot;treatment-by-time&quot; effect showing whether the trajectory of response differed over time by treatment group. Also, group differences in baseline-to-endpoint changes in the efficacy measure were tested using LOCF ANCOVA followed by pairwise planned comparisons (t-tests). The least square means shown here are from the LOCF baseline-to-endpoint ANCOVA. Outcome results with a &quot;minus&quot; score indicate that patients did better, i.e. had a reduction in symptoms on this scale.</description>

A last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in which baseline and each of the 8 weekly assessments were the within subject factors (&quot;time&quot;) and treatment group (&quot;treatment&quot;) was the between-subjects factor with 3 levels was used. The focus was on the &quot;treatment-by-time&quot; effect and whether the trajectory of response differed over time by treatment. Also, group differences in baseline-to-endpoint changes in the efficacy measure were tested using LOCF ANCOVA followed by pairwise planned comparisons (t-tests). The least square means shown here are from the LOCF baseline-to-endpoint ANCOVA. Outcome results with a &quot;minus&quot; score indicate that patients did better, i.e. had a reduction in symptoms on this scale.</description>

Each of these domains is scored 0-10, with a higher score representing greater disability or functional impairment. These 3 domain scores are added to give a Total Disability scale score. Range of response for Total Disability: 0 to 30. A higher score shows greater disability/functional impairment. The relative efficacy of the 3 treatments was tested with a last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).

A higher score represents more severe suicidality. The relative efficacy of the 3 treatments was tested with a last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in which baseline and each of the 8 weekly assessments were the within subject factors (&quot;time&quot;) and treatment group (&quot;treatment&quot;) was the between-subjects factor with 3 levels. Also, group differences in baseline-to-endpoint changes in the efficacy measure were tested using LOCF ANCOVA followed by pairwise planned comparisons (t-tests). The least square means shown here are from the LOCF baseline-to-endpoint ANCOVA. Outcome results with a &quot;minus&quot; score indicate that patients did better, i.e. had a reduction in symptoms on this scale..</description>

          <description>Sheehan - Suicidality Tracking Scale S-STS (2008 version with 8 items) measures severity of a range of suicidality symptoms. Range of scores: 0-32. A higher score represents more severe suicidality. The relative efficacy of the 3 treatments was tested with a last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in which baseline and each of the 8 weekly assessments were the within subject factors (&quot;time&quot;) and treatment group (&quot;treatment&quot;) was the between-subjects factor with 3 levels. Also, group differences in baseline-to-endpoint changes in the efficacy measure were tested using LOCF ANCOVA followed by pairwise planned comparisons (t-tests). The least square means shown here are from the LOCF baseline-to-endpoint ANCOVA. Outcome results with a &quot;minus&quot; score indicate that patients did better, i.e. had a reduction in symptoms on this scale..</description>
