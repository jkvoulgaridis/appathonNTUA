    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Aperio® PMCFU is to collect data in clinical practice of the Aperio® and
      Aperio® Hybrid Device, which is intended to restore blood flow in the neurovasculature by
      removing thrombus in patients, experiencing ischemic stroke. Recanalisation status will be
      assessed at the end of the procedure using the modified TICI (Thrombolysis in cerebral
      infarction) score.

      Study Type: prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label Participants: 10 participating
      centers in Germany planned PI: Dr. Franziska Dorn, University Hospital Munich, Germany
      Estimated Enrolment: A minimum of 130 patients treated with the Aperio® or Aperio®
      Thrombectomy Device due to thrombotic occlusion of the anterior or posterior circulation
      arteries with a diameter &lt;3mm

      Follow up: 3 months Estimated Final Assessment: End of 2022

      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, national Post-Market Clinical
      Follow-up Study to collect comprehensive information on technical and clinical success and
      safety of the use of Aperio® and Aperio® Hybrid Thrombectomy Device in arteries &lt;3mm in
      clinical practice. Aperio® and Aperio® Hybrid Thrombectomy Device will be used within its
      approved indication.

    <description>Successful arterial recanalization of occluded target vessel measured by mTICI score of 2b or 3 following the use of the Aperio® and Aperio® Hybrid Thrombectomy Device without any symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and rescue therapy within 3 passes per Device.
mTICI describes the response of thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke. Higashida et al. 2003: Grade 0: no perfusion Grade 1: penetration with minimal perfusion Grade 2: partial perfusion Grade 2A: only partial filling (less than two-thirds) of the entire vascular territory is visualized Grade 2B: complete filling of all of the expected vascular territory is visualized but the filling is slower than normal Grade 3: complete perfusion</description>
