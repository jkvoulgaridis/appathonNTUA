  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of oral
      CG-806 for the treatment of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (except APML), secondary
      AML, or therapy-related AML whose disease has relapsed, is refractory or who are ineligible
      for or intolerant of intensive chemotherapy or transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 a/b dose escalation study of safety,
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of CG-806 in ascending cohorts (3+3 design) to
      determine the MTD or recommended dose in patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid
      Leukemia (except APML), secondary AML, or therapy-related AML whose disease has relapsed, is
      refractory or who are ineligible for or intolerant of intensive chemotherapy or
      transplantation. This is to be followed by a cohort expansion phase at the candidate
      recommended Phase 2 dose.

    <description>Patients will be assessed for adverse events during all cycles of treatment and for dose limiting toxicities in Cycle 1 (28-days). Dose escalation to a higher dose level will be considered if none of the first three patients who complete Cycle 1 (28-days) at a given dose level experience a dose limiting toxicity or if only 1 of 6 patients at a given dose level experience a dose-limiting toxicity.</description>
