  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tibial nerve stimulation (TNS) has been shown to be an effective alternative for the
      management of the overactive bladder (OAB). Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TTNS)
      uses a series of regular electrical pulses to stimulate the tibial nerve. Numerous studies
      have positively shown the efficacy of this treatment. These studies have included
      multicentric, double-blind, randomized sham-controlled study of patients with idiopathic OAB.
      , . In 2013 the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance has
      added TTNS as a second-line option for the management of female urinary incontinence , .

      In reality, the vast majority of patients treated using tibial nerve receive treatment
      percutaneously (PTNS) by inserting a needle into their lower leg. PTNS requires 12 visits to
      a physician's office and a painful treatment experience. From a physician's perspective PTNS
      is resource intensive in terms of time, financial and staff commitments. As a result, PTNS is
      often not a feasible option from the point of view of health care delivery. Moreover, the
      treatment may not be an option for patients whose schedule or ability to travel is limited.
      These issues are exacerbated for those with disabilities requiring special transport
      arrangements and who have trouble committing to 12 expensive and long trips to receive
      treatment. Additionally, 8% of patients who undergo PTNS complain of adverse effects which
      include pain, bruising, tingling or bleeding at the insertion site of the 34-gauge needle. As
      a direct result of these limitations long-term follow up studies of patients undergoing PTNS
      treatment show poor compliance to PTNS over time .

      Non-invasive, homecare TTNS devices such as the ZIDA Wearable Neuromodulation System are on
      the cusp of achieving regulatory clearance. TTNS, stimulates transcutaneously at a home-based
      setting and at least one study has explored the efficacy of this treatment method . Early
      results have demonstrated improvements in OAB symptom scores and urodynamic parameters . So
      far, these studies have employed standard commercial TENS devices (transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation). These studies have used a variety of treatment frequencies to stimulate
      the tibial nerve at frequencies between 10 to 40 Hz, patient have been advised which
      pre-determined stimulation settings can be used for home care treatment. Commercial TENS
      devices limit mobility of patients during the time that the nerve is being stimulated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ZIDA device uses a series of regular electrical pulses to stimulate the tibial nerve for
      the management of overactive bladder by a patient in the home setting. The most common
      potential risk and complication associated with the ZIDA device are discomfort and pain
      (including throbbing pain) at, or near the stimulation site, including the patient's lower
      leg and foot; Redness/inflammation at, or near, the stimulation site; Numbness of toes. This
      study is designed to exclude those subjects who may be at risk for known and unknown
      complications. No other complications have been reported and there are no new or other
      expected complications or risks expected in this clinical study, making the safety profile of
      the ZIDA no greater than that of other tibial nerve stimulator products that are commercially
      used for treatment of overactive bladder.

      As mentioned above, the ZIDA device has a low potential for risks and complications.
      Therefore, the study Sponsor and Principle Investigator have determined that through their
      participation in this clinical study, the study subjects will be exposed to no new risks
      compared to the risks of devices currently available for similar intended uses. Specifically,
      the proposed study of ZIDA meets the definition of an NSR (nonsignificant risk) study for the
      following reasons:

        -  ZIDA is NOT intended as an implant

        -  ZIDA is NOT purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life

        -  ZIDA does NOT present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a
           subject

        -  ZIDA has a very low safety risk profile.

        -  The study will be conducted by investigational centre and investigators with experience
           and expertise and sufficient staff to provide quality care to subjects requiring
           treatment of an overactive bladder.

        -  The study was designed to mitigate any potential unknown risk through the eligibility
           criteria, subject selection and training on the ZIDA device.

      As addressed above, the ZIDA device does NOT otherwise present a potential for serious risk
      to the health, safety or welfare of a subject and meets the definition of a NSR study.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study of 50 subjects divided into two groups, with one group having the active ZIDA device treatment once weekly at home, and one group having a sham ZIDA device (non-treatment) once weekly at home, for a duration of 12 weeks for both groups. Subjects will be called by a research member weekly to report their weekly treatment and any complications during the 12-week treatment period. A phone call assessment will be conducted during week-6 period. Subjects will complete a final phone-call assessment at the end of the week-12 period.
This clinical investigation is being conducted in accordance with 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, and abbreviated 21 CFR 812 regulations, International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCPs), applicable local regulations and Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be analysed for the FAS population. The primary endpoint is the difference in treatment success between the Zida arm and the sham arm. Treatment success is defined as at least a 30% reduction in the frequency of daytime, night time, or moderate/severe/incontinence voids from baseline to week 12 from an average of the three day ICIQ bladder diary. A chi square test will be used to compare the clinical success rates between the treatment arms.</description>
