  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain Flortaucipir Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>80-100 minutes postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Brain imaging of tau in healthy volunteers and subjects with cognitive impairment. Standard uptake value ratios (SUVr), normalized to the entire cerebellum. A single combination volume of interest (VOI) is reported (which is derived by using the weighted average of parietal, temporal, and occipital regions). For SUVr, a value of 1 signifies no flortaucipir activity above background, values greater than 1 signify increasing flortaucipir activity in the brain.</description>

    <measure>Whole body effective dose</measure>
    <time_frame>injection to 6 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Radiation dose estimates measured in millisieverts per megabecquerel (mSv/MBq) for the whole body obtained from Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment/Exponential Modeling (OLINDA/EXM) radiation dosimetry code. Results calculated using 73.7-kg man model</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Assessments (Mini-mental State Exam)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Correlations between flortaucipir SUVr and cognitive function as measured on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MMSE is a 30-point questionnaire that is used to measure cognitive impairment. 0 is the lowest score and 30 is the highest score, indicating normal cognitive function. Lower MMSE scores indicate worsening cognitive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Assessments (Digit Symbol Substitution Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Correlations between flortaucipir SUVr and cognitive function as measured on Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). The DSST is sensitive to the presence of cognitive dysfunction as well as to change in cognitive function. Scores range from 0 to 133. Lower DSST scores indicate worsening cognitive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Assessments (AD Assessment Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Correlations between flortaucipir SUVr and cognitive function as measured on a Modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS)-Cognitive subscale (the 11 areas most typically impaired in AD including orientation, verbal memory, language, and praxis, minus the spoken language assessment). Scores on the modified scale can range from 0 to 65. Higher scores indicate worsening cognitive function.</description>
