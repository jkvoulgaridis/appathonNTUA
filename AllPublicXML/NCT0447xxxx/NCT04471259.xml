    <textblock>
      Isokinetic muscle strength test implemented by the Biodex system is a method used for
      evaluating muscle function that has been applied clinically in the field of sports and
      rehabilitation medicine. However, information on its application on Haglund's deformity
      remain insufficient. Therefore, the present study is designed to examine the effectiveness of
      the muscle strength test using the Biodex system in evaluating the recovery of athletic
      capacity in patients with Haglund's deformity following endoscopic surgery.

      Patients. A retrospective (medical records), level 3 evidence study was designed to evaluate
      the outcomes of patients who underwent endoscopic surgery for Haglund's deformity. The
      present study was approved by the Peking University Third Hospital's ethics committee.
      Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, parents or guardians of the patients
      prior to the present study. The rights of the patients were protected.

      Diagnosis. Patients were designed to be diagnosed based on subjective complaints, combined
      with clinical and radiological examinations. Radiological measurements for this disease
      include the Fowler-Phillip angle, calcaneal pith angle, parallel pitch lines, Chauveaux-Liet
      angle and the X/Y ratio.

    <description>Biodex isokinetic muscle testing system was applied in this research. Isokinetic muscle strength test is a kind of muscle function evaluation and test method, which has been applied in the research and clinical work of sports medicine and rehabilitation medicine but never on Haglund's disease before. The isokinetic muscle strength test of the flexor and dorsiflexion of the ankle joint can evaluate the muscle strength and endurance to reflect the postoperative patient's capacity for action, providing reliable clinical evidence for postoperative rehabilitation of patients after endoscopic calcaneoplasties. Isokinetic strength test conducted on both the injured and uninjured sides of the patients using the Biodex system before surgery.</description>
