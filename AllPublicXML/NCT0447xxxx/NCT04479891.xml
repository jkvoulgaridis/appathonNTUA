  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the effect of multiple oral doses of itraconazole on the single dose
      pharmacokinetic parameters of pyrotinib in healthy Chinese subjects. The safety of pyrotinib
      alone and when co-administered with itraconazole will also be assessed.
