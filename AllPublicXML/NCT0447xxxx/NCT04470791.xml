      The study aimed to determine the effect of local cryotherapy as a coadjuvant in patients with
      snakebite treated with F(ab')2 therapy venom at the Hospital Juárez de Mexico.

      Introduction: Local cryotherapy induces vasoconstriction, which leads to a reduction in the
      inflammatory process. However, the efficacy of local cryotherapy as a coadjuvant in snakebite
      treatment with F(ab')2 antivenom is unknown.

      Objective: Determine the effect of local cryotherapy as a coadjuvant in patients with
      snakebite treated with F(ab')2 therapy venom.

      Material and methods: Subjects with snakebite envenomation accident grade II, according to
      the Christopher-Rodning classification, were enrolled from the Clinical Toxicology Service of
      the Hospital Juárez de México. One group of patients received F(ab')2 antivenom therapy
      (antivipmyn®) plus local cryotherapy, and another group received only F(ab')2 antivenom
      therapy.

    <intervention_name>F(ab)2 antivenom therapy (antivipmyn®).</intervention_name>
    <description>Antivipmyn is an equine origin antivenom produced by Institute Bioclon in Mexico (Silanes Laboratories, México). The snake venoms used to create the F(ab')2 fragments are from Crotalus durissus and Bothrops asper. The number of doses of each patient depended on the classification and evolution, as indicated by the manufacturer for grade II envenoming: from 6 to 10 bottles of F(ab)2 antivenom therapy, intravenously, as an initial dose. One dose (bottle) consisted of 10 mL of polyvalent concentrated and modified horse antibodies treated by enzymatic digestion to neutralize the Bothrops asper venom to not less than 780 lethal dose 50 (LD50), and the Crotalus basiliscus venom to not less than 790 LD50.</description>

    <intervention_name>Local cryotherapy.</intervention_name>
    <description>Interval cryotherapy consisted of applying a plastic bag (the size of the bag depending on the size of the lesion, approximately 28 x 46 cm) two-thirds filled with crushed ice (frapped) wrapped in a towel applied for 20 minutes every 4 hours at the site of the snakebite throughout the hospital stay. New ice bags were used after 4 hours.</description>
