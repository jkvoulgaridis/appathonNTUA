  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular death. Pulmonary embolism
      may be life-threatening condition with an estimated 30-day mortality rate about 10-30%. In
      high-risk pulmonary embolism, systemic thrombolysis is indicated, whereas recent development
      of interventional cardiology has made catheter-directed techniques an important alternative
      to thrombolytic therapy. The controversy concerns also risk stratification and treatment in
      intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism patients. A significant percentage of
      intermediate-high risk patients with pulmonary embolism may experience rapid hemodynamic
      deterioration and then the prognosis in this group is significantly worse. Catheter-directed
      techniques are aimed to quickly relive obstruction and restore pulmonary blood flow, thus
      increasing cardiac output and immediately restoring hemodynamic stability.

      The scope of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of catheter-directed
      approaches in high-risk and intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism patients.

      Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular death. Pulmonary embolism

      The scope of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of catheter-directed
      approaches in high-risk and intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism patients.

      The primary data recorded include details of each patient's clinical status, co-morbidities
      with the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the implemented catheter-directed therapy, the results
      of additional studies (lab tests results, electrocardiogram, imaging studies), and the
      outcome. The study endpoints comprise technical success, clinically relevant
      procedure-related complications or bleeding events, classified according to the Valve
      Academic Research Consortium-2 guidelines criteria.

      Collecting the fore mentioned data allows for clinicians to better manage the pulmonary
      embolism patients with increased mortality risk.

    <description>Using common femoral venous access the pigtail diagnostic catheter will be placed into the main pulmonary artery and an initial pulmonary angiogram will be performed to demonstrate the location and extent of thrombi in pulmonary arteries. Then pulmonary arterial pressures will be measured. Subsequently an Indigo catheter (Penumbra, Alameda, California) will be placed and a direct-aspiration first-pass technique will be performed purposefully to attach a large thrombus to the catheter tip by suction and then pull it out through the sheath. The decision to terminate the intervention will be at operator's discretion after careful evaluation of hemodynamic parameters (restoration of the systolic blood pressure≥100 mmHg, heart rate &lt;100/min), improvement of arterial blood saturation≥ 92%, practicable clot burden reduction and total amount of aspirated blood (no more than 300 ml).</description>
