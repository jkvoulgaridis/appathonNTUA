        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 18 to 80 years, inclusive

          2. No clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history and
             vital signs

          3. Presence of a histologically confirmed low risk BCC lesion, with well-defined borders,
             and with a largest diameter measure before biopsy of 5 mm to 20 mm, located on arms or
             trunk

          4. Histological diagnosis of the target lesion must have been conducted 5 to 30 days
             prior to Day 1

          5. No other dermatological disease within 50 mm of the target lesion at Day 1

          6. No prior or concurrent treatment of the target lesion (including radiation therapy)

          7. Willing to undergo surgical excision approximately 63 days after first treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of systemic cancer

          2. Prior radiation treatment at the lesion site or anywhere else on the body within the
             past 20 years

          3. Concurrent disease or treatment that suppresses the immune system (eg, previous organ
             transplant history, etc.)

          4. Clinically relevant cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, neurologic, renal, or other
             major systemic disease that could complicate execution of the protocol or
             interpretation of the study results.

          5. History of thrombotic events, hemorrhagic events, and gastrointestinal perforation and
             fistula

          6. History of recurrence or presence of any other tumor subtype in the target lesion

          7. Concurrent presence of a malignant lesion within 100 mm of the target lesion that will
             require treatment during the study

          8. Current enrollment in any other investigational drug or device study within 60 days of
             Day 1 of this study

          9. Evidence of dermatological disease or confounding dermatological condition that would
             hinder carrying out the study or interpreting the results (eg, atopic dermatitis,
             eczema, psoriasis, xeroderma pigmentosa, etc.)
