      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm bridging study to evaluate the efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics, and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) for the treatment of anemia due to
      IPSSR very low, low, or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in Chinese and
      Japanese subjects with ring sideroblasts who require RBC transfusions. The study is divided
      into the Screening Period, Treatment Period (Primary Phase and Extension Phase) and a
      Posttreatment Follow-up Period and will enroll a total of 30 subjects.
