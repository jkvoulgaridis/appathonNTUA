  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to primarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of U3-1402 in
      participants with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received at least 2
      prior lines of therapy and will explore clinical benefit according to human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 3 (HER3) tumor expression level in otherwise refractory tumors.

      There will be 2 cohorts with enrollment in 2 parts. Subjects will be treated on Day 1 of each
      21-day cycle (every 3 weeks) with U3-1402 5.6 mg/kg intravenous (IV). The estimated treatment
      period is approximately 8 months and the follow-up period is approximately 4 months.
