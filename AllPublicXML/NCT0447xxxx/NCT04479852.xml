  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 4 in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery Asberg Depression rating scale is a 10-item scale used to assess the severity of depression. Individual items are scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6). The total score is the sum of individual items, ranging from 0 to 60; where a higher score indicates more depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, and 3 in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery Asberg Depression rating scale is a 10-item scale used to assess the severity of depression. Individual items are scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6). The total score is the sum of individual items, ranging from 0 to 60; where a higher score indicates more depression.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point scale to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. A score of 1 represents &quot;normal&quot; and 7 represents &quot;most extremely ill&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Week 4 in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM D-17) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 17-item Hamilton Depression rating scale is used to assess the severity of depression. Individual items are scored on either a 3-point (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4), with 0=No difficulty/absent and 4=most severe. The total score is the sum of individual items, ranging from 0 to 52; where a higher score indicates more depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Week 4 in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale is a 3-part scale that measures the degree of disruption on work, social and family life using an 11-point scale where 0 represents &quot;no disruption&quot; and 10 represents &quot;extreme disruption&quot;. In addition to the 11-point scale, participants are asked to indicate the number of days in the past week that were &quot;lost&quot; and numbers of days that were &quot;unproductive&quot;. The results of these questions have a range from 0 to 7. A total global functioning impairment score can be utilized by summing the scores from work, social and family life scales for a value range from 0 to 30.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Week 4 in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology - Self Report (QIDS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology - Self Report (QIDS-SR), is a 16 item self-reported scale where each item has a 4-point scale where 0 represents least impact scores while 3 represents greatest impact scores. Some questions are linked. The total score ranges from 0 to 27 where a higher score indicates more depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Week 4 in the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) is a 16 item satisfaction scale where each item has a 5-point scale. A score of 1 represents &quot;very poor satisfaction&quot;, while a score of 5 represents &quot;very good satisfaction&quot;. Only the first 14 items are summed for a total score that ranges from 14 to 70.</description>
