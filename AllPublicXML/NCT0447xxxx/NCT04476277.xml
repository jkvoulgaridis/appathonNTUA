      Background:

      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder. It results from a single genetic
      change (mutation) in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs are the cells that carry oxygen to the
      body. In people with SCD, some RBCs are abnormal and die early. This leaves a shortage of
      healthy RBCs. Researchers want to learn more about how long RBCs live in the human body.

      Objective:

      To study how long RBCs live in people with and without SCD.

      Eligibility:

      People age 18 and older who either have SCD, had SCD but were cured with a bone marrow
      transplant, have the sickle cell trait (SCT), or are a healthy volunteer without SCD or SCT

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will give a
      blood sample.

      Participants will have a small amount of blood drawn from a vein. In the laboratory, the
      blood will be mixed with a vitamin called biotin. Biotin sticks to the outside of RBCs
      without changing their function, shape, or overall lifetime. This process is known as biotin
      labeling of RBCs. The biotin labeled RBCs will be returned to the participant via vein
      injection.

      Participants will give frequent blood samples. Their RBCs will be studied to see how many
      biotin labeled RBCs remain over time. This shows how long the RBCs live. Participants will
      give blood samples until no biotin labeled RBCs can be detected.

      During the study visits, participants will report any major changes to their health.

      Participation lasts for up to 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mean potential lifespan (MPL) of RBCs can be quantified by either a population or cohort
      study. Such studies have corroborated the MPL of healthy donor (HD) RBCs to be approximately
      115 days while RBCs from subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a much more variable
      but consistently shorter MPL of approximately 32 days. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) is utilized as a curative therapy for the treatment of severe SCD resulting
      in, among other pathophysiological advantages, restoration of a HD RBC phenotype. This study
      will evaluate the population methodology (biotin-labeled RBCs) to determine MPL in subjects
      with SCD compared to patients who have successfully undergone allogeneic BMT, subjects with
      sickle cell trait, and healthy donors without SCD. Data generated will be used to determine
      the utility of performing a population study of RBC lifespan in gene therapy treated patients
      to ultimately target the percentage of transferred globin gene needed to reverse SCD.
