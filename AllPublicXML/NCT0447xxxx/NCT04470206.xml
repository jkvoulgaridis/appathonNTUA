  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation in reducing the intensity
      of neuropathic pain. This efficacy is defined as obtaining relief of at least 50% of the
      preoperative pain intensity assessed by the visual analog scale or the digital pain scale. No
      study has evaluated the efficacy of stimulation specifically on the different components of
      neuropathic pain, only an overall improvement in pain has been described.

      A specific questionnaire for neuropathic pain has been extensively validated in neuropathic
      pain: the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI).

      Thanks to the multidimensional structure of this questionnaire, investigators propose to
      evaluate separately and in a much more specific way the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation
      in the short and long term on the different components of neuropathic pain and to define
      responders subgroups.
