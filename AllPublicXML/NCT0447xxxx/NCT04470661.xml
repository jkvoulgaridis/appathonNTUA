    <textblock>
      It is aimed to determine prerenal, renal and postrenal diagnoses of patients with acute
      kidney injury with POCUS performed in the emergency department. Patients who presented to the
      emergency department and who have acute kidney injury (AKI) according to the KDIGO criteria
      will be evaluated and patients diagnosed with AKI will be included in the study. The
      diagnostic accuracy of POCUS with the AKI etiologies of the patients will be evaluated.
