      Rationale: A growing number of cervical cancer patients live years beyond their cancer
      diagnosis and ultimately survive their disease. Cervical cancer patients report higher levels
      of psychological distress compared to other (gynecological) cancer types, resulting in
      physical and psychosocial limitations. The mechanisms explaining why some patients do, and
      others do not experience persistent psychological distress after cervical cancer remain
      unclear.

      Objective: Gain insight into the mechanisms explaining psychological distress (i.e. anxiety,
      depression, cancer worry, perceived stress) in a prospective population-based sample of
      cervical cancer patients. Factors to be studied include characteristics of the individual
      (demographical and clinical, including comorbidities), characteristics of the environment
      ((sexual) relationships), biological function (cortisol, melatonin and sex hormone production
      assessed in scalp hair, inflammation and telomere length assessed in blood, overall quality
      of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), symptoms (EORTC QLQ-CX24), functional status (physical activity and
      sleep measured using the Actigraph activity tracker, and food intake measured using the
      online 'Eetmeter'), and general health perceptions (B-IPQ). The second aim is to assess the
      impact of cervical cancer on partners' distress (cancer worry, illness perceptions,
      relationship quality, dyadic coping).

      Study design: Prospective population-based study in which cervical cancer patients and their
      partners are included shortly after diagnosis and followed until 10 years after diagnosis.
      Patients from treatment centres in the Netherlands and their partners will be asked to
      complete questionnaires after diagnosis, after 6 months, and after 1, 2, 5 and 10 year.
      Clinical data like disease stage, initial treatment and mortality will be extracted from the
      Netherlands Cancer Registry. In a subsample of patients, additionally objective lifestyle
      (actigraph, biosensor) and biological (blood, hair) measures are assessed at diagnosis and
      after 6, 12 and 24 months. .

      Study population: Newly diagnosed stage 1-3 cervical cancer patients (N=520) and their
      partners (N=312, expected) from any treatment centre in the Netherlands will be asked to fill
      out questionnaires. In a subsample of patients (N=116) additionally lifestyle and biological
      measures are assessed at all time-points.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: psychological distress (anxiety, depression, perceived
      stress, cancer worry)

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Patients and partners are asked to complete a questionnaire at 6 points in time:
      after diagnosis, after 6 months, and after 1, 2, 5 and 10 year. Patients will additionally be
      asked to complete an online food diary for 3 days. A subsample of patients will be asked to
      donate blood samples (2X10 ml, 10 minutes) to assess inflammation markers and telomere
      length, to donate a scalp hair sample (10 mg) to assess hormone production after diagnosis
      and after 6, 12 and 24 months, and to wear an Actigraph activity tracker to assess physical
      activity and sleep and a Philips Biosensor to assess heart rate variability as a marker of
      vagal nerve function at 6, 12 and 24 months.

        All newly diagnosed I-III stage cervical cancer patients that receive primary treatment in
        one of the treatment centres will be identified by their treating gynaecologist. Patients
        will be invited before the start of treatment and will be followed until 10 years after
        diagnosis. Additionally, patients will be asked to invite their partner to participate.
