  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To promote follicular development in POI women, G-CSF mobilized activated platelet rich
      plasma will be directly injected into the ovarian medulla.

      This is a prospective, observational, multicentric, open, pilot-controlled randomized trial
      which seeks to evaluate the impact of the 4-step ASCOT technique on the ovarian reserve and
      reproductive outcomes of POI patients. The study will be developed in two phases.

      In a first step, POI women will randomized to control or undergo the 4-step ASCOT technique
      based on the direct ovarian injection of G-CSF mobilized and activated PRP. Follow up (AFC,
      AMH, FSH and E2 determinations) will be developed for 3 month in the controls and for 6
      months in the treated and COS initiated if growing antral follicles detected. In the second
      phase, POI women allocated to control group after completed the follow up period will undergo
      the 4-step ASCOT technique, as described in the previous phase but only one ovary will be
      injected, then they will undergo a 6-month follow up period as described above.

    <description>POI women randomized to the 4-step ASCOT technique will receive a direct ovarian injection of G-CSF mobilized and activated PRP. For each patient, both ovaries will be directly injected with the G-CFS activated PRP (4-step ASCOT). Follow up (AFC, AMH, FSH and E2 determinations) will be developed for 6 months and COS initiated if growing antral follicles detected.</description>

    <description>Mobilization treatment will consist of subcutaneous Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF, Neupogen) at a daily dose of 10 ug/kg. G-CSF will be given for 4 days. On the fifth day, collection will be started provided that the number of CD34+ circulating cells in peripheral blood is equal to or higher than 10 per uL. If this number is not reached, mobilization treatment will be continued for two more days, in attempt to reach the minimum level to start collection.</description>

    <description>On day 5 of mobilization, if patients reach the established CD34+ levels described above, BMDSC mobilized peripheral blood (20ml) will be obtained to prepare the activated PRP for injection. PRP preparation (2nd Step) will be done with the Ortho.Pras+20 kit (Proteal), a closed and single-use system. After PRP collection, these G-CSF mobilized PRP will be activated by adding the provided Cl2Ca to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). The direct ovarian injection of G-CSF mobilized activated PRP (2-3ml/ovary) will be performed in an ultrasound-guided intervention in which preparation will be injected under the ovarian cortex (2ml pprox../ovary) using a with a 17-21G needle connected to the Ortho.Pras+20 kit syringe. The 2 ml will be distributed in several points for each ovary and the final injected volume per ovary recorded. Both ovaries will be injected when proper anatomical access can be assessed.</description>
