  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of an integrated care plan based on an
      mHealth web-based platform (HappyAir) on adherence to a 1-year maintenance program applied
      after pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients.

      Methods: COPD patients from three hospitals were randomized to a control group or an
      intervention group (HappyAir group). Patients from both groups received an 8-week program of
      pulmonary rehabilitation and educational sessions about their illness. After completion of
      the process, only the HappyAir group completed an integrated care plan for 10 months,
      supervised by an mHealth system and therapeutic educator. The control group only underwent
      the scheduled check-ups. Adherence to the program was rated using a respiratory physiotherapy
      adherence self-report (CAP FISIO) questionnaire. Other variables analyzed were adherence to
      physical activity (Morisky-Green Test), quality of life (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease Assessment Test, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, and EuroQOL-5D), exercise
      capacity (6-Minute Walk Test), and lung function.

    <description>Adherence to the maintenance program was measured with the respiratory physiotherapy adherence self-report questionnaire (CAP PHYSIO).
It consists of a total of 16 items, with a Likert scale to score each one, with 1 point as totally disagree and 4 points as totally agree. Three different dimensions of results are obtained: Total CAP, Perception and Adherence. The final rating scale is set to a range of minimum of 16 points (minimum adherence) to a maximum of 64 points (maximum adherence).</description>

    <measure>Adherence to physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to physical activity was measured with the therapeutic compliance questionnaire (Morisky-Green Test).
It consists of a series of four contrast questions with a &quot;yes/no&quot; dichotomous answer, which reflects the patient's behavior with respect to compliance. It results in a score ranging from 0 (High adherence) to 4 (Low adherence).</description>

    <description>The HappyAir app reminded the HappyAir group daily to use the app, indicating that they record medication intake, daily exercise time (minutes), level of tiredness after the exercises (good, little tired, very tired, or exhausted), and daily mood (happy, little sad, sad, or very sad). The HappyAir integrated plan was designed as a model of a therapeutic program based on communication that introduced the figure of the therapeutic educator (physiotherapist or respiratory coach) in order to design interventions focused on the patients and their needs, with minimal intervention and presence, making the patients responsible for their self-care and management of their illness. Patient and educator shared responsibility.</description>
