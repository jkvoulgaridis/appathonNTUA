  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a novel drug-delivery system
      developed to deliver, effectively and safely, small doses of cytotoxic agents into peritoneal
      tumor deposits. It is currently used for palliation and for down-staging of patients who are
      non-eligible for cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy
      (HIPEC).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PIPAC used in neoadjuvant setting to
      enhance the response of patients with colorectal peritoneal metastasis when combined with
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy for patients eligible to CRS/HIPEC prior to planned surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm, single center, phase II trial to study the added efficacy
      benefit of PIPAC administered in the neoadjuvant setting in combination with systemic therapy
      for patients eligible for CRS/HIPEC.

      the following procedures will be done to all study population. Visit 0 (Week #0) screening -
      Clinical evaluation and baseline cross-sectional imaging. Patients will be evaluated for
      their eligibility and recruited if found suitable.

      (Week #1) tumor board discussion to ensure eligibility and staging (Week #2-4) Initiation of
      systemic therapy, if not been already started (2 cycles): Systemic therapy will be
      administered and tailored by the treating oncologist as per patient tolerability. If already
      on chemotherapy at visit 0, patients will continue chemotherapy until first PIPAC.

      Visit 1 (Week #4) first PIPAC: Diagnostic laparoscopy, staging, PCI evaluation and biopsies
      will be taken as described earlier.

      Systemic therapy (2 cycles, Week #4-8): Systemic therapy will be administered and tailored by
      the treating oncologist as per patient tolerability.

      Visit 2 (Week #6) - post first PIPAC - Surgical Oncology Clinic: evaluation of PIPAC
      tolerability and possible side effects or complications. Cross sectional imaging to monitor
      progression prior to the upcoming second PIPAC.

      Visit 3 (Week #8) - second PIPAC: Diagnostic laparoscopy, staging, PCI evaluation and
      biopsies will be taken as described earlier.

      Systemic therapy (2 cycles, Week #8-12): Systemic therapy will be administered and tailored
      by the treating oncologist as per patient tolerability. Systemic therapy will be stopped at
      week#12 (2-4 weeks) prior to planned CRS/HIPEC Visit 4 (Week #10) - post second PIPAC -
      Surgical Oncology Clinic: evaluation of PIPAC tolerability, quality of life, and possible
      side effects or complications after PIPAC.

      Visit 5 (Week #12-14) - Surgical evaluation and cross-sectional imaging - Surgical Oncology
      Clinic: Planning for upcoming CRS/HIPEC Visit 6 (Week #14-16) - CRS/HIPEC: proper PCI
      evaluation, complete tumor cytoreduction and HIPEC will be targeted. The extent of surgery,
      technical difficulties including OR time and blood loss will be documented.

      Visit 7 follow up visit: will be conducted within 1 month after hospital discharge.
      Tolerability and possible complications post-surgery will be evaluated.

      Visit 8-11 follow up visits: Surgical Oncology Clinic evaluation: cross sectional imaging,
      Tumor markers and clinical evaluation will be conducted for any signs of possible recurrence
      on 3 monthly bases Visit 12-13 follow up: Surgical oncology clinic: cross sectional imaging,
      Tumor markers and clinical evaluation will be conducted for any signs of possible recurrence
      on 6 monthly bases. The follow up for the trial will be concluded at this stage (total of 3
      years follow up).

      To be noted that patient systemic chemotherapy would not be interrupted throughout the
      treatment protocol and PIPAC therapy will be delivered in-between chemotherapy cycles.

    <description>Clinically, at time of laparoscopic exploration, tumor burden and distribution will be assessed. Peritoneal cancer index (PCI) will be documented. Final evaluation of tumor burden, PCI and clinical response will be evaluated at time of CRS/HIPEC. Radiologically, a baseline abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan will be acquired &lt;4 weeks before the initiation of the treatment plan and will be repeated before CRS/HIPEC. Response will be evaluated by an independent radiologist as per RECIST criteria 1.1. Pathologically, biopsies from representative lesions will be taken. During the first procedure, before PIPAC delivery one sample from each abdominal quadrant and will be submitted to histopathology examination. Each biopsy site will be marked by a sliver clip for subsequent biopsies in the following PIPAC. Final pathological assessment will be done from specimens obtained at time of cytoreductive surgery .</description>
