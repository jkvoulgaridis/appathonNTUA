  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, single arm study. A total of 300 patients with primary
      non-small cell lung cancer treated with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs) are
      expected to included . All patients will follow up for at least 1 year. Patients with cardiac
      adverse reactions after PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment at admission or
      during the subsequently follow-up period will randomly assigned a random number to each
      patient by computer random sequence. Patients with odd random number will treat with
      RASI（renin-angiotensin system inhibitors）, and those with even random number will treat with
      ARNI（angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitor）.
