      With a commercially available particle counter, we can differentiate the particle counts of
      different sizes in different areas of the endoscopy room. An increase from baseline particles
      of &lt; 5um during or after the procedure would suggest that the procedure is an AGP.

      In this study, the particle counter from Met One Instruments model GT-526S will be used. A
      particle sizer is placed within 10cm of the anus, at the level of the endoscopists' face and
      at the level of the endoscopy nurse assistant's face The change in the particles of different
      sizes would be simultaneously recorded. The results of these three locations are compared to
      baseline and compared with each other

      Currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets &gt;5 microns (μm) in diameter
      that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are transmitted only over a
      limited distance (e.g. ≤1 m). In contrast, the term droplet nuclei refers to droplets ≤5 μm
      in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods of time, allowing them
      to be transmitted over distances &gt;1 metre. With a commercially available particle counter, we
      can differentiate the particle counts of different sizes in different areas of the endoscopy
      room. An increase from baseline particles of &lt; 5um during or after the procedure would
      suggest that the procedure is an AGP.

      In this study, the particle counter from Met One Instruments model GT-526S will be used. The
      study will be conducted in the Prince of Wales Hospital endoscopy centre. A particle sizer is
      placed within 10cm of the anus, at the level of the endoscopists' face and at the level of
      the endoscopy nurse assistant's face The change in the particles of different sizes would be
      simultaneously recorded. The results of these three locations are compared to baseline and
      compared with each other.
