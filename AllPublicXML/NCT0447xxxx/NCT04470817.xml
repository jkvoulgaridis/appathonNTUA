    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety by determining the incidence rates of all
      adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs)/serious adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs), unexpected AEs and ADRs that are not reflected on the precaution in the use, ADRs
      already known, non-serious ADRs and other safety related information (laboratory values
      changes, etc).

      This is a long-term prospective, observational post-marketing surveillance study of
      azilsartan medoxomil in participants with essential hypertension. This study will assess the
      safety and effectiveness of azilsartan medoxomil prescribed as a monotherapy or taken
      concomitantly with other anti-hypertension therapies in real-world clinical practice
      settings.

      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. The data will be prospectively
      collected, at the centers from medical files and recorded into electronic case report forms
      (e-CRFs). All the participants will be assigned to a single observational cohort:

        -  Participants With Essential Hypertension

      The multi-center study will be conducted in South Korea. Data collection will be based on
      routinely scheduled and emergency visits over the surveillance period, scheduled at Visit 1
      (Baseline), Visit 2 (6 Weeks), Visit 3 (3 Months or more less than 6 Months) and Visit 4 (6
      Months or more [Month 9]). The overall duration of the study will be approximately 6 years.
      All participants will be followed up for 9 months after drug administration.

    <measure>Final Effectiveness Rate as Assessed by the Investigator</measure>

    <description>Effectiveness rate: percentage of participants who achieved effectiveness over total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, and is calculated as number of effective participants/total number of participants in group, multiplied by 100. Final effectiveness will be assessed based on: Improved (symptoms have improved or it is considered to have had a maintenance effect); Unchanged (no significant change from pre-administration, not considered to have had a maintenance effect); Worsened (symptoms have worsened compared to pre-administration); Unassessable (unable to assess due to grounds such as missing effectiveness variables, follow up loss, etc.). Maintenance effect: cases where the likelihood of worsened symptoms is high with discontinuation of medication, or equivalent effect to existing drugs is sustained when substituted with existing drugs. Effectiveness rate is determined by classifying 'Improved' as &quot;Effective&quot; and 'Unchanged' and 'Worsened' as &quot;Ineffective&quot;.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
