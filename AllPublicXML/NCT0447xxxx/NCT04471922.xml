    <textblock>
      A single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo parallel controlled phase 1 study to
      evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of multiple (7 days) ascending dose
      (60mg QD, 80mg QD, 100mg Qd) administrationof Anaprazole in healthy Chinese subjects. 45
      subjects, 15 subjects for each dose group. In each dose group, 10 subjects take
      investigational drug (anaprazole), 2 subjects take active comparatory drug (rabeprazole), 3
      subjects take placebo.
