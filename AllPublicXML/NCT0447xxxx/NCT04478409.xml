  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common auto-inflammatory disease (prevalence:
      1-5 / 10,000 inhabitants). It is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, which encodes variants
      of the Pyrine inflammasome. Inflammasomes are protein complexes of the innate immunity that
      produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β).

      In vitro, our preliminary results demonstrated that the activation of the inflammatory pyrine
      (measured by the concentration of interleukin-1β) by kinase inhibitors is significantly
      increased in FMF patients compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, a measurement of cell
      death gave significant results in differentiating the patients from the controls.

      The performance of this functional has been tested, fast and simple diagnostic test on common
      mutations and wish to assess its characteristics for MEFV mutations.

      The investigators hypothesize that this quick and simple functional test can serve as a
      diagnostic tool for FMF and can quantitatively discriminate against patients with different
      mutations (genotypes).

    <description>Considering 5 clearly pathogenic (homozygous) genotypes, 15 possibly pathogenic genotypes (5 pathogenic mutations in the heterozygous state, 10 possibly pathogenic mutations in the homozygous or heterozygous state), a number of 80 patients will be necessary to cover the correlation analysis genotype / phenotype.
The study does not change the usual course of care. Only an additional blood sample (4 ml for children under 12 and 10 ml for children 12 and over and adults) during a planned blood test is specific to research (no risk added). The benefit / risk balance therefore remains unchanged with regard to the usual care of patients.</description>

      Sample will be code and sent to the laboratory within 24 hours (Inserm U1111, Lyon). For
      healthy subjects, research does not involve drawing additional blood from their blood
      donation.

      There will be no long-term storage or establishment of biological collections. The monocytes
      will be extracted, selected and counted. The pyras inflammasome will then be activated and
      the interleukin-1β secretion will be measured by ELISA. Cell death will be quantified in real
      time by fluorimetry.

      Validation on cellular models in vitro: immortalized monocytes will be invalidated for the
      MEFV gene by CrispR-Cas9 and different inducible variants of the MEFV gene will be expressed
      in MEFV knot out cells. These genetically modified cells will then undergo the tests for
      stimulation of the inflammatory Pyrine according to the same procedures as the monocytes of
      the patients.

        This study will involve 80 patients with Familial Mediterranean fever, presenting a
        previous genetic analysis finding at least one mutation of the MEFV gene, considered
        pathogenic or possibly pathogenic (60 heterozygotes or complex mutations and 20
        homozygotes). The controls will be 80 healthy subjects (French national medical and
        scientific center (INSERM) and French blood bank (EFS) convention).
