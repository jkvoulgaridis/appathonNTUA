  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, case information and specimens of patients with malignant hyperthermia(MH)
      will be collected from all over China, and gene fragment analysis, sanger sequencing method
      and/or high-throughput whole-genome sequencing will be performed. The MH bioinformatics
      database will be established to find the pathogenic gene and mutation site of MH in Chinese.
      Based on the bioinformatics database, the genetic law of MH family will be studied. According
      to the results of the study, the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of MH that is in
      line with Chinese population biology characteristics will be formulated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When MH cases or suspected cases occur in China, anesthesiologists can seek help through
      malignant hyperthermia emergency rescue WeChat group in which experts from all over the
      country will give therapy instructions. Afterwards, the responsible anesthesiologist will
      complete the case report form (CRF) and collect family history of MH. The quality of CRF is
      reviewed by the investigator and all the queries are solved within 1~2 weeks.

      Upon obtaining the informed consent, all biological specimens of MH confirmed or suspected
      patients and their blood relations will be collected in the local hospitals and transported
      to West China Hospital, Sichuan University in dry ice packaging. All specimens will be
      checked by the trained investigator, registered and labeled in a standardized manner, and
      then stored in the biological sample bank of West China Hospital, Sichuan University.

      Firstly, investigators will use the method of gene fragment analysis to detect the samples at
      the diagnostic mutation sites included in the current European malignant hyperthermia group.
      Secondly, investigators will use sanger sequencing method to verify the mutation variants. If
      the screening results are negative, then high-throughput whole-genome sequencing will be
      performed.

      The MH bioinformatics database will be established to find the pathogenic gene and mutation
      site of MH in Chinese. Based on the bioinformatics database, the genetic law of MH family
      will be studied. According to the results of the study, the guideline for the diagnosis and
      treatment of MH that is in line with Chinese population biology characteristics will be
      formulated.
