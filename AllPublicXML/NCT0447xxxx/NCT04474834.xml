  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if the addition of an individual polygenic risk
      score (PRS) in addition to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) or Tyrer-Cuzick
      (IBIS) score will aid women at risk of breast cancer in making a decision to take (or not
      take) medications to prevent breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a minimal risk prospective multisite study with a single arm incorporating the PRS
      into a standard breast cancer risk reduction consultation, followed by annual surveys over 10
      years to determine if and how the availability of the PRS influenced patient decisions
      regarding preventive medicine and medication compliance. Because women know beforehand that
      the PRS is pending, study participants will be advised that a final decision to take
      preventive medicine must be deferred until after the PRS results are made available.
      Nevertheless, a survey of understanding of risk and benefit and assessment of willingness to
      take preventive medicine will be done prior to receiving the PRS results and then another
      survey will be completed after receiving the PRS score.

    <description>A Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) is a blood based genetic test which assesses 300 common breast cancer susceptibility loci (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). The PRS has been retrospectively validated and categorizes women into three categories of lifetime risk of developing breast cancer: Low Risk (&lt;15% lifetime risk), Above Average Risk (15 to 40%), and high risk (&gt;40 %).</description>
