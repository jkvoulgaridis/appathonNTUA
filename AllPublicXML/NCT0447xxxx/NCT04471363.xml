  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to explore cancer survivors' and their romantic partners'
      interest in a couples-based physical activity intervention and whether cancer-specific
      exercise education influences exercise beliefs and intentions.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess multiple predictors of couples-based physical activity interest among
      both survivors and partners including gender, age, current exercise, relationship
      satisfaction and partner support for exercise. Additionally, this study will include an
      experimental manipulation in which half of the sample will be randomized to receive
      cancer-specific exercise education.

        We are interested in hearing from cancer survivors and romantic partners from diverse
        backgrounds. This study is open to both active and inactive individuals. Cancer survivors
        can have had any type of cancer, cancer treatment, or recurrence(s). Further, we are not
        limiting participation based on time since diagnosis. Romantic partners do not need to be
        married, co-habituating, or in a relationship for a specific time-period in order to be
        eligible. Additionally, this study will not exclude couples in which both individuals are
        cancer survivors. Lastly, while we prefer both partners within a couple participate, we
        will not exclude individual participation.
