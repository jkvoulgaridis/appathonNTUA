  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Neck Specific Disability measured by Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative, 12 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI is designed to measure neck-specific disability. The questionnaire has 10 items to measure patient-reported disability secondary to neck pain and activities of daily living including personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work status, driving, sleeping and recreation and patients rate their status from 0 (best) to 5 (worst imaginable). Individual item responses are summed to a total score, where 0 points indicate no activity limitations and 50 points indicate complete activity limitation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>JOA score</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperatively and at one follow-up- assessment after a minimum of one year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score is a widely used tool to assess the severity of clinical symptoms in patients with cervical compressive myelopathy. Motor function (Upper extremity/Lower extremity); Sensory (Upper extremity/lower extremity/trunk); Bladder function. The Score reaches a maximum of 17 and a Minimum of 0 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperatively and at one follow-up- assessment after a minimum of one year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a scale used to determine the pain intensity experienced by individuals. It consists of a line, approximately 10-15 cm in length, with the left side signifying no pain with a smiling face image and the right side signifying the worst pain ever with a frowning face image.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>development of EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperatively and at one follow-up- assessment after a minimum of one year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <measure>development of radiological outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperatively and at one follow-up- assessment after a minimum of one year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>if provided in the clinical standard; e.g. fusion, implant subsidence, implant migration)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of AE/SAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperatively, intraoperatively and at one follow-up- assessment after a minimum of one year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of AE/SAEs during the postoperative course</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction with Treatment Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>at one follow-up- assessment after a minimum of one year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with Outcome of surgery documented in two aspects: is the Patient satisfied (four Point scale: very satisfied, satisfied, unsatisfied, very unsatisfied) and would the Patient like to undergo surgery again (yes, no, not willing to say)</description>
