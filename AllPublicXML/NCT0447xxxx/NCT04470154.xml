          2. Aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years old, male or female;

          3. Dry weight ≥ 50.0 kg at screening, body mass index (BMI = weight (kg) / height2 [m2])
             in the range of 16.0-30.0 kg/m^2 (inclusive);

          4. Patients with end-stage renal diseases who receive hemodialysis (including
             hemodiafiltration) 3 times in a week prior to screening for at least 3 months;

          5. Patients with at least two occurrences of single-compartment urea clearance (sp Kt/V,
             see Appendix 7 for the calculation formula) ≥ 1.2, or at least two occurrences of urea
             reduction ratio (URR) ≥ 65%, or one occurrence of sp Kt/V ≥ 1.2 and one occurrence of
             URR ≥ 65% on different days of dialysis within 3 months before screening;

          6. Male subjects must agree to use condoms in sexual intercourse during the study and
             within 3 months after the last dose; female subjects should have had menopause for at
             least one year, or should have had permanent sterilization (e.g., fallopian tube
             occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy); or women of childbearing potential
             must agree to take effective contraceptive measures during the study and within 3
             months after the last dose, such as oral contraceptives, condoms, and contraceptive
             films.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Expected to undergo kidney transplantation and/or parathyroidectomy during the study;

          2. History of allergy to opioids, such as urticaria (Note: adverse effects related to
             opioid use, such as constipation and nausea, are not included as the exclusion
             criteria in this study);

          3. Used opioids within one week before screening, or unable to avoid the use of opioids

         16. Having a total blood loss of ≥ 200mL within 1 month before screening, except for the
             blood loss during menstruation in females;

         17. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding;

         18. Any physiological or psychological diseases or conditions that may increase the risk
