  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of niraparib plus
      pembrolizumab versus placebo plus pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy in participants with
      Stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (both squamous and non-squamous
      histology) who have achieved Stable disease (SD), Partial response (PR), or complete response
      (CR) following completion of platinum-based first-line induction chemotherapy with
      pembrolizumab. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive niraparib plus
      pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy. The study's primary
      hypotheses are that participants with confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC could benefit from
      niraparib plus pembrolizumab versus placebo plus pembrolizumab with respect to
      Progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall survival (OS).

    <description>TTD is defined as the time from randomization to meaningful deterioration on a composite endpoint of dyspnea, chest pain, and cough on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 13-item lung cancer-specific module (EORTC QLQ-LC13).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms by EORTC 30-item Core module (EORTC QLQ-C30) (Scores on a scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 in Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Each cycle is of 21 Days); thereafter every 2 cycles until 90 days after last treatment dose (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated questionnaire to assess overall health-related quality of life in participants with cancer and contains 30 questions including multi-item scales and single item measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/quality of life scale (GHS/QOL), and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties). The QLQ-C30 employs a week recall period for all items and a 4-point scale for the functional and symptom scales/items with response categories &quot;Not at all&quot;, &quot;A little&quot;, &quot;Quite a bit&quot; and &quot;Very much&quot;. The two items assessing GHS/QOL utilize a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (&quot;Very Poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;Excellent&quot;). Scores are averaged, and transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score on functional scales represents better function, and on symptom scales represents more severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a clinically valid and useful tool for assessing disease- and treatment-specific symptoms in lung cancer participants. It is a lung cancer-specific questionnaire module designed to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30. The measures in the lung cancer questionnaire module assess both lung cancer-associated symptoms, such as coughing, shortness of breath (dyspnea), hemoptysis, and pain, as well as side effects from conventional chemo- and radiotherapy, such as hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, and dysphagia.</description>

SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose; results in death or is life-threatening or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect or any other situation that require medical or scientific judgment.
