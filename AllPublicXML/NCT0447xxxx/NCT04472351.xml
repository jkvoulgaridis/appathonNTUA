  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of &quot;ASCEND-I&quot; (A
      Strategy and Computer-based intervention to ENhance Daily cognitive functioning after stroke
      - Inpatient), an inpatient intervention that combines computer-based cognitive training and
      coaching of cognitive strategies to improve working memory (WM) and related executive
      functions in individuals with stroke. The investigators hypothesize that relative to an
      &quot;enhanced usual care&quot; control condition, ASCEND will be associated with improvements in WM.
      The investigators also hypothesize that measures of baseline brain connectivity (assessed via
      participants' routine clinical magnetic resonance imaging scans) will predict response to
      ASCEND-I.

    <description>The WCPA is a standardized, performance-based, ecologically-valid measure of executive functioning in which the participant has to organize a list of appointments into a weekly schedule. The outcome variable is the percentage of appointments entered correctly relative to the total number of appointments entered.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in working memory function, as measured by a Delayed Recognition Working Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of study (approximately 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a computerized task in which participants view a series of trials in which they have to encode a scene of a natural environment, hold it in mind, and determine whether a &quot;probe&quot; scene matches the original scene. A portion of trials include distracting scenes that have to be ignored or attended to. The outcome variable is the percentage of correct responses.</description>

    <description>Computerized WM training with Rehacom will be implemented in daily 30-minute sessions that are scheduled prior to the participant's occupational therapy (OT) session as an adjunct to routine rehabilitation. Tasks are tailored to the participant's current ability level and are adaptive to performance changes. During these sessions, the study staff member will use guided questioning to help the participant anticipate challenges, reflect on performance, and link computerized exercises to the Multicontext sessions. The Multicontext treatment sessions will be delivered within the participant's OT session by an OT. The Multicontext approach helps individuals to self-discover WM-related error patterns and learn to anticipate WM performance challenges through repeated practice using functionally-relevant activities. The OT conducts guided questioning pre- and post-task to help the participant anticipate challenges and self-discover WM strategies.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control condition will account for the time spent with rehabilitation therapists and study staff and provide more general cognitive stimulation. The control group will receive usual, standard of care occupational therapy during OT by inpatient rehabilitation staff who are not trained in the Multicontext approach. The standard OT session often focuses on cognition in a non-standardized and non-targeted manner without the targeting of WM and guided self-discovery of the Multicontext approach. To control for the cognitive training element of ASCEND, individuals randomized to the control condition will meet with a study staff member for 30 minutes of general cognitive stimulation that includes word-searches, crossword puzzles, and/or jigsaw puzzles.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>ASCEND-I</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention is an inpatient version of a novel behavioral intervention named &quot;ASCEND&quot; (A Strategy and Computer-based Intervention to ENhance Daily Cognitive Functioning after Stroke). ASCEND-I combines computer-based cognitive training exercises, with structured coaching sessions within patients' occupational therapy. Computer-based training is 30 minutes in length daily, and strategy training within patients' occupational therapy ranges from 30-60 minutes (depending on patients' clinical goals). The computer exercises aim to improve working memory (WM) through a series of engaging and interactive computer games (e.g., card games, virtual shopping, mental arithmetic). The Multicontext OT sessions aim to assist the participant in generalizing and transferring skills from the computer exercises to everyday activities and to develop further strategies to compensate for WM difficulties.</description>
