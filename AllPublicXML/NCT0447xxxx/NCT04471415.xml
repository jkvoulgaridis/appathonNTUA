    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of DRP-104 administered via intravenous
      infusion as a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab in patients with advanced
      solid tumors and to assess preliminary safety and efficacy in two expansions of patients,
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with defined genetic mutations and advanced
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

      This study will be conducted in 4 Parts:

      Part 1: Phase 1 single-agent dose escalation of DRP-104 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors to define the MTD (up to approximately 50 patients)

      Part 2, Once the MTD of DRP-104 has been declared and includes 3 specific cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Phase 1 single-agent safety expansion at the of DRP-104 in patients with
           advanced solid tumors (N=14 patients);

        -  Cohort 2: Phase 2a expansion at the of DRP-104 in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic NSCLC whose tumors contain a KEAP1 mutation, NFE2L2 mutation and/or STK11
           mutation (N=55 patients)

        -  Cohort 3: Phase 2a expansion at the MTD of DRP-104 in recurrent, unresectable or
           metastatic SCCHN (N=15-25 patients).

      Part 3: Phase 1 combination dose escalation of DRP-104 and atezolizumab in patients with
      advanced solid tumors previously treated with an anti-PD-1, anti PD-L1, and/or anti-CTLA-4
      antibody, starting one dose level below the MTD of single-agent DRP-104 and in combination
      with atezolizumab (up to approximately N=12 patients).

      Part 4: Phase 1 combination safety expansion at the MTD of DRP-104 with atezolizumab in a
      similar patient population as the dose-escalation (N=14 patients).
