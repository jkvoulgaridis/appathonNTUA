        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, of any race, ≥18 and ≤60 years of age on Day 1.

          -  Have been diagnosed with active distal UC for ≥3 months prior to Day 1, as determined
             by clinical and endoscopic evidence and documented in a histopathology evaluation.

          -  Have UC that is restricted to between the descending colon and the rectum (ie, left
             sided distal colitis), with demarcation of the lesion confirmed by endoscopy.

          -  Have a total Mayo score ≥6, an endoscopic subscore ≥2, rectal bleeding subscore ≥1,
             and a stool frequency subscore ≥1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have used any biologics or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors including, but not limited
             to, anti TNF α biologics or tofacitinib for the treatment of UC.

          -  Have used any purine analogues (azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or thiopurines) or
             immunosuppressants (methotrexate or cyclosporine) for the treatment of UC.

          -  Have used any rectal therapy for the treatment of UC or any intravenous
             corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to Day 1.

          -  Have received 5 aminosalicylic acid, sulphasalazine, or low dose oral corticosteroids
             that have been stable for &lt;4 weeks. Doses of oral drugs must remain stable until the
             last dose of study drug.

          -  Have received any other concomitant medications for UC that have been stable (ie, have
             not started dosing with a new drug or had a change to their dosing regimen) for &lt;7
             days or 5 half lives, whichever is longer, prior to Day 1.

          -  Have Crohn's disease, indeterminate colitis, ischaemic colitis, fulminant colitis,
             toxic megacolon, chronic pancolitis, or symptomatic intestinal stenosis.

          -  Have a history of extensive colonic resection (subtotal or total colectomy) or are
             anticipated to require surgical intervention for UC.

          -  Have an ileostomy or colostomy.

          -  Have evidence of treatment for Clostridium difficile infection or other pathogenic
             bowel infection within 60 days or for another intestinal pathogen within 30 days prior
             to Day 1.
