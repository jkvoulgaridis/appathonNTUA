    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal budesonide administration with
      lying head back position and a 5 mins time to release of medication (5MR) compared to 1 min
      time to release (1MR) in chronic rhinosinusitis patients (CRS). Patients will be instructed
      to administer via mucosal automatization device (MAD) with either of the two treatment
      approaches daily for 5 to 7 days per week and 8 weeks total. This is a crossover study design
      so each patient will be placed in the other treatment approach for an additional 8 weeks of
      treatment. Moreover, there will be a &quot;washout&quot; of 2 weeks after baseline assessment and
      before the first treatment, as well as a second &quot;washout&quot; of 2 weeks between the two
      treatment approaches. The participants will also complete study related procedures such as
      endoscopic evaluation, cultures, and two questionnaires throughout the study period. The
      investigators hypothesize that Budesonide delivered to the sinuses with a 5 minute time to
      release of medication will be more effective at decreasing inflammation when compared to a 1
      minute time to release of medication after administration.

      Objective

      To compare the efficacy of 1 minute versus 5 minutes time to release of budesonide with lying
      head back position following administration via mucosal atomization device (MAD).

      Hypothesis

      Budesonide delivered to the sinuses with lying head back position and a 5 minute time to
      release (5MR) of medication will be more effective at decreasing inflammation both
      objectively and subjectively when compared to 1 minute time to release (1MR) of medication
      after administration.

      Baseline and Follow-up Visits Evaluation:

      The following information will be obtained from each participant

      Baseline Demographic Data: Age, sex, smoking status, CRS subtype, pre-existing comorbidities,
      history of asthma, history of previous surgery, history of previous medications including
      oral and inhaled corticosteroids.

      Clinical Data: Modified Lund-Kennedy (MLK) scores, sinonasal cultures, Sino-nasal Outcome
      Test-22 (SNOT-22), EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) scores, and culture.

      Conduct of Study:

      The proposed study is a single blind randomized, controlled crossover study at of 20 weeks in
      duration. Patients who have CRS and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be
      invited to participate in this study.

      Patients will undergo a 2 week &quot;washout&quot; period before starting their respective
      administration method. The first administration methods will be once daily for 8 weeks in
      duration. This is then followed by an additional &quot;washout&quot; period of 2 weeks. Finally,
      patients will switch to the other administration method for an additional treatment duration
      of daily application for 8 weeks. We will assess which administration method is more
      effective. Patients will be asked to administer budesonide daily with a minimum requirement
      of at least five days a week to ensure changes seen are related to the appropriate treatment
      arm. The &quot;washout&quot; period will involve standard of care daily non-medicated intranasal saline
      irrigation. Data will be collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, and lastly 20
      weeks follow-up visit. SNOT-22 questionnaires, EQ-5D-5L questionnaires, endoscopic
      evaluation, and Modified Lund Kennedy Scores will each be completed at baseline and then
      again at 2 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, and 20 weeks.

      Upon enrolment in the study, patients will be randomly divided to either start with 5MR or
      1MR administration methods through 1:1 block randomization. In addition, demographic data and
      clinical data will be obtained by the investigators.

      Management of Patient Care:

      The clinical care remains the same for patients participating in this study; however, there
      is a possibility that some patients will experience an increased frequency of visits to the
      clinic with some being spaced 2 weeks apart. The increased appointments are required to
      effectively transition each patient into the different treatment types and also to acquire
      additional outcome measures. This will be clearly explained to each participant to ensure
      that they are aware of the additional appointments compared to standard of care. Otherwise,
      there are no additional risks imposed on the study participants. Patients have the right to
      withdraw from the study at any time. Patients who meet any of the exclusion criteria that
      were not noted at the beginning of the study will be removed from this study and the
      physician will discuss the future management options with the patient.

      Sample Size:

      We expect 60 patients (30 patients per study arm) to demonstrate an effect for the study.

      The washout periods included in the crossover study design will allow for more control in
      regards to reducing confounding variables. In particular, this allows patients to start at a
      similar baseline by using the same standard of treatment with Budesonide for the 2 weeks of
      washout before going into the 5MR or 1MR treatments.

      Sample Size:

      We expect 60 patients (30 patients per study arm) to demonstrate an effect for the study. To
      account for a drop-out rate of 25% the investigators plan to recruit 40 patients in each arm.

      Analysis:

      Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the baseline characteristic data and the data
      from the administered surveys and objective findings of cultures and MLK scores. In addition,
      rigorous statistical analysis will be conducted on the Likert scale-based SNOT-22 and
      EQ-5D-5L surveys. These analyses will include paired t tests with repeated measured ANOVA for
      validation and confidence intervals.

      Safety Monitoring:

      Patients who experience signs and symptoms of budesonide reaction will be noted and the code
      will be broken so that a discussion can occur between the research supervisor and the patient
      regarding the use.

      All expected and unexpected adverse events will be recorded and graded by the research
      supervisor. Stable chronic conditions, which are present prior to the clinical trial entry
      and do not worsen, are not considered adverse events and will be accounted for in the
      patient's medical history.

      During each patient visit, the research supervisor will ask appropriate questions and perform
      a physical exam to elicit any adverse events. The research supervisor will also review any
      relevant clinical data and laboratory investigations with the patient. All reportable adverse
      events will be recorded on appropriate case report form. The research supervisor will also
      write the stop date, the severity of the AE and his judgment of the AE's relationship to the
      study.

      A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as an AE meeting one of the following:

      Death occurring between Day 0 and 182 days (6 months) of the study. Life Threatening Event
      (defined as a participant at immediate risk of death at the time of the event) In-patient
      hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization between Day 0 and 42 of the
      study.

      Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity In the event of SAE, the
      research supervisor will discuss with the patient (or next of kin) whether there is a
      relationship between the study and the SAE. If there is a relationship, the PI will be
      responsible for coordinating care for the patient until the SAE has been addressed.

      Pregnancy During the Trial Patients will be responsible for determining if they are pregnant
      or become pregnant during the study. If patients notify the PI they are pregnant, they will
      be removed from the study and the medical management options will be discussed.
