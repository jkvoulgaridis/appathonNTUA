  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recommended adjuvant therapy for stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were
      perioperative chemotherapy. The adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage lung
      cancer improved about 5% 5-year survival. As for advanced NSCLC with epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) activating mutation, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) combination with chemotherapy had improved progression-free survival
      (PFS) compared with EGFR-TKI alone. We propose this trial of Neoadjuvant Afatinib Combination
      With Chemotherapy for Stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC With EGFR Activating Mutation, which would maximize
      benefit early in a patient's treatment course. At the same time, dynamic
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) was used to
      evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV) and uptake rate constant (Ki) changes of lesions
      before and after treatment, so as to accurately and quantitatively monitor the tumor response
      of different therapy.

      The prognosis of stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was worse, with 5-year
      survival rate between 26%-60%. The recommended adjuvant therapy for stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC were
      adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As for advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation,
      EGFR-TKI combination with chemotherapy had improved survival compared with EGFR-TKI alone.
      The Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group-1103 (CTONG-1103) trial showed that neoadjuvant erlotinib
      has better PFS than neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      The investigators propose that neoadjuvant EGFR-TKI combination with chemotherapy for stage
      Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation might have better pathological response and
      disease-free survival (DFS) than chemotherapy alone, and maximize benefit early in a
      patient's treatment course. At the same time, dynamic 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron
      emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) was used to evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV)
      and uptake rate constant (Ki) changes of lesions before and after treatment, so as to
      accurately and quantitatively monitor the tumor response of different therapy.

    <description>Neoadjuvant treatment (chemotherapy+afatinib) will start within 1-3 days from enrollment/randomisation. 3 cycles will be administered at 21-day (+/- 3 days) intervals (QW3) prior to surgery. Before surgery a tumor assessment (including dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT) will be done. Patients must leave the study if there is evidence of progression. Patients with stable disease or partial response may be considered for surgery.
Surgery: Surgery must be done within the 3rd-4th week (+7 days) from day 21 cycle 3 of neoadjuvant treatment (day 42-49 after day 1 of cycle 3) Adjuvant treatment (afatinib): Patients that are R0 confirmed by surgical pathology evaluation will receive the first adjuvant administration within the first week (+ 7 days) from surgery and up to 2 years.</description>
