  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Postoperative pain management after transaxillary thoracic outlet decompression
      surgery (TATOD) is difficult. In a retrospective case-control trial, we found evidence that a
      PECS II block is able to reduce pain and morphine consumption. This may ultimately lead to
      less morphine induced side-effects and improved patient satisfaction. However, the risk of
      bias in retrospective research is high. To determine the effect of PECS II in TATOD, a
      randomized controlled double blinded trial could offer more valuable scientific evidence. Our
      hypothesis is that a PECS II block will reduce pain, opioid use and opioid induced
      side-effects in patients undergoing transaxillary TOD (TATOD).

      Objective: The aim of the study is to determine the effect of a PECS II block on
      postoperative pain and opioid use in patients undergoing TATOD. The secondary objective is to
      determine the effect of a PECS II block on opioid induced side effects such as postoperative
      nausea and vomitus and the quality of recovery Study design: Single centre randomized
      controlled double blinded trial Study population: All patients with Neurogenic Thoracic
      Outlet Syndrome (NTOS) selected for TATOD by the TOS multidisciplinary workgroup and based on
      the specifications in 2016 SVS reporting standards.

      Intervention: The study group will receive a PECS II block with 40 ml ropivacaine 5 mg/ml.
      The control group will receive a PECS II block with 40 ml NaCL 0.9%.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome parameters are postoperative pain using the
      Numeric Rated Scale (NRS) score assessed at rest and when moving and postoperative
      morphine-equivalent consumption. Secondary outcome parameters are postoperative Nausea and
      Vomitus (PONV) and Quality of Recovery questionnaire (QoR-15).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: All patients will undergo ultrasound guided injection, after induction of
      anaesthesia. The administration of the injection does not invoke any extra physical
      discom-fort. Possible complications include hematoma and pneumothorax, however, the risk is
      very low (&lt;1%)[1]. In the intervention group, we expect less pain, a reduced need for pain
      medica-tion and less postoperative nausea and vomitus. We do not expect an altered
      postoperative course in the control group. Patients will be asked to fill out a
      questionnaire. Extra blood sam-ples, site visits, physical examinations or other test will
      not be done in this study.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be done through Research manager©. This research program has the possibility to create randomisation logs before the start of the trial.
A random list of numbers will be generated through Research manager© between 0 and 70. If the number is even, the patient will be allocated to the interventional treatment arm (PECS II block). If the number is uneven, the patient will be allocated to the placebo arm. This list will not be changed during the course of this investigation. Randomisation will be performed by an independent pharmacist from the hospital pharmacy before the start of the trial.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Randomisation will be performed by an independent pharmacist from the hospital pharmacy before the start of the trial. This pharmacist has no other task then creating this list and overseeing the preparation of the syringes used in this trial. Syringes will be prepared with ropivacaine or placebo based on this randomisation list. This syringe will be delivered to the preoperative holding with a label that clearly states BLOCKTOS medication, patient name, date of birth and patient number. This procedure makes sure that the patients, surgeons, anaesthesiologist and any other medical personnel are blinded for the randomisation.</masking_description>

    <description>Pain is measured using the Numeric Rated Scale (NRS) for pain. This is a psychometric response scale in which patients are asked to rate their pain from 0 to 10 (no pain to extreme pain). This scale is a validated and generally accepted tool to measure pain.</description>

    <description>Opioid use is measured in Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED). This is a generally accepted tool to quantify opioid use in patients. We will focus on the total opioid consumption.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Recovery Scale - 15 (QoR-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after surgery and every postoperative day in the morning and in the evening</time_frame>
    <description>The QoR-15 is a recently developed and validated patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM) of postoperative quality of recovery.
Fifteen questions assess five domains of patient-reported health status: pain, physical comfort, physical independence, psychological support and emotional state. The 11-point numerical rating scale leads to a minimum score of 0 (very poor recovery) and a maximum score of 150 (excellent recovery).</description>
