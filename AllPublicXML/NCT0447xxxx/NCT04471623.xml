  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate an approach to decentralize, or virtualize, the
      clinical trial experience for enrolled subjects, through the coordinated use of multiple
      digital health and telehealth technologies. The study aims to validate the feasibility,
      acceptability and best practices of coordinating/integrating several individual digital
      health technologies to achieve execution of high compliance, cost-efficient, and
      scientifically sound clinical trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation documented (health record diagnosis or EKG) within
             the past year and taking an oral anticoagulant (OAC) medication for stroke prevention

          -  Uses a smart phone daily and is willing to use apps and home devices for the study

          -  Agreeable to use a Televisit method to conduct all study visits from trial team

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active angina, stable or unstable, requiring urgent cardiovascular functional risk
             stratification (stress testing or catheterization) or intervention. Or has congestive
             heart failure that is not compensated or in which the subject is not euvolemic, as
             determined by the treating MD

          -  Individual has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his or her
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk.
