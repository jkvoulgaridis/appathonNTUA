  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Belatacept is safe to give to adult heart
      transplant recipients. Belatacept (NULOJIX) is an anti-rejection medication that is available
      through a prescription from a doctor. In this research study, belatacept is being used in an
      investigational manner (not for the purpose that it is approved for).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term outcomes after heart transplant remain suboptimal with renal failure and cardiac
      allograft vasculopathy contributing to morbidity and mortality. Belatacept is Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved for use in kidney transplant recipients on the basis of two
      randomized controlled trials, which demonstrated important renal sparing benefits, a
      reduction in de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and improved long-term outcomes. In
      this study, ten (10) primary heart transplant recipients will receive belatacept in addition
      to mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and a tacrolimus tapering regimen.
