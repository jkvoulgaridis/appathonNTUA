      A two-group parallel randomised trial of Delphi survey methods.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim:

      The aim of this trial is to compare a multi-round Delphi survey method with a Real-Time
      Delphi method on prioritised outcomes included in a core outcome set (COS). This trial is
      embedded within the COHESION study which is developing a COS for interventions for the
      treatment of neonatal encephalopathy.

      Methods:

      Stakeholders (parents/ caregivers of infants diagnosed and treated with neonatal
      encephalopathy, healthcare providers and researchers) will be randomised using stratified
      randomisation to take part in either a multi-round or Real-Time Delphi. Stakeholders will
      rate the importance of the same set of outcomes in both arms. We will compare the prioritised
      outcomes at the end of both surveys as well as other parameters such as feedback, initial
      condition and iteration effects.

    <description>Comparison of outcomes prioritised by respondents at the end of (i) the Real-time and (ii) multi-round Delphi processes. An outcome is judged 'prioritised' based on the proportion of respondents rating the outcome a 7-9 (inclusive) on a 9-point Likert scale (higher scores = higher importance for inclusion in the COS)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feedback Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 14 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The feedback effect will tell if the feedback provided to participants resulted in them amending the rating they have to each outcome on the 9-point scale (higher scores= higher importance for inclusion in the COS)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Initial Condition Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>During the Real-Time Delphi intervention (5 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The initial condition effect will capture if early participant's rating for each outcome on the 9-point scale ( higher scores= higher importance for inclusion in the COS) differs to rating given by later participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Iteration Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 14 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The iteration effect will determine if there is a difference in how consensus is achieved on prioritising each outcome or not, between the Multi-Round and the Real-Time Delphi survey arms</description>

    <measure>Comparison of outcomes prioritised within each survey arm with the final Core Outcome Set</measure>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Attrition rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Attrition rates will be recorded at the end of round 1 (week 3) and round 2 (week 9) in the Multi-Round Delphi and at weeks 2 and 4 in the Real-Time Delphi arm.</time_frame>

    <measure>Frequency of re-visiting the Real-Time Delphi arm</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured when a participant visits the Real-Time Delphi survey and rates the outcomes fully for a second time (between the start of week 1 and the end of week 5).</time_frame>

    <description>Participants will be asked in a short questionnaire how they found answering each survey using a modified Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of use questionnaire on a 7-point Likert Scale where 1= Strongly Disagree and 7=Strongly Agree.</description>

    <description>The Real-Time Delphi Method involves a single-round Delphi survey rating the importance of outcomes for neonatal encephalopathy. Feedback on each outcome (participant's own rating score, rating of the outcome by stakeholder group and overall consensus results for that outcome) will be provided to the participant once they have rated an outcome. They can then modify how they rated the outcome based on this feedback if they wish. Participants can also re-visit and re-rate outcomes as many times as they wish when the survey is live. Duration will span approximately 5 weeks.</description>

    <description>The Multi-Round Delphi Method involves a three-round Delphi survey rating the importance of outcomes for neonatal encephalopathy. Feedback on each outcome (participant's own rating score, rating of the outcome by stakeholder group and overall consensus results for that outcome) will be provided to the participant at the end of Round 1 and the end of Round 2. Participants can then modify how they rated the outcome based on feedback, in Rounds 2 and 3, if they wish. Each survey Round will run for 3 weeks approximately. In between survey Rounds, there will be a downtime of approximately 10 days before providing feedback and a further 7 days before starting the next round. Duration will span approximately 14 weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to participate in an online Delphi survey (using one of two randomly allocated methods) to rate the importance of outcomes that should be measured to determine the effect of treatment for neonatal encephalopathy. Outcomes will be prioritised on their importance in a consensus-driven manner.</description>
