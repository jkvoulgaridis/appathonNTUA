  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll women planning to have an intrauterine device (IUD) placed for
      contraception immediately following a vaginal delivery. Women will be randomized to have this
      procedure done with or without ultrasound guidance. We intend to determine if the routine use
      of ultrasound to confirm device position reduces the rates of IUD expulsion.

    <textblock>
      Participants will be screened and consented for participation in the study when they are
      admitted to Labor and Delivery for delivery and express desire for a post-placental LNG-IUD.
      If the patient consents for study participation and meets eligibility criteria above, she
      will be enrolled in the study after achieving vaginal delivery when she is randomized to
      either IUD insertion with ultrasound or without ultrasound use. See protocol for detailed
      description of IUD placement and ultrasound use.

      After placement of IUD with or without ultrasound guidance, patients will be scheduled for a
      routine postpartum follow-up visit 6-10 weeks after delivery. At the postpartum follow-up
      visit, providers will assess for IUD expulsion with usual clinical practice, including
      history, pelvic exam, and additional imaging if IUD strings are not visualized on exam.
      Several attempts to contact participants who do not attend their postpartum visits will be
      made to attempt to reschedule appointments and conduct a phone questionnaire assessing for
      IUD expulsion.

    <description>For participants randomly assigned to ultrasound use, a bedside ultrasound will be performed using the trans-abdominal probe during and/or immediately after placement of the IUD. The distance from the IUD arms to the fundus will be measured with the ultrasound, and the IUD will be defined as being &quot;in place&quot; when the distance from the top of the IUD to the fundus is measured to be 3mm or less. If the distance is greater than 4mm, the provider may reposition the IUD manually or with a ring forceps.</description>
