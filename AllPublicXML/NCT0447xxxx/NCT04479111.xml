      Our study is a single arm, single center clinical trial. The enrolled patients will accept
      laparoscopic ileocecus-sparing right hemicolectomy. The primary endpoint: postoperative
      complications, 1-year local recurrence. The second endpoint: conversion to conventional right
      hemicolectomy, time to first flatus after surgery, number of harvested lymph nodes, 3-year
      disease free survival, R0 resection, Specimen morphometry

    <description>Following the principle of complete mesocolic excision(CME), Ileocecus-Sparing Right colectomy refers to the resection of the most portion of the ascending colon, hepatic flexure and mid to distal transverse colon. The extent of lymph node dissection and length of distal resection margin are similar to conventional right hemicolectomy. The length of proximal resection margin varies.</description>

    <description>The ileocecal artery(ICA) is skeletonized. The colic branch of ICA is divided and ligated. Preserve anterior cecal artery, posterior cecal artery and ileocecal branch of ICA. Divide and ligate the right colic artery(RCA) and middle colic artery(MCA) at their roots. Dissect the lymph nodes surrounding the ICA, RCA and MCA accordingly. Head-to-Head colocolic anastomois is done, with circular stapler via making an opening at the bottom of cecum.</description>

          2. ASA grade I-III

          3. Qualitative diagnosis: a pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma;

          4. Localization diagnosis: the tumor located at hepatic flexure and proximal transverse
             colon(proximal to the right branch of middle colic artery);

          5. Enhanced CT scan of chest, abdominal and pelvic cavity: assessment of tumor stage is

             proximal edge of the tumor should be longer than 5cm.

          7. Informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Preoperative imaging examination results show: fused lymph node at the root of
             ileocolic artery.

          4. Distant metastasis.

          5. History of any other malignant tumor in recent 5 years.

          6. Patients need emergency operation.
