  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial investigates the side effects of interstitial brachytherapy and to see
      how well it works in limiting the growth of large kidney cancer masses in patients with
      kidney cancer that have refused or are unable to undergo surgery or ablation
      (unresectable/unablatable). Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy,
      temporarily introduces a radiation source into or near the tumor to eradicate the tumor
      cells. Giving brachytherapy may potentially reduce the size of the kidney cancer mass that
      would otherwise not be amenable to surgical management and translate into lower risk of
      spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of renal interstitial radiation therapy
      (interstitial brachytherapy). (Safety Lead-In) II. To evaluate local control of renal
      interstitial brachytherapy. (Expansion Phase)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate treatment response of the primary tumor. II. To evaluate 12 month distant
      progression free survival. III. To evaluate the 12 month volumetric growth of the primary
      tumor mass. IV. To determine biomarkers predicting response and resistance to radiation
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo interstitial brachytherapy for 1-2 fractions in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who undergo 2 fractions may receive both
      fractions in the same day or on 2 separate days over 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for at least 3
      years.
