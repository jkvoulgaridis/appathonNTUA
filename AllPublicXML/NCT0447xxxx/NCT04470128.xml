    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, two-stage, phase II clinical study .The main objective is
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HSK21542 injection for analgesia in patients
      undergoing colonoscopy, and, combining the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      characteristics
