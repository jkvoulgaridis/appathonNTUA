  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oncological diseases are the main cause of death in developed countries and also in Uruguay.
      Advances in therapeutics have made possible to aspire to cure and in other cases long-term
      remission with a significant increase in survival and the transformation of cancer into a
      chronic disease. Chemotherapy treatments have some side effects and cardiotoxicity is well
      known within them. Heart failure (HF) is a progressive pathology, with high mortality and
      high resource requirements of the health system with a prognosis that may be worse than some
      types of cancers. The treatment of established systolic dysfunction and symptomatic HF is
      mainly based on the indication of inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and
      beta-blockers among other pharmaceutical and no pharmaceutical interventions. Aerobic
      physical exercise, as a therapeutic intervention, reverses the physiopathological changes
      that are presumed to lead to HF in sedentary people and it is known, it is feasible to
      execute an exercise program in cancer patients. However, effective treatments for the primary
      prevention of systolic dysfunction are not well known. Our hypothesis is that an aerobic
      physical exercise program for at least 3 months, in subjects with lymphoma and new-onset
      chemotherapy, is effective in preventing left ventricular systolic dysfunction, at the end of
      chemotherapy and at one year. For this, the investigators propose a randomized, controlled,
      clinical study which is blind both for the patient and the evaluating physician, comparing
      the difference of global longitudinal strain (an echocardiographic result of myocardial
      function) pre-chemotherapy minus end of chemotherapy and minus one year after, between the
      active group (aerobic program) and the control group (flexibility program).

      Hypothesis: an aerobic physical exercise program for at least 3 months, in subjects with
      hemato-oncological diseases that initiate chemotherapy, is effective in preventing systolic
      dysfunction of the left ventricle at the end of chemotherapy and one year.

      It is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Blinded for the subject, evaluating
      echocardiographic, and treating hematologist.

      Blocked randomization method stratified by sex: the randomization sequence will be software
      generated and centralized by an investigator independent from assistant physicians and
      echocardiographic evaluator.

      To calculate N sample the investigators took a 15% variation of longitudinal left ventricular
      strain ( clinically significant criteria). The mean and standard deviation of the healthy
      Uruguayan population was taken from an own study (19.6 ± 1.7%); considering alpha error 0.05
      and power 80%, a sample of 16 in each group is required to find significant results. An
      additional 20% was added for possible &quot;drop outs&quot; resulting in a sample size of 19
      subjects/group (N total 38).

      The intervention is a 3 months aerobic exercise program compared with a 3 months flexibility
      exercise program.

      The main outcome is the myocardial longitudinal strain variation. Secondary outcomes are
      related to systolic and diastolic cardiac function, quality of life, cardiac and oncological
      outcomes, and evaluation of adherence.

      Statistical analysis: Qualitative variables will be expressed in absolute and relative
      frequency. Continuous variables will be resumed as mean and standard deviation or median and
      interquartile interval regarding normal distribution. Parametric or non- parametric tests of
      the association will be used regarding test of normality of each continuous outcome and
      Chi-squared test for the association of qualitative variables. Survival analysis will be made
      with Kaplan Meier curves and long rank test.

      The project is registered in Uruguayan interventional trial registration (Ministery of Public
      Health) with the number 812559.

    <measure>Quality of life. Minnesota LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE® Questionnaire (MLHFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Minnesota questionnaire for HF patients: It is comprised of 21 important physical, emotional and socioeconomic ways heart failure can adversely affect a patient's life. The patient marks a 0 (zero) to 5 scale to indicate how much each itemized adverse of heart failure has prevented the patient from living as he or she wanted to live during the past 4 weeks. The questionnaire is simply scored by summation of all 21 responses. The response format ranges from 0 (none or not applicable), to 1(very little) to 5 (very much). The simple sum of the responses that ranges from 0 to 105 is a measurement of heart failure severity as indicated by its adverse effect on the respondent's life during the past month. The MLHFQ scores increase with the adverse impact of heart failure on the respondent's life. Evaluation made at the end of exercise program.</description>

Each activity is rated in terms of degree of dyspnea (no shortness of breath, mildly short of breath, moderately short of breath, severely short of breath) while engaging in the activity over the past 7 days, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of dyspnea. Respondents who indicate that they did not perform an activity in the past 7 days will not produce a score for that item. The bank includes 33 items.</description>
