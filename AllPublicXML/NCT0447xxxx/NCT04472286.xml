  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood cancer treatments are increasingly effective, leading to dramatic improvements in
      survival rates. These treatments often have devastating effects on the overall health of
      pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) since they occur during a critical time of bone growth,
      including increased risks of poor bone health, fracture, and diabetes. In normal child
      development, physical activity habits influence bone density and structure, which affect bone
      strength in adulthood. Despite this well-understood principle of bone development, there are
      no exercise guidelines for improving bone health in PCS. The long-term goal of this research
      is to develop an effective exercise intervention to improve bone health after cancer therapy.
      As a first step, the investigators propose to test the hypothesis that the intensity and
      amount of ground impact of a child's daily physical activity will influence changes in bone
      density in PCS. The Specific Aims are to (1) examine the effect of physical activity on
      lumbar bone density of PCS and to (2) evaluate how physical activity influences bone density.
      In a prospective cohort study, the investigators will enroll 38 pediatric and adolescent
      survivors (ages 5-18) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma at any post-treatment time
      point. Aim 1: At two assessments, baseline and six months later, bone density and structure
      (by DXA scan, a type of x-ray that can measure bone density and the amount of muscle and fat
      in the body) and physical activity level (by accelerometry, a device like a fitness tracker)
      will be evaluated. Each child will be categorized as having low or high physical activity
      based on accelerometry measures averaged from baseline and six-month assessments. Bone
      changes (0-6 months) will be compared between low and high activity groups. Aim 2: Evaluate
      potential mechanisms by which physical activity mediates changes in bone, including the
      effects of lean mass (measured by DXA) and metabolic health (lipid panel, insulin sensitivity
      (HOMA-IR, hemoglobin A1c), vitamin D). Long-term impact: This research will provide
      information as to the types of exercise that impact bone health in PCS. This study will help
      develop effective, evidence-based exercise therapies. These therapies may help prevent
      fractures and associated disability, leading to an improvement in the quality of life for
      survivors of pediatric cancer.

      This project will examine habitual physical activity, bone health, and insulin resistance in
      pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma cancer survivors at two time points:
      baseline and 6 months. At the two study timepoints, all study participants will be asked to
      wear an accelerometer, receive a DXA scan of the lumbar spine and hip, and have blood drawn
      for analysis. Study participants will be given a gift card stipend for each study visit
      attended. Study visits will coincide with regular office visits to Children's Hospital
      Oncology Clinic and the Children's Hospital Survivorship Clinics whenever possible. The
      potential mechanism by which physical activity mediates bone changes will be explored by
      concurrently measuring changes in lean/fat mass and metabolic status. This pilot study will
      provide data to inform the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a
      physical activity intervention on bone health in PCS.
