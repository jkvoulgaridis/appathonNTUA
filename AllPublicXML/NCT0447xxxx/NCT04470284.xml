    <textblock>
      SMART-BP is a randomized, controlled study in which hypertensive patients are allocated to
      self monitoring of blood pressure monitoring (SMBP) only group or SMBP with mobile App based
      feed-back algorithm (SMBP-App) group. The App based feed-back algorithm will provide the
      patients with instruction in response to the measured BP value, e.g. remind of taking drug,
      if high blood pressure is detected.

      The primary outcomes are mean systolic BP change and drug compliance at 12-weeks. Secondary
      endpoints include mean diastolic BP change at 12-week, mean systolic and diastolic BP change
      at 6, 12 months, and drug compliance.

      This trial is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of SMBP with mobile health application (SMBP-App) compared with SMBP alone.

      Patients with hypertension will be randomly assigned to SMBP-App (intervention) and SMBP
      along (control) groups. In SMBP group the patients perform home blood pressure measurement
      and usual care. In SMBP-App group the patients perform home blood pressure and receive extra
      alarm and instructions from the mobile application in response to the obtained blood pressure
      value.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether SMBP-App is superior to SMBP alone in terms of
      blood pressure reduction and improved drug compliance in patients with hypertension.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients with essential hypertension, aged 19 years or older

          -  Sitting SBP &gt; 140 mmHg or sitting DBP &gt; 90 mmHg which is confirmed by triplicate

          -  Patients able to use smart phone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of secondary hypertension and suspected secondary
             hypertension, including coarctation of the aorta, primary hyperaldosteronism, renal
