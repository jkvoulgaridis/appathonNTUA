      Post marketing study on Fuse® Full Spectrum Endoscopy® - EndoChoice to compare two CE-marked
      medical endoscopes.

      Up to now colonoscopes had an angel of view of 170°. The purpose of this study is to check if
      330° field of view colonoscopes have a higher polyp detection rate in everyday clinical use
      in a setting of a single endosopists high volume gastroenterology practice with already high
      polyp detection rate.

      The study objective is to see if there is any significant difference in polyp detection rate
      within this two groups of two endoscopy systems.

      Primary study outcome are number of polyps and adenoma detected with each endoscopy system.
      The main secondary study outcomes are difference in histology and other hallmarks of
      endoscopy quality measurements (e.g. time to coecum, withdrawal time, patient satisfaction
      VAS 10, bowel preparation).

      Open label; retrospective control study This study includes retrospective analysis of all
      patient undergoing a screening colonoscopy in that particular gastroenterology practice
      investigated with two different endoscopy systems and lately also Endocuff (cap assisted
      colonoscopy).

      Exclusion criteria: Technical failure of passing an 12.8 mm colonoscopy to the coecum (e.g.
      structuring diverticulosis, obstructing tumor).

      The patients underwent randomly assigned either a colonoscopy performed with a high
      definition 170° colonoscope form Pentax i10 line or a colonoscopy done with Fuse 330°field of
      view colonoscope (both endocopes with identical handling). Data have been assessed for
      quality measurements for the practice and then have been anonymously analysed for general
      endoscopists interest.

      Baseline caracteristics (age, gender, Propofol and medication dosage) and quality
      measurements (quality of bowel preparation according BBPS score, time of endoscopy) are
      assessed as are the numbers of polyps, histology and location of polyps. Further more two
      bowel preparation are currently used in this practice and analysed aswell. The data have been
      enrolled anonymously with an online data assessment tool (dyssys) eCRF and then statistically
      analysed in an Excel databank.

      Study Product are two CE-marked type of endoscopes of two manufacturers Pentax and Fuse of
      EndoChoice with different angle of view.

      The reference/control are the patient undergoing a standard high definition colonoscopy with
      Pentax i10 colonosopes in comparison of the other patients having a colonoscopy performed
      with Fuse colonoscopes.

      From a former tandem colonoscopy study with Fuse colonoscopes there were 12% of additional
      polyps detected. If we suggest a difference of at least 10% the calculated sample seize would
      be 400 patients in each of the two groups. Yearly almost 1200 colonoscopies take place in
      this practice.

      Data collection still ongoing til December 2019 March 2015 First-Participant-In End of study
      December 2019

      Single-centre study at the private practice Gastroenterologie Wettingen If the investigators
      personal adenoma detection rate would be 40% in the standard high definition colonoscopy
      group (Pentax group) - as repeatedly confirmed by Medica pathology laboratories, Zurich -
      almost 400 patients in each group would be mandatory if we postulate a 10% higher adenoma
      detection rate in the Fuse group (historical data showed 12% more polyps detected with Fuse
      in comparison to standard colonoscopy in a study published from Blair S. and Gralnek IM as
      abstract ACG 2014). With a polyp detection rate of 40 vs 50% and an alpha error of 0.05 and a
      power of 80% a sample seize of 774 was calculated. T-Test, Chi-Square-Test will be applied.
