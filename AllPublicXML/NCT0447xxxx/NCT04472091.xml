  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the safety of the geniculate artery
      embolization (GAE) procedure with HydroPearl® Microspheres in 30 patients with knee pain
      caused by osteoarthritis with 24 months follow-up. The GAE procedure is an arterial
      embolization procedure that blocks abnormal blood vessels caused be knee arthritis in order
      to evaluate the effect on knee pain.

    <description>Knee function measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) scale. The WOMAC is a 24-question tool that is completed by the patient to evaluate osteoarthritis of the knee, including pain, stiffness, and physical function of the joints. There are 5 items regarding pain, 2 items for stiffness, and 17 items for physical function. Questions are ranked on a 5 point Likert scale. A score of &quot;0&quot; indicates no symptoms and &quot;4&quot; indicates severe symptoms. The individual scores are added and an overall higher score indicates worse symptoms.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo the genicular artery embolization (GAE) procedure for the treatment of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis. A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in the single treatment arm of the study.
The study will involve a screening period in which patient eligibility is determined. Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will undergo GAE with HydroPearl® Microspheres (polyethylene glycol microspheres, Terumo Medical, Somerset NJ). Following treatment, patients will undergo follow-up at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post GAE.</description>
