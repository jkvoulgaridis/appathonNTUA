      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of alisertib or sapanisertib, in
      combination with osimertinib, in treating patients with EGFR mutated stage IIIB or IV
      non-small cell lung cancer that remains despite treatment with osimertinib (osimertinib
      resistant). Osimertinib, alisertib, and sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The goal of part 1 of this trial is to
      find the highest tolerable dose of alisertib or sapanisertib in combination with osimertinib
      that can be given to patients with EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of part
      2 of this trial is to learn if the dose of alisertib or sapanisertib found in part 1 can help
      control EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer when given in combination with osimertinib.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of osimertinib plus alisertib
      II. Determine the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of osimertinib plus
      sapanisertib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) to the study combinations
      (osimertinib+alisertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      II. Determine the progression free survival of the study combinations (osimertinib+alisertib
      and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant NSCLC.

      III. Determine the disease control rate (DCR) of the study combinations
      (osimertinib+alisertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant
      NSCLC.

      IV. Explore biomarkers associated with response/resistance of the study combinations
      (osimertinib+aliertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant
      NSCLC.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib and sapanisertib. Patients are assigned
      to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and alisertib PO
      QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop progressive disease may crossover to Arm B.

      ARM B: Patients receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-28 and sapanisertib PO QD on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who develop progressive disease may crossover to Arm A.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
