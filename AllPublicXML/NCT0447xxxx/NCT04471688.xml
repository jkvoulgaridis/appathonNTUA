  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past ten years, nucleic acid detection technology has overcome the limitations of
      serological detection, reduced missed detections due to window period, occult infection,
      etc., and its application in the field of pathogen detection has developed rapidly. Since
      2015, domestic blood collection and supply institutions have fully popularized nucleic acid
      testing. The safety screening of blood sources mostly adopts the method of combining two
      times of enzyme-free negative and one time of nucleic acid testing, which excludes the
      guarantee of blood safety to the greatest extent.

      At present, the clinical pre-transfusion and pre-operative infectious disease screening in
      our country is still serological detection. The use of nucleic acid detection for infectious
      disease screening can better realize the significance of patients'
      pre-transfusion/pre-operative infectious disease screening. Therefore, this study will
      analyze the nucleic acid detection technology and clinical serological detection technology
      in order to solve three problems:

        -  Explore the best detection strategy for patients with pre-transfusion/pre-operative
           infectious disease screening; ② Explore the confirmation process of the gray area
           results of infectious disease serological testing; ③ Better realize the significance of
           screening for patients' infectious diseases.
