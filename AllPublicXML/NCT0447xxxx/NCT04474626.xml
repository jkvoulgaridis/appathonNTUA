  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to assess the safety and effectiveness of isoquercetin to
      reduce levels of soluble P-Selectin in patients with sickle cell disease. Isoquercetin is a
      naturally occurring flavonoid-or vitamin. You will find quercetin and isoquercetin in fruits
      and vegetables.

      The names of the study drug involved in this study are/is:

      - Isoquercetin
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase 2 study in adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) to assess the
      effect of oral isoquercetin on biomarkers of endothelial and platelet activation,
      inflammation and ongoing blood coagulation.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
           including evaluations and follow up visits.

             -  The names of the study drug involved in this study are/is: Isoquercetin

             -  Participants will receive study treatment for 1 year and will be followed for 30
                days after the last dose.

        -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
           safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in
           treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved isoquercetin as a treatment
           for any disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects require an established diagnosis of sickle cell disease/homozygous
             hemoglobin S (SCD-SS) or sickle cell disease hemoglobin β0-thalassemia (SCD-Sβ0-thal).

          -  Patients on other therapy including hydroxyurea will be included.

          -  Age 18-50 years.

          -  Participants must have preserved organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥2,000/mcL

               -  platelets ≥75,000/mcL

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with
                  creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          -  Subjects with no evidence of worsening over the last 4 weeks (e.g. any acute
             complication of SCD including but not limited to VOC, acute chest syndrome and stroke,
             that required unscheduled medical attention or intervention) as determined by the
             investigator will be included.

          -  Patients on anticoagulation therapy will be excluded.

          -  The effects of isoquercetin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of isoquercetin
             administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Please ensure exclusion criteria are clearly worded to describe participants who will
             not be eligible.

          -  Participants may not be concurrently receiving any other study agents.

          -  Subjects with no evidence of worsening over the last 1 month (e.g. any acute
             complication of SCD including but not limited to VOC, acute chest syndrome and stroke,
             that required unscheduled medical attention or intervention) as determined by the
             investigator will be included.

          -  Familial bleeding diathesis.

          -  Known diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

          -  Currently receiving anticoagulant therapy.

          -  Currently using daily use of aspirin (&gt;81mg daily), Clopidogrel (Plavix), cilostazol
             (Pletal), aspirin-dipyridamole (Aggrenox) (within 10 days)

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to isoquercetin.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit study compliance.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because isoquercetin is a PDI inhibitor
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment
             of the mother with isoquercetin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with isoquercetin. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used
             in this study.
