  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been proved that lithium carbonate can prolong slow wave sleep with few or no
      side-effects. The aim of the present study is to evaluate postoperative sleep quality of
      patients undergoing video assisted thoracic surgery taken 250mg lithium carbonate 6 hours
      after surgery.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled (randomized, parallel group, concealed
      allocation), double-blinded trial. All patients undergoing video assisted thoracic surgery
      during morning will be randomized 1:1 to the treatment intervention with lithium carbonate
      250mg (Baoqing, Hunan, China) or calcium carbonate 500mg (Reneed, Beijing, China) 6 hours
      after surgery. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the lithium carbonate 250mg on the
      first postoperative night sleep quality. The patients received standardized general
      anesthesia supplemented by paravertebral nerve block. The ultrasound-guided approach for
      paravertebral nerve block was used with the patient in the lateral decubitus position, and
      the paravertebral nerve block was administered at the T4-T6 level according to the incision
      protocol at our center. General anesthesia for maintenance of propofol anesthesia, total
      intravenous anesthesia was administered by using propofol (Fresenius Kabi, Austria GmbH) at a
      plasma target concentration (Marsh pharmacokinetic model software) of 2.5-4 μg/ml.
      Remifentanil (0.2-0.5 μg/kg/min, Renfu, Yichang, China) was given to all patients during the
      operation. All patients accepted patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with 1 μg ml-1
      sufentanil (Renfu, Yichang, China). Duration of sleep was defined as the duration of all
      bispectral index data below 80 in the 12 hours of monitoring (from 20:00pm to 06:00am).
