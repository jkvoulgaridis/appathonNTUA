  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) who
      were lost of follow up and relinkage them to hepatitis C care
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will review electronic medical charts to identify patients with HCV
      diagnosis. Next, investigators will evaluate if these patients are routinely followed by
      liver specialists at the Institution. Those patients who were lost of follow up will be
      reached to evaluate their disease and eventually offer them to restart HCV care.
