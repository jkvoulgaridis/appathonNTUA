    <measure>PROMIS Global--10 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From the pre-operative assessment until 3 years after the srugery</time_frame>
    <description>Enrolled subjects with total joint arthroplasty of hip and knee will be asked to complete an on-line (web-based) survey (PROMIS-10 global) using a computer. Most patients will only be asked to complete this survey over a maximum 3 year period. The PROMIS-10 Global consists of ten items that measure global physical health (GPH) and general mental health (GMH). The raw PROMIS scores are continuous and range from 4-20. The GPH and GMH scores are converted based on a T-Score Metric allowing for comparisons to a general population. A higher score indicates a better general health</description>

    <measure>Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement (HOOS, JR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the pre-operative assessment until 3 years after the srugery</time_frame>
    <description>The HOOS, JR is a 6-item instrument that includes 2 of the 5 subscales from the original HOOS (pain, and function and daily living). In the HOOS, JR questionnaire, pain is assessed by 2 items; and function and daily living is assessed by 4 items. These items were assigned a score 0-4 based on the options to the questions (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = extreme). A raw score is summed from the 6 items with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 24. High subscale and raw scores represent worse signs and symptoms. Subsequently, the raw summed score is converted to an interval score out of 100, where 0 represents total hip disability and 100 represents perfect hip health. Using the process, a HOOS, JR score was calculated for each patient included in our study from the original HOOS survey.</description>

    <measure>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the pre-operative assessment until 3 years after the srugery</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS, JR is a 7-item instrument that includes 3 of the 5 subscales from the original KOOS (symptoms, pain, and function and daily living). In the KOOS, JR questionnaire, stiffness/ symptom is assessed by 1 item; pain is assessed by 4 items; and function and daily living is assessed by 2 items. These items were assigned a score 0-4 based on the options to the questions (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = extreme). A raw score is summed from the 7 items with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 28. High subscale and raw scores represent worse signs and symptoms. Subsequently, the raw summed score is converted to an interval score out of 100, where 0 represents total knee disability and 100 represents perfect knee health. Using the process, a KOOS, JR score was calculated for each patient included in our study from the original KOOS survey.</description>
