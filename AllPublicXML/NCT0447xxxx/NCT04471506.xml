      PURPOSE:

      to determine the effect of aerobic exercise training on sex hormones , insulin resistance and
      depression and if is there correlation between these factors effect in postmenopausal obese
      women

      BACKGROUND:

      The practice of regular physical activity is recommended worldwide by different public health
      agencies for primary or secondary prevention of many health problems, including cancers. In
      particular, physical activity is associated with a 25 % reduction in the average risk of
      cardiovascular diseases among women, and this protective effect appears to be independent of
      menopausal status. Many interrelated biological mechanisms may underlie this association,
      such as the effect of physical activity on glucose metabolism, inflammation, immune function,
      and sex hormones. Indeed, endogenous sex hormones, particularly estrogens, seem to be
      involved in the initiation, promotion, and progression of tumors. Prolonged exposure to high
      endogenous hormone levels is considered one of the main risk factors for female breast
      cancer, with a relative risk of 2.00 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.47-2.71) for
      postmenopausal women with the highest estradiol levels . Several observational studies have
      found an inverse association between physical activity and circulating estrogen levels . This
      effect may be mediated by the decrease in fat mass, the main source of estrogens in
      postmenopausal women. It may also be mediated by the disruption of the menstrual cycle before
      menopause , especially when exercise is associated with low energy intakes. However, the
      assessment of the exposure to physical activity remains imprecise, because it is generally
      only possible to measure it in naturally living subjects using questionnaires

      .

      HYPOTHESES:

      may have no Correlation between sex hormones and insulin resistance and depression in
      response to exercises in postmenopausal obese women

      RESEARCH QUESTION:

      Is there Correlation between sex hormones and insulin resistance and depression in response
      to exercises in postmenopausal obese women?

      It is an interventional study in which 60 women estimated to enroll according to random
      allocation and assigned into two groups equal. The study group will receive aerobic exercises
      in addition to diet recommendations while the control group will receive diet
      recommendations. the aerobic exercises in form of treadmill training intensity of exercises
      high intensity, target heart rate (THR) will be 70-80% of heart maximum (HR MAX)time of
      session 40 min initial 10 min warm up exercises on treadmill in low intensity and active
      phase 20- 30 min intensity will increase until patient reach to THR then intensity decrease
      until session will be ended by cooling down phase for 10 min . The volunteers will perform
      exercises 3 times per week for 12 weeks .insulin resistance will be measured by HOMA -IR
      index and sex hormones (estradiol ,testosterone. sex hormone binding globin ) pre and post
      intervention and use zung self-rating depression scale to assess depression
