    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAGE-718 and
      its effects on cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor symptoms in participants with PD-MCI.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first administration of a study drug.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1, 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS scale consists of a baseline evaluation (at screening) that assesses the lifetime experience of participants with suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal behavior (SB) and a postbaseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last study visit. The C-SSRS includes 'yes' or 'no' responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet the following criteria for PD-MCI: Have a confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic PD
             according to 2015 Movement Disorder Society (MDS) clinical diagnostic criteria; Meet
             MDS Task Force Criteria for MCI in PD.

          2. Have a score of 20 to 25 (inclusive) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at
             Screening.

          3. Meet criteria for Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stage I to III (mild to moderate motor severity) at
             Screening.

          4. Have stable motor symptoms for at least 8 weeks, in the opinion of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a diagnosis of dementia of any etiology, including but not limited to: Dementia
             associated with PD (probable or possible), Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Alzheimer's
             Dementia, and Vascular Dementia.

          2. Have any indication of parkinsonism other than idiopathic PD.

          3. In the opinion of the investigator, be experiencing unpredictable fluctuations in
             motor and/or nonmotor symptoms associated with PD.

          4. Have a diagnosis of an ongoing central nervous system condition other than idiopathic
             PD, including active neurologic and/or nonremitted psychiatric disorders.

          5. Have a history of brain surgery, deep brain stimulation, a significant head injury
             causing loss of consciousness greater than 30 minutes, or hospitalization due to a
             brain injury.

          6. Have experienced psychotic symptoms within the past 3 months, including those
             associated with PD medications, as determined by a 'yes' answer to item A or item B on
             the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire completed during Screening.
