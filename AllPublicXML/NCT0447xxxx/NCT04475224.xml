    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At the time of consent (whether oral or written consent), the patient's age is over 18
             years old and under 89 years old

          -  Patients who have suffered a cervical spinal cord injury within the past 78 hours
             whose AIS classification was A at 66 - 78 hours after injury-Written informed consent
             has been obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The injury site is C1-C2 or C2-C3

          -  The patient cannot start rehabilitation necessary for recovery of function at an early
             stage, for example because tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, or mechanical ventilatory
             support is necessary

          -  It is predicted that it will not be possible to administer the first dose of the study
             drug within 78 hours after the cervical spinal cord injury

          -  A history of SCI (Spinal cord injury), or abnormal findings in the spinal cavity or
             marked breakdown of the meninges other than SCI

          -  Efficacy and safety cannot be evaluated properly due to such as concurrent multiple
             external trauma or concurrent organ injury

          -  High dose steroid therapy administered for spinal cord injury

          -  Disease such as serious liver disorder, renal disease, heart disease, blood dyscrasia,
             metabolic disease, or infections requiring systemic therapy

          -  History of malignant tumor

          -  Participation in a clinical study or research of pharmaceuticals or medical devices
             within 1 month before registration

          -  Drug allergies to drugs that will be (or may be) used

          -  Administration of the study drug to the site of spinal cord injury is inappropriate
             for a reason such as intrathecal infection or intrathecal mass

          -  Problems with the subject's ability to give informed consent in person

          -  The subject is breastfeeding or possibly pregnant

          -  The subject cannot be expected to survive more than 180 days after the start of
             administration of the study drug, in the judgement of the investigator

          -  It is inappropriate for the subject to be included in the study, in the judgement of
             the investigator
