  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of TP-03, an eyedrop, to its
      vehicle control for the treatment of blepharitis due to Demodex, a microscopic mite
      frequently found in human hair follicles. The hypothesis for the study is the proportion of
      participants cured at Day 43 with treatment by TP-03 ophthalmic solution is greater than the
      proportion cured by treatment with its vehicle.

      This Phase 2b/3 study is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, double-masked, parallel trial
      to compare the safety and efficacy of TP-03 to vehicle control for the treatment of Demodex
      blepharitis. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of 0.25%
      TP-03 compared to its vehicle from Day 1 to Day 43 in adult participants with mild to severe
      Demodex blepharitis. The primary efficacy endpoint will be cure based upon collarettes.
      Safety will be determined by assessing adverse effects related to the treatment as well as
      evaluating any changes in visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit lamp biomicroscopy and
      dilated ophthalmoscopy findings.
