      The effect of combination of hydrodilatation, corticosteroid injection, and joint
      mobilization for treatment of frozen shoulder, compared with general physical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frozen shoulder (FS) is a common clinical problem which induces pain, loss of passive and
      active range of motion (ROM) of glenohumeral joint, and leads to disability, functional
      limitation, and decreasing quality of life. FS is usually treated with conservative
      treatments, which include medications, physiotherapy, joint mobilization, hydrodilatation,
      intra-articular steroid injection, etc.. The short-term effect of each treatment is variable,
      and the long-term effect is not established. Clinically combination of each treatment is
      common, but types of combination, and the effect of combination is still not well studied. We
      aim to combine hydrodilatation (with corticosteroid injection), joint mobilization, and
      general physiotherapy to treat frozen shoulder and compare the long-term effect with general
      physical therapy alone.

      This is a prospective single-blind randomized controlled trial. 70 participants will be
      recruited from the outpatient clinic of the department of Physical Medicine and
      Rehabilitation of Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital and randomly divided into COMB group
      and PT group. Each subject in the COMB group will receive 2 times of ultrasound-guided
      hydrodilatation injection (10mg triamcilonone, 2cc 1% xylocain, and 17cc normal saline)
      through both anterior and posterior shoulder joint in a two-weekly interval. In addition,
      joint mobilization and general physiotherapy (stretch exercise and physical modalities) will
      also be given, 2 times a week, for 8 weeks. The PT group will receive general physical
      therapy, 2 times a week, for 8 weeks. Outcome measures include the Shoulder Pain and
      Disability Index (SPADI), the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ), and active and passive
      range of motion (ROM) of the affected shoulder, the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36),
      and patients' self evaluation. Evaluation will be performed at baseline and at 2, 4, 6 months
      after the beginning of the treatment. Statistics will be performed after completing the
      patients' treatment and evaluations. We expect that the COMB group will recover sooner and
      better than the PT group.

    <measure>Visual analog scale（VAS）</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS for pain is obtained using a 100-mm-long horizontal line, with 0 mm on the left, indicating no pain, and 100 mm on the right, indicating very severe pain. The pain at rest is defined as rest pain, and pain on maximal abduction of the affected shoulder is defined as activity pain. The reliability of VAS for pain is 0.94, but in the absence of a criterion standard for pain, criterion validity cannot be evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion（ROM）</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>All the 4 planes of ROM will be measured. It includes abduction in the frontal plane, forward flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation with the arm at 0° of abduction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Disability Questionnaire（SDQ）</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The SDQ is a pain-related questionnaire that contains 16 items describing common situations that may induce symptoms in patients with shoulder disorders. The response options are &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; and &quot;not applicable.&quot; The final score is calculated by dividing the number of positively scored items by the total number of applicable items and then multiplying this number by 100, which results in a final score ranging between 0 (no disability) and 100 (the worst possible condition).</description>

    <measure>The 36-item Short Form Health Survey（SF-36）</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a generic measure of quality of life and is composed of 8 subscales related to the following components: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each subscale generates a score from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate better health.</description>

    <description>Patients in the Comb group will receive hydrodilatation of the affected shoulder and subdeltoid bursa injection for 2 times in 2-week interval. Patients also receive mobilization exercise and conventional physical therapy (including physical modalities and stretch exercise), 3 times a week, for 8 weeks.
The injectates for hydrodilation include 10mg triamcinolone, 2cc 1% xylocaine, and 17cc normal saline for both posterior and anterior shoulder joint injection. 10mg triamcinolone and 2cc 1% xylocaine will also be injected into the subdeltoid bursa of the affected shoulder. All injections will be performed under ultrasound guidance. For shoulder joint injection, ａ21 gauge, 3-inch needle will be used; and a 22 gauge, 1.5 inch needle will be applied for subdeltoid bursa injection.</description>
