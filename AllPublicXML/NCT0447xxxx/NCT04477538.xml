  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the physical well-being Q-score derived from the BREAST-Q between the two groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of study (estimated to be 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The physical well-being module is one of the domains of the BREAST-Q that can be administered in isolation. Patients answer specific questions with answers that range from 1-4 to 1-5. Upon completion of this component of the survey, a physical well-being-specific numerical score is generated. This is then converted, based on previously published Rasch-modeling to generate a Q-score whose values range from 0-100. This same approach is used for all other domains of the BREAST-Q. Pre- versus postoperative Q-scores for physical well-being can be directly compared to study the impact of surgery on physical well-being. Similarly, the physical-well-being domain can be readministered to provide a longitudinal assessment of physical function over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of study (estimated to be 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-The satisfaction with outcome module is one of the domains of the BREAST-Q. Patients answer specific questions with answers that range from 1-3. Upon completion of this component of the survey, a specific numerical score is generated. This is then converted, based on previously published Rasch-modeling to generate a Q-score whose values range from 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with breasts</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of study (estimated to be 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-The satisfaction with breast module is one of the domains of the BREAST-Q. Patients answer specific questions with answers that range from 1-4. Upon completion of this component of the survey, a specific numerical score is generated. This is then converted, based on previously published Rasch-modeling to generate a Q-score whose values range from 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Upper extremity function as measured by PROMIS Upper Extremity Short Form 7a</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of study (estimated to be 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Questions regarding upper extremity function as reported by patient. Answers range from 5=without any difficulty to 1=unable to do. The total score ranges from 5-35.</description>
