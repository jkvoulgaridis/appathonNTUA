    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to determine the effect of respiratory physiotherapy applied on
      stroke diagnosis, balance, respiratory functions and respiratory muscle strength in addition
      to neurodevelopmental treatment in patients with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study will include individuals aged 40-75 years, diagnosed with ischemic or hemorrhagic
      stroke, who applied to the Kırıkkale University Faculty of Medicine physical therapy and
      rehabilitation clinic. After the patients are separated according to the specified exclusion
      and inclusion criteria, they will be divided into 3 groups using the &quot;Online Random
      Allocation Software&quot; program. Evaluations will be made before and after treatment.

      In addition to normal neurodevelopmental therapy (NGT) 5 days a week, respiratory
      physiotherapy will be applied. The total duration of treatment will take 6 weeks.

        1. Neurodevelopmental treatment program (BOBATH treatment approach) will be applied to the
           group.

        2. The group will have a neurodevelopmental treatment program (BOBATH treatment approach)
           and diaphragmatic breathing exercises.

        3. The group will have a neurodevelopmental treatment program (BOBATH treatment approach)
           and respiratory muscle training with the THRESHOLD IMT device.

      Inspiratory Muscle Training Program with Threshold IMT device: Constant pressure is applied
      to the inspiration phase during application. The training group is started from 40% of MIP
      and inspiratory muscle training is given. In practice, patients are asked to sit in a loose
      position on the upper chest and shoulders. After the nose clip is attached, the patient is
      instructed to tighten his lips around the mouthpiece of the instrument, making inspiration
      and expiration. After eight breathing cycles, she is asked to do 1-2 respiratory controls.

      Diaphragmatic breathing exercise: The patient is given a supine position, a pillow is placed
      under his knees and head. The patient is asked to place his right hand in the upper abdomen
      and his left hand in the upper part of his chest. The patient is told to take a slow and deep
      breath through the nose until four counts, and to hold the air in for the breathing time, and
      then to the patient, shrinking his lips like a whistle, and exhaling his breath for a long
      time. Exercises are performed two hours after meals, initially as short as 2-3 minutes,
      within 10 minutes of the patient's tolerance, with an average of 30 minutes per day.

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It was used to determine the cognitive state before the training. The Mini-Mental State Test was first published by Folstein et al. It consists of eleven items under 5 main headings: orientation, record memory, attention and calculation, recall and language, and the total score is evaluated over 30 points. The ideal threshold value of the Mini-Mental State Test was found to be 24.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This test is applied to assess the risk of falling and mobility.This test starts with the individual leaving the chair without receiving arm support by giving the go command while sitting in a chair.The distance of 3 meters is asked to return and sit again in the chair.The elapsed time is recorded in seconds.</description>

    <description>Subjects will asked to stand comfortably, to make a fist, and to raise their arm until it was parallel to the yardstick (position 1). The placement of the end of the third metacarpal along the yardstick will recorded. Subjects will then asked to reach as far forward as they could without losing their balance (position 2), and the position of the end of the third metacarpal along the yardstick will again recorded. No attempt will make to control the subject's method of reach, but if he will touch the wall or took a step during the maneuver, that trial will consider invalid and repeated</description>

    <description>The group will have a neurodevelopmental treatment program (BOBATH treatment approach) and respiratory muscle training with the THRESHOLD IMT device. T-IMT is an instrument that provides the same pressure in each breath for the strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles, regardless of the patient's rapid or slow breathing. This device provides a constant pressure in inspiration with its flow-free one-way valve. It also has an adjustable device pressure. The tool consists of pressure section, mouthpiece and nose clip. During application, constant pressure is applied to the inspiration phase. The training group is started from 40% of MIP and inspiratory muscle training is given. In practice, patients are asked to sit in a loose position on the upper chest and shoulders. After eight breathing cycles, 1-2 respiratory controls are requested</description>
