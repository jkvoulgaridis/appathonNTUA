  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inside of studies that report an upper airway function impaired, the upper limb strength has
      been demonstrated to be determinant in breath, speech and swallow performance. Nevertheless,
      no previous studies in neuromuscular disease have explored the relation between general
      disability and upper airway function.

      There is a suspicion of upper airway which is associated with physical deterioration, however
      the extent to which if feeds back has not been explored.
