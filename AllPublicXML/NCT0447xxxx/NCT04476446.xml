    <textblock>
      The purpose of this expanded access program (EAP) is to provide expanded access to esketamine
      treatment and collect additional safety data and quality of life until esketamine is
      commercially available for participants with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD).

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome, designed for self-completion by respondents. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems. Where Level 1: no problem, Level 2: slight problems, Level 3: moderate problems, Level 4: severe problems and Level 5: extreme problems).</description>

             available and the participant must be unable to participate in a clinical trial; for
             example, because they do not fulfill the eligibility criteria of the protocol or there

             have had nonresponse to 2 or more oral antidepressant (of the same or a different
             class) treatments in the current episode of depression confirmed by documented medical
             history and/or pharmacy/prescription records i.e., treatments were prescribed in
             adequate dosages for adequate duration with affirmation of treatment adherence, to
             meet criteria for TRD, and have failed at least one augmentation/combination strategy
             and have failed an adequate course (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 7 sessions) of, or
             have a contraindication/no access or refuses electro‐convulsive therapy (ECT)

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta‐human chorionic
