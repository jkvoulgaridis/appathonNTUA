      Regulatory T (Tregs) cells play an important role in the maintenance of immunological
      tolerance. It decrease in the peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Vitamin D
      has an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect in rheumatoid arthritis.

      Vitamin D supplementation significantly enhances Tregs percentage in the peripheral blood of
      RA patients. So supplementation of Vit D improves rheumatoid arthritis disease activity.

      Background: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the maintenance of
      immunological tolerance, so Tregs deficiency or decrease suppressor functions may be
      associated with development of autoimmune diseases.

      Vitamin D is essential for normal bone mineralization and growth, prevention of osteopenia,
      osteoporosis, and nonspecific painful musculoskeletal conditions . Vitamin D is thought to
      have an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions, as its receptors are widely expressed
      in peripheral mononuclear blood cells, also its deficiency associated with several autoimmune
      disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis

      Methods: 40 patients with active RA were randomly assigned into two groups. Group I received
      MTX plus hydroxychloroquine, group II received MTX and hydroxychloroquine plus vitamin D
      supplementation for 3 months, in addition to 30 healthy volunteers as control group.
      Peripheral blood Tregs were measured by Flow Cytometry.

      Statistical Analysis. The collected data analyzed by SPSS software (version 16). The range,
      mean and standard deviation were calculated for quantitative variables. Categorical variables
      were expressed as number and percentages; Chi square was used as a test of their
      significance. Skewness, kurtosis; Shapiro-Wilk, and The Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to
      test the normality for the data. The difference between two means was analyzed using the
      students (t) test (paired and unpaired samples- T tests). Significance was considered at
      p&lt;0.05.

    <description>4 ml of heparinized blood from the subjects' peripheral blood was collected. Human peripheral blood natural regulatory T cells (Tregs) were surface stained with Mouse Anti-Human CD4 FITC (Fluorescein) conjugated Monoclonal Antibody and Mouse Anti-Human IL‑2 Rα/CD25 APC (allophycocyanin) conjugated Monoclonal Antibody, followed by intracellular staining using Rabbit Anti-Human/ Mouse FoxP3 PE (phycoerythrin) conjugated Antigen Affinity-purified Monoclonal Antibody, cells were fixed and permeabilized with FoxP3 Fixation &amp; Permeabilization Buffer Kit. Cells were gated on lymphocytes.</description>
