  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of molar incisor hypomineralization is relatively high. It has been reported
      that MIH-affected children experience a wide range of negative impacts because of having
      visible enamel opacities on their incisors whether these teeth show post eruptive breakdown
      or not. The management of MIH is challenging with a broad spectrum of treatment modalities
      being available. However, there are no clear guidelines available to aid in clinical decision
      making. Possible treatment options for anterior teeth with MIH include: Microabrasion, resin
      infiltration, tooth bleaching, etch-bleach and seal technique and composite restorations or
      veneers. It is believed that these methods could be used alone or in a combination of methods
      to achieve better aesthetic results.

      For MIH affected-incisors microabrasion and resin infiltration are acceptable treatment
      options which could be used alone or in a combination. Accordingly, the aim of this study is
      to compare the clinical outcomes of using resin infiltration either alone or combined with
      microabrasion for the management of MIH affected incisors.

      The study will be conducted on a dental unit in postgraduate clinic of Pediatric Dentistry
      and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University, Egypt.The
      primary hypothesis of this study is that a resin infiltration and microabrasion combined
      treatment will result in better clinical outcomes than using resin infiltration alone. All
      treatment procedures will be carried out by the principal investigator.

      36 patients will be included in the study. The teeth will be randomized into two groups
      according to the intervention. The study involves two types of interventions:

      Group 1 (resin infiltration):

      The treatment will follow the manufacturer's instructions (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany). The
      procedure involves the application of Icon-Etch, Icon-Dry as well as Icon-Infiltrant.
      Followed by removal of excess and then polishing of the treated surfaces.

      Group 2 (Micro-abrasion followed by resin infiltration):

      The Micro-abrasion agent (Opalustre, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) will be applied to the
      tooth for 60 seconds using a standard rubber cup attached to a low speed hand piece followed
      by rinsing the tooth surface with water for 20 seconds. This procedure will be repeated up to
      5 times.

      Resin infiltration will then be carried out as discussed before.

      Vita Easyshade Advance® spectrophotometer (Vita Zahnfabrik, Sackingen, Germany) will be used
      to evaluate the masking color of the teeth selected in the study.

      Measurements will be taken before, immediately after, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12
      months after treatment.

      A standardized Photograph will be taken at 5 different times (before treatment, immediately
      afterwards, one month, 6 months and 12 months after treatment with the exact same camera and
      conditions. The images collected will be analyzed and evaluated by 2 different dentists.

    <description>Vita Easyshade Advance® spectrophotometer (Vita Zahnfabrik, Sackingen, Germany) will be used to evaluate the change in color of the teeth selected in the study before and after the treatment. L*, a*, and b* values will be recorded for each tooth based on the CIEL*a* b* color space. The value of color differences or color masking (∆E) will be clinically evaluated by the formula ∆E=[(∆L*)2+(∆a*)2+(∆b*). Color readings will be taken before, immediately after, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in the patient's oral health related quality of life following the treatment: Child Perceptions Questionnaire CPQ 8-10/11-14</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It includes evaluating the patient's Oral Health Related Quality of life (OHRQoL) before and after treatment which is measured as difference in the scores of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire CPQ 8-10/11-14 before and after treatment. There are 36 items included in the questionnaire covering four different domains: oral symptoms, function related limitations as well as emotional and social well-being. The participants should answer regarding the frequency of certain events in the last six months. There are 5 responses to choose from: 0 = Never, 1 = Once or twice, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often and 4 = Every day or almost every day. The total score should range from 0 to 144. Higher scores indicate low oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL).</description>
