  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, twin-center, cohort study in patients discharged from the hospital
      after major abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery for cancer. This study is designed to evaluate
      the adherence to extended deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (DVT) with the direct oral
      anticoagulant apixaban on the background of historical data from the investigator's center on
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) substandard adherence in the same setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All guidelines have embraced the concept of extended DVT prophylaxis after major abdominal or
      pelvic surgery for cancer, but the recommendation is consistently to use LMWH, which is more
      complicated than orally available prophylaxis, more expensive and has poor adherence.

      The patients will be identified in the pre-operative admission or in post-operative orders as
      potentially eligible for extended prophylaxis. On the day of discharge a research assistant
      or a research nurse will approach the patient, provide information about the study and obtain
      written consent if the patient fulfills the eligibility criteria.

      Each patient will be asked to take apixaban until postop day 29±1 and will be followed until
      postop day 90±3. The total duration of the study from first patient in to last patient out is
      expected to take 12 months.

      At 1 week after discharge there is a telephone contact to ask about any side effects from
      apixaban or bleeding events or signs of thromboembolism and to answer any questions from the
      patient.

      At postoperative Day +28-30 there is a telephone contact to ask about side effects, bleeding,
      signs of venous thromboembolism (VTE), until what date the patient has taken apixaban and
      estimate of missed doses using a standardized script. If the patient is still taking it,
      instruction will be given to discontinue. Self-reported modified Morisky Medication Adherence
      scale with 6 statements will be used At 90 days ±3 days there is the last telephone contact
      to ask about bleeding events or signs of VTE. The study is complete for the patient. At the
      time of Visit 4 the pharmacy that the patient uses will be contacted to provide dispensing
      record for apixaban, in order to verify that the patient filled the prescription.
