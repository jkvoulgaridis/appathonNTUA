      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib
      in in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma failed from second
      line chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed /refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma usually have a bad
      prognosis. These patients cannot be treated successfully with the conventional chemotherapy
      of CHOP. Apatinib is a new type of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR-2. Some
      studies have shown that the combination of low-dose apatinib and camrelizumab shows a
      synergistic effect in the exploration of multiple solid tumors, and the adverse reactions of
      low-dose apatinib are significantly reduced, and the patients are well tolerated.The
      investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with
      apatinib in the patients with relapsed refractory diffuse large B cell lymphomafailed from
      second line chemotherapy.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

             hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibodies at screening
             stage must pass further detection of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA titer (no more than
             2500 copies/mL or 500 IU/mL) and HCV RNA (no more than the lower limit of the
             detection method) in the row. In addition to active hepatitis B or hepatitis C

             their risk of receiving research drug treatment, or confuse their judgment on toxic
             reactions;
