  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multi-center prospective observational study, the investigators plan to identify the
      incidence and risk factors for checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury and characterize
      biochemical, genetic, immunological, and histological features associated with it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ChILI) is a new incompletely understood category
      of hepatotoxicity which is distinct from other types of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) such
      as direct or idiosyncratic DILI. The data regarding the incidence and risk factors is
      lacking. Therefore, 'in-depth phenotyping' together with data from the control group exposed
      to checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) is necessary to develop refined algorithms incorporating
      CPI-related factors, host genetic and environmental risk factors that would enable
      pre-empting ChILI.

      The aim of the study is to enroll two deeply phenotyped cohorts (patients who developed ChILI
      and patients who are starting checkpoint inhibitors) and obtain biological samples at
      multiple time points.

      -  Collection and storage of biological samples (blood, urine, stool) from patients with
           ChILI at three-time points (the day of liver injury, 1 week, and 1 month after). The
           investigators will perform a liver biopsy when it is clinically indicated.

        -  Collection and storage of biological samples (blood, urine, and stool) from control
           patients at two-time points (before starting CPIs and 6 to14 weeks after commencing
           treatment)

        ChILI group:

        Adults with cancer receiving checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD L1 inhibitor) as
        monotherapy or combination (without chemotherapy) and developed acute liver injury
        secondary to checkpoint inhibitor.

        Control Group:

        Patients with malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer or any
        other cancer, receiving single or combination therapy using checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Both patient groups and control group:

        â€¢ Able to give written informed consent OR Potential participants who have developed
        encephalopathy related to ChILI as a response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, who lack the
        capacity to give written informed consent and have a consultee (personal or nominated) -
        for ChILI patient group only

        ChILI group:

        Patients who developed checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury and meet the following
        criteria:

          1. Meets one of the following analytical thresholds at enrolment (visit 1)

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) OR

               -  ALT exceeding 3 times ULN plus bilirubin exceeding 2 times ULN OR

               -  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) exceeding 2 times ULN with accompanying elevations of
                  gamma-glutamyl transferase in the absence of known bone metastases driving the
                  rise in ALP level

          2. Absence of other known causes of liver injury after detailed investigations

        Patients who developed ChILI but did not meet the above criteria at enrolment or who were
        found to have a different cause for their liver injury after further investigations will be
        excluded from the analysis

        Control group:

        Consecutive patients with cancer who have a clinical indication to start checkpoint
        inhibitors. A small proportion of patients will develop ChILI following their checkpoint
        inhibitor treatment and will be classified as cases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy concurrently with checkpoint
             inhibitors.

          -  On the judgment of chief investigator that the person has certain alternative
             explanations to the acute event (rather than ChILI).
