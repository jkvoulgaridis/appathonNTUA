  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tear is one of the most common shoulder diseases and conservative treatment is
      commonly used for tears involving ≤50% of tendon thickness. Since conventional conservative
      treatments are not fundamental to repair tendon tissue, there is growing need of new therapy
      for improving structural outcome. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of allogeneic
      fibroblasts on partial-thickness rotator cuff tear. The primary outcome is the change of ASES
      after 24 weeks TPX-115 injection. The secondary outcomes are pain VAS, functional evaluations
      including ROM, Constant score, ASES score and SST at 4, 12 and 24 week and structural
      evaluation on MRI at 24 week.
