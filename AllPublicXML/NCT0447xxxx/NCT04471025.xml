  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to compare the block characteristics of the single operator &quot;jedi
      grip&quot; technique and the conventional double operator technique.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing hand, wrist, elbow and forearm surgery randomly assigned two groups
      (Group I: Jedi grip and Group II: Conventional double operator technique). By a blind
      observer, the block characteristics were evaluated and recorded .

    <description>Sensory blockage was evaluated and graded; from lateral to the forearm, the volar face of the thumb, volar face of the 5th finger and lateral side of the hand back; for musculocutaneous, median, ulnar and radial nerves, respectively. Graduation was according to a previously validated 3-point scale using a cold test: 0 = no block, 1 = analgesia (patient can feel touch, not cold), and 2 = anesthesia (patient cannot feel touch)</description>

    <description>blockage was evaluated and graded; with elbow flexion, thumb abduction, thumb opposition, thumb adduction for musculocutaneous, radial, median, ulnar nerves respectively. Motor blockage graduation was also according to a (validated) 3-point scale: 0 = no block, 1 = paresis and 2 = paralysis.</description>

    <description>USG guided infraclavicular block was applied to patients either by conventional two-person technique or by one person Jedi technique according to the allocated group. On Group I single operator controlled the probe with one hand while controlling the needle and the syringe on the other hand with the Jedi technique. The needle was held between the index finger and the middle phalanx of the middle finger, and the syringe was held with fingers 4 and 5, with the plunger part to the thumb in the palm. On Group II, operator used the probe and needle with different hands while an assistant controlling the syringe to aspirate or inject local anesthetic.</description>
