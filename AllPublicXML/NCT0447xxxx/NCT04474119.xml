    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical study to compare
      the clinical efficacy and safety of KN046 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus placebo plus
      paclitaxel and carboplatin in subjects with advanced squamous NSCLC who have not previously
      received systemic treatment.

          -  Has measurable disease.

          -  Has not received prior systemic treatment for their advanced/metastatic NSCLC.

          -  Can provide tumor tissue.

          -  Has a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Status.

          -  Has adequate organ function

          -  If female of childbearing potential, have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to first trial treatment;

          -  If female of childbearing potential or a male subject with a partner with childbearing
             potential, be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception (with a
             failure rate of less than 1.0% per year) from first study treatment to 24 weeks after
             completion of the trial treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Untreated active CNS metastasis or leptomeningeal metastasis.

          -  Is currently participating and receiving an investigational drug or has participated
             in a study of an investigational drug within 4 weeks or within 5 times of half-life
             (no less than 2 weeks), whichever is shorter prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment;

          -  Has received other anti-tumor treatment, including traditional Chinese medicine which
             has approved anti-tumor indication within 4 weeks or within 5 times of half-life (no
             less than 2 weeks), whichever is shorter prior to the first trial treatment;

          -  Major surgery for any reason, except diagnostic biopsy, within 4 weeks of the first
             administration of trial treatment and/or if the subject has not fully recovered from
             the surgery within 4 weeks of the first administration of trial treatment;

          -  Curative radiation within 3 months of the first dose of trial treatment. Radiation to
             more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation should not be used
             within 4 weeks prior to the first administration of trial treatment;

          -  Subjects receiving immunosuppressive agents (such as steroids) for any reason should
             be tapered off these drugs before initiation of trial treatment (with the exception of
             subjects with adrenal insufficiency, who may continue corticosteroids at physiologic
             replacement doses, equivalent to &lt; 10 mg prednisone daily, inhaled steroids and
             topical use of steroids);

          -  Has interstitial lung disease, or a history of pneumonitis that required oral or
             intravenous glucocorticoids to assist with management;

          -  History or current active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an
             immunostimulatory agent

          -  Previous malignant disease

          -  History of uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Prior therapy with any antibody/drug targeting T cell coregulatory proteins

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to antibody drug

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding;

          -  Other medical conditions that at the discretion of investigator interfere with the
