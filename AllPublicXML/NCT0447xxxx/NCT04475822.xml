  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing all over the world, which is
      largely related to the increasing obesity population and the current inactive lifestyle of
      human beings. It is a common problem facing public health and clinical practice.Metabolic
      syndrome is an accumulation of biologically metabolic risk factors related to cardiovascular
      disease and diabetes, including glucose metabolism disorders, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
      obesity (especially central obesity).Researchers believe that the common pathological basis
      of these manifestations is insulin resistance, which is generally considered to be a
      reduction in the biological effects of insulin compared with the normal biological effects of
      expected biological phenomena.Nowadays, there are more and more studies on insulin resistance
      in the world. We have known that age, poor living and eating habits, high blood fat, high
      blood sugar and stress all lead to insulin resistance.

      The researchers hope to reduce weight, reduce body fat rate, improve body fat distribution
      and insulin resistance, reverse abnormal metabolic indicators, and ultimately reduce the
      incidence of chronic diseases in patients with metabolic syndrome through the intervention of
      lifestyle and diet habits in the early stage of the disease.

    <description>According to the definition of low carbon diet given by R. D. Feinman et al. (Nutrition, 2015), the daily carbohydrate intake of participants in this group was limited to 130g/ D, and the recommended diet was formulated according to the standard and combined with the local eating habits in Xi 'an, and dietary habit education was conducted. Participants could eat according to the recommended diet.</description>
