  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is defined according to the Berlin definition (1)
      as diffuse lung damage occurring in patients with a predisposing risk factor.

      Positioning in the prone position (PP) has been shown to decrease mortality in patients with
      moderate to severe ARDS.

      However, this technique is not without deleterious effects such as ventilator-associated
      pneumonia, endotracheal tube obstruction, development of pressure ulcers, and increased
      workload for the caregivers.

      There are other positioning techniques such as the &quot;upright&quot; position, which simulates a
      relative verticality, which allows to increase the effects of the prone position and even in
      some patients to improve oxygenation without the PP in the acute phase of ARDS.

      However, given the revolution caused by the use of PP in ARDS patients, verticalization have
      not been studied in more details.

      Today, there is a bed on the market that allows patients to be truly upright without having
      to transfer them to a tilt table.

      The investigators believe that raising ARDS patients in the acute phase is safe and feasible
      in routine practice. In this research protocol comparing PP and verticalization in a
      crossover trial design in acute ARDS patients, the investigators want to show that this
      technique can be safe and feasible, with the same effects on oxygenation as PP.

      Cross-over study, according to 4 preset sequences of 4 periods and randomly assigned. All
      patients will thus have the classic positioning technique (PP), as well as the technique
      under study (verticalization). For simplicity, the investigators will use the term
      &quot;verticalization&quot; even if the final positioning that is targeted is only a
      &quot;pseudo-verticalization&quot; to a 55° angle. The cross-over scheme with 4 sequences of 4 periods
      allows to get rid of the first order carry-over effect.

      Progressive verticalization protocol in 7 steps from the strict supine position to a 55°
      inclination of the raising bed, according to the clinical responses of the patient with ARDS,
      as follows:

      - Verticalization in the bed

      The verticalization maneuver will take place in 7 steps of 15 minutes maximum each:

      S1. The first one corresponds to the flat position (strict dorsal decubitus) S2. The second
      is the positioning of the patient at 25° of inclination. S3. The third is the 45° positioning
      S4. The fourth at 55°, which corresponds to the greatest inclination imposed to the patient.

      S5. The fifth corresponds to the 45° return S6. The sixth is the return to 25° S7. Finally,
      the investigators reposition the patient flat back.

      Examinations:

        -  Arterial Gazometry At the beginning, at the end and one hour after each positioning
           technique.

        -  Chest ultrasound

        -  Others All adverse events will be recorded in a clear and detailed manner.

    <description>The randomly selected study sequence (Arm1, Arm2, Arm3 or Arm4) will begin after the supine roll-over at the end of the first PP session (out-of-study sequence). This allows all patients to initially have the positioning technique that has been proven beneficial in ARDS.
The chronology of the treatment periods in each of the 4 arms allocated by randomization will be as follows: Each PP must be started within 4 to 8 hours after the end of the previous PP or after the end of the verticalization that just preceded it. Each verticalization must be performed within 4 to 8 hours after the end of the previous PP or the previous verticalization. Each PP period will last between 12 and 20 hours.</description>
