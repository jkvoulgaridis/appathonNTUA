  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some cognitive impairment in patients with bipolar depression. THINC-it is a simple,
      fast and free cognitive assessment tool. It has good reliability and validity in patients
      with depression, but its application in patients with bipolar depression is not clear. The
      purpose of this study is to verify the reliability and validity of THINC-it cognitive test in
      bipolar depression, and to further explore the difference of cognitive impairment between
      attack and remission of bipolar depression, so as to provide empirical research basis for
      clinical evaluation-based treatment.

      There is some cognitive impairment in patients with bipolar depression. THINC-it is a simple,
      fast and free cognitive assessment tool. It has good reliability and validity in patients
      with depression, but its application in patients with bipolar depression is not clear.

      This study includes three steps.

        1. baseline: demographic data, sequential test THINC-it and standard test tools, clinical
           scale evaluation, to verify the discriminant validity and parallel validity of THINC-it
           in bipolar depression.

        2. follow-up (1 week): 30-50 patients with stable bipolar depression were evaluated by
           clinical scale and THINC-it test to verify the test-retest reliability of THINC-it in
           bipolar depression.

        3. follow-up (8 weeks): all patients with bipolar depression were evaluated by clinical
           scale, THINC-it test, longitudinal comparison data, and the influencing factors of
           cognitive impairment were analyzed.
