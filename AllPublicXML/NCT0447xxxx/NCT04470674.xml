    <textblock>
      This is a two arm, randomized, phase II study of patients with advanced KRAS mutation
      positive and PD-L1 high NSCLC who have not received therapy for advanced stage disease.
      Patients will be randomized between Arm A and Arm B treatment. Arm A treatment will consist
      of durvalumab every 4 weeks for 13 cycles. Arm B treatment will consist of durvalumab with
      chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by durvalumab with pemetrexed every 3 weeks
      for 13 cycles.
