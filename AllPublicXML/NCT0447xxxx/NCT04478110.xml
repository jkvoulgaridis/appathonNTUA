  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Korean Americans report the lowest and declined rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening,
      compared to general population in the United States. The present study aimed to evaluate the
      efficacy of a community-based multifaceted intervention designed to improve CRC screening
      among Korean Americans.

    <description>The interactive group education was aimed to increase participant overall understanding of CRC, screening methods, and utilization of available resources such as home test kit and navigation services, with the ultimate goal of increasing screening rates. Clinical partners provided clinical support and ensured successful screening assessment and follow-ups by offering more flexible hours of clinic operation with bilingual medical staff on site. Patient navigation assistance was also offered based on participants' needs. The range of assistance included scheduling appointments with clinical partners for sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy for screening and diagnosis after a FIT positive result, assisting paper.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group received a group education session in a similar format with that of the intervention group delivered by trained Korean community health educators. Different from the intervention group, the education focused on general health education and primary prevention issues, including routine health examinations and screening for various diseases such as cancer.
