  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to look at blood sugar changes during chemotherapy using a
      continuous blood sugar monitoring device. The device uses patches that attach to the skin on
      the back of the arm to measure blood sugar changes for the duration of the chemotherapy
      course. Each patch lasts for about 2-weeks. During chemotherapy visits, new patches will be
      placed and will be worn until the chemotherapy course is complete. Participants will be in
      this study for 6 months. Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled in this study.
