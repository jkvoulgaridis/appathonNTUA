  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a tool to facilitate self-management for children with
      medical complexity (complex, multisystem chronic diseases) called MyChildCMC (My Child's
      Complex Medical Condition). MyChildCMC is an online, phone application (app) that engages
      parents daily in ongoing monitoring of common, crosscutting acute symptoms, including
      respiratory distress, inadequate feeding/fluid intake, fever, altered mental status, pain,
      and seizure status. The MyChildCMC app also guides parents to recognize early warning signs
      for health deteriorations to avoid acute events (i.e., ED visits and/or hospitalizations).

      Parent comments during the development of the MyChildCMC application revealed that the tool
      had potential in helping them manage their child's chronic conditions. This study will be the
      first to explore if online home monitoring using online technology is feasible, scalable, and
      can lead to improved CMC outcomes. This pilot feasibility trial for the MyChildCMC app will
      determine app feasibility and if successful, our approach will be a model for improving CMC
      care and reducing costs for families and children with medical complexity. Future MyChildCMC
      trials will integrate care coordination and a more robust alert system to help facilitate
      care and follow-up for patients.

      Aim: Investigators will assess the impact of the MyChildCMC app by comparing outcomes for the
      child and caregiver with the following outcomes:

        1. Child Quality of Life (QOL)

        2. Child Hospital and Emergency Department (ED) admissions

        3. Parent/Caregiver satisfaction with care

        4. Study participation rate

        5. Retention of intervention (intervention arm only)

        6. Adherence of intervention (intervention arm only)

    <description>Parents/patients randomized into the MyChildCMC Intervention Group will use the MyChildCMC app to monitor their child's daily symptoms for the duration of the study period (3 months). The MyChildCMC app includes a daily form consisting of 12 questions assessing child's vitals, pain, seizures, mood, and feeding as well as caregiver worry for the day. Daily reminders are sent to the parent to fill out the vitals form in the app. Parents/participants will also fill out a quality of life survey at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months as well as a caregiver satisfaction survey at 3 months.</description>

    <description>Parents/patients randomized into the Standard of Care Group do not use the MyChildCMC app to monitor their child's daily symptoms and are instructed to continue with regular care for their child and to continue monitoring their child's symptoms on their own without the use of the app for the duration of the study period (3 months). Parents/participants will also fill out a quality of life survey at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months as well as a caregiver satisfaction survey at 3 months.</description>
