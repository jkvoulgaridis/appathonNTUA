  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-part, phase 1-2 dose-finding study designed to determine the
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and proof-of-concept efficacy of ST101 administered IV in
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of two phases: a phase 1 dose
      escalation/regimen exploration phase and a phase 2 expansion phase.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation / regimen exploration phase During the dose escalation/regimen exploration
      phase, only patients diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, carcinoma or
      sarcoma of any tumor type who are refractory or intolerant to all available therapies that
      would impact survival will be enrolled.

      ST101 will be administered intravenously (IV), initially once per week. The dose escalation
      cohorts will be recruited using a standard 3+3 design. At each new dosing cohort, there will
      be a 1-week observation period after dosing the first patient in order to assess safety prior
      to dosing the remainder of the patients in that cohort. The dose cohorts will be 0.5, 1, 2,
      4, 8 and 16 mg/kg with once weekly (QW) dosing in all cohorts except for the highest dose
      level which will be dosed every other week (Q2W).

      The expansion phase consists of 4 specific tumor-type cohorts, which each follow the same
      Simon 2-stage design. Fifteen (15) patients will be enrolled in each cohort and treated with
      the ST101 RP2D. If one or more responses is observed that cohort will be expanded to a total
      of 30 patients to further assess efficacy.

      Responses will be graded using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1
      (Eisenhauer 2009) for hormonal receptor positive (HRpos) locally advanced/metastatic breast
      cancer (LA/MBC) and melanoma, modified response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO)
      (Ellingson 2017) for GBM and prostate cancer clinical trials working group 3 (PCWG3) (Scher
      2016) for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).During the expansion phase, only
      patients diagnosed with the following tumor types will be allowed into this phase of the
      study:

        -  HRpos LA/MBC that has progressed after prior 1-2 hormone-based therapies. Previous
           treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, mammalian target of
           rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor or chemotherapy is allowed as monotherapy or in combination.

        -  Melanoma that has progressed after/or on treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor
           (CPI) and have received 1-2 prior lines of therapy for their advanced/metastatic
           disease. Patients that have BRAF mutated disease should also have received one line of
           appropriate targeted therapy.

        -  Primary (de novo) GBM that has recurred or progressed (per modified RANO criteria) after
           1 standard treatment regimen. Standard therapy is defined as maximal surgical resection,
           radiotherapy, and concomitant temozolomide with radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy
           with temozolomide. Patients that undergo tumor treating fields as an adjuvant to first
           line therapy are allowed.- CRPC that has progressed after previous treatment with
           taxanes, abiraterone and enzalutamide/apalutamide.

      The tumor types in the expansion phase may change based on emerging data from the dose
      escalation phase of this study. Additional mini cohorts of 10 patients may be added to the
      expansion phase based on efficacy signals during the dose escalation phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion Criteria

               1. Able and willing to sign informed consent form (ICF) and comply with the protocol
                  and the restrictions and assessments therein.

               2. Male or female ≥18 years of age.

               3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.

               4. Must have a locally advanced or metastatic inoperable tumor as follows:

                    1. For the dose escalation/regimen exploration phase: melanoma, carcinoma, or
                       sarcoma

                    2. For the expansion phase: HR positive LA/MBC, melanoma, GBM, CRPC

               5. Agrees to provide a newly obtained biopsy of an accessible lesion (if they can be
                  biopsied based on the investigator's assessment) prior to the start of study
                  treatment, and to repeat biopsy once during study treatment. Tissue obtained for
                  the biopsy must not be previously irradiated (unless progressing following
                  irradiation), but a new or progressing lesion in the radiation field is
                  acceptable. Archived biopsies are acceptable for GBM patients.

               6. In the investigator's opinion, the patient may not derive clinical benefit from,
                  or is ineligible for, a particular form of standard therapy on medical grounds,
                  or the patient failed or did not tolerate one or more of other anti-cancer
                  therapies:

                  a. For the dose escalation/regimen exploration phase up to 3 previous lines of
                  systemic anticancer therapies are allowed. Since this is a FIH study, it's
                  important that patients are not refractory to therapeutic intervention due to
                  multiple lines of prior therapies.

                  a. For the expansion phase: i. HRpos LA/MBC must have progressed after prior 1-2
                  hormone-based therapies. Previous treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6
                  (CDK4/6) inhibitor, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor or
                  chemotherapy is allowed as monotherapy or in combination ii. Melanoma that has
                  progressed after or on treatment with a CPI and have received 1-2 prior lines of
                  therapy for their advanced/metastatic disease. Patients that have BRAF mutated
                  disease should also have received one line of appropriate targeted therapy iii.
                  Primary (de novo) GBM that has recurred or progressed (per modified RANO
                  criteria) after 1 standard treatment regimen (surgery, radiotherapy, and
                  temozolomide therapy). Patients that undergo tumor treating fields as an adjuvant
                  to first line therapy are allowed.

                  iv. CRPC that has progressed after previous treatment with taxanes, abiraterone
                  and enzalutamide/apalutamide or that are intolerant to these treatments.

               7. Evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1, modified RANO or PCWG3 with at least one target
                  lesion

               8. Disease that progressed on, or is non-responsive to, the previous line of therapy
                  per RECIST 1.1, modified RANO or PCWG3.

               9. If not menopausal or surgically sterile, willing to practice at least one of the

                  abstinence from sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex; (2) sexual
                  intercourse with vasectomized male/sterilized female partner; (3) combined
                  (estrogen and progestogen containing) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception
                  associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, parenteral, transvaginal or
                  transdermal) for at least 3 consecutive months prior to investigational product
                  administration; (4) other acceptable forms of birth control (condoms,
                  contraceptive sponge, diaphragm or vaginal ring with spermicide or cream); (5)
                  use of an intrauterine contraceptive device.

              10. All previous anti-cancer therapy-related adverse events should have resolved to
                  grade 1 or baseline value with the exception of alopecia. Levothyroxine is
                  allowed for patients that previously received a CPI and experienced thyroid
