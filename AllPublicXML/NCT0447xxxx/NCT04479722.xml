  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of using Zuoxin Left Atrium Appendage Closure for
      preventing stroke in Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients who have
      contraindications for long-term anti-coagulation. And to support registration approval from
      National Medical Products Administration (NMPA).

      SAFE-PROTECT trial is composed of Roll-in group, small-size group and RCT group. This trial
      is planned to conduct in about 20 sites from China.

      Roll-in group plans to enroll at most 3 subjects each site to implant experimental device for
      exploration and observation.

      RCT group plans to enroll no less than 154 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria, and 1:1 randomly allocated to experimental arm or comparator arm.

      Small-size group plans to enroll no less than 10 subjects who have LAA width 15-17mm, to
      implant experimental device.
