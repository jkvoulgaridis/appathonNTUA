  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the anesthetic efficacy of
      Alexadricaine versus Mepecaine-L infiltration anesthesia in children during extraction of
      badly decayed or unrestorable maxillary first primary molars.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, no clinical trials in literature have been done to compare anesthetic
      efficacy of 4% Articaine versus 2% Mepivacaine in pain management during extraction of badly
      decayed upper first primary molars. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to fill this
      knowledge gap.

      This trial will be held on a new brand of 4% articaine made in Egypt called Alexadricaine
      anesthetic solution where no clinical trials have been conducted on it yet in literature.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically fit (ASA I, II).

          -  Mentally capable of communication.

          -  Children aged 6-8 years, children older than 8 years old will not be included due to
             physiologic root resorption associated with shedding which may simplify the extraction
             procedure.

          -  First maxillary primary molar needs extraction due to root caries &quot;beyond possible
             repair&quot; ( to standardize the cause of extraction and ensure the efficiency of the
             anesthesia where no root or bone resorption or periapical infection that may affect
             the patient's response and may also simplify the extraction procedure).

          -  No history of intra-oral injections (first dental visit).

          -  Child must give assent prior to participation, as well as approved parental informed
             written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with acute or sub-acute dento-alveolar abscess (because there would be root
             and bone resorption that may simplify the extraction procedure, also acute
             inflammation may affect anesthetic efficiency).

          -  Children with history of prolonged bleeding, platelet disorders, Hyperthyroidism or
             hypersensitivity.

          -  History of significant behavior management problems.

          -  Patients who had taken analgesics or antibiotics in the 12-hrs preceding the
             injection.

          -  Children whose parents or caregivers did not give consent for the study.
