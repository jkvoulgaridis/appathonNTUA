  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HS-10241 is a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of c-Met kinase. In
      preclinical studies, it demonstrated strong activity against c-Met kinase in vitro and in
      vivo, and inhibited tumor cell growth. This study is conducted to assess the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
      safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HS-10241 at single dose and multiple doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of single and multiple doses of oral administration of
      HS-10241 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have progressed
      following prior therapy. There is a dose-escalation study, which is designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single dose and repeat doses of HS-10241 given
      once every day (QD). An alternative dosing schedule of twice every day (BID) may be
      investigated if the drug clearance of HS-10241 is faster than anticipated.

      All patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for
      28 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects of this study will be permitted to
      continue therapy with assessments for progression once every 6 weeks, if the product is well
      tolerated and the subject has stable disease or better. As the disease progresses, survival
      follow-up is recommended bimonthly.
