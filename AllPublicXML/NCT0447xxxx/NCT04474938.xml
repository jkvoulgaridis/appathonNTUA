  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis who have advanced cardiac damage are at risk of
      premature mortality. There is ongoing unmet need for effective therapies to rapidly induce
      deep hematologic response and decrease the early death rate. Lately, trials of daratumumab in
      relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis have shown dramatic response rates. However, the
      benefits of upfront daratumumab in AL patients have not yet been demonstrated definitely in
      prospective studies. Therefore, we designed a phase II, single arm clinical trial to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of co-administration of daratumumab with bortezomib and
      dexamethasone (BD) regimen in treatment-naïve patients with Mayo 04 stage III AL amyloidosis.
      We planned to enroll 40 patients, who would receive daratumumab and BD treatment for a total
      duration of 12 months. The primary endpoint is complete response and very good partial
      response rate. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, progression-free survival, organ
      response and adverse effects. We aimed to further optimize the treatment strategies and
      guidelines for high risk AL amyloidosis patients.

    <description>Very good partial response or better rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response or very good partial response. Complete response: normalization of free light chain levels and ratio with negative serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis. Very good partial response: difference between involved and uninvolved free light chains (dFLC) less than 40 mg/L</description>
