  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We at PGIMER have been practicing hypofractionated radiotherapy in breast cancer patients for
      the last 4 decades. Our standard doses have been 35Gy/15#/3wks to the chest wall after
      mastectomy and 40Gy/16#/3wks after breast conserving surgery (BCS).It is also a routine
      practice in the UK and in a few centers in Canada. Hypofractionation reduces treatment time
      to half while maintaining cosmesis and gives control rates equal to conventional
      fractionation. As breast cancer is a leading cancer in females and radiation therapy is an
      important part of its local management, hypofractionation helps radiation centers worldwide
      to meet the growing need for radiation treatment in breast cancer, particularly in developing
      countries where resources are limited. It also reduces the financial burden on the patient
      and family. In this study we want to evaluate the impact of reducing the treatment duration
      from 3 weeks to 1 week. Eligible patients with breast cancer after mastectomy or BCS will be
      treated with a radiotherapy dose of 26Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week in the study arm and 40Gy
      in 15 fractions over 3 weeks in the control arm. The primary endpoint of this noninferiority
      study will be locoregional tumour control. Secondary endpoints will be early and late
      radiation toxicities, quality of life, contralateral primary tumours, regional and distant
      metastases, survival and second cancers. A total of 1018 patients will be randomised (1:1) to
      receive 1 week or 3 weeks of radiotherapy. An event-driven analysis will be performed after
      at least 94 patients have documented locoregional recurrences.

      Aim: To test a 1-week schedule of hypofractionated adjuvant whole breast/chest wall and/or
      regional nodal radiotherapy against 3 weeks for loco-regional control, acute and late
      toxicities, quality of life (QoL), survival and second cancers after primary surgery in
      patients with breast cancer.

      Review of literature Four randomised trials involving a total of &gt;8000 women have compared a
      lower total dose in fewer larger fractions against 50Gy in 25 fractions, and all have
      reported favourable results in terms of local tumour control and late adverse effects.1-4
      Appropriate adjustments to total dose allow 15- or 16-fraction schedules to be delivered over
      3 weeks that are at least as safe and effective as standard 5-week regimens.

      A 2008 Cochrane review of altered radiotherapy fractionation in early breast cancer1
      including The Royal Marsden Hospital/Gloucestershire Oncology Centre and Ontario trials
      totalling 2644 women with mainly axillary node negative tumours &lt;5cm diameter concluded that
      radiotherapy fractions larger than 2Gy were at least as effective as 2Gy fractionation for a)
      local-recurrence free survival (absolute difference 0.4%, 95% CI 1.5% to 2.4%), b) breast
      appearance (risk ratio (RR)1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.17; p=0.86), c) survival at five years (RR
      0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19; p=0.75), d) late skin toxicity at five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.44
      to 2.22; p=0.98, or e) late radiation toxicity in subcutaneous tissue (RR1.0, 95% CI 0.78 to
      1.28; p=0.99).1 The UK START A trial(N=2236) showed that the estimated absolute differences
      in 5-year local-regional relapse rates compared with the control schedule of 50Gy in 2Gy
      fractions were 0.2% (95% CI 1.3% to 2.6%) after41.6Gy and 0.9% (95% CI 0.8% to 3.7%) after
      39Gy. In STARTA, photographic and patient self- assessments suggested lower rates of late
      adverse effects after 39 Gy than with 50 Gy, with a hazard ratio(HR) for late change in
      photographic breast appearance of 0.69(95% CI 0.52 to 0.91,p=0.01).3 In the UK START B
      trial(N=2215) the estimated absolute difference in 5-year local-regional relapse rates for
      40.05 Gy compared with 50Gy was -0.7% (95% CI 1.7% to 0.9%),and the HR for late change in
      photographic breast appearance was 0.83 (95% CI 0.66 to1.04). These START trials reported
      similar local tumour control with some evidence of lower rates of late adverse effects after
      schedules with fraction sizes larger than 2 Gy compared with the international standard
      25-fraction regimen.4 The international standard regimen for whole breast radiotherapy prior
      to publication of these studies was a total dose of 50Gy in 25 fractions (daily doses) over
      5weeks following surgical resection of the primary tumour in women with early breast cancer.
      With the establishment of safety and efficacy of moderate hypofractionation another 'new
      standard of care' using 40-41Gy in 15 to 16 fractions over 3 weeks has been established, as
      evidenced by recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Clinical
      Excellence(NICE). 5 Although interesting and practically helpful, such moderate
      hypofractionation is unlikely to represent the useful limits of hypofractionation for whole
      breast or even regional nodal radiotherapy.

      Further hypofractionated radiotherapy has been tested using once weekly schedule to the whole
      breast in the UK FAST study.5 Assuming an α/β value between 3 and 4 two different schedules
      were hypothesised to be equally effective (28.5 Gy and 30Gy in 5 fractions over 5 weeks) to
      the 50Gy in 25 fraction over 5 weeks schedule. Initial analysis has shown a higher rate of
      moist desquamation using the 50Gy regimen; however photographic assessment after a median
      follow-up of 28.4 months has shown more mild or marked change in the photographic appearance
      with the hypofractionated schedule.4 Clinical assessments of breast appearance changes were
      similar to the 50Gy group when using the 28.5Gy schedule but worse with the 30Gy schedule.
      Final results from the study are awaited. The UK FAST Forward study randomly allocated 4096
      patients to 40Gy/15#/3 weeks, 27Gy/5#/1 week, or 26Gy/5#/1 week to the whole breast or chest
      wall.6 They concluded that 26Gy/5#/1 week was non-inferior to the standard of 40Gy/15#/3
      weeks for local tumour control, and was as safe in terms of normal tissue effects up to 5
      years in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

      Hypofractionated radiotherapy has been used at PGIMER and comparable clinical outcomes have
      been published with moderate hypofractionation.7-9 Although Indian breast cancer patients
      present at a younger age, with more advanced stage, and a higher percentage of grade 3 and
      triple negative tumours compared to the western population. These adverse factors may not be
      important when comparing hypofractionated radiotherapy with standard fractionation.9
      Reservations exist for extreme hypofractionation to the regional nodes citing increasing risk
      of brachial plexopathy when hypofractionating to the supraclavicular fossa although moderate
      hypofractionation has been used at our institute for the last 5 decades without reports of
      any brachial plexopathy.10,11 Similarly, moderately hypofractionated 2-week regimes have been
      used in clinical trials and have been found to be safe.10 Given the above evidence, 40Gy in
      15 fractions has been recommended as the standard of care in the UK even for cases that will
      include irradiation of the supraclavicular fossa.

      Recently, Wang et al. published results from a randomised study in high-risk breast cancer
      patients after mastectomy.11They reported similar 5-year clinical outcomes and late
      toxicities with conventional and hypofractionation.This study also established the safety of
      3 weeks regional nodal irradiation(RNI) in patients with breast cancer. They reported a
      lymphedema rate of 19% at 5-years. We published our results of RNI with 40 Gy/15 fractions/3
      weeks hypofractionation with 2D technique, at 15 years RNI was safe and comparable to
      historical data of conventional fractionation (ClinicalTrial.gov Registration No.
      NCT04175821).12

      Against this background, a phase III randomised, non-inferiority study testing1 week against
      3 weeks of radiotherapy to the breast and chest wall with or without supraclavicular fossa
      adjuvant radiotherapy will include1018 patients. The primary end point will be locoregional
      control and secondary end points will be acute and late radiation toxicity, QoL, survival and
      second cancers.

      5. Preliminary work done: i) The consent form prepared. ii) CRF, PIS, evaluation sheet
      prepared Detailed Research Methodology This study will be a randomised, non-inferiority,
      open-label, phase 3 trial, with patients to be recruited from a single institute. Other
      institutes will be invited if they are willing to participate. Patients to be included in
      this study will be pre-operatively staged according to American Joint Committee on Cancer
      (AJCC) 8th edition, International Union against cancer (which uses TNM staging) as stage III
      breast carcinoma. For patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy, pathological stage will be
      reflected and those with neoadjuvant chemotherapy the stage which is higher
      (clinical/pathological) will be reflected. A total of 1018 patients with histologically
      proven post lumpectomy/mastectomy cases of carcinoma breast suitable for radiotherapy will be
      enrolled in this study. Patients will be evaluated at the Department of Radiation Oncology
      Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education &amp;Research, Chandigarh, India. A thorough
      clinical examination followed by routine investigations which will include hemogram, liver
      function tests, kidney function tests, mammography, chest X-ray, ultrasound of abdomen/CECT
      chest, abdomen and pelvis and whole body bone scan. Written informed consent will be taken
      from all the patients.

      Randomisation and masking Eligible patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either
      1 week or 3 weeks of radiotherapy without stratification by simple randomisation according to
      a prescribed computer-generated central randomisation schedule. Radiation oncologists in the
      study team will enroll participants, and research staff members who will be involved in
      follow-up data collection will assign participants to interventions. Treatment allocation
      will not be masked.

      Radiotherapy Radiotherapy dose to chest wall, axilla level III and supraclavicular fossa will
      be of 26Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week in the study arm and 40Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks
      in the control arm.BCS patients will receive a sequential boost of 8Gy/2#/2days or
      simultaneous integrated boost(SIB) to a total dose of 34Gy in the study arm and 48Gy in the
      control arm. Treatment will be done on a linear accelerator with 6 or 10MV photon energy.
      Boost can be with photons or electrons. 1cm bolus will be used in all postmastectomy
      patients, daily in study arm and in 50% of treatment in the control arm. Dose will be
      prescribed at mid-separation in 2D technique and the dose covering 95% of the planning target
      volume with three-dimensional conformal(3D-CRT) or intensity modulated radiotherapy(IMRT).

      Supraclavicular fossa(SCF) and axilla level III will be treated in patients with T3-4 disease
      with lymphovascular invasion, grade 3 or N2 disease and T3-4 disease treated with neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy after adequate axillary dissection. Level I and II axilla will only be
      irradiated in patients with inadequate axillary dissection(&lt;10 lymph nodes). The prescribed
      dose to the area will be defined as the dose to the point at 3 cm beneath the skin in
      two-dimensional radiotherapy technique, or the dose covering 95% of the planning target
      volume with 3D-CRT or IMRT.

      Internal mammary node (IMNs) radiation will be done in T3-4 central and inner quadrant
      lesions and patients with N2 disease. IMNs will be irradiated with a separate 12x5 cm single
      field. The first five intercostal spaces will be included in the IMN target volume. The
      medial border of the IMN field will be midline; lateral border 5 cm lateral to the midline;
      the superior border will abut the inferior border of the supraclavicular field; and the
      inferior border will be above the xiphoid. Dose will be 34Gy/10#/2weeks. Dose will be
      prescribed at 3cm depth. Imaging will be done for set-up verification on alternate days in
      the study arm and once weekly in the control arm.

      Hormonal therapy may be given to oestrogen receptor-positive or progesterone
      receptor-positive tumours, and anti-HER2-targeted therapy (e.g., trastuzumab) for those with
      HER2-positive disease depending on the affordability.

      Assessment Patients will be assessed for medical history, a physical examination, and a blood
      test before radiotherapy, once per week during radiotherapy, and 2 weeks after radiotherapy.
      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for 2 years after radiotherapy, then every 6
      months from 3 to 5 years, and yearly thereafter. Skin, subcutaneous toxicity and cosmetic
      assessment will be done before treatment and then in regular follow up of the study. Acute
      radiation toxicity will be assessed and scaled according to the RTOG grading system. Late
      radiation toxicity will be assessed with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the
      European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scale.
      Cosmetic assessment will be done using Harvard/NSABP/RTOG breast cosmesis grading scale at
      baseline, 3 and 5 years. Quality of life(QoL) will be assessed with EORTC QLQ -30, EORTC
      QLQ-BR 23 at baseline, 3 and 5 years.12

      Statistical considerations The primary hypothesis of the study is that locoregional
      recurrence with 1 week is non-inferior to that with 3 weeks of radiotherapy. The primary
      endpoint will be locoregional recurrence (LRR). Based on historical data (Wang et al.), the
      5-year LRR rate with 3 weeks of RT is expected to be approximately 8%. 1 week of RT would be
      considered non-inferior to 3 weeks of RT if the 5-year LRR rate does not exceed 13%. If LRR
      follows exponential distributions within each treatment group, this non-inferiority margin
      corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67.

      Sample size calculations were performed using module STE0S-3 of nQuery version 8.5.2.0. A
      total of 94 LRR events will be required to provide at least 80% power using a one-sided test
      at the 5% level of significance. Under assumed failure rates and guarding against 10%
      ineligibility or loss to follow-up, the target accrual will be1018 patients with an accrual
      period of 3 years. If the two schedules are equivalent, 5 years of follow-up after the last
      patient has been randomised will be required to observe 94 LRR events, resulting in total
      study duration of 8 years.

      For the primary efficacy endpoint, we will use the cumulative incidence method to estimate
      the actual incidence of locoregional recurrence at different time points, with death without
      locoregional recurrence as a competing risk. We will use the log-rank test and Cox regression
      model for statistical inference based on cause-specific hazards. We will calculate overall
      survival and disease-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier method, and we will analyse these
      endpoints using the log rank test and Cox regression model. Acute and late toxicities will be
      summarised as frequency and severity on the basis of their association with protocol
      treatment; χ² tests will be used to compare the differences. The primary endpoint and all
      efficacy endpoints will be analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population (i.e.,
      including all eligible patients who will undergo randomisation but exclude those who are
      considered ineligible. On the basis of the study design, the primary endpoint locoregional
      recurrence will be analysed at a one-sided significance level of 0•05 and reported with a
      two-sided 90% CI. All other statistical tests will be two sided, and p values of &lt;0.05 will
      be taken as significant. All tests will be performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the
      Social Sciences) v.23.0.
