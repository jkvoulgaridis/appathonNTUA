  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the hold properties of an investigational denture
      adhesive using an established methodology called the maximum incisal bite force (BF), and
      Kapur-Olshan (KO) index for denture retention and stability. The effects of hot drinks and
      two questionnaires relating to participants' perception will also be assessed for the
      investigational denture adhesive.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-centre, controlled, randomized, single blind, 4-treatment,
      4-period, cross-over study to evaluate maximum maxillary bite force in a population of full
      maxillary denture wearers. This study consists of 5 visits (1 screening visit and 4 treatment
      periods including minimum washout period of 2 days between treatment visits). Participant's
      maxillary and mandibular dentures will be assessed for retention and stability using KO index
      and whether they are well made. Participants will be randomized to one of the 4 treatment
      groups i.e. No adhesive, Super Poligrip Free (SPF), Investigational Adhesive and
      Investigational Adhesive + Hot drink arm group and will undergo an oral soft tissue (OST) and
      Oral Hard Tissue (OHT) examination. Participants who will meet all the inclusion and no
      exclusion criteria will continue the study. Participants will complete the BF measurement, KO
      assessment, OST, OHT examination and participants 'perception questionnaire as per the
      schedule.

    <measure>Area Over Baseline Over 12 Hours (AOB 0-12) to Compare Maximum Incisal Bite Force (BF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Incisal bite force measurements will be performed to analyse the denture dislodgement as measure of denture adhesive hold efficacy. All BF measurements will be conducted by an examiner. AOB0-12 will be used to assess the incisal bf and is defined as (AUC0-12)/12 minus baseline BF(pounds [lbs]). Area under the Curve (AUC) is calculated from 0 to 12 hours (hr) using the trapezoid method; denoted as AUC0-12. This transformation will return the measurement to the same scale as the original observations. Area over baseline in BF as measured by AOB0-12 will be analyzed for each of the three interventional products, compared to no adhesive. Higher values of AOB0-12 demonstrate a stronger bite force overtime than lower values.</description>

    <measure>Kapur Olshan (KO) Index Scores for Denture Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>KO Index score will be assessed to examine retention and stability performance of maxillary dentures. Retention will be measured on score of 0-5 to assess nature of resistance offered by denture to vertical force at the canine/lateral incisor region of the denture: 0= No retention- when the denture was seated in place, it displaced itself; 1= Poor- denture offers slight resistance to vertical pull and little or no resistance to lateral force; 2= Fair- denture offered moderate resistance to vertical pull and little or no resistance to lateral forces; 3= Good- denture offered moderate resistance to vertical pull and lateral force; 4= Very Good- denture offered very good resistance to vertical pull and lateral force; 5=Excellent - denture offered excellent resistance to vertical pull and lateral force. Higher the score, higher the retention ability of denture.</description>

Stability will be measured as score of 0-4 to assess nature of rocking offered by maxillary denture by placing alternate horizontal force at the cuspid and contralateral molar regions of the upper denture: 0=No stability; 1=Poor; 2=Fair; 3=Good; 4=Excellent. Composite KO Index scores will be measured as the sum score of retention &amp; stability of dentures such that a sum score of zero (0) represents no retention and stability and a sum score of 9 represents excellent retention and stability.</description>
