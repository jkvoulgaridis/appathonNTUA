      Purpose The aim of this study was to analyze the microbiota of patients undergoing LSG or
      LRYGB on three levels of gastrointestinal tract, using oral swab and stool sample. We
      compared samples from patients achieving favorable outcomes in terms of weight-loss with
      patients, who did not respond optimally to the bariatric operation.

      Materials and methods Design This prospective cohort study was conducted in one academic,
      teaching hospital. The recommendations of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Section of the
      Polish Surgical Society were used as indication for surgery, that is: Body Mass Index (BMI)
      ≥35 kg/m2 with obesity-related comorbidities or BMI ≥40 kg/m2⁠.

      Analysis and endpoints Primary endpoint was to determine the difference in microbiota present
      in oral cavity and large intestine between patients ing Group 1 and Group 2. Secondary
      endpoint was to compare the results of microbiota analysis between LSG and LRYGB.
