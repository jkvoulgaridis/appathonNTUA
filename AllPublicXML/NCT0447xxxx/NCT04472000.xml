  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative shoulder stiffness is a common complication after shoulder surgery (incidence
      10-15%). The symptoms consist primarily in a painful impairment of the mobility of the
      glenohumeral joint, usually after initially good course. Cause and origin are not clear.

      Vitamin C is known as an inactivator of free radicals and plays a key role in building
      collagen tissue. Vitamin C thus has a modulating role in inflammatory reactions. Injured and
      ill people have been shown to have significantly increased vitamin C needs, which underlines
      this role. Evidence was also found that vitamin C has a positive influence on similar
      diseases such as the complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS, Morbus Sudeck) on the wrist and
      postoperative arthrofibrosis on the knee joint.

      The Investigators want to investigate whether vitamin C intake can positively influence the
      incidence and / or severity of postoperative shoulder stiffness after shoulder surgery.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of vitamin C on the external
      rotational ability of the operated shoulder in the glenohumeral joint compared to the
      opposite side at 12 weeks post surgery.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to investigate other shoulder mobility tests,
      patient-reported outcomes (level of pain, ability/return to work, smoking habits),
      patient-reported questionnaires (Constant Score, Oxford shoulder score, DASH score) and the
      incidence of a frozen shoulder at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post surgery.

      Total duration of study: 2.5 years.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to the two treatment arms, vitamin C or placebo, in a
      1:1 ratio Study participants in the verum group receive one capsule of Burgerstein Vitamin C
      retard 500mg b.i.d. with treatment starting in the evening on the day of the operation for a
      total of 50 days.

      The placebo group receives one placebo capsule b.i.d. with treatment starting in the evening
      on the day of the operation for a total of 50 days. Vitamin C will be administered orally.
      Burgerstein Vitamin C Retard Capsules 500 mg (Pharmacode: 6739189) will be used for this
      study. Active substance: Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C, E 300).

      Since a known drug should be tested for a new indication, the exclusion of a bias by a
      placebo effect, the administration of a placebo to the control group is necessary. To exclude
      a detection bias and a performance bias, the study is performed double-blind. A randomization
      protects against a selection bias.

      The determination of the sample size is based on the following considerations. The primary
      endpoint is not expected to be normally distributed. Therefore the sample size determination
      is based on a Mann-Whitney test for the comparison of the two groups (placebo and treatment)
      assuming a logistic distribution. Based on a few data of comparable measurements the
      Investigators think that the standard deviation of the primary endpoint is 10(=SD) in each
      group. The treatment effect is expected to be Delta=10, a medically reasonable effect.

      To achieve a power of at least 80% for the 4 tested comparisons in the final analysis of the
      primary endpoint, a minimal sample size of 42 in each of the 4 patient groups (strata) is
      required. In expectation of a drop-out rate of 20%, the target sample size will be 50
      patients in each stratum and 200 patients in total, with 100 in the placebo group and 100 in
      the treatment group.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly allocated to the two treatment arms, vitamin C or placebo, in a 1:1 ratio. The randomisation will be stratified by type of surgery performed. Allocation will be concealed using sequentially coded drug packs that are otherwise identical. Drug packs will be coded as 01-01 to 01-50 for stratum 1, 02-01 to 02-50 for stratum 2, 03-01 to 03-50 for stratum 3, and 04-01 to 04-50 for stratum 4.
The 4 strata differ in the type of operation performed:
Rotator cuff surgery with resection of the acromioclavicular joint
Rotator cuff surgery without resection of the acromioclavicular joint
Shoulder arthroscopy with resection of the acromioclavicular joint
Shoulder arthroscopy without resection of the acromioclavicular joint Vitamin C will be administered orally at 1000 mg/day (500 mg b.i.d.) for 50 days post surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Difference between the external glenohumeral joint rotations of the operated shoulder and the opposite shoulder</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the difference between the external glenohumeral joint rotations of the operated shoulder and the opposite shoulder (&quot;Delta ∆&quot;).
The external glenohumeral joint rotation was chosen as primary measure for shoulder performance because this is the component of movement in the shoulder joint, which is the first and most severely impaired in postoperative shoulder stiffness and which normalizes as the last after the symptomatology subsides.
Delta ∆ was chosen as an outcome measure, since the standard deviation of the external rotation capability in the population is very high. The external glenohumeral joint rotation of both shoulders is measured using a smartphone with the App &quot;GetMyROM&quot;.</description>
