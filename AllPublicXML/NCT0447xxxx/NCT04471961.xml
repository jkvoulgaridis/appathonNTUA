  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in children. Most pediatric
      tumors differ from adult tumors in terms of biological and clinical characteristics. In
      children, the part of genetic determinism could be higher since the role of environmental
      factors may be less pronounced than in adults and that a young age at onset is a main feature
      of genetic cancer predisposition. Recent studies suggested that a number of genetic
      predisposition remains to be characterized.

      Methods. Trio-Based whole exome sequencing of germline DNA from children and parents will be
      performed prospectively in a multicentric study including 40 unselected cases of malignant
      tumor. Participating hospitals will include the CHU of Montpellier, the CHU de Nice and the
      AP-HP. Tumor analysis will include whole exome analysis and transcriptome for the
      identification of therapeutic target and contribute to confirm potential link between
      constitutive mutations and tumor phenotype (such as loss of expression, loss of
      heterozygosity).

      Perspectives. This pediatric oncology study proposing a global approach integrating
      trio-based whole exome sequencing, somatic DNA and RNA analysis will improve the recognition
      of genetic predisposition and the characterization of target therapies in children with
      cancer.
