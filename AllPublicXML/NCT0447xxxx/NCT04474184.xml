      This phase I trial investigates the development of a new early detection test to reduce
      racial disparities in endometrial cancer death rates. DNA samples collected from a tampon may
      be able to be used to detect endometrial cancer. Studying information from focus groups and
      vaginal samples of African American and white women may help researchers develop a less
      invasive and painful test to detect endometrial cancer. The purpose of this trial is to
      perform a demonstration project of tampon self-collection, assess percentage of samples
      returned; total and endometrial derived DNA quantity and quality, preliminarily test
      previously validated DNA methylation markers that may discriminate endometrial cancer from
      normal endometrium in tampon specimens.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct focus groups to elicit perceptions and knowledge among African American women
      (AAW) and white women (WW) concerning abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)/post-menopausal
      bleeding (PMB), endometrial cancer (EC) risk factors, barriers to seeking medical evaluation,
      sources of medical information and acceptance and feasibility of tampon self-collection for
      laboratory testing.

      II. To perform a demonstration project of tampon self-collection from 25 AAW and 25 WW with
      AUB/PMB in Jacksonville.

      OUTLINE:

      AIM 1: Participants attend a focus group over 2 hours about endometrial cancer including
      knowledge of abnormal uterine bleeding, post-menopausal bleeding, risk factors, sources of
      medical information, barriers to seeking gynecologic care, and acceptance of tampon
      self-collection for endometrial cancer detection.

      AIM 2: Participants receive a tampon kit for collection of vaginal samples.

      After completion of study enrollment, participants may be followed up annually for 10 years.

    <description>Will test samples for top EC-specific DNA methylation markers using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and provide descriptive statistics for all measurements (mean, median, standard deviation). Will assess the percentage of samples that yield &gt; 500 ng amplifiable DNA, which suffices for methylation assays.</description>
