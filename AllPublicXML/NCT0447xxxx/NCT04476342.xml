      Research objective:

      (1) To develop a minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation integrated system, and to form
      a new product package, the package of the system should include the extracorporeal
      circulation off-set supplies for a routine heart operation.(2) To explore the influence of
      integrated minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system on the recent clinical
      outcome of patients.(3) To explore the influence of integrated minimally invasive
      extracorporeal circulation system on blood dilution of patients.(4) To explore the influence
      of integrated minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system on inflammatory response
      in patients.

      1) Clinical research methods: A prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study was
      designed. 80 patients should be included.Clinical study grouping: The control group was
      conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CCPB) group, which was equipped with ordinary
      oxygenator, microemboli filter and 4:1 cardioplegia solution.The experimental group was
      minimal invasive cardiopulmonary bypass (MICPB) group, with built-in micro-thrombotic
      oxygenator and mini cardioplegia (MP) formula (15ML15% potassium chloride (KCl)+10ml compound
      potassium, calcium and magnesium +25ml normal saline).

      Research method:

      A: Before, in, and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) blood collection, Hemoglobin (Hb),
      hematokrit (Hct), and blood lactate values of the two groups of patients were measured and
      analyzed statistically.B: Blood transfusion volume, urine volume and ultrafiltration volume
      were collected during CPB in the two groups of patients, and the data of the two groups were
      statistically analyzed.To investigate the effects of integrated minimally invasive
      extracorporeal circulation system on inflammatory response indicators white blood cell count
      (WBC),C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and C3a
      in patients before (T0), CPB (T1) and 2 hours(H) after CPB (T2), blood samples were collected
      from the two groups, centrifugated, superfluid was taken, and stored at -80℃.The
      concentrations of CRP, IL-6, TNF-a and C3a were determined by ELISA.Statistical analysis was
      performed.WBC was measured in blood routine.(3) To investigate the influence of integrated
      minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system on the recent clinical outcome of
      patients. The mechanical ventilation time, ICU time, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital
      mortality of patients in the two groups were statistically analyzed.

      in patients.

      Research and development of integrated minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system

      (1) Appropriate CPB tubes should be determined according to clinical needs. Adopt 3/8 inch
      vein tubes and elevate the position of blood storage tank to reduce the length of the tubes
      and precharge.The piping jacket shall include the main pump pipe, the infusion pipe, the
      platform package (static and static vessels), the left and right core suction pipe, and the
      negative pressure suction pipe.The total precharge should be kept at about 800ml (284ml
      static precharge of the self-equipped micro-plug oxygenator, and about 500ml precharge of the
      pipeline and stopping liquid perfusion system).(2) Cooperate with integrated membrane
      oxygenator manufacturers in the design of pipelines to form a wrapper that integrates
      membrane oxygenator and pipeline.Among them, oxygenator and pipeline should be well connected
      in the sheath.

      A prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study was designed. 80 patients should be
