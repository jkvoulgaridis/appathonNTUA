    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, multi-center study with an open-label, dose escalation phase followed by
      a single-arm expansion phase to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of NT219 alone and in combination with ERBITUX® (cetuximab) in
      adults with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors.

             if he/she were to participate in the study;

          9. History of weight loss &gt;10% over the 2 months prior to Screening;

         10. Clinically relevant serious co-morbid medical conditions, including:
