  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well ZEN-3694, enzalutamide, and pembrolizumab work in
      treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places
      in the body (metastatic). ZEN-3694 blocks the expression of the MYC gene to prevent cellular
      growth in certain types of tumors, including castrate resistant prostate cancer. Enzalutamide
      has been shown to block testosterone from reaching prostate cancer cells by binding to a
      receptor on prostate cancer cells, called androgen receptors. This works similar to a lock
      and key. When enzalutamide (key) inserts into the androgen receptor (lock) testosterone
      cannot attach to the androgen receptor, which slows the growth of tumor cells and may cause
      them to shrink. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody (proteins that can protect the body
      from foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses) designed to block a specific control
      switch which may be activated by tumor cells to overcome the body's natural immune system
      defenses. It also enhances the activity of the body's immune cells against tumor cells. The
      purpose of this study is to find out the effects ZEN-3694, enzalutamide, and pembrolizumab on
      patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have previously experienced
      disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had prior disease
      progression on at least one second generation androgen signaling inhibitor, including
      abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, and/or enzalutamide and have clinicogenomic evidence
      of transdifferentiated mCRPC (Cohort A) or mCRPC without transdifferentiation (Cohort B).
      Prior to enrollment in Phase 2 (Cohort A and B), a safety lead-in cohort of 6 patients with
      metastatic CRPC will be enrolled. Accrual will proceed to Phase 2 if &lt; 33% of patients (0/6
      or 1/6 patients) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity during Cycle 1.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, BET bromodomain
      inhibitor ZEN-3694 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-21. Patients
      not on enzalutamide prior to study enrollment or have previously discontinued enzalutamide
      receive BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 beginning on day 1 of cycle 2. Cycles repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 90 days
      until death or study completion or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the composite response rate in Cohort A and Cohort B study population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate and median duration of response in each study
      cohort.

      II. To determine the median progression free survival and 6-month progression-free survival
      rate.

      III. To determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 50 (PSA50) response proportion in each
      study cohort.

      IV. To determine the median overall survival of each cohort. V. To determine the safety of
      the treatment combination.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association between baseline metastatic tumor characteristics including
      treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (t-SCNC), androgen receptor (AR),
      retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) loss, and immune response transcriptional
      signatures with clinical outcomes.

      II. To evaluate modulation of AR transcriptional activity, expression of t-SCNC markers, and
      immune parameters including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression in evaluable
      paired tumor biopsies.

      III. To evaluate the association between baseline and change from baseline in peripheral
      blood biomarkers including T cell subsets, T cell repertoire, and inhibitors of bromodomain
      extraterminal protein (BETi) whole blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) panel with clinical outcomes.

      IV. To evaluate the association between baseline or change from baseline in gallium Ga 68
      citrate (68Ga-citrate) positron emission tomography (PET) with subsequent clinical outcomes.

      V. To compare efficacy outcomes (composite response, PSA50 response, objective response,
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)) between cohorts.

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
             years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or

             Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) or treatment with drugs
             (e.g. methimazole, neomercazol, carbamazole, etc.) that function to decrease the
             generation of thyroid hormone by a hyper-functioning thyroid gland (e.g., in Graves'
             disease) is not considered a form of systemic treatment of an autoimmune disease

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed

          -  Cardiac condition as defined as one or more of the following:

               -  Uncontrolled supraventricular arrhythmia or ventricular arrhythmia requiring
                  treatment

               -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) congestive heart failure class III or IV

               -  History of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident
                  within 6 months prior to C1D1

          -  History of seizure or pre-disposing condition (e.g. brain metastases)

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy at a
             prednisone equivalent dose of &gt; 10 mg daily or other form of immunosuppressive therapy
             within 7 days prior to first dose of study drug

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals on effective anti-retroviral
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial
             (screening not required in the absence of risk factors)

          -  For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (positive
             hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and/or hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]), the HBV
             viral load must be undetectable at the time of study enrollment (screening not
             required in the absence of risk factors)

          -  Chronic active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection defined as positive viral load
             (screening not required in the absence of risk factors)

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis

          -  Has an active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics within 7 days prior to C1D1

          -  Use of a prohibited concomitant medication within 7 days of C1D1

          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to C1D1. Minor procedures including biopsies,
             dental surgery, cataract surgery, or outpatient procedure are allowed

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial
