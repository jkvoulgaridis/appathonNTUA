  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery. AKI has been
      reported as 7-40% depending on the type of surgery, and is known to increase to about 50%
      when there are risk factors. Cardiac surgery-associated AKI (CSA-AKI) requires cardiac
      replacement therapy in 1-5% of patients and increases mortality to 1,4%, but the treatment is
      still unknown. Therefore prevention of occurrence is very important.

      Known factors related to the development of CSA-AKI include hemodynamic, inflammatory,
      metabolic, and nephrotoxic factors, and since there is a close connection between hypotension
      due to deterioration of cardiac function, preventive measures to prevent hypotension in
      juicing It is only possible.

      To date, strategies to protect kidneys with drugs are very limited. Urinary trypsin
      inhibitor, ulistine, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, so it has been reported
      to protect against renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Various studies have been attempted to
      prevent CSA-AKI, but most of them are inflammatory reactions during surgery. It was performed
      only for surgery with extracorporeal circulation that causes severely.

      Therefore, this study would like to verify the effectiveness of ulistine's medicine in the
      prevention of CSA-AKI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery without
      extracorporeal circulation.
