  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital are interested in learning more about the
      neurobiology of well-being in new mothers and novel ways to support them during their
      transition to parenthood. This study aims to evaluate well-being in new mothers and the whole
      family (including partners and infant) and the impact of a probiotic dietary supplement on
      the gut microbiome. This study hopes to help improve the existing knowledge of maternal
      postnatal health.
