  <brief_summary>

      It involves collecting safety and efficacy data, under the actual conditions of use of
      medicines in children and adolescents, using a validated tool (VIGINOM) and relying on the
      network of Interregional pediatric oncology appeal organizations (OIR) identified by INCa
      since 2010 and responsible for the organization of Pluridisciplinary Pediatric Interregional
      (RCPPI) and National Consultative Meetings which discuss each case of relapse in order to
      define the best therapeutic options.

      The objective is to aim for completeness throughout the national territory. This is why this
      project will be carried out in close collaboration with the RIOs and RCPPI and that of the 31
      centers of the SFCE which bring together more than 400 doctors pediatric oncologists and
      hematologists on French territory
