  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. It
      is considered that if there are no changes in prevention and treatment strategies there will
      be an increase to 70 million obese children by 2025. Of the only pharmacological treatments
      accepted at this age to improve insulin resistance is metformin, but it can condition
      gastrointestinal, muscular and hepatic adverse events. Cinnamon is an alternative therapy,
      which due to its high concentrations of polyphenols, improves insulin resistance by
      decreasing the proinflammatory environment that occurs in this group of patients, and unlike
      metformin with less frequent adverse events. The effectiveness of cinnamon has been
      demonstrated by decreasing insulin resistance in the adult population.

      Controlled clinical trial, 100 children aged 10 to 15 years with obesity Body Mass Index
      (BMI&gt; 2 SD) will be selected. Children and parents who agree to participate will be measured
      anthropometry (weight, height, BMI, body fat) and Tanner stage. Once the 100 children have
      been selected and registered, a determination will be made after 8 hours of fasting leptin,
      ghrelin, insulin, lipid profile, liver function tests, creatinine and cinnamic acid.
      Subsequently they will be randomly assigned to a group that receives the intervention with
      cinnamon 3000mg / day, or placebo; Both groups will receive diet and physical activity
      recommendations according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. They will be
      followed for 16 weeks. During this period, patients will be contacted weekly to confirm the
      consumption of the capsules and interrogation of adverse effects such as dyspepsia,
      gastrointestinal disturbances and headache. They will be scheduled monthly for capsule
      counting and interrogation of adverse effects. At the end of the 16-week follow-up,
      anthropometry, fasting after 8 hours of leptin, ghrelin, insulin lipid profile, liver
      function tests, creatinine and cinnamic acid will be performed.

      Statistical analysis: Shapiro Wilk test will be applied to the variables with quantitative
      measurement scale to identify the type of distribution; in the case of parametric
      distribution, the data with averages and standard deviation will be presented, in case of
      presenting non-parametric distribution, medium and minimum and maximum values will be used.
      In the case of qualitative variables, they will be expressed with percentages and simple
      frequencies. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the two groups with t-Student
      or U-Mann Whitney according to the type of distribution of the variables. To evaluate the
      effect of the intervention, body fat deltas and biochemical measurements will be calculated
      by subtracting the final value (after 16 weeks of intervention) from the initial (baseline)
      value and statistical significance will be evaluated using comparisons between groups with
      paired t- or Wilcoxon. Covariance analysis control of confounding variables (ANCOVA) will be
      carried out.
