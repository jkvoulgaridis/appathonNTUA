  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the impact of safety behaviors (i.e., unnecessary protective actions) on
      outcomes of exposure therapy for spider phobia. Researchers will compare exposure therapy
      with (a) no safety behaviors, (b) safety behaviors faded toward the end of treatment, and (c)
      unfaded safety behaviors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some studies suggest that safety behaviors might undermine the efficacy of exposure therapy
      (Powers et al., 2010), whereas other studies suggest that there is no difference in exposure
      therapy outcomes whether or not safety behaviors are used (Deacon et al., 2010). Mixed
      findings could be explained by the parameters of safety behaviors use, such as whether they
      are used throughout the full course of therapy or faded toward the end of therapy. This will
      be the first study to directly compare the impact of faded and unfaded safety behaviors on
      exposure therapy outcomes. Specifically, researchers will randomize participants with a fear
      of spiders to receive exposure therapy (a) without safety behavior use, (b) with faded safety
      behavior use, and (c) with un-faded safety behavior use. Researchers will compare each
      condition's impact on fear reduction and on the tolerability/acceptability of treatment.

    <description>Participants will approach a live, non-poisonous tarantula, placed on the floor, at the opposite end of the room. The participant will walk toward the spider during this test. The test is over when the participant has reached the hardest step that they can complete at that time.
During this BAT, investigators will assess fear response behaviorally by recording the most challenging step completed (range, steps 0 -12).</description>

    <description>Participants will approach a live, non-poisonous tarantula, placed in a clear tank on a table, at the opposite end of the room. The test is over when the participant has reached the hardest step that they can complete at that time. Steps include walking toward the spider and lowering one hand into the tank.
During this BAT, investigators will assess fear response behaviorally by recording the most challenging step completed (range, steps 0-21).</description>
