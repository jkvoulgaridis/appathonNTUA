  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteochondral defects (OCDs) of the talus have a significant impact on the quality of life of
      patients. When OCDs are of small nature (up to 15 mm in diameter), and have failed
      conservative management, surgical intervention may be necessary. For small cystic defects the
      current treatment is an arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation (BMS) procedure, during which
      the damaged cartilage is resected and the subchondral bone is microfractured (MF), in order
      to disrupt intraosseous blood vessels and thereby introduce blood and bone marrow cells into
      the debrided lesion, forming a microfracture fibrin clot, which contains a dilute stem cell
      population from the underlying bone marrow. This procedure has been reported to have a 75%
      successful long-term outcome. Recently, the additional use of biological adjuncts has become
      popular, one of them being bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) from the iliac crest. BMAC
      consists of mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and growth factors, which may
      therefore theoretically improve the quality of subchondral plate and cartilage repair. The
      current evidence for treating talar OCDs with BMS plus BMAC is limited and heterogeneous. It
      is unclear to what extent the treatment of talar OCDs with BMS plus BMAC is beneficial in
      comparison to BMS alone.
