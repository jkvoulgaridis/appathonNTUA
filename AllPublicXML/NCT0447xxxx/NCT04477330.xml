  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achieving functional ambulation post stroke continues to be a challenge for stroke survivors,
      clinicians, and researchers. In the effort to enhance outcomes of motor training, cortical
      priming using brain stimulation has emerged as a promising adjuvant to conventional
      rehabilitation. This project focuses on the development of a long term gait rehabilitation
      protocol using brain stimulation to improve walking outcomes in people with stroke. The
      project will also aim to understand the neural mechanisms that are associated with response
      to the intervention.
