  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the influence of skincare products containing chemicals such as parabens
      and phthalates on the skin microbiome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin serves as a critical barrier between our bodies and the environment and the locus for a
      diverse and active microbial community. The composition and metabolic activity of the
      microbial community on the skin is presumably influenced by the local chemical environment,
      which includes natural skin lipids (e.g., squalene and sapienic acid), components of personal
      care products applied directly to skin, and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) that
      reach the skin through gas phase absorption, dust deposition, and direct contact with
      surfaces. Common semi-volatile ingredients in skin care products include phthalates,
      parabens, and UV blocking compounds (e.g., oxybenzone, octocrylene or homosalate).

      The investigators have recently demonstrated a method of collecting chemicals from areas of
      skin with infrequent direct dermal contact using alcohol wipes to assess passive air to skin
      partitioning of both target and nontarget compounds (Garrido et al., in review).
      Low-volatility reaction products can accumulate in skin oils and act as skin irritants, with
      the potential of being absorbed into the bloodstream. With methods developed for chemical and
      microbiome sampling, the overall goal of the proposed research is to develop an understanding
      of the two-way interaction between organic chemicals on the skin and the composition of the
      skin microbiome.

    <description>Demonstrate the ability to detect chemicals (specifically parabens) found in common ingredients in personal care products on human skin. Collection of isopropyl alcohol forehead wipe and subsequent detection and quantification of parabens by GC-QTOF-MS (gas chromatography) and LC-QTOF-MS (liquid chromatography). Comparisons between baseline, week 1, and week 2 will be made.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Influence of skincare product ingredient (specifically parabens) on facial skin microbiome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Document changes in microbial community composition following application of skin care ingredients of controversial concern (parabens) in comparison with changes following application of products not containing these ingredients. This is assessed by facial swab collections, DNA extraction, and determination of a list of specific bacterial species present at each time point. Comparisons between baseline, week 1, and week 2 will be made.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals aged 15 and over

          -  No known medical conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with
             study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have been on any medication (including antibiotics, probiotics,
             prebiotics) that has caused a change in current skin composition of interest based on
             the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Individuals with systemic antibiotic use within last 60 days.

          -  Individuals with topical antibiotic use on the test sites within last 30 days

          -  Individuals unwilling/unable to avoid topical antibiotics, systemic antibiotics,
             prebiotics, and probiotics during study.

          -  No other interfering skin products should be used during duration of study.
             (Paraben-free &amp; phthalate-free personal product &quot;safe&quot; list will be provided for other
             uses during study period if needed).
