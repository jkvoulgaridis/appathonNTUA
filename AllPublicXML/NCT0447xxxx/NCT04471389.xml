  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential hypertension is a complex trait that results from interaction between environmental
      factors and genetic factors. Salt sensitivity is the genetic susceptibility of blood pressure
      to salt, and it is an intermediate genetic phenotype of essential hypertension. This study
      aims to investigate the effects of interaction between salt sensitivity genomics and
      environmental factors on long-term blood pressure (BP) and target organ damage based on two
      established cohorts including &quot;the cohort of Hanzhong adolescent hypertension study&quot; and &quot;the
      cohort of Mei county adult salt-sensitive hypertension study&quot;. Firstly, the Hanzhong
      cohort-based follow-up study is designed to observe the track of BP from childhood, and to
      explore the effects of many risk factors (such as salt-sensitivity, obesity et al) on
      long-term BP changes and the occurrence of TODs. In addition, by using DNA samples collected
      from subjects of &quot;Mei county adult salt-sensitive hypertension study&quot; in which all
      participants had completed a chronic salt loading and potassium intervention trial,
      investigators attempt to carry out whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome DNA methylation
      and transcriptome detection, and analyze the relationship between salt sensitivity genomics
      and BP responses to dietary sodium/potassium intervention, long-term BP change, the risk of
      target organ damages. Investigators aim to explore the role of risk factors, including salt
      sensitivity, in the development of hypertension, and to illustrate the effects of interaction
      between salt sensitivity genomics and environmental factors on hypertension and target organ
      damage. This study would enable the investigators to further explore the genetic mechanism of
      essential hypertension, to identify new genetic markers for predicting early hypertension and
      target organ damage as well as to provide the basis for the prevention, targeted treatment,
      and new drugs development of hypertension in the future.

      This study is a longitudinal cohort follow-up study. The main contents include:

      (1) Questionnaire design: the questionnaire is designed according to the research contents
      and purposes. The standard questionnaires will be used to collect the general information,
      dietary habits, lifestyle, medical history, and family history etc. (2) Anthropometric
      measurements: blood pressure, pulse, height, body weight, waist and hip circumference will be
      acquired by medical practitioners who received professional training based on World Health
      Organization (WHO) standards, and passed relevant examinations. (3) Blood and urine samples
      collection: morning fasting blood, nocturia, and 24-hour urine specimen will be collected by
      medical staffs, and blind tubes will be set up according to 5% of the total samples. Blood
      biochemistries including serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
      triglycerides, fasting glucose, creatinine and hsCRP can be measured using automatic
      biochemical analyzer. The sodium and potassium concentrations in the urine will be measured
      by flame photometry. The total sodium and potassium excretions in urine in 24h were
      calculated by multiplying the concentration and 24-h volume of urine. (4) Auxiliary
      examinations: Auxiliary examinations including carotid intima-media thickness,
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation (FMD), measurements of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity
      (baPWV) and electrocardiographic parameters. The measurement will be done in hospitals by
      medical practitioners who received professional trainings and passed relevant examinations.
      (5) Whole-exome sequencing: Genomic DNA will be isolated from blood samples and subjected to
      exome capture, followed by next-generation sequencing on the Roche NimbleGen system. (6)
      Whole-genome DNA methylation analysis: levels of DNA methylation will be quantified using the
      Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip array (HM450K). (7) Transcriptome sequencing:
      cDNA libraries will be sequenced via the Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 platform. (8) Data processing
      and statistics: investigators should input the data to the database, and utilize software
      such as Access, SPSS, STATA, CASAVA, MutSigCV, and Genome MuSic to analyze. (9) Quality
      control: ① Questionnaire is strictly designed and amended by epidemiologists and clinical
      experts. ② A standardized &quot;Investigator Handbook&quot; will be stipulated according to the
      guidelines. ③ Staff members are required to do a rigorous training and pass the exam. ④ The
      investigation process will be strictly supervised by the principal investigator. ⑤ Data entry
      uses the parallel double-entry method. ⑥ During laboratory testing, blank control and blind
      detection are applied to ensure the quality. ⑦ Data analysis is performed by 2-3
      postgraduates, inconsistent data need to be double-checked.

        In March and April 1987, investigators established the cohort of Hanzhong Adolescent
        Hypertension Study. A total of 4,623 adolescents aged 6-15 years old in over 20 schools of
        three towns (Qili, Laojun and Shayan) in Hanzhong, Shaanxi, China were recruited. In
        2003-2004, investigators established the cohort of Mei county adult salt-sensitive
        hypertension Study. This study was a family-based dietary intervention study conducted in a
        Han Chinese population from rural areas of northern China. A total of 675 subjects from 126
