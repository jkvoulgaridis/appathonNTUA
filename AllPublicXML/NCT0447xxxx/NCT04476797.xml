  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GTI-4711-101 is a Phase 1-2 study of the safety of GC4711, and its potential to reduce
      radiation-related pulmonary injury due to SBRT for early stage large or central localized
      NSCLC. After an open-label, Phase 1, safety cohort of approximately 5 subjects has been
      completed, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 portion will be conducted.

      Subjects must be referred for SBRT with large (&gt;3cm) or central localized, node negative,
      non-metastatic NSCLC, and have an ECOG PS score of 0-3 to be considered for enrollment.
      Subjects with small peripheral lesions(≤3cm) are excluded, as the aim is to improve outcome
      in larger, central NSCLC carrying a higher risk of pneumonitis, as well as poorer local
      control. Feasibility of SBRT is judged by the treating physician. Chemotherapy given before
      SBRT is permitted, but subjects must be immunotherapy naive.

      SBRT is planned on the (persistent) PET+ tumor location for a dose of 10-12 Gy in 5
      fractions, delivered on sequential weekdays. In the Phase 1, 5 subjects will each receive
      GC4711 by 15-minute IV infusion, before each SBRT fraction After the Phase 1, a Phase 2,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study phase will be initiated, wherein
      approximately 66 subjects referred for SBRT with early stage large or central localized NSCLC
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either GC4711 or placebo given intravenously
      (IV) before each fraction of SBRT.

      All subjects will be evaluated for changes in the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide
      (DLCO) and pneumonitis. All subjects will be followed for 12 months for treatment related
      adverse effects, disease control (Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS),
      Distant Metastases (DM) rate and local control-(RECSIST 1.1), and quality of life (FACT-L) A
      Data Monitoring Committee will be established for the Phase 2 portion of the study to provide
      independent monitoring of safety given the blinded design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects at least 18 years of age.

          2. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          3. Histological or biopsy proven NSCLC. For peripheral lesions, cytology and/or clear
             imaging-guided suspicion is accepted if histology cannot be obtained.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0-3.

          5. Large (&gt;3cm) or centrally localized (within 2cm in all directions around the proximal
             bronchial tree, including ultra-central tumors, abutting the bronchial tree or
             trachea), node negative and non-metastatic NSCLC, judged acceptable for SBRT by the
             treating Investigator. Staged with FDG-PET/CT, brain CT or MRI with contrast and/or
             mediastinoscopy, measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.
