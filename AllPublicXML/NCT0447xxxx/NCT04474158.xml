      This community-partnered cluster-randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness
      of a trauma-sensitive, gender-transformative youth violence prevention program that
      integrates racism and discrimination prevention.

      Set in 24 neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with concentrated social and economic
      disadvantage, this study addresses gender and racial injustice through a series of group
      discussions, bringing together adolescents ages 14-19 with law enforcement officers in a
      process of social restoration.

    <intervention_model_description>This cluster-randomized community-partnered study will examine the effectiveness of a trauma-sensitive, gender transformative youth violence prevention program called Creating Peace that integrates racism and discrimination prevention among youth ages 14-19. The study will be located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania across 24 neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage ('clusters'), randomized either to receive the &quot;Creating Peace&quot; program (i.e., intervention neighborhood, n=12) or to a job skills training program (n=12 schools).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Creating Peace uses a group discussion format with activities that explore race, gender, sexual identity, and social class. Creating Peace is a 12 session curriculum designed to support youth ages 14-19 in healing from experiences of trauma by restoring social connections, strengthening positive coping strategies that exclude all forms of violence, challenging gender norms that foster violence perpetration, and practicing positive bystander intervention skills to intervene safely with peers' disrespectful and harmful behaviors. Through 12 sessions (3 hours/session) over a 4 to 12 week period, Creating Peace offers gender transformative content combined with youth leadership development. Near program conclusion, youth will offer guidance to law enforcement on interacting with youth in a process of social restoration.</description>
