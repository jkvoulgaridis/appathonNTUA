  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of the multi-drug
      combination of abiraterone, cabozantinib, and nivolumab in conjunction with ongoing androgen
      deprivation therapy in previously untreated metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of cabozantinib and abiraterone
      acetate/prednisone in conjunction with nivolumab will have an acceptable safety profile and
      will be feasible to administer in patients with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.

    <measure>Frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of 1st cycle of treatment for patients in dose level 1 &amp; dose level 2 (estimated to be 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Hematologic DLT is defined as any of the following that occurs during the 1st cycle that is attributed as possibly/probably/definitely related to treatment: Grade 4 neutropenia &gt;7 days duration; Febrile neutropenia of any duration with temperature &gt;38.5 °C; Grade 4 anemia which requires transfusion therapy on more than 2 occasions in 7 days; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia which requires transfusion therapy on more than 2 occasions in 7 days
Non-hematologic DLT is defined as any possibly/probably/definitely related grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity that occurs during the 1st cycle except:Grade 3/4 nausea, vomiting, or anorexia that returns to Grade 1 prior to the start of cycle 2; Grade 3 triglycerides will only be considered a DLT for patients who have grade 3 despite appropriate lipid-lowering drug therapy; Grade 3 rash will only be considered a DLT for patients who have received 2 weeks of supportive care treatment with no improvement; Grade 3 diarrhea or Grade 3 colitis lasting ≤7 days</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSA response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Through end of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-PSA response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who have PSA response as defined by at least 50% decline in PSA level from baseline measured twice at least 3 weeks apart. Based on the PCWG3 criteria, a favorable effect on PSA may be delayed for ≥ 12 weeks. Therefore, early rises in PSA before 12 weeks will not be considered when determining PSA response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through end of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment through 1 year of follow-up (estimated to be 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Defined as time of enrollment to time of death from any cause</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment through 1 year of follow-up (estimated to be 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of first PCWG3 defined progression or death, the event that occurs first. Patients who have not experienced either event at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of their last progression assessment.
For rising PSA after an initial decline from baseline, the PSA is recorded from the start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2ng/mL above the nadir, which is confirmed by a second value 4 or more weeks later, confirming a rising trend. If there is no initial decline from baseline, PSA progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks.</description>

          -  Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study participation.

               -  Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture.

               -  Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.

               -  Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).

                    -  Active hepatitis B or C; active HIV.

                    -  Major surgery (e.g., GI surgery removal or biopsy of brain metastasis)
                       within eight weeks before the first dose of study treatment. Complete wound
                       healing from major surgery must have occurred one month before the first
                       dose and from minor surgery (e.g., simple excision, tooth extraction) at
                       least ten days before the first dose. Patients with clinically relevant
                       ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.
