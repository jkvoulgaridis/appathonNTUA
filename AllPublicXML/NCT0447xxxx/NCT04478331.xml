  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity (PA) is essential throughout bariatric surgery (BS) management,
      especially for the long-term maintenance of weight loss. To optimize physical activity
      counseling and monitoring, the use of technology seems appropriate and effective. A recent
      meta-analysis provided proof of efficacy for mobile technology to increase physical activity
      or weight loss in the short term. Videoconferencing may also be effective, especially as it
      reduces the barriers related to face-to-face physical activity interventions. Both
      technologies (mobile and videoconferencing) seem particularly interesting for bariatric
      surgery management, but their long-term effects on physical activity maintenance are unknown.
      Moreover, the mechanisms underlying their effectiveness, such as technology acceptability and
      motivational processes, have not been examined.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of two technology-based PA post-BS
      resumption programs (mobile technology and videoconferencing) compared to standard care
      one-year after BS and the contribution of acceptability and motivational mechanisms in
      explaining these effects on behavioral measure of PA, physical measures, and health
      indicators.

      One hundred and twenty young women undergoing bariatric surgery will be included. Prior to
      the surgery, the volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: standard care
      (CONTROL), access to an internet-based physical activity program delivered by an eHealth
      platform associated with an activity bracelet (ACTI-MOBIL), or access to a physical activity
      program delivered via videoconferencing (ACTI-VISIO). The technology-based physical activity
      programs will take place from the third to sixth month after surgery. The primary outcome is
      the distance traveled during a 6-minute walk test relativized according to Capadaglio's
      theoretical distance. Secondary outcomes are behavioral measures of physical activity,
      physical measures, health indicators, technology acceptability, and motivational concepts.
      Data will be collected prior to bariatric surgery, and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. A
      mixed model approach will be used to analyze the change in outcomes over time for each group.

      This study will provide information on the effects of two technology-based physical activity
      programs (mobile technology and videoconferencing) after bariatric surgery. Based on the
      results, recommendations for implementing these programs will be made.

    <measure>Change of motivation for physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-bariatric surgery (BS), Month 3 after BS, Month 6 after BS, Month 12 after BS</time_frame>
    <description>The motivation for health-oriented PA will be measured with a French motivation scale for health-oriented PA (Boiché et al., 2016). This scale comprises 18 items, equally distributed across the six motivational constructs of self-determination theory: intrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, external regulation, and amotivation. Participants will respond on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1: &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 7: &quot;strongly agree.&quot; Higher scores indicating the most predominant type of motivation on the self-determination continuum.</description>

    <measure>Change of general causality orientations scale for physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-bariatric surgery (BS), Month 3 after BS, Month 6 after BS, Month 12 after BS</time_frame>
    <description>Causality orientations will be measured using an adaptation of the General Causality Orientations Scale (Vallerand et al., 1987) to assess the strength of three motivational orientations (i.e., autonomy, control, impersonal) in the context of PA in a medical environment. The scale comprises seven vignettes and 21 items. Each vignette describes a situation and is followed by three items, one per motivational orientation, to which participants respond on a 7-point scale ranging from 1: &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 7: &quot;strongly agree.&quot; The higher scores indicating the most predominant type of causality orientation.</description>

    <description>The two PA sessions per week will be delivered via videoconferencing (developed by Mooven™). The PA program consists in tailored adapted PA sessions led by a professional specialized in adapted PA. These sessions were specifically designed to be appropriate for the population and were developed in collaboration with the authors to ensure standardization of the recommended volume of PA. The PA sessions will be given live, individually at the beginning and then in groups of four women. During sessions, the professional and the participants will interact simultaneously, and the execution of the exercises will be monitored and adapted live by the professional. To ensure the safety of the PA, a rating of perceived exertion will be requested after each session on a 10-point scale. If the RPE exceed 7, the professional specialized in adapted PA will adjust the training load. In addition to the exercises, the sessions will also include advice and tips for reaching the recommended PA level.</description>

    <description>The PA sessions will be delivered by an eHealth platform (developed by BePatient™) associated with an activity bracelet. The researchers enrich PA content on the platform and ensure standardization of the recommended volume of PA. The platform consists of tips for reaching the PA level, PA questionnaires, PA feedback measured by the activity bracelet, and a video demonstration of PA sessions performed by a peer. The PA sessions are automatically broadcasted twice a week for 12 weeks and begin 3 months after BS. To ensure the safety of the PA, the sessions were designed to be appropriate for this population and the RPE will be measured after each session on a 10-point scale. If the RPE exceeds 7 for 3 consecutive sessions, the training load will be adjusted. The platform will also include a variety of content, including dietary tips, obesity-related facts, information about surgery, and frequently asked questions.</description>
