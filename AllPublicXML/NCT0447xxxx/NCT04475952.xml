  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper digestive tract cancer (UDC) is a major disease burden worldwide encompassing all
      cancers involving the digestive tract (from oral cavity to duodenum). A majority of patients
      presenting with this disease are diagnosed late and have poor overall survival rates (&lt;20%).
      NICE referral guidelines for diagnostic endoscopy are usually associated with late disease.
      Exhaled breath testing is a non-invasive and acceptable technology utilising mass
      spectrometry (MS) which has shown promise at diagnosing cancer at an early stage.

      Previous research has shown that products formed as a result of metabolism can be measured in
      breath and saliva (biomarkers). This has the ability to accurately identify patients with
      upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers from breath. Our initial pilot data has demonstrated
      that changes in the breakdown of metabolites release volatile organic compounds (VOC) which
      can be measured with MS. This data is supported by other patient studies. However no previous
      study has been performed utilising a non-invasive technique with breath and saliva. Thus the
      aim of this study is to identify VOCs present in patients with this disease.

      In this multi-centre study the investigators want to overcome the limitations of previous
      work by utilising non-invasive samples (breath, saliva and urine) in patients in multiple
      sites. The investigators aim to conduct a study in patients with UDC and those without. The
      investigators hope that the results of this study will provide evidence for large scale
      analysis of patients with this disease, demonstrate the feasibility of this technique and
      move this valuable test forward into mainstream medical practice. The major advantage of this
      test is that it is easy to undertake and painless for the patient. This study of products in
      breath, saliva and urine will be useful for detecting UDC to allow treatment at an early
      stage, improving overall survival.

        Patients recruited from secondary care will have been referred by their responsible
        clinician to undergo either a laryngoscopy (which involves visualisation of the highest
        part of the oesophagus, larynx and vocal cords, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (which
        involves a telescope test to visualise the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum) or a lower
        gastrointestinal endoscopy (which involves a telescope test to visualise the colon) or
        surgery. No other investigations will be required.
