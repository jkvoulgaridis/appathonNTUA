  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quizartinib is a novel oral Class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor exhibiting
      highly potent and selective but reversible inhibition of Feline McDonough sarcoma (FMS)-like
      tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Quizartinib is currently being studied alone or in combination with
      other agents as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) in adult and pediatric populations.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      quizartinib and its pharmacologically active metabolite AC886 after a single oral dose of 30
      mg in participants with moderate hepatic impairment (HI) (as defined by National Cancer
      Institute-Organ Dysfunction Working Group [NCI-ODWG] criteria) compared to the healthy
      control participants with normal hepatic function.
