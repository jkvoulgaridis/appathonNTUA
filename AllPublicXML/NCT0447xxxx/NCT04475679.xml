  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A post market clinical follow up study (PMCF) with Adhese Universal DC is planned to ensure
      the safety and efficacy of the product. It is a study with two arms. Inlays and onlays for
      molars and premolars will be luted with Adhese Universal DC or Adhese Universal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the long-term safety of Adhese Universal DC in terms of tooth
      vitality and failure rate of placed restorations. Tooth vitality is an indicator for the
      health status of the dental pulp. A vitality test is performed to acquire information about
      the vitality of teeth. A healthy dental pulp offers a positive response to the vitality test.
      Once the dental pulp is injured an irreversible inflammatory reaction starts with a possible
      necrosis of the dental pulp. Pulpa necrosis is followed by a negative response to the
      vitality test.
