  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is considered an efficacious procedure for relieving pain and
      disability in patients with hip osteoarthritis. However, 6-12 months post-surgery physical
      activity level is unchanged compared to pre-surgery and still considerably lower than that of
      healthy peers. Increasing physical activity after THA may enhance the outcome of the THA
      because a graded relationship between physical activity level and functional performance has
      been documented. Six-8 months after THA physical function is only recovered to about 80% of
      that of healthy peers and older adults still seem to be at increased risk of frailty.
      Furthermore, these patients continue to impose higher healthcare costs than an age- and
      sex-matched reference population which potentially could be related to the functional status
      that is not completely regained. Finally, patients with hip osteoarthritis can have extensive
      comorbidity thus increasing physical activity after THA could be a simple and relatively
      inexpensive method for improving general health, which in turn may decrease healthcare costs.

      The reasons for the lack of increase in physical activity despite increased capability after
      THA are unknown but it may be related to the sedentary behavior adopted by the patients prior
      to surgery and uncertainty. A systematic review has illuminated that patient-reported
      barriers to engaging in physical activity after THA are largely related to limited or
      inadequate information or education culminating in uncertainty about 'doing the right thing'
      for both the individual's recovery and the longevity of the joint replacement.

      Few studies have investigated the effects of specific interventions to increase physical
      activity after THA. Promising results have been shown from physical activity sensors in
      combination with e.g. goal setting. None of these studies have addressed the patient-reported
      barriers to physical activity regarding uncertainty and limited education.

      This trial aims to investigate the effect of adding a pedometer-driven, behavior change
      intervention to usual rehabilitation care 3 months after THA to increase physical activity
      compared to usual rehabilitation care alone (control). Outcomes are taken 3 (baseline), 6
      (after the intervention period) and 12 months after THA (follow-up).

      Hypothesis: the behavior change intervention will increase the proportion that completes
      ≥8,000 steps per day 6-month post-surgery to 50% versus 30% in the control group.

    <description>It is a 3-month, multimodal, minimal contact, pedometer-driven, behavior change intervention to promote and support physical activity, that is initiated 3 months after THA. There is one initial, physiotherapist-led, face-to-face, physical activity counselling including 1) a brief motivational interviewing regarding physical activity, 2) patient education regarding physical activity after THA including recommendations and safety based on an &quot;orthopedic surgeon guided&quot; video and leaflet, 3) handling out pedometer and educational material i.e. a practice-oriented leaflet with advice on how to use a pedometer, a step-calendar and goal setting as well as strategies to incorporate physical activity into daily life. This initial counselling is followed by two, physiotherapist-led, telephone-assisted counselling after respectively three and seven weeks.</description>
