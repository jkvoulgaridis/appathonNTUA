  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome of this study will be the assessment of distress as measured by the non-blinded observer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Periprocedural</time_frame>
    <description>The non-blinded observer will use the Observation Scale of Behavioral Distress (OSBD) to assess the periprocedural distress of the child. The OSBD records the presence or absence of thirteen operationally-defined behaviors, which indicate discomfort (e.g. cry, verbal resistance, information seeking) at 15-second intervals throughout the procedure. The behaviors are given a score ranging from 1 to 4 according to the severity of distress that is expressed by that behavior. The recorded score during a 15-second interval can range from zero (no distress) to 33.5 (extreme distress). The total scores will be summed up and then divided by the number of 15-second intervals to obtain a mean distress score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Periprocedural distress as measured by the blinded observer</measure>
    <time_frame>Periprocedural</time_frame>
    <description>The blinded observer rates the child's distress on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not anxious at all) to 3 (extremely anxious). Ratings are based on facial features, crying, and physical movements. The blinded observer reports the highest (i.e. peak), most common (i.e. typical),and the lowest level of distress. We will compare the highest and most common levels of distress between groups, as we believed these levels of distress are most clinically relevant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child-reported levels of distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Right after anorectal manometry (same day)</time_frame>
    <description>The child will be asked to rate the amount of distress experienced (unpleasantness, nervousness, and anxiety) during the manometry on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). They are also asked to rate the pain of the procedure on an analogous scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extremely painful). Children who received hypnosis are asked if they believed that it helped them to relax on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</description>

    <measure>Parent-reported levels of distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Right after anorectal manometry (same day)</time_frame>
    <description>The parent accompanying the child will be asked to rate the amount of distress of the child (unpleasantness, nervousness, and anxiety) during the manometry on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). They are also asked to rate the pain of the procedure on an analogous scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extremely painful). Parents of children who received hypnosis are asked if they believed that it helped the child to relax on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</description>

    <description>The motility nurse will report if all parts of the procedure could be performed properly and rates the degree of difficulty of the procedure on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</description>
