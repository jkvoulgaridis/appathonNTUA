    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center Phase II clinical trial intended to observe
      and evaluate the efficacy and safety of famitinib malate in treating iCCA(Intrahepatic
      Cholangiocarcinoma ) patients with FGFR2 genetic aberrations who failed first-line therapy.
