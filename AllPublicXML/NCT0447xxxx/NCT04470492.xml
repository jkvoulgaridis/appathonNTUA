      The primary objective of the study will be to determine whether remote limb ischemic
      conditioning (RLIC) together with conventional medication therapy compared with only
      medication therapy reduces the 3-month risk of composite cardio-cerebral vascular event in
      patients with a recent TIA or IS caused by occlusion of a cerebral artery.

      After screening period, eligible patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups.In
      addition, all participants receive an usual clinical therapy.

    <textblock>
      In this study, Patients in the RLIC group will be treated with Renqiao Remote Ischemic
      Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (200mmHg) twice daily and conventional medication; patients
      in the control group will be treated only with conventional medication. In the study, the
      RLIC treatment will be comprised of 5 cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia and
      reperfusion, which will be induced by 2 cuffs placed around the upper arms respectively and
      inflated to 200mmHg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation.
