      Aim of the study is to assess the rate of postoperative intraretinal cystoid changes after
      pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling and peribulbar application of triamcinolone
      acetonide and to examine possible risk factors for postoperative intraretinal cystoid
      changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epiretinal membranes (ERM) are disorders leading to vision loss and metamorphopsia.
      Vitrectomy with membrane peeling has developed to be the gold-standard in treatment of ERM.
      Nevertheless, there are about 10% of patients having intraretinal cystoid changes after
      surgery with potential for disturbance of visual acuity. The aim of the study is to assess
      the rate of postoperative intraretinal cystoid changes after pars plana vitrectomy with
      membrane peeling and peribulbar application of triamcinolone acetonide and to examine
      possible risk factors for postoperative intraretinal cystoid changes.

        Patients having undergone pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling and periocular
        application of triamcinolone acetonide at the end of surgery between June 2019 and January
        2020 at the department of Ophthalmology of the Hanusch Hospital in Vienna, Austria, were
        selected for the study

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of an ERM

          -  indication for membrane peeling defined as significant loss of vision and/or
             metamorphopsia due to the ERM

          -  application of periocular triamcinolone acetonide at the end of surgery

          -  at least one follow-up examination present in the patient's history

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  macular edema caused by conditions other than ERM (such as choroidal
             neovascularization, diabetic macular edema, etc.)
