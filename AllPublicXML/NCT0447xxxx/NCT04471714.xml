    <textblock>
      This study examines the role of the GABA-B receptor in long-lasting presynaptic inhibition of
      primary afferents in human participants. Participants will come in for two visits, receiving
      baclofen (a GABA-B receptor agonist) on one visit and a placebo during the other.
      Electro-physiological measures will be use during both visit to asses presynaptic inhibition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability to execute purposeful movements relies on sensory information coming from the
      body. This sensory information tells us where are limbs are in relation to the rest of our
      body (posture sense), how fast they are moving (kinesthetic sense), how forcefully we are
      making a contraction (muscular sense) and if we are being contacted by external objects,
      changes in temperature, pain, etc (somatic sense). Without these senses, we could not make
      well controlled movements or navigate in our environment safely. Because of the importance of
      these sensory inputs, the nervous system has designed a highly regulated system to control
      the amount and quality of sensory inflow entering into both the spinal cord and brain. We
      wish to re-investigate how sensory pathways from our body controls the inflow of sensory
      inputs in adults with and without neurological injury. Specifically, we want to test if the
      long-lasting suppression of sensory inflow by other sensory nerves is regulated by GABA-B
      receptors. We will test this by giving participants the GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen.
      Nerve stimulation and muscle responses will be used to understand how sensory transmission is
      being controlled in the spinal cord and the GABA-B receptors involvement. Results from these
      studies will provide important fundamental information about how normal sensory inflow is
      controlled so that we can better understand how it may be altered after injury to the brain
      and spinal cord. This information will open new avenues of study into the treatment of
      sensory-related dysfunction such as spasticity and motor incoordination that occurs after
      central nervous system injury or disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 65 years.

          -  General good health

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications to baclofen such as a known hypersensitivity to baclofen, renal
             impairment, stroke, epilepsy, pregnancy and lactation.

          -  Injury to peripheral nerves or muscles. Injury to nerves or muscles will confound the
             interpretation of the spinal reflex data.

          -  Participants with spinal cord injury already taking oral baclofen to manage
             spasticity.
