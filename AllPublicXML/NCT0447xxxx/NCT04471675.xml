  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, single-center, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion Phase I
      clinical study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The aim of this study is designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of
      albumin-bound formulation of docetaxel for intravenous infusion in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in two stages. The first stage (Stage I) is a dose-escalation study.
      A classic 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patients with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to
      receive sequentially higher doses of albumin-bound formulation of docetaxel once every three
      weeks (a Cycle) by intravenous infusion, starting at a dose of 50mg/m2. Patients will receive
      the albumin-bound formulation of docetaxel

    <time_frame>21 days.</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE.</description>
