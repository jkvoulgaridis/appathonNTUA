      The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the transmission of
      respiratory diseases and the correct wearing of masks, as well as the factors affecting the
      correct wearing of masks. The research is beneficial to the prevention of respiratory
      diseases and moves the barrier of prevention and control forward. It is of great significance

      1. Overall design：This study uses the methods of cross-sectional survey and chance
           sampling.

        2. Sign the Informed Consent Form.

        3. Investigation on the basic situation of personnel: The gender, age and education level
           of the subjects were analyzed as the factors influencing whether the mask was worn
           correctly or not.

        4. Investigation on the types of wearing masks： 1) The types of masks worn by the subjects
           were recorded as the basis of stratified statistics.

      2) Mask suitability testing：

        1. Visual inspection whether the mask is close to the face with obvious gaps.

        2. Breathing test whether it can blow the cotton wool under the eyes when the subject
           taking a deep breath.

        3. Spray test The FT-30 qualitative fitness test system of 3M company was used to test the
           suitability and correctness of wearing mask.

      In the spray test, all subjects underwent a sensitivity test to prove their ability to smell
      the bitterness of the reagent, and then were randomly divided into a hood group and a direct
      spray group.

      In order to objectively reflect the overall situation of the subjects, it is necessary to
      cover many ages and educational levels of men and women.

      Each subject participated in the study for about 5-6 minutes, and the total duration of this
      study was about 3 months.
