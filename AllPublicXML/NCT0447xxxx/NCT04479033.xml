  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two phases - i) a comprehensive assessment of biopsychosocial needs
      among cognitively impaired persons and their family caregivers residing in the Whampoa
      residential estate in Singapore ; ii) a quasi-experimental evaluation of a pilot
      community-based dementia care programme administered by a multidisciplinary team of service
      providers. The intervention is a physician-enhanced dementia-specific care management
      programme that supports client dyads for up to six months and through community care
      management, person-centred communication, management of challenging behaviours,
      psychoeducation, geriatric medicine, and gerontological approaches. The intervention team
      consists of a nurse, social worker, care manager, physician, and 'Dementia Care Program
      Assistants' who specifically design personalised meaningful activities to engage persons
      living with dementia as well as provide caregivers with training in basic dementia
      caregiving.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To provide appropriate care for persons living with dementia (PLWDs) in the community, their
      needs (met, unmet, and latent) and that of their caregivers must be understood holistically.
      Local studies have yet to comprehensively examine the experiences of community dwelling older
      persons living with moderate to severe dementia and their caregivers, and the impact of an
      integrated community model of health care and psychosocial support. This study adopts a
      mixed-method approach to needs assessment and programme evaluation using qualitative in-depth
      interviews and quantitative surveys administered to participants assigned to control and
      intervention groups. The Hua-Mei Dementia Care System (HMDCS) is a programme that aims to
      empower and support both PLWDs and their caregivers through personalised care management,
      dementia-specific education, and cognitive training. The HMDCS addresses the multifaceted
      challenges faced by PLWD-caregiver dyads such as behavioural problems, psychological
      distress, lack of social participation, stigma, communication barriers, financial strain, and
      insufficient social support.

      The study aims are to:

        1. Explore the perceptions, behaviours, and underlying motivators and inhibitors of PLWDs,
           their caregivers, and members of the community

        2. Assess the health, social, psychological, and emotional needs of community dwelling
           PLWDs and their caregivers

        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the programme in reducing cognitive and functional
           decline, caregiver burden, as well as improving self-reported health status, social
           wellbeing, and quality of life of PLWD-caregiver dyads

    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination is a 30-point test to screen for cognitive impairment. Scores ranging from 20 to 26 indicate some cognitive impairment, 10-19 indicate moderate to severe cognitive impairment and below 10 indicate very severe cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>Zarit Burden Interview is a 22-item instrument for measuring the caregiver's perceived burden of providing care. Questions focus on caregiver's health, psychological well-being, finances, social life and relationship between the caregiver and the PLWD.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in memory and behaviour problems at week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist is a 24-item (scored on a scale of 0-4) caregiver-report to measure behavioral problems in PLWDs. The items can be summed as a total score and 3 subscale scores in the domains of memory, depression, and disruptive behaviors. Parallel scores for caregiver reaction are also obtained. Such disruptive and challenging behaviors undermine quality of life in PWDs and place both an emotional and financial burden on their caregivers.</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness of the new model of care will be assessed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with respect to the control group. Cost will be assessed by recording utilization of health care and long-term care services and their average unit costs. The calculated ICER will show the cost of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved by the new model of care. Effectiveness will be assessed by computing the average quality-adjusted life years left to live by the dementia participant in both groups. As the intervention is not assumed to be life-extending, study groups will only differ through their quality of life as measured by EQ5D weights. We will account for the quality of life of both PLWDs and their caregivers and sum their respective contributions.</description>

    <description>An individualised care plan is developed for PLWDs-caregiver dyads who meet/communicate weekly with various members of the HMDCS team depending on the nature of their needs. Each dyad's care plan involves the diagnosis of problems (eg: memory problems, family conflicts, poor nutrition, fall risk, medication compliance, lack of long-term care arrangements), establishment of treatment goals (eg: caregiver education, awareness of long-term care planning, stabilising medical care at home, improving emotional support), and indicating specific interventions (eg: referrals to counsellors, specialist doctors, day rehabilitation centres; consultations at GP clinic; coordination of advanced care planning; installation of home safety devices; training caregivers to detect acute deterioration in PLWDs). Monitoring of the dyads' statuses and updating of care plans are performed throughout the duration of the programme.</description>
