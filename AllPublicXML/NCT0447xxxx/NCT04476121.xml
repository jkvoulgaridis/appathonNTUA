      The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of PRF application in case of alveolar
      osteitis.

      The main objective was to compare the effects of using two different methods in the treatment
      of dry socket (alveolar osteitis), which is a postoperative complication of dental
      extraction. The first was Nipas, applied, if dry socket was diagnosed following a tooth
      extraction. In case of subsequent extraction of homonymous tooth and reoccurrence of dry
      socket, patients were treated with application of PRF.

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate the relationship between intensity of pain after application of PRF and Nipas, , NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) pain scale is used.
NRS scale, ranges from 0 to 10; where 0 refers to no pain and 10 refers to most severe pain.</description>
