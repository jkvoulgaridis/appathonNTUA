    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if performing radiotherapy (SRS) prior to surgery
      results in better treatment outcomes than performing surgery before radiotherapy for patients
      with brain metastases.

      Brain metastases occur when cancer cells from a primary cancer (e.g. lung, breast, colon)
      travel through the bloodstream and spread (metastasize) to the brain. As these new tumors
      grow they apply pressure and change how healthy brain tissue works. This can lead to a loss
      of brain function and worsening quality of life. Treatments for patients whose cancer has
      spread to the brain is often surgery, radiation therapy (radiotherapy) or a combination of
      both.

      Surgery is one the main treatments for brain tumors. To remove the tumor, a neurosurgeon
      makes an opening in the skull and attempts to the remove the entire tumor. If the tumor is
      too close to important brain tissue, the surgeon may attempt to remove part of the tumor.
      Removal of the tumor from the brain tissue is called resection. The complete or partial
      removal of tumor helps to relieve symptoms by reducing pressure on healthy tissues and
      reduces the amount of tumor that needs to be treated by radiotherapy.

      One type of radiotherapy used to treat brain metastases is stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
      SRS uses many focused radiation beams to treat tumors within the brain. Unlike surgery, there
      is no incision or cut being made. Instead, SRS uses an accurate map of your brain to deliver
      a precise beam of radiation to the tumors. The radiation damages the tumor cells forcing them
      to shrink and die off. The focused radiation beams also limit damage to healthy brain tissue
      minimizing side effects.

      Surgery followed by radiotherapy is a standard treatment for brain metastases. However, there
      are still risks associated with the combination of treatments. This study plans to
      investigate whether performing surgery prior to SRS results in improved quality of life and
      decreased side effects.
