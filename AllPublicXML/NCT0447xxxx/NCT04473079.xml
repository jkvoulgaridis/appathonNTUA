  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for H. pylori eradication includes antibiotics. The treatment has decreased its
      efficiency (lower capability to eradicate the infection) due to increasing antibiotic
      resistance in the population. But the addition of probiotics to the treatment has been
      observed to increase efficiency, and decreasing the antibiotics' side effects. We set to
      evaluate whether Lacidofil® STRONG improves efficacy when added to the standard therapy to
      eradicate H. pylori.

      This study aims at evaluating the efficacy of Lacidofil® STRONG as an adjuvant therapy to a
      standard 14-day H. pylori eradication treatment among H. pylori-positive participants with
      non-ulcer dyspepsia.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, with two parallel arms. Participants will be
      randomized to receive probiotic or placebo as adjuvant to the standard anti-H. pylori
      treatment. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for 12 weeks, during which they
      will receive the anti-H. pylori treatment and co-administration of investigational product
      (IP; for two weeks), followed by IP supplementation alone (for four weeks), and they will be
      followed-up 4 weeks after last IP administration.
