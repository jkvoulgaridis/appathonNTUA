      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of BurstDR dorsal column stimulation,
      compared with comprehensive medical management, in improving pain and back-related physical
      function in subjects suffering with chronic, refractory axial low back pain with a
      neuropathic component, who have not had lumbar spine surgery and for whom surgery is not an
      option.

      A prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical study with an optional crossover
      component. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of BurstDR SCS in the treatment of
      chronic axial low back pain with a neuropathic component, compared to comprehensive medical
      management (CMM).

      Subjects will be followed in-clinic at 1,3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months and via phone call or
      optional clinic visit at 15- and 21-months. The primary endpoint will be assessed at the
      6-month follow-up visit. Upon completion of the 6-month follow-up visit, subjects who are
      dissatisfied with therapy and receiving inadequate improvement with their treatment
      assignment will be allowed to cross-over to the other treatment arm, if desired.

      The study will enroll up to 270 patients at up to 30 sites. Subjects will be randomized in a
      3:2 fashion to yield approximately 200 evaluable subjects for the primary endpoint analysis.
