  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although immunotherapy revolutionized melanoma outcomes over the last 10 years, only 40-50%
      of patients respond to treatments and 25% develop acquired resistances. Natural Killer (NK)
      cells naturally recognize and kill tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive
      micro-environment generated by the tumor decreases NK cells' killing activity. CD160 is a NK
      cell receptor identified and characterized in our laboratory. Engagement of the GPI isoform
      (CD160-GPI) initiates NK cell cytotoxic response. Upon NK cell activation, a transmembrane
      isoform (CD160-TM) is neo-synthesized which promotes the amplification of activated NK cell
      cytotoxicity.

      The aim of this study is to assess the phenotypic profile of advanced stages melanoma
      patients' NK cells (mainly CD160-TM expression or its induction) and therefore the
      therapeutic potential of the use of an anti-CD160-TM agonist antibody to boost the
      NK-dependent mechanism leading to tumor depletion.
