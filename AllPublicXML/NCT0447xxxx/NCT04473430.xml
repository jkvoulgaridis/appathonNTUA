      The study is conducted to examine the prevalence of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and estimate
      glycemic variability patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2), treated with insulin
      and receiving hemodialysis, to assess the accuracy of the CGM in this specific cohort, and to
      assess the efficacy of real-time CGM data in preventing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

      The study is conducted to examine the prevalence of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and estimate
      glycemic variability patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2), treated with insulin
      and receiving hemodialysis, to assess the accuracy of the CGM in this specific cohort, and to
      assess the efficacy of real-time CGM data in preventing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

      The study will provide novel insights into the glycemic exposure patterns among dialysis
      patients and will provide preliminary data for future outcomes-based studies determining the
      best glycemic targets for this group.

    <description>Dexcom G6, a factory-calibrated CGM system, is innovative in many aspects: 1) it does not require finger stick POC BG for calibration, 2) the sensor is small, compact, light-weight, 3) has no interference with several substance and drugs, and 4) protective &quot;urgent low soon&quot; alarm, with proven prediction of hypoglycemia within 20 minutes in advance. The sensor uses a novel semi-permeable membrane that blocks interference with most clinically relevant substances, including high levels of urea and creatinine, and commonly used medications. Dexcom G6 CGM is a commercially-available, minimally invasive sensor, with a flexible and thin wire that is inserted into the abdominal subcutaneous tissue.</description>
