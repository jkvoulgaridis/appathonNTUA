    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory clinical study to presume the optimum usage and dosage for a
      therapeutic confirmatory study by evaluating the efficacy and safety of TPN171H 5mg, 10mg,
      20mg or placebo administered orally in patients with erectile dysfunction. In conclusions,
      Patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) were administered placebo, TPN171H 5mg, 10mg or 20mg
      30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual intercourse for 8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study in 240 ED patients, which consists of 3 part: 1) a 4-week run-in
      period without any ED treatment; 2)randomization to 8 weeks of treatment with TPN171H or
      placebo; and 3) a 1-week follow-up period for continued adverse event monitoring.

      The effects of TPN171H on ED will be evaluated using the IIEF-EF and SEP diaries. The IIEF-EF
      will be administered at baseline and at 4-week intervals following initiation of treatment,
      meanwhile the SEP diary will be completed by patients after each sexual attempt throughout
      the study.
