    <description>The relationship between perinatologists' ultrasound use and upper extremity pain. Perinatologists use ultrasound for a long time during the day. This can cause some pain in the upper extremities. In our study, the investigators will have a survey of perinatologists and ask some questions: How long have they been doing this profession, which hands they use, how many patients they examine per day, do they have any complaints of upper extremity. The investigators will try to relate upper extremity pain with their answers.</description>
