      1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of xy0206 as single drug in the treatment of
           relapsed / refractory AML;

        2. Evaluate the dose limited toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of xy0206 as
           single drug in the treatment of relapsed / refractory AML subjects.

        3. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacokinetic (PD) characteristics and PK / PD
           correlation of xy0206 as single drug treatment in relapsed / refractory AML subjects;

        4. To evaluate the primary efficacy of xy0206 as single drug in the treatment of relapsed /
           refractory AML patients;

        5. To evaluate biomarkers of xy0206 as single drug treatment for relapsed / refractory AML
           subjects.
