  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a potentially malignant condition mainly characterized by
      inflammation and fibrosis of the submucosal tissues leading to marked rigidity and reduced
      opening of the jaws. OSMF has a multifactorial etiology but areca nut consumption is
      considered to be the most consistent factor in its pathogenesis. There is no definitive
      treatment available for treating OSMF. Conventional management involves physiotherapy
      exercises and treating the disease with certain medications such as steroids and homeopathic
      medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSMF is a chronic insidious disorder of the oral cavity which has a great potential to turn
      malignant. The clinical manifestations of OSMF comprise of white, marble-like appearance of
      the oral mucosa with loss of flexibility and formation of palpable fibrous bands extending
      from the anterior to the posterior region of the oral cavity.Other features include burning
      sensation on taking spicy food, loss of papillae of the tongue, loss of natural pigmentation
      of the lips and restricted mouth opening.

      There is no definitive treatment available for OSMF due to its complex etiology. The most
      essential component in the management of OSMF is the discontinuation of the habit of areca
      nut chewing by the patient followed by conservative or surgical treatment. Currently,
      steroids are the most commonly used drug group in managing OSMF because of their ability to
      reduce the inflammatory process and increasing the apoptosis of inflammatory cells thereby
      decreasing fibrosis. However, they are not very useful in reversing the pathology and
      restoring mucosal elasticity and can cause mucosal thinning with long term use ultimately
      resulting in worsening of the symptoms of the disease.

      Many in- vitro and in- vivo studies have been conducted to establish the anti neoplastic,
      anti inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, antimicrobial, anti-parasitic,
      antioxidant and hypoglycemic properties of N.sativa oil. Among all the constituents of
      Nigella sativa, Thymoquinone (Tq) is the most pharmacologically active constituent
      responsible for most of its properties. Nigella sativa has been used widely in different food
      preparations in the form of a flavoring agent or a spice. It is also recognized as 'safe' in
      the inventory of United States Food and Drug administration.

    <measure>Pain assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using VAS. This scale usually present as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the pain intensity experienced by the patient will be represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>Inter-incisal mouth opening (IMO) assessed using vernier caliper</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Interincisal mouth opening will be calculated by measuring the distance between the mesioincisal angles of the maxillary central incisor and the mandibular central incisor with the help of a vernier calliper.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cheek Flexibility assessed following the method of Mathur and Jha (1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A line will be drawn from the tragus of the ear to the angle of the mouth and then two reference points will be marked on both the cheeks at 1/3rd the distance from the angle of the mouth on the line drawn previously. After marking these reference points, the patient will be asked to blow his cheek and the distance will be measured between the two points. Then the patient will be instructed to relax his cheeks and the distance will be measured again. The difference between the two values will give the value for cheek flexibility.</description>

    <measure>Tongue protrusion</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tongue protrusion will be recorded by measuring the distance between the tip of the tongue and the mesioincisal angle of the upper central incisor using steel ruler.</description>

    <description>Participants in group 1 will be given corticosteroid lotion (Betamethasone valerate 0.1%) and will be advised to apply it topically (0.5 ml) on the buccal mucosa thrice a day along with physiotherapy using ice cream sticks three times a day for the duration of 10 minutes (3-5minutes on each side).</description>
