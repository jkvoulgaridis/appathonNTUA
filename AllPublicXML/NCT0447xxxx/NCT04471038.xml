  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide despite available antivirals
      and vaccines. SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. has developed SAB-176, an anti-influenza human
      immunoglobulin (transchromosomic [Tc] bovine-derived) intravenous therapeutic to treat past
      and current strains of Type A Influenza and Type B Influenza. This study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of SAB-176 in healthy partcipants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years and ≤60 years

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of 19-32 kg/m2

          3. Subjects must have values in normal ranges for basic labs (i.e., CBC, PT/INR, Chem-7,
             and LFTs), unless deemed not clinically significant by the PI.

          4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90 mL/min at screening, calculated using the
             Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula

          5. Subjects must agree to:

        Not take any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications with the exception of
        acetaminophen, ibuprofen, vitamins, seasonal allergy medications, and/or contraceptive
        medications, or others unless approved by the study investigator, for a period 7 days prior
        to study drug administration (i.e., Day 0). Use one of the following in order to avoid
        pregnancy: Females who are able to become pregnant (i.e., are not postmenopausal, have not
        undergone surgical sterilization, and are sexually active with men) must agree to use at
        least 2 effective forms of contraception from the date of the subject's signing of the
        informed consent form through 60 days after the last dose of study drug. At least one of
        the methods of contraception should be a barrier method.

        Males who have not undergone surgical sterilization and are sexually active with women must
        agree to use condoms plus have a partner use at least one additional effective form of
        contraception from the date of the subject's signing of the informed consent form through
        60 days after the last dose of study drug.

        Neither females or males should donate oocysts or sperm for use in artificial insemination
        through 60 days after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any history of allergy, anaphylaxis, or severe reaction to beef products (including
             milk and gelatin)

          2. Any history of allergy, anaphylaxis, or severe reaction to IVIg or human blood
             products

          3. Any chronic medical problem/condition that require medications needed to maintain the
             subject's health. Exceptions to this restriction can be allowed for minor health
             conditions that are treated with Tylenol, over-the-counter non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatories, vitamins, seasonal allergy medications, or oral/transdermal/IUD
             contraceptives, etc. The study investigator will make a determination to exclude a
             subject based upon their medical history and the type and frequency of the drug
             substance.

          4. History of cardiovascular disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or unexplained
             syncope

          5. Abnormal clinically significant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), per PI discretion

          6. Subjects who have been laboratory confirmed or clinically diagnosed with influenza
             within seven days prior to infusion (by subject history) will be deferred from
             infusion. Any subject with signs and symptoms of an active respiratory infection on
             the day of infusion will be deferred until the infection is cleared in the opinion of
             the investigator. Subjects that present with an active upper respiratory infection on
             the day of infusion will be tested with an FDA licensed Influenza A/B Antigen Test.
             Signs and symptoms constituting an upper respiratory infection include cough, sore
             throat, or rhinorrhea with or without fever.

          7. Enrollment will be delayed for all patients who have other intercurrent infections
             (e.g., gastroenteritis, abscess, etc.).

          8. Women who are breast-feeding

          9. Positive urine or serum pregnancy test

         10. Positive urine drug screen (UDS)

         11. Clinically significant results, including laboratory results, as determined by study
             investigator

         12. Positive rheumatoid factor

         13. IgA deficiency (defined as IgA less than 7 mg/dL)

         14. Participation in another research study with receipt of any investigational drug
             within 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is longer, prior to study drug
             administration (i.e., Day 0) and until completion of the study

         15. Participation in any other research study until the completion of the study

         16. Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to study drug administration (i.e.Day
             0)

         17. Receipt of any vaccination within 30 days prior to study drug administration (i.e.Day
             0)

         18. Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit
             the subject's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study
