  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will deliver self-sampling human papillomavirus (HPV) tests
      and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits, as well as adapted cancer screening educational
      materials, by mail to 110 women who are out-of-date for both cervical and colorectal cancer
      screenings, recruited through federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in rural, segregated
      counties of Pennsylvania.

      The hypothesis is that delivering self-sampling HPV tests and FIT, as well as adapted
      educational materials, to women in rural, segregated areas could help overcome environment-
      and person-level barriers and thereby increase cancer screening, reduce geographic cancer
      disparities, and improve public health.

      and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits, as well as adapted cancer screening educational

      screenings, recruited through federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in rural, segregated
      counties of Pennsylvania. Additionally, the investigators will conduct baseline and follow-up
      surveys to assess short-term changes in environment- and person-level factors associated with
      screening, and intervention feasibility (e.g., acceptability). A control group of 110 women,
      also recruited through FQHCs in rural, segregated counties of Pennsylvania, will be used for
      comparison; these women will receive standard-of-care reminders for cancer screening and
      complete the baseline and follow-up surveys.
