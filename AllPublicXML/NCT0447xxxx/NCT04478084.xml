      Primary Objective:

      To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 and Verorab vaccine at D14 (to assess the
      immune response after 3 doses [2-2-2]) and D42 (to assess the immune response after 4 doses
      [2-2-2-0-2]) when administered as standalone in healthy pediatric population or
      co-administered with ERIG (equine rabies immunoglobulins) at D0 in healthy adults.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 and Verorab vaccine at D90 (to assess
           the immune response 90 days post-rabies simulated exposure) when administered as
           standalone in healthy pediatric population or co-administered with ERIG at D0 in healthy
           adults

        -  To describe the safety profile of VRVg-2 and Verorab vaccine as standalone in pediatric
           population or when co-administered with ERIG at D0 in adults, after each vaccination.
