      Catheter ablation in patients with ventricular tachycardia using a new mapping algorithm
      called, parallel mapping, that is aimed to increase the specificity of mapping and the
      outcome of ablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with scar in the hearts after heart attacks, the risk for dangerous abnormal
      heart rhythms, including sudden death is high. This is because dead muscle fibers are
      replaced by scar tissue, creating a physiological condition promoting abnormal heart
      rhythms.These abnormal heart rhythms are called ventricular arrhythmias or ventricular
      tachycardias. In these patients, ablation procedures can be helpful, however the recurrence
      rate of arrhythmias after ablation remains unacceptably high. The primary reason for this
      high recurrence rate is nonspecific mapping methodologies for identifying the heart area
      responsible for these arrhythmias. Therefore, new methods for increasing the specificity of
      mapping have been the subject of significant research for many years, however implementation
      of these methods in clinical practice has been challenged by limited technologies. Recently,
      a new mapping technology named &quot;parallel mapping&quot; has been developed, received FDA approval
      and is routinely utilized at the Cleveland Clinic. However, the workflow of using parallel
      mapping, and the efficacy of ablation using this technology have not been evaluated.
