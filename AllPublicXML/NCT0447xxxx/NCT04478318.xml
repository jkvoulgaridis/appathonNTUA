    <textblock>
      To determine the minimum scan duration for fluorine-18 positron-emitting radioactive
      isotope-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
      (CT) scans performed on a total-body PET/CT scanner that results in non-inferior image
      quality to 18F-FDG PET/CT scans performed on a conventional PET/CT scanner. The subject
      population will be patients being staged for lung cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma.
