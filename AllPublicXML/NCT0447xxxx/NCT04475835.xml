  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, cohort study, in which a total of 100 patients will be
      enrolled and randomly assigned to receive bivalirudin or heparin in a 1:1 ratio during
      short-term intervention of non-infarction related artery for acute ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention.

      NACE, MACE, any type of BARC bleeding, stent thrombosis will be evaluated in 30 days and 6
      months after recruitment.

      The 2017 guideline gives a class IIA recommendation ('should be considered') for complete
      revascularisation in patients presenting with STEMI and multivessel disease, which is
      approximately 50% of the STEMI population. Staged multivessel PCI during hospitalization (3-5
      days after PPCI) is common in contemporary practice.

      Patients undergoing primary PCI should receive enhanced antithrombotic therapy, includes DAPT
      and and parenteral anticoagulant, which caused an increased bleeding risk. In addition,
      repeated use of heparin in a short time may increase the incidence of HIT. Direct thrombin
      inhibitor bivalirudin, demonstrated a reduced risk of bleeding and an overall favorable
      profile including reduced NACE.

      This is a randomized, open label, cohort study, which is aimed to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of bivalirudin during short-term intervention of non-infarction related artery for
      acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction after emergency percutaneous coronary
      intervention.
