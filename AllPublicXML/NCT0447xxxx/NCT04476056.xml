  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and loss of muscle mass are common in patients with chronic pancreatitis.
      However, there is only limited data on nutritional treatment. In this study, malnourished
      patients with chronic pancreatitis will receive an intensified nutritional therapy to improve
      nutritional status. The aim of the study is that malnutrition in patients with chronic
      pancreatitis can be successfully treated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and sarcopenia are common complications in chronic pancreatitis leading to
      increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore nutritional therapy can be considered
      imperative. However, there is limited evidence on the treatment of malnutrition in patients
      with chronic pancreatitis. This study aims to investigate the effect of an intensified
      nutritional therapy on nutritional status in malnourished patients with chronic pancreatitis.
      By testing feasibility of this intensified therapy valuable recommendations for future
      treatment of malnutrition in patients with chronic pancreatitis can be derived.
