  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses education needs in gestational diabetes care and followup at the staff
      and patient levels.

      In the initial phase, nurses and community health workers will complete specific training
      modules on gestational diabetes developed for this study. The effectiveness of the education
      modules will be evaluated through pre/post surveys of participants assessing diabetes
      knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy.

      Patient participants will be recruited in two groups - a usual care group and an intervention
      group. Both groups will receive initial gestational diabetes education with trained clinic
      staff. The intervention group will receive additional education during and after pregnancy
      with a curriculum delivered by a community health worker. The patient curriculum for the
      intervention is in development.

    <intervention_model_description>Staff participants will complete surveys on diabetes knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy before and after completing online training modules on gestational diabetes.
Patient participants in usual care group will receive only their usual care. These patient participants will be recruited from our community health center partner at diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Patients in the intervention group will also be recruited at diagnosis of gestational diabetes and will receive a community health worker delivered curriculum including 4 sessions during pregnancy and 4 sessions postpartum.</intervention_model_description>
