  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The treatment of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) uses the strengthening of
      the knee and hip muscles. Studies propose the use of partial vascular occlusion (OVP) of the
      quadriceps muscle to increase muscle strength and endurance, without joint overload or
      discomfort to the patient. However, there is no consensus on the use in individuals with
      PFPS. Objective: To establish the effect of quadriceps muscle strengthening with OVP and low
      resistance to exercise on pain, functionality, postural control and muscle recruitment in
      women with patellofemoral dysfunction. Methods: Women with PFPS (n = 20) will respond to pain
      and functionality scales. The postural control and muscle recruitment of the quadriceps will
      also be evaluated in dynamic activities of single-legged squat and up / down stairs using a
      force platform and surface electromyography. After the initial assessment, the participants
      will be randomized into two groups: conventional quadriceps strengthening with greater
      resistance loads to exercise and quadriceps strengthening with OVP and low loads. And they
      will perform a six-week treatment protocol with exercises to strengthen the quadriceps. At
      the end of the intervention protocols, all of them will be reassessed immediately, after four
      and eight weeks. Expected Results: It is expected that the group submitted to exercises with
      OVP and lower load will present the same results of postural control and muscle recruitment
      compared to the conventional strengthening group. These results will indicate the possibility
      of using exercises and loads with less joint impairment.

    <description>Quadriceps strengthening exercises will be performed in isometric, concentric and eccentric phases, with partial occlusion to blood flow. The occlusion equipment will be positioned over the proximal portion of the lower limb to be treated, just below the gluteal fold and inguinal ligament (Tennent et al. 2017). The pressure must be maintained during all series of exercises (approximately 5 minutes) (Bryk et al. 2016; Ferraz et al. 2018; Giles et al. 2017).</description>

    <description>The muscle strengthening group with partial vascular occlusion will perform the strengthening exercises: single leg squat on 25 ° inclined plane, eccentric + isometric + concentric quadriceps exercise and deep squat. The equipment for vascular occlusion will be positioned over the proximal portion of the lower limb to be treated, just below the gluteal fold and inguinal ligament (Tennent et al. 2017). The pressure must be maintained during all series of exercises (approximately 5 minutes) (Bryk et al. 2016; Ferraz et al. 2018; Giles et al. 2017). If necessary, the pressure can be adjusted at intervals and after the end of the exercise, an interval of 5 minutes is suggested for blood reperfusion.</description>
