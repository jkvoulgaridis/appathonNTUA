  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well polatuzumab vedotin and combination chemotherapy work in
      treating patients with previously untreated double or triple hit lymphoma. Polatuzumab
      vedotin is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding with cancer cells and releasing
      another chemotherapy drug, called monomethyl auristatin E, into the cell causing the cancer
      cells to die or stop growing. Chemotherapy drugs, such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving polatuzumab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may work better in
      treating patients with double or triple hit lymphoma compared to combination chemotherapy
      alone.

             remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 5 months
             after the last dose of polatuzumab vedotin, 3 months after the last dose of rituximab,
             and for at least 6 months after the last dose of cyclophosphamide to avoid exposing
             the embryo for the duration of the pregnancy. Men must refrain from donating sperm
             during this same period

          -  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients
             considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before study treatment

          -  CRITERIA FOR TISSUE SUBMISSION:

          -  Eligible patients must have available at the study site a representative
             formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimen that enabled the definitive diagnosis
             of DLBCL

               -  The specimen must contain adequate evaluable tumor cells (&gt;= 20% for excisional
                  biopsy and &gt;= 50% if sample is a core biopsy) to enable relevant biomarker
                  analysis

               -  A tissue block (preferred) or 15 serial, freshly cut, unstained slides plus punch
                  biopsy of the tissue block accompanied by an associated pathology report will be
                  requested. Punch biopsy is required only with the slide submission. Cytological
                  or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable

               -  If the archival tissue is unavailable or insufficient on the basis of the above
                  criteria, the patient may still be eligible if the patient is willing to provide
                  tissue from a pretreatment core or excisional/incisional biopsy of the tumor.
                  Cytological or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable. The sample
                  should be shipped according to instructions provided in the laboratory manual.
                  Tissue collected on study will not be returned to sites. If needed, additional
                  slides from previously collected samples may be requested. Cases received from
                  each of the participating institutes should be histological confirmed according
                  to the 2016 WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasm.
                  The evaluation process by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ
                  hybridization (FISH) requires the possession of representative amount of tissues
                  in a paraffin embedded block to be sent to the primary testing institution
                  (Karmanos Cancer Center, Detroit, Michigan). Shipped slides should be placed in
                  proper containers to avoid breakage during shipping. Blocks of paraffin embedded
                  tissue or slides should be sent with a tracking number the address. In addition,
                  the participation institution should call the laboratory at 313-576-8351 (Julie
                  Boerner) for any sample that they ship and provide tracking number

          -  Creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN or a measured creatinine clearance &lt; 40 mL/min (unless abnormal
             laboratory values are due to underlying lymphoma per the investigator)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 x ULN (unless
             abnormal laboratory values are due to underlying lymphoma per the investigator)

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;= 1.5 x ULN (unless abnormal laboratory values are due to underlying
             lymphoma per the investigator)

             * Patients with documented Gilbert disease may be enrolled if total bilirubin is =&lt; 3
             x ULN

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) &gt; 1.5 x ULN in the

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications
