      This research is a prospective study in which the purpose is to investigate the clinical
      outcomes following the transfer of a mosaic embryo (presence of both chromosomally normal and
      abnormal cells) that has been screened for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT).

      This research is a prospective study with the purpose is to investigate the clinical outcomes
      following the transfer of a mosaic embryo (presence of both chromosomally normal and abnormal
      cells) that has been screened for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). PGT involves the
      biopsy and testing of a handful (3-6) of trophectoderm (pre-placental cells) from the embryo.
      Embryos that are screened as mosaic via PGT, as a standard, are not offered for transfer for
      pregnancy attempt. Publications have shown that mosaic embryos and mosaic fetuses can result
      in healthy live births (Wallerstein et al, 2015; Victor et al, 2019). Ongoing clinical
      outcomes are important to further understand the association between an embryonic mosaic
      biopsy of pre-placental cells and subsequent fetal chromosomal constitution. Implantation
      rates and live birth rates will be evaluated to help understand if mosaic embryos should
      routinely be offered for transfer to patients attempting pregnancy.
