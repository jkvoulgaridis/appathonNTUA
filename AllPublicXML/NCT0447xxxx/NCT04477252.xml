  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Stroke continues to be one of the leading causes of disability in the Spanish
      adult population with the presentation of impairments such as alteration of mobility and a
      consequent reduction in quality of life. These sequelae, generally chronic, generates a
      significant expense and saturation of social and health services. With the growth in the
      number of cases, the development of new rehabilitation approaches and updating of the social
      context becomes pertinent, such as the incorporation of telerehabilitation to assist
      individuals with stroke.

      Objectives: To analyze adherence to physical rehabilitation by mobile App and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of lumbopelvic stability exercises performed at home with the App.

      Material and methods: Randomized controlled single blind pilot study (n = 30). Participants
      with Stroke (&lt;6 months) will be randomized between two groups (App for carrying out
      lumbopelvic stability exercises + usual treatment versus usual treatment). The study will
      last 3 months and App adherence, Quality Of Life, participation in Daily Life, functionality,
      sitting balance, standing balance and gait will be taken as variables.

      Expected results: It is thought that the use of an App can contribute to rehabilitation in
      its chronic phase, monitorization and fallow-up the clinical evolution of the patient. Even
      if chronicity leads us to think about the stabilization of the physical condition, It is
      thought that the best results will be found among the subjects who will use the App.

      The recruitment of participants will be done in a personalized way through a verbal
      invitation from the responsible therapist.

      The therapists of the center will be informed about the inclusion criteria in this study in
      order to proceed with the personalized invitation.

      In the case that the participant meet the inclusion criteria and wishes to participate in the
      study, the professional evaluator is contacted to begin the process of submission in this
      study.

      The professional evaluator has the responsibility to explain to the participant what the
      study consists of The professional evaluator is responsible for giving the participant the
      study information sheet (approved by the ethics committee and the management of the center
      where the study will be conducted).

      The professional evaluator is responsible for collecting the signature of the informed
      consent to participate in this study (approved by the ethics committee and the management of
      the center where the study will be conducted).

      A numerical code (from 1 to 30) will be assigned to each patient according to the order of
      recruitment to keep their identity secret.

      The code attributed to each participant will appear in the individual data collection
      notebook The association between the participant's identity and the attributed code will be
      known by the professional evaluator The code attributed to each participant will be entered
      in the spreadsheet where the collected data and results of the assessment tests will be
      uploaded.

    <intervention_model_description>In this simple blind randomized controlled pilot study, participants will be recruited from users of the rehabilitation center where the study will be carried out (Neurorehabilitation Clinic - Sant Cugat del Vallés). 30 participants will be recruited. In the recruitment process, patients will be informed about the study, they will be asked to sign an informed consent and the randomization between the experimental group and the control group will be done by computerized program and with the following interventions</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The therapist responsible for the conventional treatment of the patient and the therapist who performs the assessment will not have access to information about the study group the patient encounters. Since the randomization of patients, access to the intervention of the Experimental Group will be facilitated by the researcher on an occasion other than the initial assessment.</masking_description>

The App will have the &quot;rehabilitation&quot; option where the user can consult the description of the exercise and view a demonstration video so that it can be carried out correctly at home, independently or with help. The administrator therapist of the App has the permission to create users, contact them directly through chat or video-call and personalize the exercise program.
The exercises that will be carried out in this study phase, are described in previous studies by the author Rosa Cabanas et al. All possible exercises will be included in the administration platform, and according to of each user, the prescription of some exercises or others will be made.</description>
