          -  The effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation,
             and for 4 months following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

        Based on its mechanism of action, ipilimumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a
        pregnant woman. Females of reproductive potential must use effective contraception during
        treatment with ipilimumab and for 3 months following the last dose of ipilimumab.

        Based on its mechanism of action, nivolumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a
        pregnant woman. Females of reproductive potential must use effective contraception during
        treatment with nivolumab and for 5 months following the last dose of nivolumab.

        intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the initial ECG, and
        the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine

             (i.e., with use of disease‐modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form
             of systemic treatment and is allowed.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition (eg, known deficiency of the enzyme
             dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase), therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might
             confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for
             the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
