  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate, in vigilant resuscitation patients, the
      effect of the use of HYPNO VR on the pain felt during the insertion of a thoracic drain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, monocentric, prospective study of two parallel
      groups of patients in whom a chest tube is to be inserted:

        -  Group 1: Insertion of the drain according to the usual management protocol.

        -  Group 2: Insertion of the drain according to the usual management protocol supplemented
           by the use of a hypnosis software application (HYPNO-VR).

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of pain associated with chest drain insertion (difference between pain felt at the time of insertion and basal pain prior to the procedure) is the primary endpoint. This will be measured on a simple numerical scale Graduated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Basal pain will be assessed 15 min before drainage, then immediately after insertion and after 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h and 24h.</description>

    <description>Evolution of pain over 24 hours measured on a simple numerical scale Graduated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Basal pain will be assessed 15 min before drainage, then immediately after insertion and after 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h and 24h.</description>

    <measure>Pain distress measured on a simple numerical scale during the procedure and evolution from basal state</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain distress during the procedure and evolution from basal state. The patient will rate how much pain during the procedure was distressing or annoying on a simple numerical scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very annoying or upsetting). It will be evaluated in the basal state 15 min before drainage, then immediately after insertion and after 24 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety level measured on a simple numerical scale and the State-trait Anxiety Inventory scale (STAI-Y scale) during the procedure and evolution from basal status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety level measured on a simple numerical scale graduated from 0 (no anxiety) to 10 (worst imaginable anxiety) and the State-trait Anxiety Inventory scale (STAI-Y scale) during the procedure and evolution from basal status. The simple numerical scale graded from 0 (no anxiety) to 10 (worst imaginable anxiety) will be evaluated in the basal state 15 min before drainage, then immediately after insertion and after 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h and 24h. The STAI-Y scale has 20 items evaluated from 1 to 4 according to its intensity (1= NO, 2 = rather NO, 3 = rather YES, 4 = YES) will be evaluated in the basal state 15 min before drainage then immediately after insertion and after 24 hours.</description>
