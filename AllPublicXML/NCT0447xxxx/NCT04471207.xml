  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health condition that increases
      suicide risk and affects up to 20% of military veterans and 8% of the general population.
      Prolonged Exposure (PE) is an effective and proven form of talk therapy for PTSD. However,
      dropout rates are high (25-30%) and an estimated one-third of patients who complete PE still
      report symptoms of PTSD at the end of treatment. This study directly addresses these
      limitations by using a clinical trial to evaluate the ability of an innovative technology
      system to improve Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy for veterans with PTSD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric condition.
      Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective, evidence-based treatment for PTSD; however,
      approximately one-quarter of patients drop out prematurely and one-third who do complete
      treatment remain symptomatic. The proposed study will employ a 12-session randomized clinical
      trial (N=40 treatment-seeking veterans with current PTSD) to evaluate the acceptability and
      preliminary efficacy of IB-PE and investigate predictors of outcome by accomplishing the
      following milestones: (1a) Evaluate ability of IB-PE (therapist guided vs. record only) in
      reducing PTSD severity from baseline to session 12; and (2b) Use a variety of in vivo
      exposures (IVEs) to identify biometric and behavioral indicators (high heart rate, skin
      conductance) with high predictive value of treatment response. We will use a system of
      discrete wearables (camera, microphone) to allow the therapist to accompany a participant on
      an IVE (e.g: walk through a crowded building). The system will pair with a cellular
      application, and will record information such as heart rate and skin conductance. This system
      will also allow the participant to communicate with the study therapist during this guided
      exercise.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female; any race or ethnicity; aged 18-75 years.

          2. U.S. Military veteran, any branch or era.

          3. Participants must be able to comprehend English.

          4. Participants must meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for current (i.e., past 6 months)
             PTSD (assessed via the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5). Subjects may also
             meet criteria for a mood disorder (except bipolar affective disorder, see Exclusion
             Criteria) or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia,
             generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder). The inclusion of
             subjects with affective and other anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked
             frequency of the co-existence of mood and other anxiety disorders among patients with
             PTSD.

          5. Participants taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a
             stable dose for at least four weeks before study initiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants meeting DSM-5 criteria for a history of or current psychotic or bipolar
             affective disorders. Those participants will be referred clinically to ensure they
             have appropriate level of clinical care.

          2. Participants meeting DSM-5 criteria for a current (past 6 months) moderate to severe
             substance use disorder. Those participants will be referred to addiction treatment
             centers at the VA, MUSC and in the local community. Individuals with mild SUD will be
             included.

          3. Participants considered an immediate suicidal or homicidal risk or who are likely to
             require hospitalization during the course of the study for suicidality. Those
             participants will be referred clinically for care.

          4. Participants on maintenance anxiolytic, antidepressant, or mood stabilizing
             medications, which have been initiated during the past 4 weeks.

          5. Participants enrolled in ongoing evidence-based behavioral therapy for PTSD who are
             not willing to discontinue these therapies for the duration of the trial. Attendance
             at therapeutic activities other than study sessions will be closely monitored using
             the Treatment Services Review.
