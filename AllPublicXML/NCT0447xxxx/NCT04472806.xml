    <description>Toripalimab, humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, which selectively interferes with the combination of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of lymphocytes and elimination of malignancy theoretically.
