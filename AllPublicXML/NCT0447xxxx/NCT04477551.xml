  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is serious and global chronic disease. The prevalence of periodontal
      diseases in United Arab Emirates is not clear but data from Dubai Health Authority showed
      that one in five patients has received periodontal treatment in recent years.

      Several studies reported the additional benefits provided by the use of diode laser in
      combination with ultrasonic debridement in the treatment of gum disease. The use of diode
      laser may debridement of deep pocketing areas while improving healing of gum tissues.

      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of removing bacterial deposit (biofilm) from
      deep tooth pocket using combined diode laser and conventional pocket debridement versus
      conventional pocket debridement alone on tooth supporting tissue parameters in patients with
      advanced gum disease (periodontitis).

      Methodology: A total of 22 patients with advanced gum disease will be randomly allocated to
      two groups: a control group, which will receive conventional pocket debridement and a test
      group which will receive ultrasonic debridement with diode laser. Gum measurements will be
      recorded by a masked calibrated examiner at six points for each tooth and patients'
      postoperative experience and satisfaction will be assessed using special forms.

    <measure>Quality of life measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline GOHAI score at six months days</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's quality of life will be evaluated using general oral health assessment index (GOHAI). The GOHAI has 12 negatively and positively worded items evaluating three dimensions of oral health related quality of life (physical function, pain or discomfort and psychosocial function).
The score ranged from 0 to 60. The scores are maintained for the three items &quot;able to swallow comfortably&quot;, able to eat without discomfort&quot;, &quot;pleased with look of teeth&quot;, and reversed for the remaining nine items, so that a higher score was associated with a more positive oral health.</description>
