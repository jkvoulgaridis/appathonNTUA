      Impact of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment on the Quality of Life of elderly
      onco-hematologic patients' candidates for complex antitumoral therapies: clinical and

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The screenings for the next 2 decades indicate an exponential increase in the incidence of
      neoplastic diseases in the elderly population. In order to successfully balance effectiveness
      and low toxicity of immunochemotherapy, a treatment personalisation based on an objective
      evaluation of fitness is therefore needed. The use of geriatric screening is a first step to
      rationalize decisions in this regard, the G8 tool has demonstrated the ability to identify
      patients and mostly to objectively separate elderly fragile patients from those who are fit.
      In that consideration, the individualization of the anticancer treatment based on a
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is desirable in elderly fragile patients with solid
      or haematological malignancy. Cancer mortality is constantly increasing after 65 years and
      the consequent increase in life expectancy favour the processes of cellular senescence. In
      this context G8 fragility assessment will take place in the screening test and by using the
      EORTC QLQ-C30C questionnaire to assess quality of life (QoL). The evaluation of senescent
      cells will be done by real-time PCR. Our aims are i) to evaluate the impact of the CGA on the
      QoL of elderly onco-haematological patients, candidates for complex therapies, that resulted
      as fragile at the G8 geriatric screening and ii) to evaluate the senescent cells in the
      peripheral blood of the patients enrolled in the study. The study is expected to contribute
      to precision medicine management of elderly patients and refine the therapeutic
      stratifications.

      The study is designed to evaluate the senescent cells and MDSC; in the peripheral blood of
      the patients enrolled in the project in 2 time-points: first on basal line (t = 0) and after
      12 months or in disease progression. Blood samples (10 ml whole blood) will be collected in
      Vacutainer EDTA tubes.
