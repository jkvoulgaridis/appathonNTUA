  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY1817080 is currently under clinical development to treat pain related to unexplained
      chronic cough or chronic cough not affected by a treatment (refractory and/or unexplained
      chronic cough, RUCC), or a condition where the bladder is unable to hold urine normally
      (overactive bladder, OAB) or a condition in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally
      lines the inside of the womb grows outside the womb (endometriosis). Especially in elderly
      patients with OAB or RUCC, renal impairment is frequent. Renal impairment which co-occurs in
      especially in elderly patients with OAB or RUCC is a common condition in which the kidneys
      are not filtering the blood as well as they should. End stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring
      hemodialysis is a condition in which patients kidneys are no longer able to work as they
      should and require treatment to filter wastes from the blood. The goal of the study is to
      learn more about the safety of BAY1817080, how it is tolerated and the way the body absorbs,
      distributes and excretes the study drug given in men and women with moderate renal impairment
      and with those who have end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis compared with
      matched participants with normal kidney function.
