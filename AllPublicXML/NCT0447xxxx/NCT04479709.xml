  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An altered urinary microbiome (UM) may explain the symptoms in overactive bladder (OAB)
      patients who were previously considered to have &quot;idiopathic&quot; OAB. To date, most research on
      the relationship between OAB and the UM has focused on differentiating between the UM of a
      normal bladder and that of an OAB bladder. There is currently a paucity of data on the way
      that OAB therapy impacts the UM. One of the few studies to evaluate the UM pre- and post-OAB
      treatment focused on how management with solifenacin affected the UM, but no studies have
      evaluated how intravesical onabotulinumtoxin A injections (IOI) affects the UM. Understanding
      IOI's impact on the UM is particularly interesting because despite both anticholinergics and
      IOI exerting antimuscarinic affects on the bladder, IOI is often successful when
      anticholinergics are not. This raises the question of what other mechanisms of action IOI may
      have in the bladders of OAB patients - one hypothesis is that it might stabilize the UM in
      those select patients who suffer from OAB due to an altered UM. The primary objective of this
      study is therefore to determine the UM profiles of OAB patients before and after treatment
      with IOI.
