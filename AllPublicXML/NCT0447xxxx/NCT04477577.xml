      The First Heroes study plans to influence weight and health trajectories, modify disease
      risk, and improve health care services for mother-father-infant triads from racial/ethnic
      minority and health disparity populations.

      This study is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial recruiting from Massachusetts General
      Hospital (MGH) obstetrics practices. This study will enroll 250 father-mother dyads in the
      second trimester of pregnancy and intervene through their offspring's 1-year birthday. Each
      mother-father dyad participating will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: 1. Obstetric
      and Pediatric Standard of Care + New Parent Engagement Intervention Arm or; 2. Obstetric and
      Pediatric Standard of Care + Safety Control Arm.
