  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, interventional, multi-center 1:1 randomized non-inferiority
      trial.

      The trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of the Magic Touch PTA sirolimus drug-coated
      balloon in comparison to the treatment with PTX drug-coated balloon (control device) in
      patients with femoropopliteal artery disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), in which a balloon is advanced and inflated in
      the obstructed artery for several seconds to minutes, has become the standard endovascular
      treatment for peripheral arteries. The long-term success of bare balloon PTA in the
      fem-oropopliteal segment is hampered by the occurrence of restenosis, which can be reduced by
      local antiproliferative drug delivery via the PTA balloon catheter.

      The rationale of this study is based on the hypothesis that the usage of the Sirolimus-coated
      Magic Touch Sirolimus DCB is at least equal (non-inferior) with regards to efficacy and
      safety in comparison with a clinically well-established PTX coated balloon.

      The objective of this prospective, randomized, multi-center, post-market study is to compare
      the Magic Touch Sirolimus DCB with Paclitaxel-coated DCB for treatment of high grade
      ste-notic or occluded lesions in SFA and / or P1 segment of the popliteal artery (PA) in PAD
      pa-tients.
