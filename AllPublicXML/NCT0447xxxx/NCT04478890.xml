  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a preliminary study, we hypothesis that we can place a pressure volume (PV) loop catheter
      in the right atrium of patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement
      and measure relevant PV loop data. Contemporaneously, we will record transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE) and pulmonary artery (PA) catheter parameters as comparators to the PV
      loop.

      This will be a prospective observational study design to characterize right ventricular
      function in 5 consecutive patients undergoing LVAD implantation at the University of
      Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC). Pre-, intra- and postoperative care delivery to all enrolled
      and consented patients will meet the standards of care otherwise delivered to patients
      undergoing LVAD implantation at UMMC; care delivery will be at the discretion of the clinical
      care team and will not be altered based on the output of the right ventricular high-fidelity
      conductance catheters.
