  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Should a person have a cardiac arrest (where their heart stops beating) they require
      treatment of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This includes providing chest compressions.
      Traditionally these compressions are provided by hand but mechanical chest compression
      devices (MCCD) have been investigated for use in out of hospital resuscitation attempts.

      Research trials recruiting human participants have concluded recently. They all found no
      difference in survival outcomes when MCCD and manual compressions were compared.

      Despite this, the latest expert review on MCCD suggests that MCCD can be a reasonable
      alternative to high quality manual compressions when these cannot be provided. MCCD continue
      to be used by Specialists in the local ambulance service and historically by those recruiting
      patients to a national multi centre trial of MCCD. There is another, as yet
      under-investigated element, and that is of ambulance crews' experiences of using such
      devices. Therefore it is a reasonable topic to investigate.

      This study will invite local UK NHS operational ambulance crews to participate in a 1-2 hour
      online focus group discussion (a collective group discussion) about their experiences of
      using MCCD. The participants will be any operational ambulance crew member, employed by the
      local ambulance Trust and who had experience of using any type of MCCD. The focus groups will
      be audio recorded; participants will be aware of this when they choose to participate.

      The aim of this research is to collect and report ambulance crews' experiences of using
      mechanical chest compression devices for out of hospital resuscitation attempts Ultimately
      there may of course be benefits for patients by exploring whether MCCD play a part in out of
      hospital resuscitations. Funding has been offered by a manufacturer one of the types of MCCD;
      they have had no involvement in the design of the study.

      Once transcribed, the data will be analysed manually. The content of each focus group will be
      coded and then each participants' individual responses will be coded, first using open
      coding, then focused coding to identify emergent themes, before concluding with the
      categories that have been identified. The constant comparison method of data analysis will be
      used.
