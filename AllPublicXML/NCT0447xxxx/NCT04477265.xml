  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical treatment for overactive bladder is acceptable widely. However, the effect of drug
      treatment is different due to compliance and side effect of the drug. Biofeedback-assisted
      pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the first line recommendation for overactive bladder.
      The slow effect of biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training leads to low motivation
      for continuous treatment and results in compliance difference. This slow effect also changes
      the degree of improvement in the treatment of overactive bladder. This study is designed to
      evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy for treatment of female overactive bladder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participant will be prescribed with oral medication in combination with biofeedback-assisted
      pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) for the first month. Participant will continue to have
      biofeedback assisted PFMT for another two months without oral medication. The investigators
      expected that combination therapy will improve the compliance and severity of symptoms in
      women with overactive bladder.
