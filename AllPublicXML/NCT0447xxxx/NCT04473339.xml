    <textblock>
      A phase III prospective study with the primary objective to investigate the benefit of
      Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in ovarian cancer patients with mutations
      in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes. The target population for this study is
      patients with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers undergoing
      Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS). Patients will be divided into two groups according to HRR genes
      mutation, each group will be further divided into two sub-groups with different intervention.
      Patients in Group A are HRR mutated type, sub-group 1 will undergo CRS plus HIPEC and then go
      on to receive standard platinum-based combination doublet intravenous chemotherapy, sub-group
      2 will undergo CRS and then go on to intravenous chemotherapy. Patients in Group B are HRR
      wild type, sub-group 3 will undergo CRS plus HIPEC and then go on to receive standard
      platinum-based combination doublet intravenous chemotherapy, sub-group 4 will undergo CRS and
      then go on to intravenous chemotherapy. All patients will receive maintenance therapy with
      Bevacizumab after primary treatment. Prognostic information will be collected for
      investigation of survival benefits of patients.

    <description>Patients will undergo only CRS, HIPEC and IVCT.Patients will receive standard platinum-based combination doublet chemotherapy for 6-8 cycles after CRS and then followed by maintenance therapy.
A single drug lobaplatin(30mg/m2)will be administered in normal saline via HIPEC and it will be continued for 60 minutes in the hyperthermic phase (41°C-43°C). HIPEC will be performed at the 1st, 3rd and 5th day after CRS. The intravenous chemotherapy(IVCT) will start from 7th-14th day after CRS.</description>
