  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, doubled-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase I trials. The study is
      divided into two parts. The first part is a single-dose escalated study (SAD,part 1A ) and
      food effect study (SAD, part 1B ) in healthy subjects. The second part is a multi-dose
      escalated study (MAD) in healthy subjects.
