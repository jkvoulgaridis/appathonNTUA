  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic anterior shoulder instability is a common injury for the contact athlete, with high
      rates of recurrence in some athletic populations. The specific indication for the Latarjet
      procedure differs amongst surgeons, however it is generally accepted that it is indicated in
      patients with anterior glenohumeral instability that are unlikely to have a successful
      outcome from either an arthroscopic or open anatomical Bankart repair.

      Overall the rate of reoperation following a Latarjet is around 5-7%. Infection, hematoma as
      well as screw removal and glenoid bony rim fractures are the most common indications for
      reoperation. The rate of instability after a Latarjet is low, with 1.7%-5.0% rate of
      dislocation.

      However, in terms of rehabilitation, there are only a few studies and evidence of best
      practices. A recent review of the literature has highlighted four studies, comparing
      different rehabilitation protocols, which include different immobilization periods ranging
      from 0 to 3 weeks, and different types of mobilization (under physiotherapist supervision or
      not, with machine or not). They found a similar rate of recurrent dislocation between the
      different protocols. But early passive motion enables to improve the range of motion during
      first 3-6 months, with similar results at one year.

      One main aspect which the surgeon can influence is immobilization time. In all
      above-mentioned studies, patients had to wear a sling for at least 3 weeks, even in the early
      mobilization groups. Short protocols with encouraging results have been recently emphasized
      by in other fields of shoulder surgery. The investigators would like to determine if the
      absence of postoperative immobilization could lead to improved function and better range of
      motion. To the investigators best knowledge, no study has sought to compare the usefulness of
      sling wearing after Latarjet procedure. Avoiding the sling could simplify rehabilitation and
      should provide a return to normal function faster, with greater satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare rehabilitation with the wearing of a sling, to
      rehabilitation without any immobilization after Latarjet procedure for treatment of anterior
      shoulder instability. Ultimately, the goal would be to offer to patients a simplified
      rehabilitation management, with a faster recovery, less pain and a quicker return to
      activities of daily living, work and sport.

      As primary outcome, investigators will evaluate if the Rowe score18 is superior without
      postoperative immobilization (without a sling during the first 3 weeks) for the first 6
      months after surgery. The non-inferiority of the shoulder mobilization without a sling over
      mobilization with a sling for rehabilitation after Latarjet procedure for treatment of
      anterior shoulder instability.

      Secondary outcomes include radiological criteria (X-rays and computed tomography (CT) at 6
      months for bony union), return to sport, work absenteeism, other complication rate
      (especially redislocation), and the undermentioned subjective and clinical scores before
      surgery and at 1.5, 3, and 6 months postoperative.

      All patients will be assessed with commonly used subjective scores in the form of
      self-administered questionnaires. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a widely used single-item
      test where a patient rates pain intensity between 0 and 10. This scale is useful for patient
      preoperative and postoperative monitoring and has also been correlated with patient pain,
      anxiety and apprehension20,21. Patient satisfaction (are patients satisfied, yes/no) will be
      assessed as well. Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) is a single-question test where a patient
      is asked to rate his overall shoulder function as a percentage of normal shoulder. It is a
      quick and easily administered score that has also been validated for various shoulder
      disabilities, such as instability.

      The following clinical scores will be analyzed as well Rowe and Walch-Duplay scores for
      instability is a three-item test with four choices each, measuring shoulder function,
      stability, and motion. The final result is converted into a value between 0 and 100. These
      scores have been specifically developed for shoulder instability.

      Except for VAS, higher results mean higher function. ROM will be determined using a Vicon
      motion capture system (Vicon, Oxford Metrics, Oxford, UK) consisting of six cameras sampling
      at 120 Hz already available in our facility.
