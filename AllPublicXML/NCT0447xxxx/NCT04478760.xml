  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will find out what the reference intervals are for common blood tests in
      transgender people taking hormone therapy.

      Reference intervals help doctors interpret blood test results. They are expressed as two
      numbers, and most normal results fall between them. If a results fall outside of them, it may
      be because of a disease. Some blood tests are also affected by normal difference between
      people, such as age, sex or ethnicity. For these tests, different reference intervals are
      given for each group of people. Having accurate reference intervals benefits patients because
      it allows doctors to identify disease faster.

      Transgender people have a gender identity which does not match their sex characteristics at
      birth. Gender identity is the feeling of being a gender, and sex is the biological aspects of
      growing up male or female. Transgender people may use hormone therapy to help change their
      appearance to fit their gender identity. This involves taking either oestrogen or
      testosterone.

      For blood tests which are affected by sex, it is not clear what reference intervals should be
      used for transgender people who are on hormone therapy. This is because they have a mixture
      of male and female sex characteristics. Answering this question will allow doctors to
      identify disease in them faster.

      The study will take place at cliniQ, at King's College Hospital, which provides health
      services to transgender people. It will recruit healthy transgender people who attend the
      clinic for blood tests to monitor their hormone therapy. Participants will fill out a
      questionnaire, give a urine sample, then have their appointment as normal. Extra tests will
      also be performed on their blood sample. The aim is to recruit 240 participants.
      Participant's tests results will then be used to calculate reference intervals.

      The study is funded by the National School of Healthcare Science.
