  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease that lead to the loss of
      supportive tissues around the teeth with gradual deterioration of masticatory function and
      esthetics, resulting eventually in the decrease of the quality of life. Host immune response
      triggered by bacterial biofilm is responsible for the chronic periodontal inflammation and
      ongoing tissue loss. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
      and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have anti-inflammatory properties, thus may be used for the
      treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. This study is aimed to evaluate the effect of
      dietary supplementation with PUFAs omega-3 in the patients with periodontitis stage III and
      IV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is highly prevalent oral disease in humans affecting nearly 50% of the
      population worldwide. Periodontitis is multifactorial disease individually accelerated or
      decelerated by different factors. One of them, a bacterial biofilm, leads to dysbiosis and
      raise of Gram-negative bacteria.This results in the activations of immune response and
      clinical signs of periodontal tissue inflammation. Host modulation therapy seems to be an
      adequate concept for the treatment of periodontal diseases. The main assumption of this
      therapy is to reduce by-stander tissue destruction, to ensure rapid resolution of
      inflammation or even to promote regeneration of the periodontal tissues by modifying or
      down-regulating the destructive aspects of the host response and by up-regulating the
      protective or regenerative responses The goal of the present study was to assess the effect
      of high-dose omega-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA on the clinical outcome of non-surgical treatment of
      the patients with generalized periodontitis stage III and IV. It was presumed that dietary
      supplementation with high-dose EPA and DHA would have the potential to induce a measurable
      clinical outcome as a result of reduction of inflammation and minimizing tissue damage
      mediated by anti-inflammatory effect of omega-3 PUFAs. To address this issue, a randomized
      clinical trial was designed in which EPA and DHA were supplemented in adjunction to the
      standard periodontal therapy, scaling and root planning (SRP). Clinical outcomes of active
      versus control therapies were measured in addition to the quantifications of saliva cytokines
      and chemokines.
