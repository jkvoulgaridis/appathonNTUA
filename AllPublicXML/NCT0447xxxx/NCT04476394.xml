      This is an open-label, single-dose, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance study
      following a single oral dose of [14C]-20 mg/100 μCi Anaprazole Sodium enteric-coated capsule
      in healthy adult male subjects. Whole blood, plasma samples will be collected at hour 0
      pre-dose and 1，2，3，4，5，6，8，12，24，48，72，96，120，144，168 hours post-dose (tentative, adjusted
      according to plasma drug concentration); urine samples will be collected at hour 24 pre-dose
      and 0-4，4-8，8-12，12-24，24-48，48-72，72-96，96-120，120-144，144-168，168-192，192-216，216-240 hours
      post-dose (tentative, adjusted according to sample recovery rate) ; fecal samples will be
      collected at hour 24 pre-dose and
      0-24，24-48，48-72，72-96，96-120，120-144，144-168，168-192，192-216，216-240 hours post-dose
      (tentative, adjusted according to sample recovery rate) following the start of administration
      to measure total radioactivity and plasma drug concentrations.
