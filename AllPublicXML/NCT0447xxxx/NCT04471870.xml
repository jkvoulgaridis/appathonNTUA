      The Sponsor implemented a post-authorisation safety study (PASS), category 3, focused in
      Acute Coronary Syndrome, in order to collect information about the safety of cangrelor in the
      real clinical practice, evaluating the safety of the transition to all the oral P2Y12
      inhibitors (cangrelor, ticagrelor and prasugrel).
