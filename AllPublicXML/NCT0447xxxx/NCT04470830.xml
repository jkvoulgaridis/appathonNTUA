      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety by assessing all serious and non-serious
      adverse events (AEs), irrespective of relatedness or expectedness, as well as other safety
      parameters including laboratory values, serious adverse events (SAEs)/serious adverse drug
      reactions (ADRs), unexpected AEs and ADRs that are not reflected on the precaution in the
      use, ADRs already known, non-serious ADRs and other safety related information (laboratory
      values changes, etc).

    <textblock>
      This is a long-term prospective, observational post-marketing surveillance study of
      azilsartan medoxomil/chlorthalidone FDC in participants with essential hypertension. The
      study will assess the safety and effectiveness of azilsartan medoxomil/chlorthalidone FDC
      prescribed as a monotherapy or taken concomitantly with other anti-hypertension therapies in
      participants whose blood pressure is not properly controlled by azilsartan medoxomil
      monotherapy or who require administration of multiple drugs in order to reach the target
      blood pressure in routine clinical settings.

      The study will enroll and will consider approximately 600 participants. These participants
      will be grouped with the ones treated with azilsartan medoximil monotherpy. The data will be
      prospectively collected, at the centers from medical files and recorded into electronic case
      report forms (e-CRFs). All the participants will be assigned to a single observational
      cohort:

      â€¢ Participants With Essential Hypertension

      The multi-center study will be conducted in South Korea. Data collection will be based on
      routinely scheduled and emergency visits over the surveillance period, scheduled at Visit 1
      (Baseline), Visit 2 (6 weeks), Visit 3 (at least 3 months to 6 months) and Visit 4 (6 months
      or more up to 9 months) after drug administration. The overall duration of the study will be
      approximately 5 years. All participants will be followed up for 9 months after drug
      administration.

    <measure>Final Effectiveness Rate as Assessed by the Investigator</measure>

    <description>Effectiveness rate: percentage of participants who achieved effectiveness over total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, and is calculated as number of effective participants/total number of participants in group, multiplied by 100. Final effectiveness will be assessed based on: Improved (symptoms have improved or it is considered to have had a maintenance effect); Unchanged (no significant change from pre-administration, not considered to have had a maintenance effect); Worsened (symptoms have worsened compared to pre-administration); Unassessable (unable to assess due to grounds such as missing effectiveness variables, follow up loss, etc.). Maintenance effect: cases where the likelihood of worsened symptoms is high with discontinuation of medication, or equivalent effect to existing drugs is sustained when substituted with existing drugs. Effectiveness rate is determined by classifying 'Improved' as &quot;Effective&quot; and 'Unchanged' and 'Worsened' as &quot;Ineffective&quot;.</description>
