    <textblock>
      The study verifies that the Spartan Cube CYP2C19 System generates reproducible results under
      multi-variant conditions including test site (three different test sites), operators (two
      operators per site), testing days (five non-consecutive days per site), and test kit lot
      (three different lots).

    <textblock>
      The reproducibility study (VNV-00227) is aimed at assessing the performance of the Spartan
      Cube CYP2C19 product under multi-variant conditions that include test site, operators,
      testing days, and reagent lots. The sections below address how these variables were tested.

      This study will be performed by a total of six operators at three test sites. At each site,
      two operators will conduct buccal sample collection and analysis. Operators include
      individuals who are technologists, technicians, and/or nurses. The buccal samples will be
      loaded in the Cube within one hour after buccal swab collection. Furthermore, results will be
      generated using multiple platforms (Spartan Cube, computer, and printer) and the same
      platforms will be used at each site. At each site, a total of 64 (8 subjects/operator x 2
      operators x 2 sessions x 2 sub-sessions (replicates)) tests will be run on five
      non-consecutive days. Each day includes 2 sessions and 2 sub-sessions (total 4 collection
      times) in which samples will be collected. Test subject to platform pairing is not required,
      results will be generated on one of the platforms per session. This means that each site will
      generate a total of 320(64 obs./day x 5 days) results over the entire duration of the study.

      To determine lot-to-lot reproducibility of test kits, three different lots will be evaluated.
      For this, two lots will be tested at each site. Each operator will use two lots per session
      on each testing day. Each replicate only includes a single lot of test kits.

      All results generated by the Spartan Cube CYP2C19 System will be compared with the
      bi-directional sequencing results.
