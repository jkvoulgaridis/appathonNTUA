  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of e-CBT to treat depression through
      an online, module-based program. The study aims to determine if anxiety severity and
      symptomatology decreased after the administration of 12 e-CBT sessions delivered through
      OPTT. This study also aims to determine the difference in efficacy between e-CBT alone,
      pharmacotherapy alone and e-CBT with pharmacotherapy as it relates to various demographic
      characteristics (i.e., gender, age, socioeconomic status, etc.). To the principal
      investigators' knowledge, this study will be the first multi-site study examining the
      efficacy of e-CBT in depression compared to pharmacotherapy using a naturalistic research
      design.

      Patients (n=98) will be recruited from outpatient clinics at both Kingston Health Sciences
      Centre sites (Hotel Dieu Hospital and Kingston General Hospital) and Queen's University in
      Kingston. The sample size was determined by a power analysis to minimize the probability of a
      Type II error. This study will conduct six cycles of CBT and patients will be recruited over
      an 18-month period at a rate of 16 patients per cycle. The inclusion criteria for the study
      include the following: at least 16 years old at the start of the study, diagnosed with major
      depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
      5th Edition (DSM-V) by a clinician, competence to consent to participate, ability to speak
      and read English, and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Informed consent (or
      where applicable, assent and parental consent) will be obtained at the beginning of the
      intake assessment and the patients will be given verbal and written instructions on how to
      participate in therapy through OPTT by the intake assessment administrator. All clinicians
      administering the e-CBT through OPTT will also be asked to provide informed consent prior to
      their patients in the study.

      Procedure: In addition to a diagnosis of a DSM-V major depressive episode from an experienced
      clinician, recruited patients will be confirmed to meet the DSM-IV criteria for major
      depressive disorder using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. version
      5.0.0) during an intake assessment conducted immediately after recruitment by the Project
      Manager or a trained research assistant. While this version of the M.I.N.I. has been
      validated for DSM-IV criteria, the criteria utilized for a major depressive episode has not
      changed from the DSM-IV to the DSM-V. Exclusion criteria include individuals with high
      current suicide risk (a score of over 17 points on section C, Suicidality, of the M.I.N.I.).
      The intake assessment (t0) consists of reviewing the letter of information, consent form,
      demographic information, M.I.N.I., and baseline questionnaires including the Depression
      Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction
      Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-QSF). Weekly sessions of CBT through OPTT will consist of
      approximately 30 slides and interactive therapist videos. The content and format of each
      weekly online session were designed to mirror the live CBT that will be occurring
      simultaneously and the efficacy of the 12 modules being used within the study in reducing
      depressive symptoms has already been tested through email administration by. The slides will
      highlight a different topic each week and include general information, an overview of skills,
      and homework on that topic. The homework included in each session will be submitted through
      OPTT and reviewed by the administrators with personalized feedback provided within three days
      of submission. Live CBT homework will be reviewed by the CBT group organizer and provided at
      the beginning of the next CBT session. Weekly homework submission for feedback will be
      mandatory before being eligible for the next session. DASS 21 and Q-LES-Q-SF questionnaires
      will be completed at the beginning and end of treatment for both live and e-CBT. Other
      quantitative measures for the e-CBT group will be gathered by extrapolating recorded
      information directly through the OPTT application (i.e., the number of logins per day, the
      amount of time spent logged in, etc.). After each cycle of e-CBT, patients and healthcare
      providers involved in e-CBT will be recruited for focus groups (8 for users and 2 for
      providers). Focus group participants will only be recruited after the completion of their
      12-week e-CBT program. Qualitative data will be gathered through 10 focus groups, each focus
      group will consist of 8 patients. Numerous focus groups allow different perspectives to be
      captured including gender (male, female), age (under/over 30 years old), and discipline
      (patient, e-CBT administrator, and director). The focus group prompts will pertain to
      experience and expectations of service. Qualitative measure analyses will aid in the inquiry
      of the role of personal, social, and cultural factors in enabling or constraining the use of
      OPTT. Findings will identify factors related to the utility, feasibility, and accessibility
      of OPTT from the perspectives of users and providers. Interpretive qualitative methods are
      ideal for gathering in-depth descriptions of user experience and meaning. Focus groups
      conducted with medical residents will discuss the benefits of receiving training on and
      implementing e-CBT. An Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach will guide data
      collection and analysis. The duration of most IPA focus groups is one hour. The
      semi-structured form asks questions followed by prompts in a personalized manner that may
      differ between groups. New perspectives may be introduced and explored. The IPA method is
      invaluable as it provides an inductive form of data collection and analysis. Focus groups are
      audio recorded and verbatim transcripts are coded in detail. All live and e-CBT patients will
      be contacted six months after the completion of their CBT to complete final DASS 21 and
      Q-LES-Q-SF questionnaires. This will allow for the examination of the longevity of e-CBT
      compared to live CBT.
