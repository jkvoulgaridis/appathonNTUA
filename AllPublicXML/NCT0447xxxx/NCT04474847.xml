  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will seek to determine the efficacy
      of abatacept in GCA. To examine this objective, 62 eligible patients who have newly diagnosed
      or relapsing GCA within 8 weeks prior to screening will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to
      receive subcutaneous abatacept 125mg/week or placebo. Patients who achieve remission will
      remain on their blinded assignment for 12 months at which time abatacept/placebo will be
      stopped.

      Patients who do not achieve remission by Month 3, who experience a relapse within the first
      12 months will have the option of receiving open-label abatacept for a maximum of 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA. Diagnostic criteria for GCA

             A patient will be said to have GCA by meeting 3 of 5 of the following modified ACR
             criteria for the classification of GCA in which 1 of the 3 must consist of criteria 4
             or 5:

               1. Age at disease onset ≥ 50 years.

                  above the laboratory normal limit.

               4. Temporal artery abnormality (i.e., temporal artery tenderness to palpation or
                  decreased pulsation, unrelated to arteriosclerosis of cervical arteries).

               5. Temporal artery or large vessel biopsy showing vasculitis characterized by a
                  predominance of mononuclear cell infiltration or granulomatous inflammation,
                  usually with multinucleated giant cell or an abnormal temporal artery ultrasound
                  showing features consistent with active giant cell arteritis (&quot;halo sign&quot;) or
                  characteristic changes of large vessel stenosis or aneurysm by arteriography.

          2. GCA with evidence of active disease (defined below) present within the past 8 weeks.

             effective means of birth control while receiving treatment through this study.
             Effective contraception methods include abstinence, surgical sterilization of either
             partner, barrier methods such as diaphragm, condom, cap or sponge, or hormonal
             contraception.

          5. They must be willing and able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a recent acute infection defined as:

               -  Any acute infection within 60 days prior to randomization that required
                  hospitalization or treatment with parenteral antibiotics.

               -  Any acute infection within 30 days prior to randomization that required oral
                  antimicrobial or antiviral therapy.

          2. Patients with history of chronic or recurrent bacterial infection (such as chronic
             pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, and bronchiectasis etc.).

          3. Patients with a history of recurrent herpes zoster (more than 1 episode) or
             disseminated (more than 1 dermatome) herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex, or

          5. Patients with a history of primary immunodeficiency.

          6. Patients at risk for tuberculosis (TB) defined as follows:

               -  Current clinical, radiographic or laboratory evidence of active TB, even if
                  currently being treated. Chest x-rays (posterior/anterior and lateral) obtained
                  within the 6 months prior to screening and TB testing (IFN-gamma release assay or
                  PPD) performed in the past month prior to screening will be accepted; however, a
                  copy of the reports must be placed in the participant binder.

               -  A history of active TB unless there is documentation that the patient had
                  received prior anti-TB treatment that was appropriate in duration and type
                  according to local health authority guidelines.

               -  Patients with a positive TB screening test indicative of latent TB will not be
                  eligible for the study unless they:

                  i. Have no evidence of current TB based on chest x-ray performed during the
                  screening period and by history and physical exam, and ii. They are currently
                  being treated for latent TB or the site has documentation of successful prior
                  treatment of latent TB. Treatment regimens should be dictated by local guidelines
                  as long as the treatment dose and duration meet or exceed local health authority
                  guidelines. If permitted by local guidelines regarding treatment with biologic
                  medications, patients with latent TB may be randomized prior to completion of
                  treatment as long as they have completed at least 4 weeks of treatment and they
                  have no evidence of current TB on chest x-ray at screening.

             ml/min.

         11. AST or ALT &gt; 3 times above normal laboratory range.

         12. Other severe, progressive, or uncontrolled disease that in the investigator's opinion
             could prevent a patient from fulfilling the study requirements or that would increase
             the risk of study participation.

         13. Patients who have a present malignancy or previous malignancy within the last 5 years
             prior to screening (except documented history of cured non-metastatic squamous or
             basal cell skin carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ). Patients who had a screening
             procedure that is suspicious for malignancy, and in whom the possibility of malignancy
             cannot be reasonably excluded following additional clinical, laboratory or other
             diagnostic evaluations.

         14. Receipt of an investigational agent or device within 30 days prior to enrollment.

         15. A live vaccination within 3 months before randomization.

             hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, or other conventional immunosuppressive
             agent).

         17. Patients who had received an alkylating agent such as cyclophosphamide must
             discontinue these medications at least 8 weeks before randomization.

         18. Patients who have been treated within 4 weeks of randomization with etanercept or
             within 8 weeks with adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, or infliximab.

         19. Patients who have been treated within 8 weeks of randomization with anti-IL-6 agents
             (e.g., tocilizumab, sirukumab) or a janus kinase inhibitor.
