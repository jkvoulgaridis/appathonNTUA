  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon monoxide (CO) is reported to cause around 30 deaths, 200 admissions and 4000
      presentations to Emergency Departments each year in the UK. In the longer term, CO poisoning
      is recognised to cause persistent neurological problems (including impairments of thinking
      and behavioural changes), which can develop days to weeks after the initial exposure.
      However, the incidence of these long-term sequelae is unknown. In addition, there is evidence
      of long-lasting inflammatory changes in the brain and on-going brain cell injury, although
      how long this persists is also unknown.

      Initial assessments of CO exposure can be unreliable if blood tests are not carried out
      within a relatively short period after the exposure and other biomarkers (such as imaging)
      are insensitive to detecting previous CO exposure. Certain proteins that are found in brain
      cells can be detected in the blood of individuals following brain injury and brain cell
      death. These proteins have been found to be raised in the acute period after minor head
      injury, persistently raised in patients with a traumatic brain injury and evidence of on
      going neurodegeneration (i.e. on going brain cell death) and in patients with various types
      of dementia.

      The investigators will assess the presence of these proteins in the blood of 50 participants
      with proven CO exposure in the sub-acute to chronic timescale (2 weeks to 2 years). This has
      not been done before and will allow assessment of the presence of on going brain injury in
      these participants. The investigators will also assess cognitive (e.g. memory, attention and
      speed of thinking) and behavioural impairments in these participants to help characterise the
      common impairments suffered following CO exposure and relate these to evidence of persistent
      brain injury and severity of CO exposure.
