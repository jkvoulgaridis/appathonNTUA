  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will follow participants for the periods of 3 months while using an advanced hybrid
      closed loop algorithm in free living conditions . Each period will have a different meal
      handling protocols. The objective is to identify the mitigation of the algorithm with
      different meal handling approaches.
