  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an educational video about patients'
      perioperative experience (period that spans from the time of admission to the hospital to the
      time of recovery after surgery) will affect the timing of hospital discharge. The researchers
      will use information collected during this study to create a questionnaire and an educational
      video related to the patient perioperative experience. The educational video will address
      patient concerns about the perioperative period and recovery after surgery (post-operative
      recovery).

      All participants in this study will be undergoing a MIS hysterectomy according to their
      routine care in the Gynecology

    <intervention_model_description>There will be two phases in this study. Phase I will comprise 25 women (15 pre-operatively and a separate 10 post-operatively). The results of the pre-operative interviews will be closely monitored for data saturation and we may stop accrual earlier than the planned 15. Phase II will comprise 100 women. All patients will undergo standard-of-care MIS hysterectomy, with standard follow-up with the addition of the interventions and randomization takes place here.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Phase I: A sample of patients in phase I will complete a qualitative interview prior to or after surgery. Twenty-five patients (15 pre-operatively and a separate 10 post-operatively) will be selected to participate in an in-person/phone interview. Phase II: A separate group of women will compose phase II. All patients (N = 100) in phase II will complete discrete-choice surveys and will then be randomized to receive either standard preoperative counseling or standard preoperative counseling with the addition of an educational video,</description>
