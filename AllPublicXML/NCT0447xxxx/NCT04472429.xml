               -  Histologically or cytologically verified, inoperable locally recurrent or
                  metastatic SCAC.

               -  No prior systemic therapy other than the following: a. Chemotherapy administered
                  concomitantly with radiotherapy as a radiosensitizing agent is permitted.

                  irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are
                  usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression
                  in the lesion.

             28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 (note: all toxicities associated should have resolved to
             Grade ≤ 1).

          -  Participants with laboratory outside of the protocol defined ranges.

          -  History of second malignancy within 3 years (with exceptions).

          -  Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to platinum, paclitaxel, another monoclonal antibody, or any of
             the excipients that cannot be controlled with standard measures (eg, antihistamines,
             corticosteroids).

          -  Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Current use of protocol defined prohibited medication.

          -  Has pre-existing peripheral neuropathy that is ≥ Grade 2 by CTCAE v5.
