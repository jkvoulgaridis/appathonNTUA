      The aim of the study is to assess continued safety and efficacy of the SeQuent® SCB. The
      product under investigation will be used in routine clinical practice according to the latest
      European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and according to the Instructions for Use
      (IFU). Those data that are obtained in routine clinical use will be documented in the Case
      Report Form (CRF).

      The objective of the study is to assess the continued safety and efficacy of SeQuent® SCB for
      the treatment of &quot;real world&quot; de-novo and restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and
      coronary bypass grafts. Study goals are based on non-inferiority for Drug-Coated Balloon
      (DCB) compared to Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon (PCB) and Dru-eluting Stents (DES) (historical
      data) with 80% power. Primary and secondary outcome variables are international accepted
      parameters in stent-trials, which sufficiently describe the efficacy and safety of the
      investigated device and allow clinical conclusions. Additional attention will be paid to
      those patients who received, by observation, a shortened dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).

      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the SeQuent® SCB in the
      treatment of coronary artery disease with reference vessel diameters between ≥ 2 mm and ≤ 4
      mm with suitable lesion lengths. There is no limitation of lesion lengths. In case the lesion
      is longer than 34 mm, more than one stent needs to be used.

        This is a single-armed, prospective, international, multi-center, post-market study in
        patients with coronary artery disease and indication for PCI either due to anginal symptoms
        and a relevant stenotic coronary lesion during angiography or due to documented ischemia by
        non-invasive or invasive functional testing.

        All patients who undergo a target intervention with the SCB will be followed for 12 and 24
