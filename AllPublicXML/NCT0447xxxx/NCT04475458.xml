  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most frequent surgical procedures in the pediatric population is circumcision,
      following which postoperative pain could be stressful. Usually, the most common approach is
      combining regional anesthesia techniques such as landmark dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB)
      with general anesthesia (GA). The hypothesis of this study investigates ultrasound-guided
      DPNB plus sedation in spontaneous breathing.

    <description>This block is performed by the anesthesiologist, after sedation. With an in-plane approach, the tissues around the dorsal penis nerves are visualized. The needle has to pass through Buck's fascia and there the local anesthetic is released.</description>

        Patients' anthropometric data were collected. Data related to the anesthetic technique,
        pharmacological therapy, vital parameters were registered as well as the time to discharge
        from the operatory room to the post-anesthesia care unit.

        Opioid consumption and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during and after surgery were
        noted. Pain and complications immediately after surgery, at 4 and 72 hours after surgery
        were registered.
