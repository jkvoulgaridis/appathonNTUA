    <textblock>
      A First-in-human, dose-escalation, dose-expansion phase I clinical study of JS004 in subjects
      with recurrent/refractory malignant lymphoma in China, to evaluate the safety, tolerbility,
      PK, immunogenicity,a ntumor activity and biomarkers of JS004, to define MTD and RP2D of
      JS004. A cycle is 21 days(3 weeks) which includes JS004 being administered IV Q3W. All
      patients will be treated until disease progression per Lugano response critieria 2014 for
      Lymphoma or intolerable toxicity per CTCAE 5.0, withdrawal of consent, or end of the study,
      whichever occurs first. Disease progression must be confirmed at least 4 weeks but no longer
      than 8 weeks after initial documentation of progression.
