  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VEGF is a key molecule in the control of vascular permeability via interactions with the
      VEGF-receptor on the endothelial cell. Several authors reported plasma VEGF levels are
      elevated in sepsis shock and associated with increased mortality (1,2).

      In septic shock, the main elements of treatment are intravenous fluids, appropriate
      antibiotics and vasopressors. Some authors observed positive fluid balance is associated with
      increased mortality rates in patients (3,4).

      To the best of our knowledge, no studies have shown a correlation between VEGF levels and the
      fluid balance. The aim of our study was to determine the role of VEGF in capillary leakage
      and the positive fluid balance in septic shock.
