  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A validated mobile Allergen exposure chamber (AEC) is used to expose qualified study
      participants suffering from house dust mite (HDM) induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. A
      maximum of four individuals are exposed at a time under standardized conditions with a
      mixture of allergens from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae (each
      50%, faeces and body allergens; doses of 300 μg/m3 air; 21°C, and 55% relative air moisture).
      After the first exposure, a dietary supplement tablet, containing beta-lactoglobulin (BLG),
      iron, retinoic acid, zinc and polyphenols, is taken twice daily for a period of 12 weeks,
      followed by the second exposure. A minimum of thirty persons are challenged with HDM
      allergen. After entering the chamber there is an acclimatization phase of 20 minutes with no
      exposure. Exposure time starts after acclimatization in the chamber and is 120 minutes at
      each visit. Objective parameters are recorded every 30 minutes, and subjective parameters are
      recorded every 10 minutes over a period of 120 minutes. During the exposure a plateau
      (steady-state) of total nasal symptom score with a difference from baseline is measured in
      all participants for each of the two exposures with HDM.
