    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized trial looking at the ideal method of labor induction for
      women with prelabor rupture of membranes and an unfavorable cervical Bishop score. The study
      will compare oral misoprostol and intravenous oxytocin.

      The purpose of this study is to look at optimal induction management of prelabor rupture of
      membranes (PROM) at or beyond 34 weeks gestational age.

      Objective 1: To determine if there is a decrease in time from initiation of induction of
      labor to vaginal delivery in women with an unfavorable cervix with the use of oral
      misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin.

      Hypothesis: Cervical ripening with misoprostol will be beneficial in women with an
      unfavorable cervix.

      Sub objective 1: To determine if the use of oral misoprostol for cervical ripening decreases
      the rate of postpartum hemorrhage in women with PROM.

      Hypothesis: Misoprostol use will result in significantly lower rate of postpartum hemorrhage.

      Sub objective 2: To evaluate the rates of infectious morbidity in peripartum women and
      neonates exposed to misoprostol versus oxytocin in PROM.

      Hypothesis: The use of oral misoprostol will result in lower rates of infectious morbidity in
      mother and neonate.

      Sub objective 3: To analyze patient satisfaction surveys. Hypothesis: Patients in the oral
      misoprostol group will be more satisfied with their labor experience.

      Exploratory Outcome To determine if there is a difference in cost between induction of labor
      in women with an unfavorable cervix with the use of oral misoprostol versus intravenous
      oxytocin.

      Hypothesis: The use of oral misoprostol will be cost effective in women presenting with PROM
      and an unfavorable cervix.
