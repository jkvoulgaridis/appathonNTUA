  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind stuy in which patients
      with acute pharyngitis will receive Myramistin™ / Placebo, which is provided as a spray.
      Patients will be randomised at Visit 1 on a 1:1:1:1 basis to one of the three MyramistinTM
      doses (0.005%, 0.01% and 0.02%) or placebo. The trial duration for an individual patient is
      72 hours.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the short-term efficacy of different MyramistinTM doses
      (0.005%, 0.01% and 0.02%) compared to placebo in the symptomatic treatment of acute
      pharyngitis.
