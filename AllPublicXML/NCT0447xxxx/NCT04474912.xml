  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The total number of the included subjects was 120 in 3 equal groups (RA, OA and control). All
      subject was subjected to serum IL17 level measurement. MSK US (of both wrists, MCPs, PIPs and
      DIPs) was done to all patients in RA and OA groups. Disease activity was measured by disease
      activity score (DAS28) for RA patients. Visual analogue scale for pain (VAS) was obtained
      from patients in RA and OA groups. Functional assessment was done using health assessment
      questionnaire (HAQ) for RA patients and the Australian/Canadian (AUSCAN) Osteoarthritis Hand
      Index for OA patients
