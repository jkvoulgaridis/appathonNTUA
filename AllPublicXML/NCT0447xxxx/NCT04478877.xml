  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, meningioma organoids will be established from patients' tissues and the
      characterization of the organoid will be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aims and Hypothesis to be tested:

      The investigators hypothesized that the derived organoid should have a similar morphological
      and genetic mutation signatures to the patient primary tissue.

      Study period: 1 year for patient recruitment and organoid generation from patient tumor

      Study population: 30

      Study samples:

      Patient's meningioma tumor sample are collected from patients with surgical needs. Sample
      collected are used for organoid culture. Morphological and genetic characteristics will be
      compared between the patient tumor sample and the corresponding derived organoids

      Primary outcome measures:

      Whole exome sequencing data of patient tumor tissue and patients-derived organoids
