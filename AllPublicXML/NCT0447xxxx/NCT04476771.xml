  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is called Feliz-Mente, with third generation therapy components that aims to
      improve wellbeing and self-enhancement. Without intervening directly on the symptoms, it is
      expected to increase positive experiences, the use of personal strengths and positive
      relationships, and aims to build a more meaningful self-narrative in persons with subclinical
      paranoia. Feliz-Mente is a group intervention of 12 sessions in which participants are
      expected to perform exercises during and between sessions by the use of a mobile application
      to improve treatment adherence and daily practice. The design for the present study is a
      randomized controlled trial, which compares the post-intervention measures of the
      experimental group (group receiving the intervention and the daily use of a mobile
      application of the program) with the post-intervention measures of the control group
      (treatment as usual + waiting list).
