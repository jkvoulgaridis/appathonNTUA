  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In case of acute and chronic illness nutritional problems are widespread, and a reduced
      dietary intake in combination with effects of catabolic disease rapidly lead to malnutrition.
      A high prevalence of protein energy malnutrition in patients has been reported. A close
      relation between malnutrition and re-admission rate, cost of hospital care in terms of length
      of stay in hospital as well as mortality has been documented. A Cochrane review of the use of
      oral nutritional supplementation suggested that oral nutrition not only provided nutrients,
      but also has significant improvements on psychological and social functions, possibly through
      enhancing sensation of taste and flavor which is an important mediator of pleasure and
      well-being. Therefore, an oral option of nutrition is always considered as the first choice
      of nutritional intervention, in particular in situations where nutritional interventions,
      such as assisted feeding, are difficult, time-consuming and demanding due to advanced
      morbidity and slow responses. In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators will
      explore the gaps of nutritional needs and the potential use of nutrition supplementation in
      the management of malnutrition among patients in Hong Kong. The investigators aim to improve
      the nutrient intakes and the nutritional status of participants through a specially
      formulated oral nutrition supplement titled &quot;Fresubin® Powder Fibre&quot; to reverse malnutrition
      status due to acute and chronic illness. Fresubin® Powder Fibre is a nutritionally complete
      powder product to be reconstituted in different caloric densities (1.0 to 1.5 kcal/ml) and
      containing high quality protein and vitamin D for the dietary management of participants with
      or at the risk of malnutrition.

    <measure>Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Body Mass Index. Height will be measured twice to the nearest 0.1 cm and body weight will be measured twice to the nearest 0.1 kg. BMI will be calculated as body weight in kg / (height in m)2.</description>

    <measure>Mini Nutritional Assessment-short form(MNA-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in MNA-SF would be used to examine the nutritional status of the participants. The scale of this test would be 0 to 14. Malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition will be classified as having a score of 11 or below. Score of 12-14 would be defined as normal nutritional status.</description>

    <measure>SF-12 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured with the validated Chinese version of SF-12, which includes physical and mental domains. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100. Higher score indicates better health-related quality of life in both domains.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-rated health</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-rated health will be elicited by a single question, &quot;Generally speaking, how is your health: excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?&quot;The scale would 1 to 5 and a lower score indicates worse self-rated health in this study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>5-item FRAIL scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item FRAIL scale will be measured.A score of 1 is assigned to each of the five components: fatigue, resistance (i.e. inability to climb up 10 steps), ambulation (i.e. inability to walk two to three blocks), having more than five diseases, and recent weight loss of more than 5%. Frailty scores range from 0 to 5 and represent frail (3 to 5), pre-frail (1 to 2), and robust (0) health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>3-day dietary record</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>3-day dietary record will be used to capture dietary intake for 3 days. The days of recording will be randomly assigned so that all days of the week, including weekend days, will be equally represented. Instructions about recording type of foods and how to estimate the portion sizes in household measures will be given. On the scheduled visit, the trained personnel will check the dietary records for completeness, obtain additional information about unclear items or amounts, and use examples of household measures to improve the estimation. The daily nutrient intake will be calculated by the Food Processor Nutrition analysis and Fitness software version 8.0 (ESHA Research, Salem, USA), with addition of composition of local foods based on food composition table from China and Hong Kong. Change in diet quality in terms of energy intake would be measured as outcome.</description>
