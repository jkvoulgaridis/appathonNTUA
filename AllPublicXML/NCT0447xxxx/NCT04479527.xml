    <description>Camrelizumab for injection is used to treat patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma who have undergone at least second-line chemotherapy. Approved by the Drug Administration (NMPA) on March 4, 2020, for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have previously received sorafenib therapy and/or oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy.Apatinib Mesylas is a small-molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It mainly treats malignant tumors by inhibiting VEGFR to play an anti-angiogenic effect. It has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in November 2014. It is used as a monotherapy for advanced gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has progressed or relapsed after receiving two kinds of systemic chemotherapy. Apatinib Mesylas can effectively inhibit VEGFR2 at very low concentrations, and higher concentrations can also inhibit PDGFR, c-Kit and c-Src and other kinases.</description>
