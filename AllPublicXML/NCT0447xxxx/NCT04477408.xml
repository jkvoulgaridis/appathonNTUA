    <textblock>
      The most important cause of mortality and morbidity with the geriatric population is loss of
      balance and the consequent falls, which is seen very often. The goal of our study is to
      examine the effects of plantar sensation education-based exercises on balance and
      falls.Materials and methods: 16 healthy, voluntary nursing home residents with the average
      age 77.50±5.5. Individuals had plantar sensory exercises 40 min sessions for 3 days/week
      during eight weeks. The study was planned as a self-controlled prospective study. Functional
      balance was evaluated using Berg Balance Scale, dynamic balance was evaluated using 30 Second
      Chair Stand Test, static balance and fall risk were assessed using Biodex Balance System.

      The study was run in Istanbul Provincial Directorate of Social Services Istanbul Prof. Dr.
      Fahrettin Kerim-Nilüfer Gökay Nursing Home Elderly Care and Rehabilitation Center in
      March-June 2019. This study was designed as a self-controlled prospective non-randomized
      study.

      Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The necessary ethical approval
      for the study was taken from the Medipol University Non-Interventional Clinical Research
      Ethics Comittee This study was planned to be run with 20 healthy nursing home residents. The
      criteria of being included in the study were: being above 70 years of age, scoring at least
      22 points on the Mini Mental Test, not being bound to a wheelchair, being able to walk 20
      meters independently, and that the sensation of the foot sole is at least on the decreased
      protective level compare to Semmes Weinstein Monofilamnet test. The individuals with serious
      loss of eyesight, mental retardation, a schizophrenic background, having walking disorder,
      inconvenient in walking were not included in the study.

      16 healthy aged individuals with the average age of 77.50±5.5 participated in our study. 2 of
      the first 20 participants left the study due to health problems and 2 other participants left
      due to personal reasons which they did not want to declare (Figure 1).

      A homogeneous control group could not be created due to aging, so a control group was created
      with the same participants. The first evaluations of our study were made within two days.
      After the evaluation process, 4 weeks waiting period was given. At the end of this period,
      second measurements were made for two days. Plantar sensory based exercises program lasting 8
      weeks was applied after the second measurements were taken. Post-treatment measurements were
      made for two days after the treatment ended. Measurements were made with MC and the
      physiotherapist working in the nursing home.

    <measure>Biodex Balance System - Static Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>0 week</time_frame>
    <description>The device calculates a score of stability or loss of balance in the anteroposterior and mediolateral direction. It also calculates an average stability index by taking the average of these two scores. The general balance index score was used which was obtained according to the protocol in the guide manual of the device. The measurement of static balance was repeated 3 times on the 8th level mode with a test duration of 30 seconds, with 15 seconds of rest periods and the best result was taken into evaluation. A high score indicates that the loss of postural control and balance is high.</description>

    <time_frame>0 week</time_frame>
    <description>For evaluate to fall risk the device was used as stated in the guide manual. The test was run gradually by moving from an unstable surface to a stable surface for 20 seconds in three sets. Between each set, the participants rested for 10 seconds. A high score indicates that the fall risk is high.</description>
