      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a strength training protocol on
      the uninjured upper extremity either alone or with the addition of blood flow restriction
      (BFR) training on subjects who have undergone shoulder arthroscopy.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a strength training protocol on
      the uninjured limb either alone or with the addition of blood flow restriction (BFR) training
      on the status of the injured limb post shoulder arthroscopy. Patients will be randomized into
      one of three standardized physical therapy (PT) groups after shoulder arthroscopy: Control
      group (CON), Strength Training on the uninvolved shoulder (STR), strength training with the
      BFR on the uninvolved shoulder (BFR). All three patient groups will follow a standardized PT
      rehab protocol that is usual standard of care on the involved shoulder. The STR and BFR group
      will follow a typical standard of care rehab protocol to the uninvolved side to investigate
      the potential effects of cross-education. Isometric strength will be assessed utilizing
      handheld dynamometry (HHD) at Kerlan-Jobe during their regularly scheduled pre-operative and
      follow-up visits. Patients age 18 and older undergoing shoulder arthroscopy for rotator cuff
      repair and/or biceps tenodesis. The study includes 3 visits which are standard of care
      pre-operative and post-operative visits. The duration of the study will be 14 weeks. 2 weeks
      to allow for a pre-op baseline strength assessment and 12 weeks post-op for the final
      assessment during the patients routine follow-up visit. Physical Therapy will be standardized
      for all three groups in terms of frequency and rehabilitation protocol. The only exercises
      that will be added will be to the intervention groups on the uninvolved side. Patients will
      present to physical therapy 2-3 times/week during the duration of the study regardless of
      their group allocation.
