      This is a randomized non-blinded trial evaluating the effect of virtual reality goggles on
      perceived pain and anxiety scores during venipuncture on hospitalized children ages 5-21. We
      will randomized patients to either standard of care (including Lidocaine 2.5%/Prilocaine 2.5%
      cream as a topical anesthetic 60-240 minutes prior to venipuncture) or standard of care plus
      virtual reality goggles.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        patients aged 5-21 years old admitted to the 6th floor of the inpatient unit who are
        scheduled for a venipuncture during morning phlebotomy rounds

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients developmentally or physically not appropriate to use the VR equipment as
        determined by their parent, guardian or healthcare provider, if there is discomfort related
        to wearing the goggles (for example: recent neurosurgery, migraines, hardware on head),
        patient have photosensitive seizures or infectious concern such as scabies, lice, COVID-19
        that can't reliably be disinfected.

        Patient (&gt;18) or Parent or guardian (for patient &lt; 18) that does not speak English, Spanish
        or Arabic will be excluded.

        If patient refuses Lidocaine 2.5%/Prilocaine 2.5% cream use they will also be excluded from
        the study.
