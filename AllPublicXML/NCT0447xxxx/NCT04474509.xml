      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) raised as one of the third wave Cognitive-Behavioral
      Therapy and resulted to be efficacious in promoting the core process of Psychological
      Flexibility, a key ability related to physical and psychological health outcomes. Despite
      evidence-based ACT protocol were applied successfully in different contexts, including the
      promotion of long-standing behavioral change, the impact of the single processes in the
      psychological flexibility model remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of a Focused-ACT intervention for the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, by
      separating and evaluating the single core processes targeted into a modular intervention. An
      individually randomized group treatment trial will be conducted. 150 adult obese patients who
      are attending a four-week medically-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation of weight loss
      will be randomly allocated into three group: Module Engage, Module Openness, and Module
      Awareness. In each group, the respective process will be targeted, in 2 group sessions,
      provided twice a week, lasting about one hour each. At the beginning and at the end of the
      intervention participants will complete the Psychological General Well Being
      Inventory(PGWBI), the Outcome Questionnaire-45.2 (OQ-45.2), the Brief Values Inventory (BVI),
      the Committed Action Questionnaire (CAQ), the Italian-Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (I-CFQ),
      the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ II) and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire
      (FFMQ). Also, weight will be recorded. After a period of six months (Time2) and one year
      (Time 3) from discharge, follow-up data will be collected. Repeated measures 3 (conditions) x
      4 (times) will be assessed to examine differences between three groups within four times on
      both general outcomes measure of weight, BMI, PGWBI and OQ-45.2, and FACT processes targeted
      during the interventions (BVI, CAQ, I-CFQ, and FFMQ) including the general measure of
      Psychological Flexibility (AAQ II).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of the recent third-wave Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT) raised in the last twenty years. It is grounded in Functional Contextualism, a
      form of pragmatism based on the principle of &quot;act in the context&quot;. It emphasizes the role of
      context in understanding the nature and the functions of events that occur and observes
      events as a whole. Based on behavioral therapy, ACT is also theoretically rooted in
      Relational Frame Theory (RFT) a contextual theory of cognition. Raising from this
      epistemological and theoretical basis, ACT conceptualizes human psychological suffering as
      resulting from a relationship between individuals and their historically and
      situational-based context.

      ACT targets six core processes to promote &quot;psychological flexibility&quot; defined as &quot;contacting
      the present moment fully as a conscious human being, and based on what the situation affords,
      changing or persisting in behavior in the service of chosen values&quot;: Acceptance, Defusion,
      Contact with the present moment, Self as a context, Values, Committed Actions. These
      processes were condensed in the Focused- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy approach (FACT), a
      brief application of ACT-based intervention, which is characterized by three core components:

        -  Openness refers to the willingness to experiencing distress and undesirable private
           events, as part of human experience, without judgment or attempts to avoid or control
           internal states, even if they are unpleasant. It encompasses the promotion of cognitive
           defusion, that concerns the relationship between a person and his internal states,
           including thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. While a &quot;fused&quot; person acts as
           thoughts are literally true, instead of perceiving them as mental events, defusion
           allows distancing from own personal internal states.

        -  Awareness is the ability to be present at the moment and facing events as contextually
           situated. To be aware means stepping back from suffering situations and seeing them in
           the context where they occur. This kind of acceptance is a valid alternative to
           Experiential avoidance, that is one of the most important pathological process that
           allows people to avoid unpleasant internal events, thoughts, feelings, physical
           sensations, even though the attempt to escape causes psychological distress.

        -  Engagement in actions linked to personal values, such as relationships, work, spiritual
           growth. If a person engages himself in committed actions driven by chosen life
           directions is able to pursue a meaningful and coherent life. The process points out the
           relevance of leaving in accordance with personal goals and values, engage themselves in
           behaviors driven by personal choices, in order to pursue a meaningful life.

      FACT resulted a promising evidence-based behavioral intervention, particularly suitable to
      health care settings, due to his brief nature and his adaptation in group settings.

      Glover and colleagues provided findings in support of the efficacy of a brief -4 group
      sessions FACT protocol in producing improvement of perceived quality of life and reducing
      stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in 51 patients in a primary care setting.

      Despite psychological flexibility could be conceptualized as a higher-order process related
      to well-being and health, there is a lack of evidence underline the focused effect of every
      single component of FACT processes on general outcomes.

      One promising approach is modularization of treatments into a specific module that reflect
      their processual components. Unpacking the manualized intervention into specific modules
      allows therapists to personalize intervention for the need of individuals while preserving
      the standardization of therapy, according to evidence-based guidelines.

      With this work we propose a treatment protocol based on the application of a FACT- oriented
      group psychological treatment applied in a single health care center for obesity management.
      The main scope of the intervention is to promote some crucial psychological abilities for
      stable behavioral change, to foster the long-term adoption of a healthy lifestyle, in obese
      patients undergoing treatment for weight management.

      The aim of the present study is twofold: The first aim is to evaluate whether our
      intervention is effective in producing noticeable changes in processes targeted within the
      modules. The second clinically-relevant interest is to test the specific impact of each
      single core process of FACT on the ability to change behaviors, in order to maintain weight
      lost and produce improvement in psychological well-being in obese patients.

      Due to the novelty of our intention, it is difficult to perform well-defined hypothesis. The
      only expectation is to find the pre-to-post intervention change in psychological processes,
      given by the effect of each module, and a general improvement in treatment outcomes and
      therapeutic processes.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is weight loss maintenance. Weight, and height will be assessed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI= kg/m2). Weight loss maintenance will be assessed considering the difference between initial weight and weight recorded at follow-up. Success in long term weight loss maintenance is achieved if individual loss at list 10% of initial weight, and maintains weight lost for one year (R. R Wing &amp; Hill, 2001)</description>

    <description>During this module, patients will have the opportunity to increase their motivation to change and encourage the engagement in committed actions, consistent with their life values. Patients are invited to reflect on what is important in their lives, which values make their life worth living, and which actions they could take to live a meaningful life, in accordance with personal values. The use of metaphors and experiential exercises will facilitate the process of exploring personal values, identifying life directions and related behaviors. For example, the 80th Birthday Party metaphor requires participants to imagine there is a party in honor of their birthday and the time comes when people are starting to give speeches and try to answer the question about what they want to hear people at the party say. This exercise help patients in wondering what person they want to be with themselves and others.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants attending this module are guided to recognize and distancing themselves to stressful thoughts, feelings and sensations. They will learn to read suffering as part of human experience, without self-judgment and self-condemnation. Rather, therapist will encourage the patient's assumption of an open and acceptable approach to internal experiences. Throughout the module, therapist will help patients to reflect on their usual, but ineffective efforts to solve personal problems, and encourage the adoption of new responsive strategies based on acceptance and defusion from personal distress.
An example of metaphor used during the Module is The Passenger on a bus. In this metaphor patient have to imagine to be a driver bus and his every thought is a passenger that gets on and off the bus. This exercise help patients to accept, defuse from, and reduce the power of their thoughts.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>FACT Module Awareness</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The module comprises meditation exercises and experiences aimed to learn how to act intentionally with awareness about personal thought and sensations without automatically reacting. Participants are supported to recognize their actions and the context where they occur and learn to choose to respond with action consistent with their values and not automatically. Therapist will propose breathing exercises, body scan and others mindfulness experiences. Participants will be encouraged to sitting comfortably, close the eyes, feel themselves in contact with the present moment they are living, paying attention to their breath, noticing the rhythm and any other aspect of the experience of breathing. Then, the therapist guides the participant's attention on the body, noting any part of their body from the head to feet. Then, the sounds around, any noises that could distract their attention on themselves.</description>
