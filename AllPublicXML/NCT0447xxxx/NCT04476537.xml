      The overall objective of this project is to determinate the feasibility of administering
      personalized therapy to subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer utilizing the novel
      OncoTreat platform. The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of
      implementing the OncoTreat framework in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a major health problem in the United States and
      throughout the world. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has the worst prognosis of any
      major malignancy in the United States and, unlike other common cancers, annual deaths from
      PDA are rising. During 2017, it is estimated that 53,670 people were diagnosed with PDA and
      approximately 43,090 people died from PDA in the U.S. Despite recent advances, cytotoxic
      chemotherapy for PDA has been disappointing with response rates of 20-30% for the most active
      regimens and little activity for targeted therapies. Even among the small subset of patients
      who are suitable for surgical resection at the time of diagnosis, complete resection is
      followed by recurrence in &gt;90% of patients without further systemic therapy, with a median
      time to recurrence of 6.9 months. Thus all PDA patients require systemic chemotherapy and
      more effective regimens are urgently needed.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is whether a subject is assigned a therapy that they are able to begin on Part 2 of this study. Assigment of therapy is based on results from OncoTreat analysis and recommendations of the Precision Medicine Tumor Board (PMTB) which included assessment of availability and expected toxicity of identified agents.</description>

    <description>Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria based on their provided tissue sample will be followed by the investigators to obtain medical information every 4 weeks. This follow-up will consist of a review of medical records, contact with the participant's treating physician, or personal contact between the participant and the investigators at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). During the study, their tumor tissue will be evaluated to identify medications that may help treat the cancer. The results of these tests will be reviewed by experts on a Precision Medicine Tumor Board (PMTB) and these experts may recommend a specific treatment to the participant or participant's physician.These participants will continue to be followed until death or withdrawal of consent from the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.

          -  Age â‰¥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic ductal
             adenocarcinoma or be willing to undergo a biopsy with confirmed pathology prior to
             starting therapy.

          -  Have untreated disease that is unresectable due to being metastatic or locally
             advanced without potential of surgery as assessed by the treating physician.

          -  Subjects who have documented disease recurrence greater than 6 months after completing
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for limited disease will be eligible for the
             study.

          -  Have a predicted life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

          -  Subjects must have a plan to obtain a new core biopsy of a primary and/or metastatic
             lesion planned as part of routine care for which consent is obtained separately or (b)
             consent to be biopsied to satisfy the tissue requirements of this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Has previously received neoadjvuant or adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer unless
        greater than 6 months has passed since completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy
        and initiation of therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease.
