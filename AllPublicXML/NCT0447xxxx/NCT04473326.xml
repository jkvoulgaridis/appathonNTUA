  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reinforcement learning is an advanced analytic method that discovers each individual's
      pattern of responsiveness by observing their actions and then implements a personalized
      strategy to optimize individuals' behaviors using trial and error. The goal of this pilot
      study is to develop and test a novel reinforcement learning-enhanced text messaging program
      to support medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is an
      optimal condition in which to test this program, as it is one of the most prevalent chronic
      conditions in the US adult population and requires most patients to be on daily or twice
      daily doses of medications. This pilot study will be a parallel randomized pragmatic trial
      comparing medication adherence and clinical outcomes for adults aged 18-84 with type 2
      diabetes who are prescribed 1-3 daily oral medications for this disease. Participants will be
      randomized to one of two arms for the duration of the study period: (1) a reinforcement
      learning intervention arm with up to daily, tailored text messages based on time-varying
      treatment-response patterns; or (2) a control arm with up to daily, un-tailored text
      messages. Our outcomes of interest will be medication adherence, as measured by electronic
      pill bottles, and HbA1c levels.

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will receive up to daily, tailored text messages based on their electronic pill bottle-measured adherence. Given the participants' baseline characteristics and time-varying responses to the messages, a reinforcement learning algorithm will deliver different text messages and adapt over time to determine which type of messaging works best for each individual participant.</description>
