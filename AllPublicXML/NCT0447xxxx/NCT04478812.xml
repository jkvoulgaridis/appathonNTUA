  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Tbit™ System will detect S100B and GFAP concentrations with the blood specimen to produce
      and compare repeated measures from 3 blood samples from 3 fingersticks from one subject and
      one 1 venous whole blood sample will be collected from the same subject, on 3 different Tbit™
      System by 3 different operators.
