  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary capacities of individuals are an indication of both the individual's exercise
      capacity and endurance. The most important indicator of cardiopulmonary capacity is maximum
      oxygen uptake and respiratory parameters. Auxiliary respiratory muscles exercises and core
      stabilization exercises have a place in increasing the maximum oxygen uptake. There are
      studies investigating the effects of respiratory muscle training and core stabilization
      training on maximum oxygen uptake in the literature. However, there is no study in the
      literature comparing the effects of auxiliary respiratory muscles exercises and core
      stabilization exercises on maximum oxygen uptake and respiratory parameters. Thanks to the
      findings to be obtained from our study, it is aimed to contribute to the literature with
      objective, evidence-based results in this field.

      The study will be carried out on volunteers after the approval of the ethics committee.
      Before the research, individuals and / or their relatives will be informed about the purpose
      and content of the study. Volunteer individuals between the ages of 18-25 without any known
      health problems will be included in the study after obtaining their informed consent.

      Participants will be randomly divided into three groups: control group, core stabilization
      exercises and auxiliary respiratory muscles exercises.

      In the core stabilization exercises and auxiliary respiratory muscles exercises groups,
      exercises will be carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist 3 days in a week
      separate time periods. Core stabilization exercise include, plank, lateral plank, swimmer,
      flutter kick and bridge exercises. Auxiliary respiratory exercises include, strengthening and
      stretching exercises for trapezius, sternocleidomastoideus, pectoralis major and serratus
      anterior muscles. Our study will take 6 weeks. The demographic information of the
      participants will be recorded and the VO2max values of the participants before and after the
      study will be measured with the H / P Cosmos Mercury Med device using the balke protocol.
      Respiratory function tests of participants will be measured with Cosmed Fitmate Med device
      before and after the study.
