    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to alpelisib in combination with
      fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative, advanced
      breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after disease progression following a CDK 4/6
      inhibitors; according to physician's judgement there are no therapeutic alternatives
      available for patients in this setting. The patient's Treating Physician should follow the
      suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health authority regulations

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for inclusion in this Treatment Plan have to meet all of the following
        criteria:

        Written patient informed consent must be obtained prior to start of treatment.

          1. Patient is an adult female (≥ 18 years of age) with advanced (locoregionally recurrent
             not amenable to curative therapy or metastatic) hormone receptor-positive,
             HER2-negative breast cancer

          2. Patient has documented evidence of a mutation in the PIK3CA gene as determined in
             tumor tissue or plasma by a local laboratory.

          3. The patient is postmenopausal. Postmenopausal status is defined either by:

               -  Prior bilateral oophorectomy

               -  Age ≥60

               -  Age &lt;60 and amenorrheic for ≥12 months in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen,
                  toremifene, or ovarian suppression and Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) and
                  estradiol in the postmenopausal range per local normal range

          4. Patient has evidence of progression during or after only one line of CDK4/6 inhibitors
             plus NSAI therapy for the advanced setting. CDK4/6 inhibitors plus NSAI therapy need
             to be the latest treatment regimen.

          5. Patient has a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of ER+ and/or
             PgR+ breast cancer by local laboratory.

          6. Patient has HER2-negative breast cancer defined as a negative in situ hybridization
             test or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization
             (FISH, CISH, or SISH) test is required by local laboratory testing

          7. Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following
             laboratory values:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L

               2. Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L

               3. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               4. Potassium, magnesium and calcium (corrected for serum albumin) within normal
                  limits or ≤ grade 1 according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 if judged clinically not
                  significant by the Treating Physician, or corrected with supplements

               5. INR ≤ 1.5

               6. Creatinine clearance &gt; 50% LLN

               7. In absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN. If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and
                  AST ≤ 5 × ULN

               8. Total serum bilirubin &lt; ULN (or ≤ 1.5 × ULN if liver metastases are present, or
                  total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 × ULN and direct bilirubin in normal range for patients
                  with Gilbert's syndrome)

               9. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 140 mg/dL (7.7 mmol/L)* and Glycosylated
                  Hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤ 6.4% (both criteria have to be met)

                  prediabetes), recommend lifestyle changes according to ADA or similar local
                  diabetes guidelines, i.e. dietary advice (e.g. small frequent meals, low

                  of the day, three small meals and 2 small snacks rather than one large meal) and
                  exercise. A consultation with a diabetologist is highly recommended.

              10. Fasting Serum amylase ≤ 2 × ULN

              11. Fasting Serum lipase ≤ ULN
