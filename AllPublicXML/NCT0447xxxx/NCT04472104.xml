  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to compare the effects of a group mindfulness treatment versus
      a group sex education on sexual desire, sexual distress, and sexual pain in breast cancer
      (BrCa) survivors. Participants will be randomly assigned to either 8 weekly sessions of a
      group mindfulness-based treatment or 8 weekly sessions of a sex education group. Groups will
      consist of approximately 8 breast cancer survivors and will be led by 2 trained therapists.
      Participants will complete four assessments (involving a clinician administered interview and
      standardized questions): pre-treatment, post- treatment, and 6 month follow up.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women over the age of majority, with a history of breast cancer and who are at least 3
             months following the end of their treatment

          -  Fluent in English

          -  Exceed the clinical cut-off for sexual distress (Female Sexual Distress Scale).

          -  Women who are, and who are not, in a relationship will be eligible as long as they
             have engaged in sexual activity either alone or with a sexual partner in the past 6
             months, or as long as they indicate a willingness to engage in sexual activity (alone
             or with a sexual partner) during the time period of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active cancer treatment (e.g. chemotherapy or radiation, not including endocrine or
             maintenance therapies provided they remain constant for the study duration), or
             scheduled breast reconstruction during the study period.

          -  Borderline Personality Disorder or other psychiatric or medical conditions that
             preclude the ability to fully participate in the group sessions, assessments, and
             homework.

          -  In order to determine whether any changes in symptoms are a result of participation in
             the intervention, women must also agree to 1) not make changes to or commence vaginal
             interventions (e.g., topical hormone treatments, vaginal moisturizers, vaginal
             dilation) or 2) engage in other treatments for sexual difficulties (e.g., sex
             therapy), for 2 weeks prior to the baseline assessment until 2 weeks following the
             final intervention session.
