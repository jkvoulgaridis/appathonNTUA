  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In its 2017 revision of the global guidelines for HIV care and treatment, the World Health
      Organization (WHO) called for rapid or same-day initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART)
      for eligible patients testing positive for HIV. However, to date neither the WHO nor the
      Zambia Ministry of Health has provided detailed guidance on how to implement this
      recommendation.

      In sub-Saharan Africa, where most HIV patients are located, studies continue to document high
      losses of treatment-eligible patients from care before they receive their first dose of
      antiretroviral medications (ARVs). Among facility-level reasons for these losses are
      treatment initiation protocols that require multiple clinic visits and long waiting times
      before a patient who tests positive for HIV is dispensed an initial supply of medications.
      There is very little published evidence on the practical details of the process and the
      extent to which it varies by facility, setting, or country. Without a robust baseline
      evidence base, it is challenging to identify opportunities for making improvements. The
      SPRINT (Survey of Procedures and Resources for Initiating Treatment of HIV in Africa) study
      will begin to develop this evidence base. SPRINT will combine a facility-level description of
      the standard of care with a retrospective record review of patients who recently initiated
      ART at the study sites. Data will be collected from 12 health facilities in Zambia. The
      survey will elicit detailed information about current procedures through structured
      interviews with clinic staff at the selected health facilities. The record review for a
      retrospective cohort of patients eligible for ART will estimate actual numbers of clinic
      visits, services provided, and duration of the steps for treatment initiation from start to
      finish. SPRINT is expected to identify differences in approaches to treatment initiation and
      potential opportunities for improvement.
