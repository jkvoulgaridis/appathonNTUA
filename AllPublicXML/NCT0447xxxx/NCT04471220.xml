  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the exercise capacity (6-min walking distance) under
      the following 4 conditions using High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); 1. FIO2 value that the
      minimum SpO2 value in a 6-minute walking test (6MWT) is 86-88%, and a flow of 10 L/min 2.
      FIO2 value that the minimum SpO2 value in a 6MWT is 86-88%, and a flow of 40-50 L/min 3. FIO2
      value that the minimum SpO2 value in a 6MWT is 92-94%, and a flow of 10 L/min 4. FIO2 value
      that the minimum SpO2 value in a 6MWT is 92-94%, and a flow of 40-50 L/min

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the pervious study, the investigators demonstrated that 4 weeks of training using both
      high FIO2 and high flow through an HFNC significantly improved the 6MWD compared with
      training using a 6 L/min nasal cannula. However, it was unclear whether the effects of
      pulmonary rehabilitation under HFNC were due to high FIO2, high flow rate, or a synergistic
      effect. It is also unknown whether there are differences in the effects of pulmonary
      rehabilitation under HFNC for each underlying disease.

    <intervention_name>High-flow nasal cannula</intervention_name>
    <description>The nasal high flow therapy has enabled high flow oxygen to be derived through nasal cannula. This mode not only allows constant FiO2 during peak inspiratory flow but also confers benefits including a low level of continuous positive airway pressure with increased end-expiratory lung volume and reduced work of breathing, partly through intrinsic positive end-expiration pressure compensation and dead space washout. The inspired gases are warmed and humidified, improving comfort and possibly reducing airway inflammation, leading to improved drainage of respiratory secretions.</description>
