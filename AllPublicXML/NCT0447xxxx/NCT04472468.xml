    <textblock>
      Pericardial effusion is a common complication in patients with metastatic malignancy. While
      pericardiocentesis provide effective relieve from life-threatening situation such as cardiac
      tamponade, recurrence of pericardial effusion after pericardiocentesis is common. We
      hypothesize that percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy in addition to standard
      pericardiocentesis with prolonged drainage can prevent pericardial effusion recurrence in
      patients with malignant pericardial effusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pericardial effusion is a common complication in patients with metastatic malignancy with an
      incidence as high as 21%. The occurrence of malignant pericardial effusion significantly
      impacts on patient's survival and quality of life. While pericardiocentesis provide effective
      relieve from life-threatening situation such as cardiac tamponade, recurrence of pericardial
      effusion after pericardiocentesis is common and occurs in as high as 31% of patients.
      Retrospective data has shown that prolonged pericardial drainage might reduce the recurrence
      rate but at the cost of increased risk of infection and prolonged hospital stay. Surgical
      pericardiotomy was used in the past but was not shown to reduce recurrence over prolonged
      pericardial drainage and is associated with a higher rate of complications. Surgical
      pericardial window creation via a mini-thoracotomy might be an effective treatment and can be
      considered in patient with pericardial tamponade. The safety and feasibility of Percutaneous
      Balloon pericardiotomy (PBP) has been first described 1993 and has been shown to be an
      alternative treatment for patient with malignant pericardial effusion. However, no data is
      available on the efficacy of PBP in reducing the recurrence of pericardial effusion, in
      comparison with standard pericardiocentesis with prolonged drainage. We aim to perform a
      single centre, randomized, prospective, open label controlled pragmatic trial to compare
      percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy (treatment) to standard pericardiocentesis with prolonged
      drainage (control) in preventing pericardial effusion recurrence in patients with malignant
      pericardial effusion.

    <description>Patient in this arm will receive balloon pericardiotomy before insertion of pericardiocentesis.
An 20mm over-the-wire ultra-non-compliant Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty Balloon is used to dilate the pericardium.
Success of balloon pericardiotomy is confirmed by full inflation of the balloon which is confirmed on two orthogonal projections.
Standard pericardiocentesis with prolonged drainage is performed afterwards.
Pericardial drain is removed when output is less than 100cc/day</description>
