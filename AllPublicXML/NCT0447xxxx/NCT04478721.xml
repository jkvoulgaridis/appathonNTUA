  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomised, Controlled, Open-Label Study to demonstrate
      noninferiority of temocillin (unauthorized investigational medicinal product IMP in Spain,
      but authorized in Belgium and UK) vs a carbapenem antibiotic (meropenem) in adults with
      bacteraemia due to third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

      The duration of treatment will be between 7 and 14 days. From the 5th day of intravenous
      treatment, the sequential oral treatment is permitted if the patient meets appropriate
      conditions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of temocillin (2g each 8
      hours, intravenous) to carbapenems (meropenem 1g each 8 hours, intravenous) in terms of
      efficacy and safety in the targeted treatment of bacteraemia due to Enterobacteriaceae
      resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, and therefore provide evidence for the use of
      temocillin in these infections.

      The duration of treatment will be between 7 and 14 days. From the 5th day of intravenous
      treatment, the sequential oral treatment is permitted if the patient meets appropriate
      conditions.
