    <textblock>
      Empyema is associated with a wide range of complication and mortality. It is defined by
      either a positive pleural fluid culture or grossly pus appearance. However, little is known
      about the differences in aetiology and outcome between culture-positive empyema (CPE) and
      culture-negative empyema (CNE). The aim of the current study is to look at the local
      prevalence of CNE, and compare the clinical outcome between CPE and CNE.

    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is a common disease and it ranked second as the leading cause of death in Hong Kong
      in 2016. Among patients suffering from acute pneumonia, up to 57% of them would develop
      parapneumonic effusion. Without proper treatment, parapneumonic effusion would progress into
      empyema, which is a clinical emergency. Empyema leads to a longer length of hospital stay, a
      higher rate of complication and mortality than uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion.

      The mainstay of treatment for empyema is antibiotics and drainage. Therefore, identification
      of causative microorganism is important in guiding the choice of antibiotics. The common
      bacterial culprits, for community acquired and hospital acquired, were identified by various
      local and international studies. However, the aetiological agents were still unknown in up to
      40% of cases. In addition, the clinical outcomes between culture negative empyema (CNE) and
      culture positive empyema (CPE) are largely unknown. Data from one Taiwanese study suggested
      that patients with CPE had a higher in-hospital mortality than those with CNE. However, the
      primary objective of this study was not putting on the importance of CNE. Therefore, data on
      outcome of CNE patients remain largely uncertain, either worldwide and local population.

      The aim of the current study is to look at the local prevalence of CNE, and compare the
      clinical outcome between CPE and CNE. Through more understanding of CNE, the clinical
      management of this patient group may be altered and a better patient outcome is anticipated.
