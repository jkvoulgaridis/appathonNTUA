  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of distant metastasis is a key challenge for nasopharyngeal carcinoma because
      of poor outcomes, among which, chemotherapy is the cornerstone. However, many studies
      reported the use of different chemotherapy regimens to prolong the survival of metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, while few of them focused on how to reduce the side effects of
      chemotherapy or improve the life quality of patients. Thus, we sought to find an efficient
      chemotherapy regimen with high tolerance according to the characteristics of chemotherapy
      drugs, that is, to explore the efficacy and safety of platinum plus 5-fluorouracil with
      continuous intravenous infusion at a low dose for a long term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor of the nasopharyngeal epithelium with
      high sensitivity to ionizing radiation. With the use of intensive chemoradiotherapy,
      excellent treatment outcomes can be achieved for local control, but disease failure was
      observed in approximately 20% of patients. Moreover, approximately 10% of newly diagnosed
      patients diagnosed with metastasis, resulting in about 30% of NPC patients will present with
      either synchronous or metachronous metastasis in total.

      Chemotherapy is the cornerstone of the treatment of metastatic NPC. Many studies were aimed
      at the systemic treatment of metastatic NPC, but most of them were retrospective studies or
      phase II trials with small samples. The outcome of metastatic NPC is poor with a median OS of
      about 20 months. Platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy is generally regarded as the
      standard treatment for metastatic NPC. After a multicenter phase III randomized clinical
      trial was published in 2016, gemcitabine plus cisplatin is recommended, however, less than
      60% of patients could complete the treatment in the trail. Finding a proper regimen with
      promising efficacy results as well as high tolerance is still a big challenge.

      Cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (PF) is a classical regimen widely used in metastatic NPC. The
      continuous infusion of 5‐fluorouracil with low dose was investigated in esophagus carcinoma,
      rectal carcinoma and prostate carcinoma with encouraging outcome and acceptable toxicity.
      Whereas, data of platinum-containing chemotherapy with low-dose continuous infused
      5-fluorouracil in metastatic NPC was absent. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
      antitumor activity of platinum plus low-dose long-term continuous intravenous infused
      5-fluorouracil (PFLL).
