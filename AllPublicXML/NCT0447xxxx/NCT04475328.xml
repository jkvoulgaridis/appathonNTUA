  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AngongNiuhuang pill has obvious effects on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
      Pharmacological experiments confirmed that AngongNiuhuang pill can protect blood-brain
      barrier, inhibit capillary permeability, improve the tolerance of cerebral ischemia and
      hypoxia, reduce oxidative stress injury, thus protecting brain tissue. Clinical studies have
      also confirmed that AngongNiuhuang pill can increase the GCS score, reduce coma, improve
      nerve function defect and promote nerve function recovery. The primary purpose of this trial
      was to evaluate the difference in the volume of cerebral infarction and cerebral edema
      between Angong Niuhuang pill and placebo in patients with ischemic stroke at 14 days compared
      with the baseline.

      This trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo parallel controlled,
      multicenter trial. Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized
      1:1 into two groups after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive AngongNiuhuang
      pill 1pill qd/day for 5-day; 2) the other group will receive Placebo of AngongNiuhuang pill
      1pill qd/day for 5-day. The primary purpose of this trial was to evaluate the difference in
      the volume of cerebral infarction and cerebral edema between Angong Niuhuang pill and placebo
      in patients with ischemic stroke at 14 days compared with the baseline. The study was
      consisted of six visits, including the day of randomization, 2 days, 3-6 days, 7 days (the
      endap time of the therapy), 14 days, and 90 days (the endap time of the follow-up).
      Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment
      neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the program. The period of the
      trial is from August 2020 to October 2021, and 120 subjects are planned to be recruited from
      10 centers in China. All the related investigative organizations and individuals will obey
      the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Guard-cell protoplast (GCP) standard. A Data and
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study.

    <description>Modified Rankin Scale, a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. 0 - No symptoms.1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.6 - Dead. The mRS scores between 3 to 6 points are considered to be poor functional outcome.</description>

    <measure>Changes in NIHSS score on Day 14 and 90 of the treatment from baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHSS is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>
