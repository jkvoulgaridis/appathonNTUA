  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections in critically ill patients are a major healthcare problem and an important source
      of morbidity and mortality. Since critically ill patients often have altered pharmacokinetics
      (PK) compared to non-critically ill patients there is a substantial risk that present
      standard dosing regimens of antibiotics lead to suboptimal outcomes for patients on the ICU.
      To prevent the risk of inadequate dosing in ICU patients, it is important to fully understand
      the PK of antibiotics in this vulnerable group in order to optimize the dosing regimens.

      With this study, the investigators will describe the pharmacokinetics of cefuroxime and
      amikacin in ICU patients. A heterogeneous population of ICU patients will be included to be
      able to find which factors might influence the pharmacokinetics of these drugs and to what
      extent. By using population modeling the investigators will simulate different dosing
      regimens and MIC values and compare probability of target attainment between each of these
      dose and MIC combinations. This will allow the investigators to optimize dosing regimens of
      cefuroxime and amikacin in critically ill patients.
