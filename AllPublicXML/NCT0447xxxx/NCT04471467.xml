  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is commonly used in operations of the mouth, pharynx, larynx
      and also the neck .Various complications can occur such as epistaxis,
      bacteremia,turbinectomy, retropharyngeal dissection, and nasal alar pressure sores or
      necrosis.In clinical practice, nasal pressure sores caused by NTI are not uncommon, but have
      failed to attract clinical attention.The investigators have observed that the surgeon fixed
      the nasal tracheal tube and threaded tube directly to the patient's head. The investigators
      suspect that this method can reduce the pressure between the nasal tube and the nose.

      Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is commonly used in operations of the mouth, pharynx, larynx
      and also the neck .Various complications can occur such as epistaxis,
      bacteremia,turbinectomy, retropharyngeal dissection, and nasal alar pressure sores or
      necrosis.In clinical practice, nasal pressure sores caused by NTI are not uncommon, but have
      failed to attract clinical attention.Oral and maxillofacial surgery usually uses nasal
      endotracheal intubation to manage the airway. The tube fixation directly presses the skin of
      the patient's nose. Due to the operation, the surgeon must stand on the head of the patient
      and there is not enough space to place the tracheal tube bracket. Prolonged vascular
      compression on the nasal region may be caused by excessive tension and angulation of the
      nasotracheal tube against the nasal tissue.Studies have proposed the use of nasal packing,
      hydrocolloidal dressing and modified nasal tracheal tube to reduce the direct contact between
      the nasal tube and the nose, relieve the pressure between the two, so as to prevent the
      occurrence of alar pressure ulcers, but there is no objective data to show the degree of
      pressure reduction.In clinical practice, the investigatorshave observed surgeons fixed the
      nasal endotracheal tube and threaded the tube directly to the patient's head. The
      investigators suspect that this method can reduce the pressure between the nasal tube and the
      nose, so the investigators want to use a pressure sensor to monitor the pressure between the
      two.

    <description>Tracheal tube fixation is determined by the surgeon according to the needs of the operation and is an independent process. Our research simply installed a monitoring device between the tube and the nose. The tube fixation takes place whether the observation of pressures is agreed to or not, as per standard protocol.</description>
