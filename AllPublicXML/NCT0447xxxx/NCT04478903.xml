  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a disease that requires long-term management, especially now that medical advances
      have transformed most cancers from an acute to a chronic condition. Most of the time,
      therefore, the help provided by family and friends is long-term.

      The negative impact of oncological care on the quality of life of family caregivers has
      already been studied. The UCOGB carried out a study in 2014 on the primary caregivers of
      cancer patients aged 70 and over at inclusion and at 3 and 6 months of oncogeriatric care.
      This study showed that several factors were significantly related to the caregiver's quality
      of life: the caregiver's age, perception of burden and patient autonomy (18). However, the
      evolution of quality of life and burden at 5 years has, to our knowledge, never been
      evaluated.
