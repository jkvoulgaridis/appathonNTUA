  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of
      fezolinetant and ES259564 (fezolinetant metabolite) in female participants with varying
      levels of renal impairment (mild, moderate and severe) compared to healthy female
      participants with normal renal function.

      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of
      fezolinetant in female participants with varying levels of renal impairment (mild, moderate
      and severe) and healthy female participants with normal renal function.

      Renal function will be measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the
      modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula: Mild (eGFR 60 to &lt; 90 mL/min per 1.73
      m^2) renal impairment; moderate (eGFR 30 to &lt; 60 mL/min per 1.73 m^2) renal impairment,
      severe (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min per 1.73 m^2) renal impairment and not on hemodialysis and normal
      (eGFR â‰¥ 90 mL/min per 1.73 m^2) renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be comprised of four groups of participants based on renal function.
      Participants will be screened for up to 28 days prior to investigational product (IP)
      administration on Day 1. Eligible participants with mild, moderate and severe renal function
      and healthy participants with normal renal function will be admitted to the clinical unit on
      Day -1 and will be residential for a single period of six days/five nights. On Day 1,
      participants will receive a single oral dose of fezolinetant under fasting conditions
      followed by a 96-hour in-house blood and urine sampling period. Participants are to remain
      awake, seated or semirecumbent and avoid lying on either the left or right side for at least
      four hours postdose. Standard safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted.
      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on Day 5 on the condition that all
      required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer
      stay in the clinical unit.

      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place five to
      nine days after the last pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at early discontinuation from
      the study.
