  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Yoga has received considerable attention for its potential therapeutic benefits over the past
      decades and it gradually became object of scientific scrutiny. There is currently extensive
      literature supporting its use as a non-pharmacological tool for managing a variety of medical
      problems. A few studies have also explored potential beneficial effects of practising yoga
      during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes. An association between prenatal yoga and
      decreased incidence of fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and labor abnormalities
      resulting in operative delivery have been reported.

      Exact mechanisms by which yoga could improve perinatal outcomes have not been elucidated yet.
      One of such mechanisms could be the positive effect of yoga on autonomic nervous system
      (ANS). Maternal cardiovascular system undergoes profound changes during pregnancy and ANS
      plays a central role in adaptation to pregnancy-related hemodynamic changes. Increase in
      peripheral vascular resistance that characterises hypertensive disorders in pregnancy with
      fetal growth restriction is mediated by substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor
      activity. Effects of yoga on ANS outside of pregnancy have already been investigated in
      several studies. Heart rate variability (HRV) indices, used as a one of proxy measures for
      ANS activity, showed significant shifts towards parasympathetic dominance following yoga
      sessions. Another objective means of assessing ANS activity is measurement of phase
      synchronisation between cardiovascular and respiratory systems following acute challenge. The
      higher the cardiorespiratory synchronisation after acute challenge is, the higher is the
      ability of ANS to flexibly adapt to challenge.

      The objectives of the study are:

      I. To examine whether there is a short-term shift in autonomic balance to the parasympathetic
      branch of the ANS and ability of the cardiovascular and respiratory respiratory systems to
      flexibly adapt to acute psychological challenge following sessions in pregnancy.

      II. To investigate potential long- term effects of yoga practice during pregnancy on HRV and
      cardio-respiratory synchronisation following acute psychological challenge.

    <description>Cardio-respiratory phase synchronisation index measures synchronisation between the cardiovascular and respiratory system following acute psychological challenge. It's value is between 0 (no synchronisation) and 1 (complete synchronisation). The higher the value, the higher the ability of cardiovascular and respiratory systems to flexibly adapt to challenge (standardised memory task).</description>

    <description>For frequency related HRV indices, we will run an autoregressive spectral analysis using Burg's algorithm (model order 24) after resampling and removing the trend of 2nd order. Low frequency (LF) will be defined as 0.04 - 0.15 Hz, high frequency (HF) will be defined as 0.15 - 0.40 Hz. The higher the LF/HF HRV ratio, the lower the parasympathetic tone.</description>

    <description>The sequence technique will be used for the assessment of baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS). This technique is based on identifying consecutive cardiac beats in which an increase in systolic blood pressure is accompanied by an increase in heart rate, or in which a decrease in systolic blood pressure is accompanied by a decrease in heart rate. The regression line between the systolic blood pressure and heart rate produces an estimate of BRS. The higher the BRS, the higher the parasympathetic tone.</description>

    <description>Participants in yoga group will be recruited during prenatal yoga classes at two locations: Maribor and Ljubljana. Women will be instructed to attend one class per week. Classes will consist of pregnancy-adapted yoga practices according to the system Yoga in Daily Life. They will be 90 min in duration and will consist of initial relaxation (10 to 15 min), followed by yoga postures (asanas) and stretching exercises (45 to 60 min), and final breathing (pranayama), concentration (dharana), and meditation (dhyana) techniques (20 to 30 min). Two certified yoga instructors will lead yoga classes. Measurements will be performed before and after yoga session.</description>
