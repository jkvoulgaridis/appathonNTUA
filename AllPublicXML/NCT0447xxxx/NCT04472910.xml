  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there have been no Canadian led neoadjuvant or peri-operative trials, this
      multicentre design gives the opportunity to build more experience with this strategy across
      Canada in more institutions. The design of this prospective trial will also test our
      important hypotheses regarding the use of biomarkers to understand the benefit of mFFX in
      improving outcomes for patients with resectable pancreas cancer. Data from this study would
      likely inform future studies where patients are given personalised options for the best
      treatment strategies rather than one empiric approach.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histological diagnosis of PDAC. Those with unconfirmed histology must
             have this confirmed by EUS-FNB in the pre-screening period prior to commencement of
             chemotherapy. Invasive PDAC in the setting of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
             (IPMN) is permitted.

          -  Patients must consent to EUS-FNB for correlative analysis even if adenocarcinoma has
             been confirmed, unless confirmation was performed using a previous biopsy or fine
             needle biopsy with adequate tumour tissue for GATA6 analysis.

          -  Resectable primary tumour on preoperative biphasic (arterial and venous phases)
             contrast-enhanced CT for pancreatic staging as per institutional standard of care,
             with ≤5 mm slice thickness. MRI for liver metastases (optional) as per institutional
             standard of care. The definition of resectability (as per NCCN guidelines - see
             Appendix B) includes:

               -  no involvement of the celiac artery, common hepatic artery or superior mesenteric
                  artery (or if present a replaced right or common hepatic artery)

               -  no involvement or &lt;180 (interface between tumour and vessel wall, of the portal
                  vein or superior mesenteric vein, and patent portal vein/splenic vein confluence_

               -  For tumours of the body and tail of the pancreas, involvement of the splenic
                  artery and vein of any degree is considered resectable disease

          -  Patients must be medically fit to undergo surgical resection

          -  No prior oncological treatment for index PDAC

          -  ECOG Performance status 0-1

          -  Patients must be medically suitable for treatment with mFFX as per treating medical
             oncologist

          -  No evidence of metastases (i.e., metastatic work-up negative including a CT scan of
             the chest, abdomen (IV and oral contrast, 3 phase) and pelvis)

          -  Adequate hematologic function

               -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3

               -  platelets ≥ 100 000 cells/mm3

               -  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/L (after transfusion is acceptable))

          -  Creatinine level &lt; 130 µmol/L or CrCl ≥ 50 ml/min

          -  Patients of child-bearing potential (for female patient: study entry after a menstrual
             period and a negative pregnancy test) must agree to use two medically acceptable
             methods of contraception (one for the patient and one for their partner) during the
             study and for 4 months after the last study treatment intake for women and 6 months
             for men. These patients must have a pregnancy test repeated every month while on
             chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent

          -  Adequate liver function (AST &lt;2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal at the

             unconfirmed histology.

          -  Patients in whom histology has confirmed PDAC but who do not consent to EUS-FNB,
             unless previous confirmation was by biopsy or fine needle biopsy with adequate tumour
             tissue for GATA6 analysis.

          -  Non-ductal pancreas tumours including endocrine tumours, acinar cell carcinoma, cyst
             adenocarcinoma or ampullary tumours.

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or

             carcinoma in situ or other indolent malignancy (discretion of PI).

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients are excluded from this study as the chemotherapy
             agents used in this study have been demonstrated or have the potential to be
             teratogenic and there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother

          -  Patients who are being therapeutically anticoagulated with coumadin and cannot have an
             alternative anticoagulation regimen.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the drugs used or their components.

          -  Patients with known complete absence of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)
             activity.

          -  History of QT prolongation or receiving QT prolonging medications.
