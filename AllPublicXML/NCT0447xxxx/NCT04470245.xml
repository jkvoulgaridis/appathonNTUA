  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cubital Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) results from compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow
      (colloquially termed the &quot;funny bone&quot;). CTS affects up to 6% of the population and 6000
      patients undergo surgery annually in the UK. Surgery is the only proven treatment for CTS,
      although up to 30% of patients do not improve. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop
      a reliable test to diagnose CTS to improve the selection of patients for surgery.

      New techniques in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow the visualisation of
      nerve structure and function. Diffusion tensor MRI, also known as diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI), can diagnose CTS with superior diagnostic accuracy and could enable the reliable
      diagnostic of CTS, improving the selection of patients for surgery.

      The study will include healthy volunteers (to refine the scanning sequence) and patients
      undergoing surgery for CTS. Patients will be scanned preoperatively and postoperatively using
      cutting-edge diffusion MRI techniques. The primary outcome will be change in the MRI-derived
      diffusion metrics following surgery. Secondary outcomes will consider how MRI relates to
      patient-reported outcomes and conventional clinical tests (ultrasound and nerve conduction
      studies).

      Leeds is the ideal location for this research because a) Leeds institutions are the most
      highly cited organisations in musculoskeletal research, b) Leeds houses the National Centre
      for Hyperpolarized MRI and a state-of-the-art MRI scanner, and c) Leeds is an internationally
      recognised centre of excellence for complex upper limb surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (over 18 years of age) undergoing surgical decompression of the ulnar nerve at
             the elbow for cubital tunnel syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to get into the MRI scanner due to habitus or claustrophobia

          -  Unable to lie still due to any cause (eg. athetoid movements, dystonias, chorea, etc)

          -  Intraocular or intracranial metallic foreign bodies

          -  Active implants (eg. pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators, nerve
             stimulators, etc) which are not MRI safe or conditional.

          -  Pregnancy - whilst there are no known adverse effects of MRI16-18 to the mother or
             fetus, MRI is generally avoided in pregnancy due to the acoustic trauma19 and
             inductive heating generated by alternating magnetic fields.

          -  Any metallic implants in the elbow
