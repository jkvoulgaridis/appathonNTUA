      Objective: In this study, our aim will be investigating the pregnancy results in unexplained
      infertile women undergoing ICSI, by flushing the endometrial cavity with folliculer fluid,
      that we maintain mature follicules inside them in oocyte retrieval day.

      Study Design: 100 subfertile women who applied to Zeynep Kamil Hospital, In Vitro
      Fertilization Center between October 2016 to May 2017 will be randomized with computer
      generated programme. The patients will be divided into two groups; follicular fluid group
      (n=50) and control group (n=50). The inclusion criterias are: age between 20-39 years, basal
      FSH level &lt; 10 mIU/ml, body mass index&lt;35 kg/m2 and E2 levels in human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG) day between 1000-4000 pg/ml. Patients meets these criteria will be included to the
      study programme. The exclusion criteria are determined as below: previously diagnosed
      endometriosis, uterine leiomyomas, hydrosalpinx, endocrinological disorders; previous history
      of implantation failure in IVF/ICSI cycles and severe male factor infertility.
