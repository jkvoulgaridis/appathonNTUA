  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The essential anesthesia requirements for FESS include airway management, considerations for
      facilitating surgical access, provision of a clear and still surgical field for precision
      surgery, assuring quick and non-stimulating emergence from anesthesia, and fast-tracking
      patients for discharge. Postoperative agitation, although short-lived, is potentially harmful
      to both patients and recovery room staff, it has a potential for self-injury by removing
      intravenous catheters, tubing, oxygen masks and nasal packs. Furthermore, very agitated
      patients can pose an immediate danger to operating theatre staff.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine is an amino amide-type short-acting local anesthetic (LA). It has a short
      half-life, and a favorable safety profile, and is therefore the LA of choice for continuous
      IV administration, it has analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects that are induced by
      reduction of cytokines production through inhibition of neutrophil activation, and the
      analgesia may persist even after plasma concentration reduction. It can blunt the pressor
      response to endotracheal intubation also systemic lidocaine was effective in producing
      controlled hypotension.
