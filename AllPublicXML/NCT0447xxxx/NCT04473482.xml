  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if providing patients with alcohol-related liver
      disease with tailored alcohol use treatment options will is feasible and acceptable in order
      to increase their engagement with treatment and reduce alcohol use. This is an important area
      to study to help create ways to increase patients' knowledge about different treatment
      options as well as increase likelihood of seeking and participating in alcohol use disorder
      treatments.

    <measure>Acceptability of the MAIN-ART tool as measured by post-intervention surveys</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the MAIN-ART tool will be determined by patient-level surveys of acceptability and usability of the tool.</description>

    <measure>Alcohol use frequency as measured by the Alcohol Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol use will be defined according to World Health Organization (WHO) risk drinking level. WHO drinking risk levels were derived from patient reports of the number of standard drinks (defined as 0.6 ounces of absolute alcohol) consumed, which were converted to grams of pure alcohol (0.6 ounces = 14 grams). Ranging from abstinence (0 grams) to very high risk (101+ males / 61+ females grams).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
