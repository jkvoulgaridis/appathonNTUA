  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper respiratory tract infection is the most common respiratory disease in childhood, and
      the incidence rate accounts for more than 60% of pediatric outpatients, ranking first in
      pediatric diseases. At present, antibiotics are commonly used to treat children with upper
      respiratory tract infections. However, due to the large amount of clinical use of antibiotics
      in recent years, the resistance of various pathogens has become stronger and stronger, which
      has caused the majority of clinicians and researchers to turn their attention to traditional
      Chinese medicine. Qingfei Granule is composed of six common herbal medicines such as
      Schizonepeta (Jing-Jie),Radix Scutellariae (Huang-qin),Forsythia (Lian-Qiao), etc. After
      upper respiratory tract infections with bacterial infections, chills, fever, runny nose, red
      and sore throat may occur, and may be accompanied by mild cough, thin red tongue, yellow
      moss, floating pulse,which is considered as the exogenous wind-heat Zheng in Chinese
      medicine. The study aims to assess the antibacterial effect and symptoms-relief of Qingfei
      Granule in the patients with pediatric acute upper respiratory tract infection with bacterial
      infection.

    <description>The pharyngeal swabs were used for sampling, and the pharyngeal flora diversity amplicon sequencing was used to analyze the pharyngeal flora spectrum, and the change of pathogenic bacteria flora spectrum before and after treatment was analyzed to qualitatively judge the bacterial clearance.
Calculate the bacterial clearance rate = (number of people removed / total number of people tested) × 100%</description>
