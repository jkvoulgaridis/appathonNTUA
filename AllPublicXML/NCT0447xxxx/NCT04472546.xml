  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physiological states of the skin are characterized by a certain homeostasis linked to the
      balance of the metabolic pathways. When these pathways are deregulated, the proteic, lipidic
      and metabolic is affected. It is thus possible to follow a change in the state of the skin by
      looking at change in the associated molecular profile.

      The PRISM laboratory (INSERM U1192) in Lille has developed an innovative system laser called
      SpiderMass composed of 4 parts:

        1. A laser used for the micro-sampling of material in vivo,

        2. A transport transfer line of the ablated particles,

        3. A mass spectrometer that analyzes them in real time and generates the molecular profiles
           of the epidermis,

        4. A data analysis procedure.

      The SpiderMass(TM) is of great interest for the study of the skin because it allows
      non-invasive vivo characterization, and therefore without biopsy or sample preparation. In
      addition, it will complement techniques already used in the research center such as FTIR
      spectroscopy. Indeed, in acne studies the FTIR allows to obtain only the Fatty Acid
      Triglycerid ratio while the SpiderMass permits to detail these lipid classes by each observed
      molecule on the surface of the skin and follow their evolution.
