  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, romiplostim, helps low platelet count
      caused by the standard blood cancer treatment of chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic
      cell transplantation. This study will also look at whether romiplostim can decrease the
      number of times the participant needs to return to the clinic for platelet transfusions to
      treat their low platelet count. In addition, the researchers will determine how safe it is to
      give romiplostim to people with blood cancer who have received treatment with chemotherapy
      and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation.

    <description>Patients will be enrolled prior to admission for High-Dose Therapy and Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HDT-AHCT), and they will undergo their planned HDT-AHCT for their respective hematologic malignancy as per institutional standards.
Regardless of the conditioning regimen received, all patients will receive romiplostim 3.0 mcg/kg SC weekly starting on day +1 after HDT-AHCT for at least two doses and until platelet count is &gt;50,000/mcL, without any platelet transfusions in the prior 48 hours. No patient will receive more than six doses of romiplostim, even if platelets have not corrected by Day +42.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients ≥ 18 years old diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM), any subtype of
             Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), or any subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including CNSL,
             who are undergoing HDT-AHCT.

               -  For MM, the conditioning regimen used will be high-dose melphalan.°For HL and
                  NHL, the conditioning will be one of the following high-dose regimens: BEAM, CBV,
                  or TBC.

               -  Other conditioning regimens not listed above, or variations of the above
                  conditioning regimens, may be allowed at the discretion of the principal
                  investigator if the regimen is considered myeloablative.

             infarction, ischemic cerebral vascular accident or transient ischemic attack in the

             hemodialysis, or active infection requiring IV antibiotics.

             development factor, eltrombopag, recombinant human TPO, any other TPO receptor
