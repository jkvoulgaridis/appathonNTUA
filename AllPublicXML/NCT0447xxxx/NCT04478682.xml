      METHOD:

      Place of the Research:

      The data of the research will be collected in the postpartum service of Zeynep Kamil Women
      And Chıldren Dıseases Tranıng And Research Hospıtal in Istanbul. After then 6 months of
      follow-up will be continued trough WhatsApp application.

      The Universe and the Sample of the Research:

      The universe of the research; It will comprise primipa mothers and babies who are
      hospitalized in the postpartum ward of the specified dates, deliver vaginal or cesarean
      delivery, and meet the sample selection criteria.

      The sample of the research was determined by statistic analysis by power analysis. Power
      analysis was performed by using G * Power (v3.1.7) program to determine the number of
      samples. The power of the study is expressed as 1-β (olasılığı = type II error probability)
      and research should generally have 80% power. According to Cohen's effect size coefficients;
      Assuming that the evaluations to be made between the two independent groups will have a
      medium effect size (d = 0.5), considering the fact that there should be at least 64 people in
      the groups and there may be losses in the working process, each group decided to recruit 70
      people. 140 people in total. it is given. Computerized randomization method will be used in
      the research.

      In the collection of research data; Mother and Newborn Data Collection Form Postpartum
      Breastfeeding Evaluation and Follow-up Form Application Satisfaction Evaluation Form

Intrinsic motivation and integrated regulation
Identified regulation
Mirrored editing
External regulation is examined in two sub-dimensions:
External regulation (instrumental needs)
External regulation (baby health) Scale items are rated from 1 = Never disagree to 4 = Strongly agree. The scale is in 4-point Likert type, and each item is scored between 1-4. The scale does not have a total score. The score of the sub-dimensions is calculated by taking the average of the scale sub-dimension scores. As the score obtained from the sub-dimension of the scale increases, the motivation representing that sub-dimension increases.</description>
