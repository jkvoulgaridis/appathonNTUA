      The main purpose of this research study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of
      SX-682 in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma who have completed at least 16 weeks of first line chemotherapy treatment
      without evidence of disease progression.

      In this study the investigator would like to better understand the maximum tolerable dose
      (MTD) of SX-682 in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma who have completed at least 16 weeks of first line chemotherapy treatment
      without evidence of disease progression. In addition, the investigator would like to measure
      the SX-682 pharmacokinetic data in humans. The investigator would also like to assess the
      immunophenotypic and stromal changes to the tumor microenvironment after treatment.

        eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI- except
        where contraindicated, in which case a CT scan is acceptable) evidence of progression for
        at least 8 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of
        study drug administration. An MRI is not required to rule out brain metastases or
        leptomeningeal metastases. There must also be no requirement for high doses of systemic
        corticosteroids that could result in immunosuppression (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalents)
        for at least 2 weeks prior to study dry administration.

        Medical History and Concurrent Disease

        Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
        increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair
        the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the
        interpretation of study results. Specifically:

          1. Subjects with active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          2. Subjects with interstitial lung disease or a history of pneumonitis that required oral
             or intravenous glucocorticoids to assist with management.

          3. Subjects with clinically significant heart disease that affects normal activities.

          4. Clinically significant cardiovascular/ cerebrovascular disease defined as cerebral
             vascular accident, stroke, carotid artery disease transient ischemic attach (&lt; 6
             months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt;6 months prior to enrollment),
             unstable angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification
             Class &gt;II) or serious cardiac arrhythmia.

          5. Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers
             that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer,
             superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix or breast.

          6. Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only
             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted
             to enroll.

          7. Subjects with a condition (including organ or bone marrow transplant) requiring
             systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents)
             or other immunosuppressive medications. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal
             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease.

          8. Use of other investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) or
             medications at immunosuppressive doses within 28 days before study drug
             administration.

          9. Patients who received immunotherapy or investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

         10. Patients who underwent major surgery within 4 weeks of enrollment (not including
             diagnostic laparoscopy)

         12. History of or medication induced prolonged QT interval.

         13. Any botanical preparation (e.g., herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines)
             intended to treat the disease under study or provide supportive care. Use of marijuana
             and its derivatives for treatment of symptoms related to cancer treatment, even if
             obtained by medical prescription or if its use (even without a medical prescription)
             has been legalized locally.

        Physical and Laboratory Test Findings

          1. A history of Hepatitis B or C, either acute or chronic, as indicated by HBV surface

             to positive HCV RNA.

          2. Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
