  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the psychosocial and behavioral impacts of receiving Alzheimer's
      disease genetic risk assessment incorporating APOE genotypes among Latinos in northern
      Manhattan. The investigators will conduct a longitudinal, community-based study with a mixed
      methods design. Participants will be randomized to learn about their lifetime risk of
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) based either on (a) Latino ethnicity and family history
      alone (genotype nondisclosure group), or (b) the same factors plus APOE genotype (genotype
      disclosure group). Responses will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 9 months, and 18 months after risk
      assessment. In the quantitative component of the study, the investigators will assess
      psychosocial outcomes, memory test performance, and health-related behaviors. In the
      qualitative component of the study, the investigators will investigate the lived experience
      of receiving personal AD risk information, using a stress and coping theoretical framework.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      APOE is the strongest genetic predictor of risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Given the high level of interest in genetic testing, the demand for predictive testing for
      APOE will surely increase. Improved understanding of the impacts of testing, sources of
      variability in response, and inclusion of diverse samples are critical for informing methods
      to promote safe and effective disclosure of AD genetic risk information.

      As with other diseases, previous research on AD, a devastating and incurable illness, has
      found little significant or sustained distress in response to genetic susceptibility testing
      for APOE, even among persons who learn they are at elevated risk. These surprising findings,
      which run counter to the experience of many clinicians, may be related to limitations in the
      methods of previous studies. Most previous studies primarily enrolled well-educated
      Caucasians with a family history, who were strongly motivated to pursue genetic risk
      information. Further, most studies assessed impacts primarily through standardized measures
      of depression and anxiety, which may not capture the kinds of distress experienced or coping
      strategies that might blunt or mask distress. Qualitative research shows that receipt of
      genetic information can have important psychosocial effects not well captured through
      standardized measures. Also, in one study, people with a high-risk gene test for APOE
      performed worse on memory tests if they were informed about the results than if they were not
      informed, suggesting that other impact measures are needed.

      Another important limitation of prior work is that it has lacked representation of ethnic
      minority groups. Latinos are the second largest U.S. ethnic group, comprising about 18% of
      the population, yet no previous study has investigated the impacts of receiving AD genetic
      risk information among Latinos. While AD incidence rates may vary among Latino subgroups,
      data from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), a study in northern
      Manhattan, indicate that they are about twice as high among Caribbean Hispanics (primarily
      Dominicans) as among persons of European ancestry.

      In this study, the investigators will improve understanding of the impacts of receiving
      personal AD genetic risk information and the factors that influence adjustment to such
      information among Latinos who live in the same communities studied in WHICAP.

    <ipd_description>De-identified data from surveys collected in the study will be made available from the PIs, after acceptance for publication of the primary analyses of the survey data, to qualified researchers who sign a data user agreement as described below. The investigators will provide documentation of all survey data (variable names, variable formats, variable and value labels) to accompany the data, and will share the actual survey instruments upon request. Because interview transcripts can be highly identifying, they will not be shared. However, the codebooks and interview guides will be available from the PIs, after acceptance for publication of the primary analyses of the interviews, to qualified users as described below.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>Data will be available to users only under a data user agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.
Requests for data must be in writing and addressed to the co-PIs. We will create a data request form that will include investigator affiliation, contact information and a brief description of the project, including specific aims, study design, characteristics of the data requested, and analysis plans. Applications for data use will be reviewed by the co-PIs and a data use committee composed of the other co-investigators. Approval will be contingent upon IRB approval for the proposed data analysis from the institution of the investigator requesting the data.</ipd_access_criteria>
