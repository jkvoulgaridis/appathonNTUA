    <textblock>
      This is a first in human Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics with healthy young and elderly adult male volunteers after receiving single
      and multiple ascending dose of BEY2153.

    <textblock>
      Healthy young and elderly adult volunteers who meet the criteria, will be treated single and
      multiple ascending dose of BEY2153 or placebo orally. Food effect evaluation study will be
      conducted with single ascending dose. After the single ascending dose study, independent
      external experts will review blinded data and multiple ascending dose study will be
      conducted.
