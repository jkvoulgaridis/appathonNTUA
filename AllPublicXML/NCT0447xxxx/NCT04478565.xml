  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge no study has evaluated neither feasible methods for the assessment of
      anthropometric profile nor indirect methods to estimate energy expenditure (EE) for adapted
      athletes. The primary aim is to develop and validate new RMR prediction models, for the
      estimation of the resting metabolic rate from anthropometric variables in young Mexican
      Paralympic athletes; our second objective is to evaluate the agreement between RMR and the
      prediction models of Cunningham, Harris-Benedict, Henry, Valencia, Chun, Nightingale &amp;
      Gorgey, FAO/WHO, Mifflin, Müller, Owen, and our own models. A comparative cross-sectional
      quantitative study was designed. Participants report to the testing laboratory only once for
      data collection. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
      criteria guidelines for cross-sectional research (STROBE) is followed in the design/reporting
      of this study.

    <description>The RMR was measured by IC using a portable device (Breezing®, Arizona, USA), which was calibrated before each test and has been described as a valid and reliable system (Xiaojun et al. 2015). RMR was calculated by breath oxygen consumption (O2 in mL·min-1), minute by minute, using the Weir equation (1949), while participants remained in a sitting position for ≈15 to 20 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        i) swimmers who report to the assessment area with a fasting period of 6 to 8 hours, and at
        least 12 hours after their last exercise routine; ii) swimmers who have not consumed
        alcohol or any stimulant for the last 48 hours (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate, carbonated
        drinks, energy drinks, supplements); iii) swimmers who has contested at least in one of the
        last two swimming competitions, including World Championships and Paralympic Games

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i) fail to complete the indirect calorimetry test after two attempts; ii) attend to the
        evaluation area without the appropriate clothing or without following the instructions for
        fasting, exercise, and feeding prior to the evaluations; iii) swimmers who at the time of
        the evaluations did not give written consent (parental consent in case of under 18 years
        old) for procedures or data release for research purposes.
