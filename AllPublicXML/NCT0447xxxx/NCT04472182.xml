    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be conducted to compare the efficacy of fluoride varnish containing
      xylitol coated calcium and phosphate or potassium nitrate gel versus conventional fluoride
      varnish in the management of hypersensitivity of non-carious exposed root surfaces in adult
      patients over a 12 months period.
