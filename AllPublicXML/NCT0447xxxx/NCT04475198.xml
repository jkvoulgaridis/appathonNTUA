  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, study will be conducted to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ST-2427. The study will be conducted in 2
      parts. In Part A of this study, subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of
      ST-2427 or placebo in a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) design. In Part B of this study, subjects
      will be randomized to receive up to 6 repeat doses of ST-2427 or placebo, administered
      twice-daily (BID) every 12 hours, in a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) design. In Part A and
      Part B, study drug (ST-2427 or placebo) will be administered intravenously (IV) over 1 hour.

      A total of 48 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized in a 4:2 ratio of
      ST-2427 to placebo. Study drug will be blinded to all subjects and investigators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adult males
      and females of non-child-bearing potential to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of ST-2427. This trial will include careful assessments of treatment
      effects on vital signs including cardiac and respiratory function and body temperature over a
      range of doses of ST-2427, administered as single or repeat doses for up to 3 days. SiteOne
      Therapeutics, Inc. plans to use the safety, tolerability, and PK findings from this study to
      inform the doses and study design for Phase 2 clinical studies in subjects with acute
      post-operative pain.

      Approximately 48 subjects, 6 subjects into each of 8 cohorts, will be enrolled in this study
      at a single clinical site.

      This study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part A of this study, subjects will be randomized
      4:2 to receive a single dose of ST-2427 or placebo in a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) design.
      Part A will evaluate 5 dose strengths of ST-2427, infused intravenously (IV) over 1 hour; one
      dose level in each of 5 cohorts of subjects. In Part B of this study, subjects will be
      randomized 4:2 to receive up to 6 repeat doses of ST-2427 or placebo, administered
      twice-daily (BID) every 12 hours, in a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) design. Part B will
      evaluate 3 dose strengths of ST-2427, infused IV over 1 hour, twice daily for 3 days [a total
      of 6 repeat doses] in 3 cohorts.

      Enrollment into Part B will commence after the safety, tolerability and PK of the SAD have
      been examined.
