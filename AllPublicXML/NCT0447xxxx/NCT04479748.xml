  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to assess the effect of pre-operative and continued post-operative
      corticosteroid use on pain, patient preference, visual outcomes, and change in objective
      quantifiable biological parameters in patients undergoing bilateral cataract surgery with
      premium intraocular lens implantation with or without baseline ocular surface disease.

      Patient`s first eye scheduled for surgery will receive an intracanalicular insertion of
      DEXTENZA (dexamethasone release profile of QID, TID, BID, QD, over 30 days; study eye). The
      fellow-eye will receive topical prednisolone acetate 1% (tapering schedule of QID, TID, BID,
      QD over 30 days). The fellow-eye design in n=30 patients (60 eyes) allows for balance in
      patient baseline demographic and systemic characteristics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Age 18 or greater with plans to undergo bilateral clear cornea cataract surgery with
             phacoemulsification and implantation of a premium posterior chamber IOL

               -  Schirmer's test score (anesthetized) ≥ 5 mm at Screening in either eye.

               -  TBUT ≤ 7 seconds at Screening or Baseline in either eye.

               -  All subjects must provide signed written consent prior to participation in any
                  study-related procedures. Able to comply with study requirements and visit
                  schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  revious corneal surgery or pathology

               -  Active or history of chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease in either eye

               -  Ocular pain in either eye

               -  Proliferative diabetic retinopathy in either eye

               -  Significant macular pathology detected on macular optical coherence tomography
                  evaluation at the screening visit in either eye

               -  Laser or incisional ocular surgery during the study period and 6 months prior in
                  either eye

               -  Prescription and OTC ophthalmic mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines within
                  21 days prior to Screening and throughout the study period (systemic mast cell
                  stabilizers are allowed, and systemic antihistamines are permitted)

               -  Chronic daily use (defined as &gt; 7 consecutive days at the recommended dosing
                  frequency) of systemic narcotics for any chronic pain syndrome (eg, fibromyalgia,
