    <textblock>
      Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can be helpful to improve the psychiatric, emotional,
      physical,and social status in patients with physical and mental illness and the elderly.

      The study aims to investigate the effects of AAT program in middle-aged and older patients
      with schizophrenia. The investigators will recruit 40 patients with schizophrenia in
      psychiatric ward randomised into AAT group and control group. AAT group will complete the
      12-week program. This study contains two assessment sessions before and after intervention,
      including PANSS, ACIS, MoCA-T, CHI, DASS‐21, CST, TUG and 5MWT.

      Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can be helpful to improve the outcomes of psychiatric and
      emotional symptoms, physical activeness, social skills, well-beings in patients with physical
      and mental illness and the elderly.

      The study aims to assess the applications and outcomes of psychiatric symptoms, social
      skills, cognitive function, well-beings, emotional status and physical fitness of AAT program
      applied to middle-aged and older patients with chronic schizophrenia.

      The investigators will recruit 40 patients with chronic schizophrenia who were admitted to
      day care ward and rehabilitation ward, and conduct a randomized, controlled study. 40
      patients will be stratified by the ward into AAT group and control group. AAT group will
      complete the 12-week program. This study contains two assessment sessions completed within
      one week before and after 12-week program. Subjects will be evaluated by the PANSS, ACIS,
      MoCA-T, CHI, DASS‐21, CST, TUG and 5MWT in both sessions. Statistical analysis is examined
      using paired t-test to see whether there is a significant difference (based on p‐value)
      between the scores of two assessment sessions in the AAT and control group, and using
      independent t-test to see whether there is a significant difference in the change scores of
      two assessment sessions between the 2 groups.
