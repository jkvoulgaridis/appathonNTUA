  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are very often sarcopenic/malnourished
      at diagnosis (&gt; 60% of cases) and at high risk of rapid clinical deterioration. These
      patients have important supportive care needs that represent a major challenge for improving
      treatment tolerance and patient survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

      Malnutrition and sarcopenia (muscle wasting and dysfunction) are associated with an increased
      risk of death, complications from chemotherapy, infections, emergency procedures and
      hospitalizations, and increased costs of care. Therefore, malnutrition and sarcopenia
      represent a major clinical target in GI cancers.

      Interventions targeting malnutrition/sarcopenia should be implemented as early as possible in
      patients' pathways, these syndromes being reversible at early stages but not at late stages.

      A multidisciplinary assessment at diagnosis and therapeutic approach combining nutritional
      support and adapted physical activity (APA) in addition to anticancer treatments should be
      systematically implemented in patients with advanced GI cancers.

      This type of intervention complies with the standards recommended by the National Cancer
      Institute (INCa) to promote the practice of physical activity during and after treatment in
      oncology.

      All patients will receive usual care including:

        -  Chemotherapy at the investigator's choice,

        -  Outpatient clinical visits according to the regular schedule,

        -  Tumor evaluation based on tumor marker serum levels, as appropriate, and TAP-CT with
           intravenous contrast injection every 8 weeks.

      Nutritional support will consist of:

        -  A nutrition assessment by a dietician including a VAS of food intakes at baseline, at
           W2, W4 and W8 (plus additional visits if required),

        -  Nutritional intervention according to the Société Francophone de Nutrition Clinique et
           Métabolisme (SFNEP) guidelines (dietetic counseling for all patients ± oral
           supplementation, enteral tube feeding, and/or parenteral nutrition).

      Physical activity support will consist of:

        -  A physical condition assessment by a APA profesional including physical tests (6-minute
           walking test, handgrip test, chair stand fitness test, get-up and go test, balance in
           single-leg and bipodal stance) at baseline, at W2, W4 and W8,

        -  Personalized unsupervised home-based program combining aerobic (e.g. walking, nordic
           walking) and resistance exercises.
