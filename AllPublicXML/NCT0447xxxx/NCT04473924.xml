  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections are common and associated with poor outcomes as well as high financial costs after
      kidney transplantation. Identifying and implementing strategies to reduce infections after
      kidney transplantation is important for improving patient outcomes. This study seeks to
      determine the feasibility of body surface area-based dosing of mycophenolate compared to
      standard dosing of mycophenolate in a pilot randomized controlled trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult transplant recipients â‰¥18 years of age who have a functional allograft and have
             undergone kidney transplantation between six months and two years prior to study
             enrollment

          -  Receiving mycophenolate mofetil for maintenance transplant immunosuppression at the
             time of the screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of rejection on routine six month post-transplant biopsy

          -  Prior intolerance to mycophenolate mofetil necessitating drug discontinuation

          -  Are or are planning to become pregnant, due to inability to take mycophenolate

          -  Are marginally housed, due to concerns regarding routine follow-up

          -  Are actively participating in a different interventional trial that may affect
             immunosuppression dosing

          -  Are unwilling to consent to participate
