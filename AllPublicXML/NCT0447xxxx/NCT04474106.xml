  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been hypothesized that there are two mechanisms of acute traumatic spinal cord injury
      (SCI): the primary mechanical damage and the secondary injury due to additional pathological
      processes initiated by the primary injury. Neurological damage due to laceration, contusion,
      distraction or compression of the spinal cord is called ''primary injury''. This mechanical
      injury leads to a cascade of biochemical and pathological changes, described as ''secondary
      injury'', which occurs minutes to weeks after the initial trauma and causes further
      neurological deterioration. This secondary cascade involves vascular changes, an inflammatory
      response, neurotoxicity, apoptosis and glial scarring, and further compromises neurological
      impairment after traumatic spinal cord injury. Edema, ischemia and loss of autoregulation
      continue to spread bi-directionally from the initial lesion along the spinal cord for up to
      72 hours after the trauma.

      It has been postulated that the damage caused by the primary injury mechanism is irreversible
      and therapeutic approaches in recent years have focused on modulating the secondary injury
      cascade.

      Researchers found significantly greater numbers of myelinated fibers in peripheral nerves
      after a single ESWT application in an experimental model on rats after a homotopic nerve
      autograft into the sciatic nerve.

      In another study a spinal cord ischemia model in mice was performed. ESWT was applied
      immediately after surgery and the treated animals showed a significantly better motor
      function and decreased neuronal degeneration compared to the control group within the first 7
      days after surgery.

      Researchers investigated the effect of low-energy ESWT for the duration of three weeks on a
      thoracic spinal cord contusion injury model in rats. Animals in the ESWT group demonstrated
      significantly better locomotor improvement and reduced neuronal loss compared to the control
      animals at 7, 35, and 42 days after contusion.

      It has been postulated previously, that ESWT improves the metabolic activity of various cell
      types and induces an improved rate of axonal regeneration.

      ESWT might be a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of traumatic SCI.

      The underlying study aims to investigate the effect of ESWT after acute traumatic spinal cord
      injury in humans within 48 hours of trauma in order to intervene in the secondary injury
      phase with the objective to reduce the extent of neuronal damage.
