  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates ways to detect prostate cancer earlier in men who are at increased
      genetic risk of developing prostate cancer that forms, grows, or spreads quickly
      (aggressive). Studying samples of blood, urine, and/or tissue in the laboratory may help
      doctors further understand the genetics of prostate cancer and help identify ways to detect
      cancer earlier, thereby improving treatment and methods of early detection in the future.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo collection of blood, urine, and/or tissue samples every 6-12 months,
      when any biopsy occurs, and if relevant, at time of curative therapy and 3-9 months after
      completion of curative therapy for up to 3 years.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up annually.

          -  Participant is accessible and compliant for follow-up

          -  Willing and able to undergo screening procedures, including digital rectal exam (DRE)
             and prostate biopsy, if indicated by study criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwillingness, inability or medical contraindication to undergo screening procedures,
             including prostate biopsy, if indicated by study criteria

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 5 years
