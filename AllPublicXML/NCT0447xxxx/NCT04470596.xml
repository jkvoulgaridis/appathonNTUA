      Early bacterial neonatal infection (INBP) defined as occurring in the first 3 days and by
      extension in the first week of life, remains to this day the leading cause of neonatal
      morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The germs most frequently found are
      Streptococcus B (SB) for term newborns (&gt; 37 Weeks of Amenorrhea SA) and Escherichia coli (E.
      coli) in premature newborns. Although in France, its incidence of 0.4 / 1000 is lower than in
      other developed countries (0.8 / 1000 general incidence), it remains a major public health
      concern.

      The infection criteria were defined by the National Agency for Health Accreditation and
      Assessment (ANAES) in 2002, allowing to differentiate between proven infections and highly
      probable cases of infection. Infection is considered to be proven when SB or E. coli is
      detected in blood culture or in cerebrospinal fluid. An infection is considered to be highly
      probable in the event of association of clinical signs (fever, polypnea, desaturation,
      tachycardia, etc.) evoking a beginning sepsis associating with a disturbance of the
      biological balance sheet (elevation of CRP, hyperleukocytosis, evidence of colonization on
      peripheral samples). These criteria remain valid to this day to define the infection.

      In order to define the newborns to be monitored, risk factors were established after a review
      of the literature in 2002. They make it possible to decide on diagnostic management and / or
      the setting up of a treatment.

      Since the recommendations of the ANAES of 2002, the rule, from the presence of a major
      criterion, was to carry out bacteriological samples peripheral to the birth (gastric liquid,
      swab of ear and anus) and to systematically collect a CRP of the child between H12 and H48.
      In the presence of an isolated minor risk factor, simple clinical monitoring (routine) was
      recommended for 48 hours without deciding firmly on the need for a biological sample.
      However, it is important to note that these two categories of signs are defined and
      classified in descending order of risk. This classification does not prejudge a systematic
      therapeutic attitude. In many situations, the choice is actually left to the practitioner
      depending on the context.

      In 2017, new recommendations were implemented by the French Society of Pediatrics (SFP) and
      the French Society of Neonatology (SFN) regarding the prevention of INBP. These take up the
      risk factors of the 2002 ANAES by adding PCR SB at the same level as the traditional PV. They
      define 3 categories of children according to the risk of INBP and the associated care.

      In most cases, these new practices make it possible to dispense with costly blood and
      bacteriological samples, which cause discomfort and pain for children. In addition, the use
      of gastric fluid is not internationally validated, its use in the management case remains
      very controversial. In case of delayed CRP or positive peripheral samples to the germs
      generated, and even in the absence of clinical signs, antibiotic therapy was almost
      systematically initiated. Unnecessary exposure to antibiotics promotes the development of
      bacteriological resistance and unbalances the neonatal flora.

      Following the implementation of these new recommendations at the Notre Dame de Bon Secours
      maternity hospital, which is the case in few centers today and no national survey has yet
      been carried out on their application, it therefore seems necessary to us evaluate the
      application of these new recommendations and verify that they allow the detection of all
      probable or proven infections.
