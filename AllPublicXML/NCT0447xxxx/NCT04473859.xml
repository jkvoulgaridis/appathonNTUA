    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female healthy subjects, 18-45 years of age and in good health as determined
             by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and
             laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Female subjects must have been surgically sterilized at least six months prior to
             screening. Surgical sterilization procedures must be supported with clinical
             documentation made available to the sponsor and noted in the Relevant Medical History
             / Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF. OR: Postmenopausal women must have no
             regular menstrual bleeding for at least two years prior to inclusion. Menopause was to
             be confirmed by a plasma 17β-estradiol concentration of &lt;20 pg/mL and a plasma FSH
             level of &gt;40 IU/L.

          -  Normal sitting blood pressure and pulse rate , i.e.: BP: 100 - 140 mm Hg systolic, 50
             - 90 mm Hg diastolic and pulse rate: 45 - 100 bpm. Blood pressure and pulse were to be
             measured after 3 minutes resting in a sitting position.

          -  Subject body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2

          -  Ability to communicate well with the investigator and comply with the requirements of
             the entire study.

          -  The subject has given his written consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of serious adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to any drug.

          -  Presence or history of any allergy requiring acute or chronic treatment (seasonal)
             allergic rhinitis which requires no treatment may be tolerated).

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse in the last 3 years.

          -  Abnormal physical findings of clinical significance at the screening examination or
             baseline which would interfere with the objectives of the study.

          -  Need of any prescription medication within 14 days prior to the administration of the
             drug and/or nonprescription medication within 7 days prior to the administration of
             the drug or anticipated need for any concomitant medication during the study.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial during the previous 4 weeks, i.e. from completion of
             the previous trial to the planned first administration of the current trial.

          -  Loss of 500 ml blood or more during the 3 month period before the study, e.g. as a
             donor.

          -  Existence of any surgical or medical condition which might interfere with the
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug, i.e. impaired renal or hepatic
             function, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular abnormalities, chronic symptoms of
             pronounced constipation or diarrhea or conditions associated with total or partial
             obstruction of the urinary tract.

        Symptoms of a significant somatic or mental illness in the two week period preceding drug
        administration.

          -  History of hepatitis B and / or C and / or positive serology results which indicate
             the presence of hepatitis B and / or C.

          -  Positive results from the HIV serology.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (as determined by the Principal
             Investigator) at the screening evaluation. Serum albumin below 3.5 g/l (Note to File
             no. 8 states that the correct albumin value is below 35g/l) precludes study inclusion
             in any case.

          -  History of serious mental disorders.

          -  Positive results of the drug screening.

          -  History or clinical evidence of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal,
             hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurologic or other disease.

          -  Presence of any active skin pathology including e.g., acne, acute sunburn,
             inflammatory skin disease.

          -  Presence of any open wounds or infection on the same arm.

          -  History of skin disorders e.g. atopic eczema or psoriasis or keloid reaction(s) Any
             condition that constitutes a contraindication to minor surgical procedures (such as
             bleeding disorders) or that obliges to the use of prophylactic antibiotics (such as
             mitral valve prolapse) or other comedications for the performance of minor surgical
             procedures.
