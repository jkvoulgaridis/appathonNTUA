  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of using this surgical technique in
      conjunction with bypass surgery to improve heart function and size, as well as decrease the
      possibility of future mitral valve surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Sling is used to draw together the ventricular walls at the base of the papillary
      muscles. This technique has previously been used in conjunction with mitral valve surgery,
      and has shown significant benefits for the patients.

      The reduction in the lateral inter-papillary muscle separation and in the left ventricular
      volume provided by this technique is expected to improve ventricular function, limit
      progression of ventricular dilation, and avoid progression of MR when performed without
      mitral valve surgery in patients with symptomatic ventricular dilation.

        Patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and either ischemic
        or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, referred for CABG surgery. Suitability for the
