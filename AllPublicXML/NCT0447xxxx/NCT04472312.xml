  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is the standard treatment for chronic advanced liver disease, whether
      or not associated with a primary liver tumor. The intraoperative bleeding and the need for
      blood transfusion, encountered in this major surgery are associated with increased morbidity
      and mortality. However, this hemorrhagic risk has been drastically reduced in the last 20
      years and liver transplants without the use of blood products are now possible. Indeed,
      improvements in medical and surgical techniques associated with a better understanding of the
      pathophysiology of the cirrhotic patient have enabled this advance. One of the targeted
      therapeutic strategies is the control of portal hypertension. Several treatments have been
      sought, such as the use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors (such as vasopressin) and hypovolemic
      phlebotomy. These techniques reduce portal pressure and seem to reduce intraoperative
      bleeding with, even, a protective effect on kidney function. Their single-use or their
      combination is currently used in certain centers of expertise in liver transplantation.
      However, the hemodynamic effects of the combination of these 2 treatments on portal pressure
      has never been demonstrated. In this study, the effect of vasopressin, combined with a
      hypovolemic phlebotomy, on portal pressure in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver
      transplantation will be evaluated.

      METHODS

      Objectives

      The primary objective will be to measure the hemodynamic effects of vasopressin on portal
      pressure in cirrhotic patients who have had a hypovolemic phlebotomy during a liver
      transplant.

      The secondary objectives will be to measure the effects of vasopressin on portal pressure in
      patients who have not had a phlebotomy and to compare this effect between patients who have
      or have not had a hypovolemic phlebotomy.

      The tertiary objective will be to assess the effect of the variation in portal pressure under
      vasopressin, associated or not with a hypovolemic phlebotomy, on hemorrhagic clinical
      outcomes (intraoperative bleeding and blood transfusions).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Portal pressure measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>During the surgery (intraoperatively)</time_frame>
    <description>The venous pressure in the liver will be measured by inserting a very fine needle in the portal vein. The needle will be connected to a pressure sensor and will be removed after the measurement. This measure will be performed at three different moments during the surgery; 1) as soon as possible after the incision; 2) 5 minutes after the end of the hypovolemic phlebotomy (if performed); 3) 10 minutes after the start of vasopressin infusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative blood loss</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>During the liver transplantation, a cell salvage device (Cell Saver) will be set up in the operating room. As the surgery progresses, the blood lost by the patient will be collected using suctions. The volume of blood (mL) in the suctions will be measured at the end of the surgery, before the blood is cleaned and returned back to the patient.</description>

    <measure>Packed red blood cell transfusion rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperatively and up to 24 hours following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Number of units of packed red blood cells transfused to participants will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hemoglobin concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin concentration will be verified before the surgery and after the surgery, using a photometric device (Hemocue). This device allows to accurately estimate total blood hemoglobin concentration rapidly without waiting for laboratory results.</description>

    <description>The onset or worsening of acute postoperative grade 2 or 3 renal failure according to KDIGO-AKI criteria.</description>

    <measure>Rate of new dialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative setting up to 7 days following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Any need of new dialysis occurring during the hospital stay up to 7 days following surgery will be recorded.</description>

        The investigators aim to conduct a prospective observational, non-interventional study,
        respecting current practice. This study will take place at the Centre de recherche de
        l'Université de Montréal (CHUM) where there are approximately 70 to 80 liver transplants
        per year.
