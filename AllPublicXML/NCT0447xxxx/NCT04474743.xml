  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and muscle wasting are common consequences of life-threatening, chronic diseases
      of the gastrointestinal tract. Such diseases include liver cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis
      and short bowel syndrome. Malnutrition and muscle wasting increase the risk of complications,
      reduce the life expectancy and impair the quality of life. The development of malnutrition
      and muscle wasting is different, as is the diagnosis and nutritional treatment. There are
      also different mechanisms of origin for the underlying diseases. The aim of the study is to
      compare data related to nutrition and physical condition of patients with liver cirrhosis,
      chronic pancreatitis and short bowel syndrome. Malnutrition and muscle wasting within the
      specific diseases will be characterized and possible correlations will be identified.

      For this, malnourished and non-malnourished patients of the different diseases are compared
      with controls patients with non-specific complaints of the gastrointestinal tract as well as
      with healthy study participants.

      Data on food intake, physical activity, body composition and body measurements as well as
      muscle strength and muscle function are recorded. Blood values as well as transport and
      barrier properties of the intestine will also be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and sarcopenia are consequences of life-threatening gastroenterological diseases
      such as liver cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis and short bowel syndrome and are associated
      with a poorer clinical outcome and a reduced quality of life. The diagnostic criteria of both
      conditions differ, as do the consequences for adequate nutritional therapy. Nevertheless,
      malnutrition and sarcopenia are often discussed in confusion in the literature. In addition,
      the underlying mechanisms of malnutrition and sarcopenia can differ in the various diseases.
      The aim of the study is to compare nutrition-associated parameters from patients with liver
      cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis and short bowel syndrome, to characterize the
      disease-specific phenotype of malnutrition and sarcopenia of the examined diseases and to
      obtain information on mechanistic relationships. The pathophysiological understanding of the
      clinical settings as well as the development of malnutrition and sarcopenia is important for
      choosing specific nutritional therapies. For this, malnourished and non-malnourished patients
      of each examined disease are compared with controls from patients with non-specific,
      abdominal symptoms and healthy control subjects. Data on food intake, physical activity, body
      composition and anthropometry as well as muscle strength and muscle function are recorded.
      Clinical and chemical blood parameters, the plasma metabolome as well as transport and
      barrier proteins of the intestine are also examined.
