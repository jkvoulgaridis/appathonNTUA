    <textblock>
      This study examines the integration of cancer genetic testing in various ethnic populations.
      Studying individuals and families at risk of cancer may help identify cancer genes and other
      persons at risk. The information from this study may provide an opportunity for cancer risk
      stratification and individualized screening in these ethnic populations.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the prevalence of genetic mutations in cancer patients from various ethnic
      populations seeking care at Mayo Clinic Arizona cancer clinics.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform a chart review to assess the impact of genetic testing as part of standard of
      oncology care:

      Ia. Determine prevalence of pathogenic germline mutation detected by multi-gene panel
      testing.

      Ib. Determine differences in germline mutation detection in these patients as compared to
      traditional guideline (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) based approach for
      genetic evaluation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood or saliva sample for genetic testing.
