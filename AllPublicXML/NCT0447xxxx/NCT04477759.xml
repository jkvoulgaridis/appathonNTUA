    <textblock>
      Locoregional failure remains the principal mode of mortality in head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy. Magnetic resonance-guided
      radiation therapy (MRgRT) allows for adaptive radiation dose escalation based on tumor
      response and may improve therapeutic outcomes while limiting toxicities.

      This protocol evaluates a novel framework for radiation delivery with concurrent atezolizumab
      in patients with advanced HNSCC. Dose-Escalated Hypofractionated Adaptive Radiotherapy
      (DEHART) modifies radiation dose using MRgRT by escalating radiation dose to residual tumor
      while deescalating radiation dose to areas of tumor regression.

    <textblock>
      Locoregional failure remains the principal mode of mortality in head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy. Radiation dose escalation
      with hypofractionation has shown unparalleled local control in other malignancies, such as
      non-small cell lung cancer, but has been limited in HNSCC due to toxicity concerns. Magnetic
      resonance-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) allows for adaptive radiation dose escalation
      based on tumor response and may improve therapeutic outcomes while limiting toxicities.

      This protocol evaluates a novel framework for radiation delivery using MRgRT with concurrent
      atezolizumab in patients with advanced HNSCC. Unlike conventional radiotherapy,
      Dose-Escalated Hypofractionated Adaptive Radiotherapy (DEHART) modifies radiation dose using
      MRgRT by adapting the radiation plan during the course of treatment, escalating radiation
      dose to residual tumor while deescalating radiation dose to areas of tumor regression. The
      hypothesis is that DEHART will safely deliver ablative radiation doses in 15 fractions over 3
      weeks while limiting both toxicity and the effect of tumor repopulation by resistant
      clonogens, thus resulting in an improved therapeutic ratio.

      This Phase I clinical trial will encompass the following specific aims: (1) determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the DEHART regimen delivered using MRgRT with concurrent
      atezolizumab in a population of patients who are not candidates or unsuitable for definitive
      chemoradiation therapy; (2) evaluate the toxicity and functional outcomes of the DEHART
      regimen; and (3) assess the efficacy of DEHART and obtain volumetric and functional imaging
      correlates of efficacy using MRgRT to serve as hypothesis-generating data for future trials
      of radiation dose adaptation. A modified Time-to Event Continual Reassessment (TITE-CRM)
      Phase I Design with three radiation dose levels delivered to regressing disease will be used
      to determine the MTD: 50 Gy in 15 fractions, 55 Gy in 15 fractions and 60 Gy in 15 fractions.

      If DEHART is found to be safe and shows a signal of efficacy in this study, a future Phase II
      trial will be conducted to compare this novel treatment strategy to standard-of care
      conventionally fractionated chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced HNSCC.

          -  Respiratory illness requiring hospitalization at the time of Step 1 registration

          -  Note: If the respiratory illness is resolved and the patient meets the eligibility
             status above, then the patient can be considered for the trial.

             or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.]). The following are exceptions to this
             criterion: Patients with vitiligo or alopecia; Patients with hypothyroidism (e.g.,
             following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement; Any chronic skin
             condition that does not require systemic therapy; Patients without active disease in

             Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
             definition; Note: HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need
             to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatment
             involved in this protocol may be immunosuppressive. Patients with known HIV, cluster
             of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts ≥ 200/μL, and undetectable viral loads who are
             stable on an antiretroviral regimen may be included.

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before
             registration, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or

             prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to registration

          -  Medical or psychiatric illness which would compromise the patient's ability to

          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during treatment and
             for 6 months after the last dose of atezolizumab, this exclusion is necessary because
             the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic. Women who are
             breastfeeding are also excluded.

          -  Prior allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to atezolizumab or any of study drug
             excipients.

          -  History of allogenic organ transplantation

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Uncontrolled serious chronic gastrointestinal condition associated with diarrhea

          -  Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis (TB) testing
             in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B viral (HBV)
             surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C. Patients with a past or resolved HBV
             infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and absence
             of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible
             only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.
