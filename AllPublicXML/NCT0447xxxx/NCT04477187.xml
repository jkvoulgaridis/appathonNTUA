  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bipolar fractional
      radiofrequency treatment via use of the Profound System to achieve skin tightening and
      contour change in lax submental (beneath the chin) tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, unblinded, non-randomized, non-controlled study designed to follow a
      total of up to 15 qualified and consenting subjects to receive one bipolar fractional
      radiofrequency microneedling treatment under an IRB approved protocol. Up to 15 subjects will
      be enrolled and treated at UT Southwestern in the Department of Plastic Surgery. Subjects
      will be identified from the clinical practice of Dr. Jeffrey Kenkel, Department of Plastic
      Surgery.
