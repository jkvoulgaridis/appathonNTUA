  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study in healthy participants is to learn more about the safety of
      LY3473329 and any side effects that might be associated with it. Blood tests will be
      performed to check how much LY3473329 gets into the bloodstream and how long the body takes
      to eliminate it. This is a two-part study. Participants may only enroll in one part.

      For each participant:

        -  Part A will last up to about 19 weeks and may include 9 visits.

        -  Part B will last up to about 28 weeks and may include 11 visits.
