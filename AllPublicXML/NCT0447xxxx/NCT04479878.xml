      This observational study will evaluate the frequency of complications in adult cancer
      patients with central venous parenteral nutrition and the identification of aggravating
      factors.

      In oncology, central venous catheters are used for treatments such as chemotherapy,
      hydration, antibiotic therapy and parenteral nutrition. However, these catheters are
      responsible for serious complications often infectious or vascular. They can lead to
      suspension or discontinuation of treatments and can lead to life-threatening outcomes for
      patients. The incidence rate and risk factors for central venous catheter-related infections
      in oncology remain poorly known. Recently, a prospective study targeted a 5-fold increase in
      the risk of catheter infection when parenteral nutrition was associated with chemotherapy.

      This is why the indications of parenteral nutrition must be respected and enteral nutrition
      promoted where possible.

      the investigator conducted a retrospective study in 1998 over 10 years and 6 months,
      including all patients who received or received a parenteral nutrition at home, for at least
      one month.

      Of 153 patients with implantable sites, 181 infectious episodes were recorded in 68 patients
      (44.4% of the population) with an estimated median infection rate of 2 infections/patients
      (1-12). There was a clear predominance of community-borne skin germs (85% Staphylococcus sp
      and 3% multi-resistant bacteria (BMR)).

      In order to improve our nursing practices, and reduce complications for patients,the
      investigator propose the establishment of an observatory of complications in adults with
      cancer benefiting from superior parenteral nutrition on the central venous tract initiated in
      hospitalization with a planned return home
