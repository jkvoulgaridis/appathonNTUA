  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As population in Hong Kong is aging, incidence of geriatrics hip fractures rises. Operative
      treatment for selective patients offers pain control, early mobilization and reduction in
      medical morbidities and mortalities. Research has shown that the pain from hip fracture left
      untreated may have significant physical and psychological effects on the patient,
      precipitating delirium, especially in elderly patients with hip fractures, and may delay
      operative management and may complicate hospital stay. Studies report that the pain
      management for limb fractures in the elderly is hugely sub-optimal with some suggesting that
      only 2% receive adequate analgesia. Adequate analgesia before definitive treatment of hip
      fracture may improve mobilization and cognitive performance. As a part of multi-modal pain
      management, Fascia iliaca compartment block is being increasingly popular as a simple, safe
      and effective regional technique for patients with hip fractures and proximal femoral shaft
      fractures, providing consistent analgesic effect for hip fracture patients, irrespective of
      the performing doctor's experience. This study aims to provide high level local evidence of
      the effect and efficacy of the fascia iliaca compartment block in preoperative pain control
      for patients with hip fracture admitted to Orthopaedic and Traumatology ward in United
      Christian Hospital.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control, single blinded trial. It tests the hypothesis that fascia
      iliaca compartment block using local anaesthetic agent for pre-operative analgesia in
      patients with hip fracture, compared to that using normal saline as control, leads to a
      better pain control and fewer doses of systemic analgesics required. All patients admitted to
      United Christian Hospital Orthopaedic and Traumatology ward for hip fracture with
      radiological diagnosis will be seen by on-call resident. Principal investigator and other
      investigators will be notified of the admission within 1 working day. Subjects will be
      recruited according to inclusion and exclusion criteria as mentioned in the below section.
      Subjects will be recruited only if an informed consent for this study has been signed. Only
      patients with hip fracture pending emergency operation will be recruited. 2 enclosed
      envelopes will be prepared, in which one indicates &quot;intervention&quot;, and one indicates
      &quot;control&quot;. Subjects will randomly choose any of the envelopes without knowing the
      intervention/control group assignment. To maintain true randomization, the 2 envelopes will
      be kept in good condition, preventing identification of the underlying assignment from the
      outer appearance. Investigators, knowing the group assignment, will then prepare an injection
      kit set for Fascia iliaca compartment block which includes vials of levobupivacaine, normal
      saline, syringes, 22G/21G needle, simple dressing set and skin antiseptic solution. For the
      intervention group, fascia iliaca compartment block with 30ml/40ml 0.25% levobupivacaine,
      depending on body weight (30ml for body weight less than 50kg, 40ml for body weight more than
      50kg), will be performed by investigators under landmark approach. For the control group,
      same volume of normal saline, instead of levobupivacaine, will injected using the same
      technique, so that single blinding can be achieved. Subjects' vital signs will be observed
      for every 10 minutes for 30 minutes after injection.

    <description>It involves injecting local anaesthetic agent (levobupivacaine) into the fascia iliaca compartment of the patient, infiltrating three major nerves that supply the medial, anterior and lateral thigh, namely the femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. This procedure can be done with anatomical landmark approach or under image guidance.</description>
