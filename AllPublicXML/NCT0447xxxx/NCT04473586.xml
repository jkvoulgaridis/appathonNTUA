  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate concordance (percent agreement) between results
      produced by the Spartan CYP2C19 system and bi-directional sequencing. In addition, this study
      will evaluate the concordance of buccal samples stored prior to running on the Spartan Cube
      CYP2C19 system and bi-directional sequencing.

      Sample holding time - two parts

        1. Sample tested in less than one-hour

           a.In the first part, buccal samples will be collected from subjects and tested using the
           Spartan Cube CYP2C19 system. These samples will be run immediately (within 1 h) after
           collection from the subject (&lt;1 h sample holding time). All results will be compared to
           bi-directional sequencing to determine percent agreement.

        2. Sample tested greater than 21 hours a.In the second part (sample holding portion),
           samples will be tested using the Spartan Cube CYP2C19 product. These samples will be run
           after storage at ambient temperature. All results will be compared to bi-directional
           sequencing to determine the percent agreement.
