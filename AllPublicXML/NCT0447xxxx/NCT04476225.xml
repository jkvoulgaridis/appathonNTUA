  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the contribution of genetic factors to the pathogenesis
      of diseases, including diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Hirschsprung's disease, and
      autism. Patient-derived cellular models of diseases will be developed, which will require the
      collection of blood samples from patients and healthy individuals in order to generate
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of iPSC-derived human cell
      cultures. These human cellular models will be phenotyped using a variety of methods,
      including cellular, molecular, and biochemical assays. Because these human cellular models
      will retain the genetic background from the patients and control subjects, this will allow us
      to determine the contribution of genetics to disease phenotypes. Such disease-specific
      pluripotent stem cell lines will be invaluable tools for many basic and translational
      research applications, including pathophysiological studies in a developmental context, and
      innovation and screening of small molecule drugs capable of reversing the disease phenotype
      and potentially leading to a cure for a broad range of diseases, where appropriate in vitro
      or in vivo disease models do not exist.
