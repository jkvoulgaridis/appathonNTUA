  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) utilizing weak electrical fields (&lt;5 milliamps of
      current - as proposed in the present pilot study) is an extremely safe therapeutic technique
      in use for over 40 years. During that time, TES has never been associated with a serious
      adverse event in a research setting nor a serious reported adverse event in a clinical
      setting. The main side effect associated with TES is irritation of the skin beneath the
      electrodes (as is commonly found from similar preparations used for polysomnography). The
      purpose of this pilot study is to identify the type of electrode preparation that maximizes
      subject comfort during transdermal/transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) using the
      NeuroConn DC Plus Stimulator.

      In this study, volunteers will be divided into groups based on the nature of the stimulation
      waveform utilized (DC 0.75 Hz, modified AC 0.75 Hz, AC sinusoidal 3.0 Hz or pulsed
      stimulation of up to 500 ms duration). These waveforms were chosen based on the physiology of
      slow-wave sleep (SWS). Ultimately, the goal is to use TES during sleep to enhance the
      slow-wave activity (SWA) of sleep. Slow-wave sleep is characterized by two main frequency
      bands with differing underlying physiologies: (1) slow oscillation activity with a peak of
      0.75 Hz, and (2) delta activity with a peak of approximately 3.0 Hz. Therefore, in future
      studies, the plan is to stimulate at one or both of these frequencies. The endogenous slow
      activity of the brain consists of electrical fields of &quot;alternating current&quot; with periods of
      relative cellular depolarization and periods of relative cellular hyperpolarization. The goal
      is to enhance this endogenous behavior with transcranial electrical stimulation at the two
      major slow- wave frequencies (0.75 Hz, 3.0 Hz), or using a pulsed stimulation paradigm to
      induce slow wave activity.

    <description>NeuroConn® DC Plus stimulator: the NeuroConn® stimulator can be programmed with specific frequencies of stimulation ranging from 0.5 to 500 Hz. This device is therefore appropriate for the present study to stimulate only at 0.75 or 3.0 Hz. Also, the NeuroConn only allows low current intensities to be chosen. The maximum current intensity that can be delivered with this stimulator is 5 milliamps.</description>
