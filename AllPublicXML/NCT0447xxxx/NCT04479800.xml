  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-dose, open-label, randomized, three-period, three-way crossover
      study in which healthy adult participants will receive three separate single-dose
      administrations of ASTX660 capsules under three different conditions.

      Participants receiving Treatment A (fasting) will be dosed after having fasted overnight for
      at least 10 hours. Participants receiving Treatment B (fed; high-fat/high-calorie meal) will
      fast overnight for at least 10 hours then consume a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      standard high-fat, high-calorie breakfast beginning 30 minutes before dosing. Participants
      receiving Treatment C (fed; low-fat/low-calorie meal) will fast overnight for at least 10
      hours then consume an FDA standard low-fat, low-calorie breakfast beginning 30 minutes before
      dosing. The duration of the study is expected to be approximately 47 days.

             before the first dose of study medication] or postmenopausal for at least 1 year
             before the first dose of study medication).

          6. Is willing and able to remain in the study unit for the entire duration of the

             in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the participant or
             the validity of the study results.

          2. A clinically significant abnormal finding on the physical exam, medical history,
             electrocardiogram (ECG), or clinical laboratory results at screening.

          3. Has laboratory values that are not within normal limits for amylase and lipase,
             phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine
             transaminase (ALT), bilirubin, white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil

             any other clinically significant abnormal chemistry values in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

             or QT interval corrected by the method of Fridericia (QTcF) &gt; 450 ms at screening
             visit.

          5. History or presence of allergic or adverse response to ASTX660 or related drugs or
             ASTX660 excipients.

          6. Has been on a significantly abnormal diet (i.e., low-calorie, vegan, or intermittent
             fasting) during the 4 weeks preceding the first dose of study medication.

          7. Has participated in another clinical trial (randomized participants only) within 30
             days before the first dose of study medication.

          8. Use of any over-the-counter (OTC) medication (including nutritional or dietary
             supplements, herbal preparations, or vitamins) within 7 days before the first dose of
             study medication until the end of study visit without evaluation and approval by the
             Investigator.

          9. Use of any prescription medication, except hormonal replacement therapy, from 14 days
             before the first dose of study medication until the end-of-study visit without
             evaluation and approval by the Investigator.

         10. Has been treated with any known drugs that are moderate or strong inhibitors/inducers
             of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (e.g., barbiturates, phenothiazines, cimetidine,

             within 30 days before the first dose of study medication.

         11. Blood or plasma donation within 30 days before the first dose of study medication
             until the end-of-study visit. It is recommended that blood/plasma donations not be
             made for at least 30 days after the end-of-study visit.

         12. Smoking or use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 60 days before the
             first dose of study medication until the end-of-study visit.

         13. Engagement in strenuous exercise from 48 hours before the first dose of study
             medication until the end-of-study visit.

         14. Consumption of beverages or foods that contain alcohol, grapefruit, poppy seeds,
             broccoli, Brussels sprouts, pomegranate, star fruit, char-grilled meat, or
             caffeine/xanthine from 48 hours before the first dose of study medication until the
             end-of-study visit. Participants will be instructed not to consume any of the above
             products; however, allowance for an isolated single incidental consumption may be
             evaluated and approved by the study Investigator based on the potential for
             interaction with the study drug.

         15. Has any prior history of substance abuse or treatment (including alcohol).

         16. Is a female with a positive pregnancy test result.

         17. Has a positive urine screen for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates) or cotinine.

         18. Has a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening or has been previously treated for hepatitis
             B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection.
