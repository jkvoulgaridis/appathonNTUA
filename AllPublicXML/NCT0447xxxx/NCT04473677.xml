    <textblock>
      Early detecting and removing of colorectal advanced adenomas can reduce incidence of
      colorectal cancer. Because of the less bleeding of advanced adenomas, the sensitivity of
      existing quantitative fecal immunochemical test (qFIT) is unsatisfying. A new technology
      qFIT, which have a higher sensitivity in extremely low concentration of hemoglobin compared
      with existing commercially available qFIT, is developed and this study will prove the high
      diagnostic accuracy in detecting colorectal advanced adenoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 10% of all annually diagnosed cancers and
      cancer-related deaths worldwide. With progress of developing countries, it is predicted that
      the incidence of colorectal cancer worldwide will increase to 2.5 million new cases in 2035.
      The majority of colorectal cancer is thought to arise from precancerous lesions through the
      adenoma-carcinoma pathway. Detecting and removing of colorectal advanced adenomas can reduce
      incidence of colorectal cancer. Although colonoscopy is currently considered the most
      effective method for detecting advanced adenomas, individuals may be reluctant to undergo
      colonoscopy due to the uncomfortable feeling and the relatively high cost of colonoscopy.
      Conversely, stool tests are relatively cheap and more readily accepted. Annual fecal
      immunochemical test (FIT), one of the preferred methods of colorectal cancer screening, is
      economic and easy to use. However, the existing commercially available qFIT is insufficiently
      sensitive to the minor hemorrhage of advanced adenomas, and the sensitivity is about only 27%
      to 47%. To improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting colorectal advanced adenoma, an improved
      technology of qFIT, which have a higher sensitivity in extremely low concentration of
      hemoglobin in stool compared with existing commercially available qFIT, is developed. The
      investigators design this research to prove the diagnostic accuracy of the new qFIT in
      detecting colorectal advanced adenoma and compare the new qFIT with other 3 kind of FITs.
