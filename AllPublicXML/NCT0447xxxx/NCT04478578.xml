  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will collect information to understand the causes and outcomes of febrile illness
      in rural areas in South and Southeast Asia. The study will take place in four sites across
      three countries including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Laos PDR. The findings will be used to
      identify new tests and treatments that can improve the management of febrile patients in the
      future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to better understand and quantify the burden of febrile illness, the
      aetiological causes and the manner in which it affects the people living in rural areas in
      South and Southeast Asia, all on a scale which has not been attempted before. The SEACTN RFI
      project will collect information to help better understand and predict these outcomes based
      on a multitude of factors, which will form the basis for interventions within the network in
      the future. Determining the incidence, causes and outcomes of febrile illness in these
      settings will be done through two work packages. The first of these, Work Package A (WP-A),
      the subject of this study, will be carried out at the community level, primarily by engaging
      village health worker (VHWs) and low-level Health Centres (HCs) which serve the communities
      to recruit patients presenting with a febrile illness. These patients will be assessed for
      presenting symptoms and followed up for clinical outcomes. Collection of specimen for
      diagnostic investigations in these settings is challenging. Currently, mRDTs are conducted by
      VHWs and HCs in these networks, therefore by using the same process, but also applying blood
      to filter paper and allowing it to dry (DBS), investigators will test for certain other
      pathogens, which will increase the aetiological yield.
