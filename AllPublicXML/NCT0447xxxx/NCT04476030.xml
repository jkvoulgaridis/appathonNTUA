  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) Total Score at Day 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D total score will be the sum of the 17 individual item scores. Items with score range of 0 to 2 include insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. Items with score range of 2 to 4 include agitation, depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor activity), anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score ranges from 0 to 52, where higher score indicates more depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S uses a 7-point Likert scale to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment. Severity of mental illness is assessed using ratings as 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = extremely ill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in 17-item HAM-D Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 3, 8 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D total score will be the sum of the 17 individual item scores. Items with score range of 0 to 2 include insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. Items with score range of 2 to 4 include agitation, depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor activity), anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score ranges from 0 to 52, where higher score indicates more depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with HAM-D Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 15 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D response is defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM-D total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with HAM-D Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 15 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D remission is defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I response will be defined as having a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). CGI-I employs a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement (whether or not due entirely to drug treatment) in participant's condition posttreatment. Response choices include: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is a 10-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. Each item has a score range of 0 to 6. MADRS total score (ranging from 0 to 60) will be sum of the 10 individual item scores. The higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>14-item HAM-A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety. HAM-A total score will be the sum of the 14 individual item scores. Each of the 14 items measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scores of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe) are assigned, with a total score range of 0 to 56, where &lt;17 = mild severity, 18 to 24 = mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30 = moderate to severe severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First HAM-D Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D response is defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM-D total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Depressive Symptoms Assessed by 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is a participant-rated depressive symptom severity scale consisting of 9 individual items. Scoring is based on responses to specific questions, as follows: 0 = not at all; 1 = several days; 2 = more than half the days; and 3 = nearly every day. PHQ-9 total score will be the sum of the 9 individual item scores, where, 1 to 4 = minimal depression, 5 to 9 = mild depression, 10 to 14 = moderate depression, 15 to 19 = moderately severe depression; and 20 to 27 = severe depression.</description>
