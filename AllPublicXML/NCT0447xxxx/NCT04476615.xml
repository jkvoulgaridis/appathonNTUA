  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test a Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) for its efficacy on improving
      muscular resistance and endurance. The investigators will perform a randomized clinical trial
      to test the efficacy of the FMD on improving muscular strength, muscular resistance and
      endurance in physically active young adults (18-40 years of age). The study will include two
      arms: Placebo (Placebo diet) and FMD (3 cycles of 5-day fasting-mimicking diet within two
      months). Study endpoints will include muscular strength evaluation of lower limbs,
      cardio-pulmonary responses, neuromuscular function and muscle architecture. Subjects will be
      evaluated 4 times within 3 months: at baseline (T1), after the 1st cycle of diet (T2), 7 to
      15 days after the 3rd cycle of diet maintaining baseline intensity (T3) and with
      re-assessment of Peak Power Output (T4).
