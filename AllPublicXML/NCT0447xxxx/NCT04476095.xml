  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a highly prevalent condition worldwide and the leading cause of years
      lived with disability. In most cases, the specific pathological cause remains unidentified;
      therefore, the term non-specific low back pain is commonly used for such cases. Many
      non-pharmacological therapies are available for the treatment of low back pain aiming to
      reduce pain and disability. Among these options, photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) it seems
      to be an interesting alternative. PBMT is a non-thermal and non-invasive clinical treatment,
      which has shown effects in decreased pain, modulation of inflammatory process, and tissue
      repair in musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, the aim of this project is to evaluate the
      effects of the PBMT against placebo on pain intensity in patients with chronic non-specific
      low back pain.

      To achieve the proposed objective, it will be performed a randomized, triple-blind (patients,
      therapists, and outcome assessors), placebo-controlled trial.

      Seventy-two patients with chronic non-specific low back pain will be randomly allocated to
      two treatment groups: 1. Active PBMT or Placebo PBMT.

      In both groups, six treatment sessions will be performed twice a week (at the same time of
      the day), with intervals of three or four days between sessions, during three-week period.
      The patients will be treated by a blinded therapist.

      The outcomes will be obtained at stabilization phase (during 2 weeks), baseline, end of
      treatment, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the last treatment session, and 7 days after conclusion
      of treatment. The data will be collected by a blinded assessor.

      Statistical analyzis:

        -  The Fischer's Exact Test will be conducted to compare the proportion of successes
           between groups.

        -  The Unpaired t-test will be used for demographic data.

        -  Repeated measures ANOVA will be performed to analyze pain intensity. The level of
           statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.

    <masking_description>A researcher will program the device (placebo PBMT or active PMBT) and will be instructed not to inform the patients or other researchers as to the type of treatment (PMBT or placebo). Therefore, the researcher responsible for the treatment, the investigator and the outcome assessor will be blinded to the type of treatment being administered to the patients. The sounds and signals emitted from the device as well as the information displayed on the screen will be identical, regardless of the type of treatment (placebo or PBMT).</masking_description>
