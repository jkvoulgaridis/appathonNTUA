    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational study for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of
      neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2 disease), also known as TPP1 deficiency, who
      intend to be or are currently being treated with cerliponase alfa. Patients receiving or
      expected to receive cerliponase alfa within 60 days of signing the informed consent form
      (ICF) may be eligible to enroll in the study, assuming all regulatory requirements for sites
      that have agreed to participate and protocol inclusion criteria are met. Data may be
      collected for all or some of the assessments as outlined in the protocol, dependent upon the
      clinic's and/or individual patient's standard of care.
