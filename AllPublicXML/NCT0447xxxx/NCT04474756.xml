  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mandibular Advancement Devices (MADs) are now a reliable alternative to continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) treatments for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) . Despite good tolerance
      and efficacy, there are still barriers limiting the widespread use of MAD and its acceptance
      in OSA routine clinical practice. Various MAD designs currently exist and constantly emerge
      on the market without clear evidence regarding the best technical choice and the
      cost-effectiveness compromise. Although these MAD has been tested in term of efficacy, no
      study has tested the difference between MADs in term of efficacy, tolerance and patient
      satisfaction. The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of two MADs -
      custom-made titratable MAD (NarvalTM) and customizable titratable MAD (TALITM), over a
      3-month period, in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of partial or complete
      pharyngeal obstruction during sleep. OSA is one of the most frequent chronic diseases with
      both social and multi-organ consequences making it an economic burden for society. OSA
      durably impairs the quality of life of patients and their entourage and is associated with
      co-morbidities including hypertension, arrhythmias, stroke, coronary heart disease and
      metabolic dysfunction.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the first line therapy for OSA, requires high
      adherence to be effective in terms of symptom improvement and reduction of the burden of
      co-morbidities. For one third of patients, such adherence is difficult to achieve in the long
      term and mandibular advancement devices (MAD) have emerged as the leading alternative to
      CPAP. So, MADs are now a reliable alternative to CPAP treatments, which position these in
      numerous patients as a first therapy. Moreover, mild to moderate symptomatic patients who
      refuse to be diagnosed are now referring to sleep centers in order to be treated. MAD and
      CPAP are similarly effective on symptoms, quality of life and in attaining reductions in
      blood pressure and cardiovascular morbidity. Although CPAP has a greater effect on Apnea +
      hypopnea index (AHI) reduction, adherence is better with MAD explaining the comparable mean
      disease alleviation achieved by the two treatment modalities.

      Despite good tolerance and efficacy, there are still barriers limiting the widespread use of
      MAD and its acceptance in OSA routine clinical practice. Various different MAD designs
      currently exist and constantly emerge on the market without clear evidence regarding the best
      technical choice and the cost-effectiveness compromise. Titratable two-piece custom-made MADs
      are the gold standard in clinical guidelines and several brands are now on the market.
      Although these MAD has been tested in term of efficacy, no study has tested the difference
      between MADs in term of efficacy, tolerance and patient satisfaction. Such a paradigm merits
      being tested in a randomized controlled trial. The SONAR study is a multicenter,
      parallel-group randomized controlled trial to determine if the titratable MAD NARVAL TM is
      superior to the titratable MAD TALITM in OSA patients eligible for MAD. The primary outcome
      will be the treatment response at 3 months assessed by the difference of delta AHI at
      baseline and follow-up measured by polysomnography and secondary outcomes focus at global
      efficacy, tolerance and patient satisfaction.

      To our knowledge it will be the first study comparing two titrable MADs.

    <description>The tested device Narval™ will be a custom-made adjustable bi-block mandibular advancement device, that is made with semi-rigid plastic materials (bio-compatible polymer) and customized using a high-precision computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) ) (ResMed, Narval CC™). The Mandibular Advancement Devices will be gradually adjusted to provide mandibular advancement over a 15-mm range. Each Mandibular Advancement Device will be ﬁtted by a dental specialist with an initial advancement of about 60 % of maximal jaw protrusion. During titration, mandibular advancement will be adjusted at the discretion of the dental specialist.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Mandibular Advancement Devices TALI ™</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control device TALI ™ is a mandibular advancement orthesis, customized and manufactured by the &quot;laboratoire TALI&quot;, of the bi-bloc type consisting of rigid gutters thermo-formed on the plaster dental arches and articulated by two links of variable size allowing to adjust the advance in steps of 1 millimeter. This orthesis is manufactured on molding from bio-compatible plastic materials. The different sizes of rods proposed allow mandibular advances of 4 mm to 16 mm. Two clinical studies evaluated the effectiveness of the AMC / AMO orthosis (initial version of the TALI orthesis, with non-curved links) in patients with OSA. They have already demonstrated the effectiveness of the TALI orthesis by decreasing AHI and drowsiness; most patients preferred to use the orthesis (76.4% vs. 9.1%)11.</description>
