  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will follow participants who are screened and confirmed with a genetic diagnosis
      of LGMD2E, LGMD2D, or LGMD2C. These enrolled participants will be followed to evaluate
      mobility and pulmonary function for a time period between 24 weeks to 3 years after
      enrollment. Additional participant data will be collected from the time the individual began
      experiencing LGMD symptoms to the present.
