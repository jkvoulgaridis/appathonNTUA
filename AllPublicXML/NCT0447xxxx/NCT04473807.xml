      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the IV loading
      strategy in patients who are selected to receive sotalol.

      This is an open-label single arm study investigating the safety and feasibility of an
      intravenous loading regimen of sotalol to initiate patients on oral sotalol therapy. Informed
      Consent will be obtained from all patients prior to enrollment in the study. Patients will be
      admitted to the hospital in accordance with standard hospital protocol for oral sotalol
      loading.

    <description>The hypothesis to be tested is that the intravenous loading regimen followed by q12h oral sotalol administration will result in sotalol concentration and QTc peaks on day 1 (IV to oral loading) which are comparable to the steady-state and maximum QTc seen on Day 3 (steady-state).</description>

    <description>The hypothesis to be tested is that the intravenous loading regimen followed by oral sotalol administration 4 hours after the conclusion of the IV infusion (every 12 hours thereafter) will result in sotalol peak concentrations at the end of IV loading dose (IV to oral loading) which are comparable to the steady state and maximum QTc seen on Day 3 after the last in-hospital oral dose.</description>
