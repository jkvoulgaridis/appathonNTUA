  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and loss of muscle mass frequently occur in patients undergoing chemotherapy and
      can negatively effect therapy outcome. Especially patients with cancer of the
      gastrointestinal tract are often affected by malnutrition. Therefore, this study aims to
      examine changes in nutritional status of patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract
      during chemotherapy. Findings of this study will help to improve nutritional treatment of
      patients undergoing chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and sarcopenia are common complications in patients with malignant diseases of
      the gastrointestinal tract. During chemotherapy there is a high risk of further impairment of
      nutritional status due to anorexia, nausea, emesis and other gastrointestinal conditions that
      adversely impact food assimilation or absorption. Findings on changes of nutritional status
      during chemotherapy are scarce but of paramount importance for adequate nutrition therapy.
      Therefore, this study aims to provide a detailed description of changes in nutritional status
      of patients with a malignant condition of the gastrointestinal tract during chemotherapy.

        Patients will be recruited at University Medicine Greifswald (Northeast Germany). Patients
        with initial diagnosis of a malignant condition of the gastrointestinal tract planned to
        receive cytostatic treatment will be identified in the gastrointestinal ward of the
        hosptial. Recruitment of patients receiving cytostatic treatment of a known malignant
        condition of the gastrointestinal tract will take place in the hospital's cancer day unit.
