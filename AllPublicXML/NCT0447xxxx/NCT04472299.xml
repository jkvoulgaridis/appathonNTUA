  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose if this pilot study is to determine if a perioperative infusion of 0.2%
      ropivacaine via bilateral T3 paravertebral catheters can decrease the incidence of new onset
      atrial fibrillation following primary CABG and/or valve surgery and compare a number of
      secondary outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the intervention group will have ultrasound guided bilateral T3 paravertebral
      catheters placed prior to surgery. Prior to surgery, these patients will have 5ml of 1.5%
      lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine injected in each catheter. Ropivacaine 0.2% will be
      administered via programmed intermittent bolus of 7ml every 60 minutes through each catheter
      during and after surgery. Patients in the control group will receive no block and undergo
      surgery with routine anesthetic care guided by their cardiac anesthesiologist.

    <description>The primary outcome for this trial is the incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) in the first 5 days following cardiac surgery, defined as atrial fibrillation and/or flutter as recorded on a 12-lead ECG or rhythm strip for greater than 30 seconds in patients with no prior history of atrial fibrillation and/or flutter. Outcome is reported as the percent of participants with NOAF in each arm.</description>
