  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to discover whether acquiring basic-literacy in adulthood can improve
      episodic memory and brain structural and functional connectivity. In a collaborative project
      between Brazil and USA, we will use a randomized controlled trial approach to leverage the
      level of evidence of the benefits of basic adult-education as a possible cognitive reserve
      builder. If successful, the study's findings will be important in shaping policies targeting
      increasing access to late-life education to reduce dementia risk.

    <description>The basic-literacy training will be given for two hours/day for four days/week for 6 months. At baseline, participants will be randomized into four classes of 30. An expert in adult education will oversee the classes and meet the teachers periodically, and each class will count with a certified and experienced lead teacher and teacher aid. The intervention group will receive literacy training based on analytical and phonemic methods for enabling reading and writing</description>

    <arm_group_label>Non-literacy training</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The comparator group will have access to non-literacy classes offered at the adult school, including geography, history, informatics, and sciences, but no literacy-training, for two hours/day for four days/week for 6 months. After 6 months, the groups switch, so the comparator receives the specific reading and writing training, and the intervention group receives the lessons on other themes.</description>
