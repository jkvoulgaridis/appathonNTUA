  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The opioid epidemic has had a tremendous negative impact on the health of persons in the U.S.
      The objective of the trial 1 of Application of Economics &amp; Social psychology to improve
      Opioid Prescribing Safety (AESOPS-T1), is to discourage unnecessary opioid prescribing
      through the application of &quot;behavioral insights&quot;—empirically-tested social and psychological
      interventions that affect choice.

    <textblock>
      A multisite study, AESOPS-T1 randomizes clinics to behavioral intervention or control.
      Clinics randomized to the behavioral intervention arm receive electronic health record
      (EHR)-based nudges. Eligible participants are clinicians who practice ambulatory primary care
      at the participating clinical sites in Illinois and California. At the time of opioid
      prescribing, clinicians in clinics randomized to the intervention group will be prompted with
      an EHR nudge when the prescribing history for the patient falls into one of the following
      three mutually exclusive categories: Opioid naïve, opioid refill, or chronic high-dose
      opioids. These EHR-based nudges include accountable justification, defaults and
      precommitments. The control arm receives no EHR-based intervention. Both arms receive
      guideline education. The primary outcome is the change in clinician aggregate daily milligram
      morphine equivalent (MME) dose and the secondary outcome is the proportion of dosages that
      equal or exceed 50 MME per day. These outcomes will be estimated by treatment arm with an
      intent-to-treat difference-in-differences framework using a mixed-effects regression model on
      clinician MME daily dose. The intervention period will be 18-months, with a 6-month follow-up
      period to measure the persistence of effects after the interventions conclude.

    <description>Clinicians in clinics randomized to the intervention group will be prompted with an EHR nudge when the prescribing history for the patient falls into one of the following three categories: Opioid naïve, opioid refill, or chronic high-dose opioids. These EHR-based nudges include elements of accountable justification, defaults and precommitments. Clinicians will also receive web-based guideline education, consisting of an online educational module at the start of the study period. This will include educational clinical content related to the CDC guidelines, the Oregon Pain Guidance document, tapering training and other resources such as Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Medication-Assisted Treatment Physician Locator and the Naloxone Provider Guide.</description>

    <description>The criteria for an opioid refill include: (1) an order for an included opioid, (2) an order for an included opioid within the 90 days prior to this order, and (3) no opioid prescriptions written greater than 90 days prior to this order.</description>

    <description>The criteria for chronic high-dose opioids are: (1) an order for an included opioid with a dose greater than 49 MME, (2) two or more opioid prescriptions with two different start dates within the 90 days prior to this order, and (3) an opioid prescription written more than 90 days prior to this order.
Patients who begin a taper will also complete the PainTracker (PT), a pain assessment tool aimed at broadening the understanding of pain and reframing the patient's visit around reaching functional goals. The PainTracker assessment is sent to a patient 3 days following the initial opioid taper and every 30 days thereafter. Clinicians use the information reported in the PT to monitor the patient's symptoms and initiate conversations with patients about broader life problems that impact and are impacted by pain.</description>
