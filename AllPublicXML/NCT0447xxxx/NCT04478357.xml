  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fesoterodine (Toviaz™) extended-release (ER) tablets are currently manufactured by Aesica
      Pharmaceuticals, Zwickau, Germany (Zwickau). An additional manufacturing location at Pfizer
      Freiburg, Germany (Freiburg) has been identified. This pivotal bioequivalence (BE) study is
      being conducted to satisfy the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      regulatory requirements for the qualification of the Freiburg manufacturing site.

      Overall Study Design This is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 4-period, 4-treatment,
      2-sequence, two 2-way crossover study in healthy participants. This study will assess the BE
      of Fesoterodine (Toviaz™) 4 mg and 8 mg ER tablets manufactured at Zwickau (Reference) versus
      Freiburg (Test). Study participants will include healthy male and/or female individuals
      between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Approximately 18 participants who fulfill
      entry criteria will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences as shown in the table
      below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female participants must be 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of
             signing the informed consent document (ICD).

          2. Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical
             evaluation including a detailed medical history, complete physical examination,
             cardiovascular tests including blood pressure (BP), pulse rate measurement and 12-lead
             ECG, and clinical laboratory tests.

          3. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

          5. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent
             document (ICD) and in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          3. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C
             infection; positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis
             C antibody (HCVAb). Hepatitis B vaccination is allowed.

          4. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          5. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate or tolterodine
             tartrate, soya, or any of the excipients in the investigational drug product.

          6. History of uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, gastric retention,
             severe ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon.

          7. Evidence or history of clinically significant urologic disease, urinary retention,
             obstructive disturbance of bladder emptying, micturition disturbance, nocturia or
             pollacisuria (eg, benign prostate hyperplasia, urethral stricture, recurrent urinary
             tract infections).
