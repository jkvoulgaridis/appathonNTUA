  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies whether a customized video intervention can help to reduce anxiety in
      brain cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment and their caregivers. A customized
      neuro-imaging referenced symptom video that describes symptoms and side effects specific to
      the patients' tumor may result in an early and sustained reduction in anxiety and distress
      during and after radiation treatment, thereby improving quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if provision of a neuro-imaging referenced symptom (NIRS) video intervention
      for patients starting radiotherapy for newly diagnosed primary brain tumors reduces patient
      anxiety during radiation compared to standard of care information.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if provision of a NIRS video intervention for patients starting radiotherapy
      for newly diagnosed primary brain tumors reduces caregiver anxiety during radiation compared
      to standard of care information.

      II. To determine if any changes in patient or caregiver anxiety early during radiation are
      sustained after the completion of radiation.

      III. To investigate whether changes in anxiety are associated with changes in quality of life
      and distress in patients.

      IV. To investigate whether patients perceive the NIRS intervention to have been helpful in
      understanding possible tumor and treatment symptoms.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their caregivers are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (NIRS VIDEO): Patients receive standard of care verbal and written education materials.
      Patients also receive a customized NIRS video which includes a description of each their
      tumor, functional areas of the brain affected, and possible symptoms from the tumor and
      radiation treatment based on the neuro-imaging features. Patients and their caregivers watch
      the video together or separately over 1.5-3 minutes before the end of the first week of
      radiation treatment. Within 2 weeks after watching the NIRS video, patients complete an
      optional survey over 5-10 minutes.

      ARM II (STANDARD OF CARE EDUCATION): Patients receive standard of care verbal and written
      education materials.

      After completion of radiation treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <measure>Changes in patient S-Anxiety subscale score of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 1 month post-radiation therapy (RT)</time_frame>
    <description>Using linear mixed models (LMMs) to evaluate the change in STAI between and within groups. The correlation structure over time will be selected using the Bayesian information criterion. Will calculate correlations between reduction in anxiety and improvement in quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale-Brain [FACT- Br]) and distress (Distress Thermometer). Analysis will focus on the between-group comparison of the changes of the patient S-Anxiety subscale score of the STAI from baseline to 2 weeks and from baseline to 6 weeks in to RT. All tests conducted will use a two-sided 0.05 significance level, without adjusting for multiple testing.</description>

    <description>Analysis will focus on the between-group comparison of the changes of the caregiver S-Anxiety subscale score of the STAI from baseline to 2 weeks and from baseline to 6 weeks in to RT.

    <time_frame>From baseline to 1 month post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis will be performed by testing for the effects of time, in particular, differences between the average of weeks 2 and 6 during RT and 1 month after RT. All tests conducted will use a two-sided .05 significance level, without adjusting for multiple testing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in patient Distress Thermometer score and FACT-Br score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 1 month post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluates the impact between distress and overall quality of life in patients. LMMs will be used to assess the correlations between change in anxiety and change in quality of life, etc., without including time as an independent variable, yet with within-subject correlations still accounted for. For each fixed time point, simple correlations will also be calculated. All tests conducted will use a two-sided .05 significance level, without adjusting for multiple testing.</description>

    <description>Evaluates whether neuro-imaging referenced symptom intervention was subjectively helpful in understanding their tumor and treatment symptoms and alleviating their anxiety. Relevant summary statistics will be computed. All tests conducted will use a two-sided .05 significance level, without adjusting for multiple testing.</description>
