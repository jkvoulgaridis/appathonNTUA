      This study is multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled phase 4 study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of certirobell® tablet compared with mycophenolate mofetil in primary
      living donor liver transplant recipients.

      On the first visit the patients scheduled to be operated liver transplant in 35 days will be
      conducted screening. Patients who meet the criteria of this clinical trial will be randomized
      to CertiroBell or mycophenolate mofetil on the second visit. Each group will take CertiroBell
      or mycophenolate mofetil and will conduct scheduled tests with 5 additional visits.
