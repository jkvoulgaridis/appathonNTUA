  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of opioid overdose deaths continues to rise, killing more persons in 2017 than
      HIV/AIDS at the height of that epidemic. Medication assisted treatment, including methadone
      and buprenorphine, is the standard of care for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD).
      However, chronic pain can reduce treatment efficacy during medication assisted treatment and
      is associated with illicit substance relapse, dropout, and subsequent overdose. Mechanisms by
      which chronic pain may influence the impulsive decision making (e.g., drug relapse) in
      persons with OUD have not been well characterized. A better understanding is needed of
      decision-making in this population. Two factors that can influence decisions to use drugs are
      impulsivity and acute opioid withdrawal. This proposal will test how chronic pain is
      associated with increases in impulsive decision making in OUD, whether impulsive decision
      making is greater when undergoing opioid withdrawal, and how catastrophizing may modify the
      association between withdrawal and impulsive decision making in patients with chronic pain
      and OUD. An ideal population for this developmental research project are methadone maintained
      patients, who show high treatment attendance rates and will therefore assure study efficiency
      and reliable completion.

      This is an outpatient Phase 1 clinical trial investigating the effect of naloxone
      precipitated withdrawal on delay discounting. Eligible participants will undergo two
      experimental sessions presented in random order. One session will involve the measurement of
      delay discounting 30 minutes after double-blind intramuscular (IM) administration of placebo
      (normal saline) and the other will have the exact same procedures performed after
      double-blind IM administration of naloxone (0.1 mg). Injections will occur 2 hours after
      methadone dosing (peak levels). Study sessions will last 2 hours and involve pain and opioid
      withdrawal measures assessed at baseline and 15 minute intervals after injections. The
      participant should be back to baseline and free of withdrawal by the end of the study
      session. Sessions will occur at least 48 hours apart.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Delay discounting of money rate (k)</measure>
    <time_frame>k will be calculated from the same series of discounting questions that will be asked once each session at approcimately 30 minutes after study IM medication administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Delay discounting is the relative preference for smaller sooner over larger later rewards, an aspect of impulsivity. Most individuals would prefer an immediate $100 over $100 delayed by 1 year. However, when faced with the choice between receiving $95 now versus $100 in 1 year, preferences for the delayed reward may increase. By assessing such choices across multiple delays, delay discounting quantifies the devaluation of rewards over time, which allows for an index of overall discounting rate (k).</description>

    <measure>Study Session Peak Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Peak Pain VAS will be the highest rating during each 2 hour study session.</time_frame>
    <description>Current pain level rated on 0-100 VAS. This is the validated pain scale typically used by clinicians in an outpatient or inpatient clinical visit to represent current level of pain. Higher ratings indicate worse pain severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Peak COWS rating will be the highest rating during each 2 hour study session.</time_frame>
    <description>The COWS is an 11-item validated clinician administered scale that quantifies level of opioid withdrawal. The range of scores is 0-48, with higher scores indicating greater withdrawal severity. The peak COWS rating will be the highest measurement in the session after study drug administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Peak SOWS rating will be the highest rating during each 2 hour study session.</time_frame>
    <description>The SOWS is a 16 item validated self-administered scale for grading opioid withdrawal symptoms. The range of scores is 0-64, with higher scores indicating greater withdrawal severity. The peak SOWS rating will be the highest measurement in the session after study drug administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Increase from baseline Pupil Diameter</measure>
    <time_frame>Peak increase from baseline pupil diameter will be the largest increase from baseline pupil diameter measured during each 2 hour study session.</time_frame>
    <description>Pupil diameter (mm) will be measured via digital pupillometer in standard room lighting at baseline and then throughout the study session after study drug administration. The peak increase from baseline value will be the largest increase from baseline pupil diameter measured after study drug administration.</description>
