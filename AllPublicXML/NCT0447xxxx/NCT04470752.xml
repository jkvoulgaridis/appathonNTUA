  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomised, double blind, Phase 2 Trial to evaluate the efficacy of oral Capsaicin in
      patients with post-stroke dysphagia in the (sub-)acute setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After inclusion and the assessment of the swallowing function (PRESS, PAS, FOIS, FEES)
      patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive 1mcg Capsaicin or Placebo. Oral treatment will be
      applied 3 times daily either during meals or during regular swallowing tests/trainings
      accompanied by a Speech Language Pathologist. After re-assessment of the dysphagia after 7
      days, patients with persistent dysphagia and applicable for further treatment will be treated
      for another 23 days with a final clinical swallowing evaluation after a total of 30 days. A
      Patient Medication Diary will used during the Duration of the Trial to capture compliance.
