  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognosis of children with leukemia, the most common pediatric cancer, has improved markedly.
      Yet, relapse still occurs in 15-40% of patients with a probability of survival of &lt;50%, which
      is unlikely to be boosted by intensification of standard chemotherapy due to overwhelming
      toxicity. The advent of effective and safe targeted therapies for high-risk cases is
      therefore imperative. This study constitutes two research projects aiming at driving
      therapeutic advances.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first part of the study aimed to investigate genomics and drug sensitivity profiling of
      childhood leukemia and its potential application for precision medicine.

      The second part of the study aimed to develop novel antibody for treatment of childhood
      leukemia by animal model experiments.

      Design:

      Project 1: Whole-exome and RNA sequencing will be performed on children with leukemia (ALL,
      AML, MPAL, JMML, MDS) prospectively recruited in the Hong Kong Children's Hospital. Samples
      will be screened for their sensitivity to preselected, clinically accessible targeted agents
      in an ex vivo culture system. Results for the high-risk patients will be subjected to the
      tumor broad for evaluation.

      Project 2: Fully human antibody candidates identified by phage display will be engineered
      into therapeutic forms, and assessed for efficacy and safety in patient-derived xenografts of
      relapsed/refractory B-ALL and in transgenic mice. The mechanisms of action will be identified
      by single-cell RNA sequencing.

      Significance:

      Implementation of functional genomics could identify leukemia patients who will benefit from
      targeted therapies and enable tailoring of precision medicine. The invented antibodies could
      be moved forward into clinical trials for salvaging high-risk pediatric B-ALL. Immediate and
      long-term impact on therapy of childhood leukemia is foreseen.
