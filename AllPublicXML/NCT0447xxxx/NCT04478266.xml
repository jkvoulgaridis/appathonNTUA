  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To determine whether SAR439859 in combination with palbociclib improves progression free
      survival (PFS) when compared with letrozole in combination with palbociclib in participants
      with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who have not received any prior systemic anticancer
      therapies for advanced disease.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the overall survival in both treatment arms

        -  To evaluate the objective response rate in both treatment arms

        -  To evaluate the duration of response in both treatment arms

        -  To evaluate the clinical benefit rate in both treatment arms

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of SAR439859, goserelin, and palbociclib

        -  To evaluate health-related quality of life in both treatment arms

        -  To evaluate the time to first chemotherapy in both treatment arms

        -  To evaluate safety in both treatment arms
