      The purpose of this observational study is to collect contemporary real-world treatment
      patterns, clinical outcomes, humanistic burden (including patient-reported disease-specific
      Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and treatment- related adverse events (AEs) or
      adverse reactions (ARs) among Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (aRCC) patients initiating
      first-line systemic therapy.

        Participants will be included if they have primary diagnosis of aRCC, age â‰¥18 years, with
        medical history available from date of aRCC diagnosis to most recent or current therapy.
        For Cohort 1, patients will be eligible if they had initiated 1LOT between April 2018 -
