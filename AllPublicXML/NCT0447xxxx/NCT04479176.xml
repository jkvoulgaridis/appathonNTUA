  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sphenopalatine ganglion block is an interventional procedure used for head and neck pain. In
      recent, studies about transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block (TN-SPGB) was conducted to
      measure the facial temperatures. In transnasal approach, two different methods had been used
      popularly. One method is the Intranasal Drip Method (INDM), and the other method is the
      Cotton Stick Method (CSM). Two different method were compared each other for facial
      temperature changes.

    <textblock>
      In recent, studies about TN-SPGB were conducted to measure the facial temperatures. The
      results of the two recent studies were different. One study was performed by intranasal drip
      method(INDM), and the facial temperatures increased after TN-SPGB. The other study was
      performed by cotton stick method(CSM), and the facial temperatures decreased or were not
      changed after TN-SPGB. For these results, the authors hypothesize that the results will
      differ depending on the method of TN-SPGB, that is, INDM will increase the facial
      temperatures due to sympathetic block dominantly, and CSM will decrease or maintain the
      facial temperatures due to parasympathetic block dominantly.

    <description>After the patient is placed in supine position, Two ml of 2% mepivacaine is placed in a syringe with sheath of 16 gauge vinca. Sheath of vinca is inserted through the nostril and 2% mepivacaine is dripped into nostril in the supine position. The mepivacaine dripped on the nasal pharynx is held for 10 minutes. Drip of 2% mepivacaine is performed in one nostril which pain is dominant. In cases of bilateral pain, drip of mepivacaine is performed in one nostril at random.</description>

    <description>The posture is supine position. Cotton tip applicator soaked with 2% mepivacaine is inserted vertically into the nostril. After the cotton tip applicator touched the posterior wall of the middle turbinate, the cotton tip applicator is fixed and removes after 10 minutes later. Cotton tip applicator is inserted in one nostril which pain is dominant. In cases of bilateral pain, one applicator is inserted in one nostril at random.</description>

    <description>In transnasal approach, several authors described the traditional technique using sterile 10cm cotton tipped applicators that are dipped in the chosen anesthetic and then advanced along the superior border of the middle turbinate, until it reaches the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Some other techniques had described dripping one or two ml of the anesthetics into the nostril.</description>
