  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the major cause of lifelong disability if not treated on time, the
      investigator's technique knows as Compelled Body Weight Shift Technique (CBWS) was utilized
      and administered to chronic stroke population and results were figured out using gait
      parameters and Tinetti POMA scale.

      Total 28 sample size out of which 27 were divided into control and experimental group.
      Inclusion criteria was Unilateral chronic stroke with asymmetrical stance, Patients with
      score of 3,4 and 5 will be included according to FAS (Functional Ambulation Scale), Ability
      to understand and follow instructions, Both male and female, Any type of stroke, and Age
      40-60. Written and informed consent was obtained from participants of study. Six weeks of
      exercise training was combined with compelled body weight shift technique via shoe lift of
      0.6 cm thickness for experimental group and for control group training was performed without
      shoe lift.

    <description>Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment The Tinetti, evaluation instrument is, an effectively managed, task-arranged test that, quantifies gait and balance activities of patients. A three-point, ordinal scale, extending from 0-2. &quot;0&quot; demonstrates the most elevated level of debilitation and &quot;2&quot; the people's freedom.

Results were obtained by using gait parameters including walk speed, cadence, step rate, stride length The tinetti POMA scale was utilized to record changes post treatment in gait , the weight bearing was recorded using Camry ZT-160 analog weight scale At the end of every week results were obtained.</description>
