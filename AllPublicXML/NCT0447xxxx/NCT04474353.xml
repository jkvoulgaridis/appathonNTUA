    <measure>Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are defined as possibly, probably, or definitely related adverse events that are severe or medically significant, and needing topical &amp; systemic therapy; needing surgery intervention; needing hospitalization; needing treatment interruption; or life threatening. Late DLTs will be assessed as the number of DLTs that occur in the period from 31 days after the start of treatment through 5 months after the start of treatment. The outcome will be reported as a number without dispersion.</description>

    <description>Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are defined as possibly, probably, or definitely related adverse events that are severe or medically significant, and needing topical &amp; systemic therapy; needing surgery intervention; needing hospitalization; needing treatment interruption; or life threatening. Acute DLTs will be assessed as the number of DLTs that occur in the period from the start of treatment through 30 days after the start of treatment. The outcome will be reported as a number without dispersion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the number of evaluable participants who, at 6 months from the date of surgical resection or biopsy (PFS6), are alive without disease progression, death, or other defined event (study withdrawal or loss to follow up). Disease progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase in product of perpendicular diameters of the lesion; any increase in MRI T2/FLAIR lesion area from previous MRI scan; MRI detection of a new lesion; decline in clinical status not attributable to causes other than the tumor. The outcome will be reported as the number without dispersion.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) will be assessed as the number of evaluable participants who remain alive from the date of surgical resection or biopsy. The outcome will be reported as the number without dispersion.</description>

    <description>Day 1: Subjects will wear the Optune (TTFields device) for ≥ 18 hours/day. They will take off the device when receiving stereotactic radiosurgery and brain MRI scans.
Days 1 to 8: Subjects will take oral temozolomide 75 mg/m2/day Days 2 to 8: Subjects will receive stereotactic radiosurgery (total of 35 Gy) divided equally over 5 days

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathologically proven newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM, WHO Grade IV) or
             molecular GBM of lower grade that will be treated as per glioblastoma (defined as IDH
             wild type, 1p19q not co deleted)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  A maximum tumor target diameter of less than 5 cm on the post operative MRI used for
             SRS planning (a 5 mm margin is added in the radiotherapy planning process, yielding a
             maximum diameter of the planning target volume (PTV) of less than 6 cm). If the
             maximum diameter is greater than 5 cm, the subject is still eligible if the PTV is
             less than 113 cm3 which is the volume of a 6 cm diameter sphere.

          -  Adequate organ function (obtained within 14 days prior to Day 0) as evidenced by:
