  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the airway pressures generated by High Flow Oxygen Therapy
      could have a beneficial impact in patients with heart failure, particularly by lowering
      capillary pulmonary arterial pressures. However, results compared to Non-Invasive Ventilation
      are difficult to predict due to the lack of data in the literature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to carry out a prospective randomized cross-over prospective
      physiological study comparing, Non-Invasive Ventilation and High Flow Oxygen Therapy in
      patients with chronic uncompensated heart failure. This stable population would make it
      possible to easily study variations in a physiological parameter without any added risk for
      the patient, but with all the pathophysiological parameters transposable to the situation of
      decompensated heart failure.

      Indeed, it is accepted that the existence of heart failure with decreased left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt; 40%) exposes patients to a high risk of congestive cardiac
      decompensation due to the associated presence of diastolic dysfunction1.

      The study will be conducted using an alternating design, where a patient receives the two
      treatments one after the other (&quot;cross-over&quot;), because the alternating design, compared to
      the two parallel arm design, reduces the number of patients needed to show a given difference
      between High Flow Oxygen Therapy and Non-Invasive Ventilation at equal power, if there is
      neither an order-of-prescription effect (&quot;period&quot;) nor a residual effect of the first
      treatment on the second treatment (&quot;carry-over&quot;). In order to avoid a residual effect on
      changes in pressure or oxygenation, a wash-out period on conventional oxygen therapy (O2C)
      should be set between the two treatments (High Flow Oxygen Therapy and Non-Invasive
      Ventilation) administered to the same patient.
