  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of consuming a probiotic on salivary,
      plaque, and tongue bacteria, as well as oral malodor (bad breath). Healthy volunteers will
      consume a probiotic powder, or a placebo powder, that is dissolved in water for 4 weeks.

      The oral cavity houses one of the most diverse microbiota in the human body. There are nearly
      800 unique oral bacterial species identified with more species expected to be added with
      further sampling and identification. As with microbiota of other sites in the body, a
      balanced oral microbiota is essential to maintaining the health of the human host.
      Streptococcus salivarius is a pioneer species that colonizes the human oral cavity from
      birth, and remains a predominant member of the commensal microbiota throughout life. The
      commensal microbiota provides protection against pathogenic species associated with
      conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and oral malodor (halitosis). This
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is conducted to investigate the effect of
      a Streptococcus salivarius DB-B5 strain on oral bacteria levels and halitosis. Doses of 2
      billion and 10 billion colony forming units (CFU) per day are tested.
