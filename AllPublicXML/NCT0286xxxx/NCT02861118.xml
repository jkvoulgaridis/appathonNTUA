      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the co-morbidities profile on
      treatment response to biological therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective, non-interventional, observational study that included participants
      diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who started treatment with
      biologics between June 2011 and June 2013. The study looked at the impact of the
      co-morbidities on the treatment response in IBD participants.

      The study enrolled 310 patients included both UC and CD patients.

      This multicenter trial was conducted in Spain. Investigator collected retrospective data in a
      single visit from participants who started biologic treatment between June 2011 and June
      2013. Time since participants started biological treatment until study visit or until lack of
      treatment response or until treatment change constituted the reference period for the study.

    <measure>Impact of the Comorbidities Profile in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Participants on Lack of Treatment Response to Biological Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks after start of treatment with biologics</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between co-morbidities profile and lack of response, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical profile of participants, logistic regression models were conducted. Lack of response was reduction of 2 points from baseline in Harvey-Bradshaw Indices (HBI) score for CD or Partial Mayo score (PMS) for UC after 10 weeks treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF). HBI included general well-being (0=very well to 4=terrible), abdominal pain (0=none to 3=severe), number of liquid stools/day, abdominal mass (0=none to 3=tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score/item). The total score was sum of sub scores, where score &lt;5=remission, 5-7=mild disease, 8-16=moderate disease and &gt;16-severe disease. PMS included 3 sub-scores: stool frequency (0=normal to 3=&gt;4 stools/day more than normal), rectal bleeding (0=none to 3=passing blood alone), and physician's global assessment (0=Normal to 3=severe). The total score was sum of sub scale scores from 0=normal to 9=severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Impact of the Comorbidities Profile in IBD Participants on Loss of Treatment Response to Biological Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after start of treatment with biologics</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between co-morbidities profile and loss of response, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical profile of participants, logistic regression models were conducted. Loss of response was deﬁned as loss of drug effect along follow up with initial response i.e. reduction of 2 points from baseline in HBI score for CD or PMS for UC after 6 months of treatment with anti-TNF. HBI included general well-being (0=very well to 4=terrible), abdominal pain (0=none to 3=severe), number of liquid stools/day, abdominal mass (0=none to 3=tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score/item). The total score was sum of sub scores, &lt;5=remission, 5-7=mild disease, 8-16=moderate disease and &gt;16=severe disease. PMS score included 3 sub-scores: stool frequency (0=normal to 3=&gt;4 stools/day more than normal), rectal bleeding (0=none to 3=passing blood alone), and physician's global assessment (0=Normal to 3=severe). The total score was sum of sub scale scores ranging from 0=normal to 9=severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Impact of the Extraintestinal Manifestations Profile in IBD Participants on Lack of Treatment Response to Biological Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks after start of treatment with biologics</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between extraintestinal manifestations profile and lack of response, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical profile of participants, logistic regression models were conducted. Lack of response was reduction of at least 2 points from baseline in HBI score for CD or PMS for UC after 10 weeks treatment with TNF. HBI included general well-being (0=very well to 4=terrible), abdominal pain (0=none to 3=severe), number of liquid stools/day, abdominal mass (0=none to 3=tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score/item). The total score was sum of sub scores, where score &lt;5=remission, 5-7=mild disease, 8-16=moderate disease and &gt;16-severe disease.

        <description>Correlation between co-morbidities profile and lack of response, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical profile of participants, logistic regression models were conducted. Lack of response was reduction of 2 points from baseline in Harvey-Bradshaw Indices (HBI) score for CD or Partial Mayo score (PMS) for UC after 10 weeks treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF). HBI included general well-being (0=very well to 4=terrible), abdominal pain (0=none to 3=severe), number of liquid stools/day, abdominal mass (0=none to 3=tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score/item). The total score was sum of sub scores, where score &lt;5=remission, 5-7=mild disease, 8-16=moderate disease and &gt;16-severe disease. PMS included 3 sub-scores: stool frequency (0=normal to 3=&gt;4 stools/day more than normal), rectal bleeding (0=none to 3=passing blood alone), and physician's global assessment (0=Normal to 3=severe). The total score was sum of sub scale scores from 0=normal to 9=severe disease.</description>

          <title>Impact of the Extraintestinal Manifestations Profile in IBD Participants on Loss of Treatment Response to Biological Therapy</title>
          <description>Correlation between extraintestinal manifestations profile and loss of response, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical profile, logistic regression models were conducted. Loss of response was deﬁned as loss of drug effect along follow up with initial response i.e. reduction of 2 points from baseline in HBI score for CD or PMS for UC after 6 months of treatment with anti-TNF. HBI included general well-being (0=very well to 4=terrible), abdominal pain (0=none to 3=severe), number of liquid stools/day, abdominal mass (0=none to 3=tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score/item). The total score was sum of sub scores, &lt;5=remission, 5-7=mild disease, 8-16=moderate disease and &gt;16=severe disease. PMS score included 3 sub-scores: stool frequency (0=normal to 3=&gt;4 stools/day more than normal), rectal bleeding (0=none to 3=passing blood alone), and physician's global assessment (0=Normal to 3=severe). The total score was sum of sub scale scores ranging from 0=normal to 9=severe disease.</description>
          <population>Analyzed participants included all participants who didn’t had screen failure, met all the inclusion criteria and had enough information about response to the biological treatment.</population>
