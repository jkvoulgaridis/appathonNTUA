    <measure>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Relief Rating (PRR) and Pain Intensity Difference (PID) Scores From 0 to 8 Hours Post-dose (SPRID 0-8): Ibuprofen + Caffeine Versus Ibuprofen</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 to 8 hours post-dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID 0-8: time-weighted sum of PRID scores from 0 to 8 hours. PRID: sum of PID and PRR at each post-dose time point. PRR score: at each post-dose time point participants answered to question &quot;How much relief do you have from your starting pain?&quot; on a 5-point scale: 0= none, 1= a little, 2= some, 3= a lot, 4= complete; higher scores = more relief from pain. Numerical pain severity rating (NPSR) scale: at baseline and each post-dose time point participants answered to question &quot;How much pain do you have at this time?&quot; on an 11-point scale: range from 0= no pain to 10= worst possible pain; higher scores = worse pain. PID score: NPSR score at baseline (0 hour) minus NPSR score at each post-dose time point; overall possible PID score range at a post-dose time point: -10 to 10, higher positive value = greater improvement. Overall possible SPRID 0-8 score range: -80 to 112, higher scores = more improvement in pain.</description>

    <description>When the participants were administered study medication at time 0 hours they were given the 2 stopwatches: 1 stopwatch was labelled as &quot;first perceptible relief&quot; and another as &quot;meaningful relief.&quot; Participants were instructed to stop the stopwatch labelled as &quot;first perceptible relief&quot; at the moment when they first began to feel any pain relieving effect. It was when they first felt a little/noticeable pain relief. It did not mean that they felt completely better (though they might), but when they first felt any difference in pain that they had at present. The stopwatch remained active for 8 hours (until stopped by the participants, or until rescue medication was administered).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening up to Day 17 after the last dose of study drug (approximately maximum of 48 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pre-treatment state. AEs are classified according to severity in 3 categories as mild (did not interfere with participant's usual function), moderate (interfered to some extent with participant's usual function) and severe (interfered significantly with participant's usual function).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Treatment Related Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening up to Day 17 after the last dose of study drug (approximately maximum of 48 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pre-treatment state. Relatedness of an AE to study drug was assessed by investigator.</description>

        <title>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Relief Rating (PRR) and Pain Intensity Difference (PID) Scores From 0 to 8 Hours Post-dose (SPRID 0-8): Ibuprofen + Caffeine Versus Ibuprofen</title>
        <description>SPRID 0-8: time-weighted sum of PRID scores from 0 to 8 hours. PRID: sum of PID and PRR at each post-dose time point. PRR score: at each post-dose time point participants answered to question &quot;How much relief do you have from your starting pain?&quot; on a 5-point scale: 0= none, 1= a little, 2= some, 3= a lot, 4= complete; higher scores = more relief from pain. Numerical pain severity rating (NPSR) scale: at baseline and each post-dose time point participants answered to question &quot;How much pain do you have at this time?&quot; on an 11-point scale: range from 0= no pain to 10= worst possible pain; higher scores = worse pain. PID score: NPSR score at baseline (0 hour) minus NPSR score at each post-dose time point; overall possible PID score range at a post-dose time point: -10 to 10, higher positive value = greater improvement. Overall possible SPRID 0-8 score range: -80 to 112, higher scores = more improvement in pain.</description>

        <description>SPRID 0-2, SPRID 0-4, SPRID 0-6, SPRID 0-8: time-weighted sum of PRID scores from 0 to 2, 0 to 4, 0 to 6 and 0 to 8 hours respectively. PRID at each post-dose time point = PID + PRR. PRR score: at each post-dose time point participants answered to question &quot;How much relief do you have from your starting pain?&quot; on 5-point scale: 0=none, 1=a little, 2=some, 3=a lot, 4=complete; higher scores=more relief from pain. NPSR scale: at baseline and each post-dose time point participants answered to question &quot;How much pain do you have at this time?&quot; on 11-point scale: range from 0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain; higher scores=worse pain. PID score: NPSR score at baseline (0 hour) minus NPSR score at each post-dose time point; overall possible PID score range at a post-dose time point: -10 to 10, higher positive value=greater improvement. Score range for: SPRID 0-2= -20 to 28; SPRID 0-4= -40 to 56; SPRID 0-6= -60 to 84; SPRID 0-8= -80 to 112. Higher SPRID scores=more improvement in pain.</description>

          <description>SPID 0-2, SPID 0-4, SPID 0-6, SPID 0-8: time-weighted sum of PID scores from 0 to 2, 0 to 4, 0 to 6 and 0 to 8 hours post-dose respectively. NPSR scale: at baseline and each post-dose time point participants answered to question &quot;How much pain do you have at this time?&quot; on an 11-point scale: score range from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain; higher scores = worse pain. PID score: NPSR score at baseline (0 hour) minus NPSR score at each post-dose time point; overall possible PID score range at a post-dose time point: -10 to 10, higher positive value = greater improvement. Overall possible range: SPID 0-2 = -20 to 20; SPID 0-4 = -40 to 40; SPID 0-6 = -60 to 60; SPID 0-8 = -80 to 80. Higher SPID scores = more improvement in pain.</description>

          <title>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Relief Rating Scores From 0 to 2 (TOTPAR 0-2), 0 to 4 (TOTPAR 0-4), 0 to 6 (TOTPAR 0-6) and 0 to 8 Hours Post-dose (TOTPAR 0-8)</title>
          <description>TOTPAR 0-2, TOTPAR 0-4, TOTPAR 0-6, TOTPAR 0-8: time-weighted sum of PRR scores from 0 to 2, 0 to 4, 0 to 6 and 0 to 8 hours post-dose respectively. PRR score: at each post-dose time point participants answered to the question &quot;How much relief do you have from your starting pain?&quot; on a 5-point scale: 0= none, 1= a little, 2= some, 3= a lot, 4= complete; higher scores = more relief from pain. Overall possible range: TOTPAR 0-2 = 0 to 8; TOTPAR 0-4 = 0 to 16; TOTPAR 0-6 = 0 to 24; TOTPAR 0-8 = 0 to 32. Higher TOTPAR scores = more improvement in pain.</description>

        <description>PRID: sum of PID and PRR at each post-dose time point. PRR score: at each post-dose time point participants answered to a question &quot;How much relief do you have from your starting pain?&quot; on a 5-point scale: 0= none, 1= a little, 2= some, 3= a lot, 4= complete; higher scores = more relief from pain. NPSR scale: at baseline and each post-dose time point participants answered to a question &quot;How much pain do you have at this time?&quot; on an 11-point scale: range from 0= no pain to 10= worst possible pain; higher scores = worse pain. PID score: NPSR score at baseline (0 hour) minus NPSR score at each post-dose time point; overall possible PID score range at a post-dose time point: -10 to 10, higher positive value = greater improvement. At a single post-dose time point overall possible range for PRID score: -10 to 14, higher scores = more improvement in pain.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pre-treatment state. AEs are classified according to severity in 3 categories as mild (did not interfere with participant's usual function), moderate (interfered to some extent with participant's usual function) and severe (interfered significantly with participant's usual function).</description>
