  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized feasibility trial conducted with severe trauma patients. At admission
      patients presented hypofibrinogenemia, hypotension and tachycardia. The primary outcome was
      feasibility assessed by the proportion of patients receiving the allocated treatment up to 60
      minutes after randomization. The treatments regards to receive or not to receive an early
      replacement of fibrinogen.

      This is a randomized feasibility trial conducted between December 2015 and January 2017 with
      severe trauma patients (Index of Shock Severity [ISS] ≥ 15) admitted to the emergency room of
      a large trauma center. At admission patients presented qualitative hypofibrinogenemia (FIBTEM
      A5 ≤ 9 mm), hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg) and tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 100
      bpm). The primary outcome was feasibility assessed by the proportion of patients receiving
      the allocated treatment up to 60 minutes after randomization meaning receive replacement
      through fibrinogen concentrate (50mg per kg of body weight) by the intervention group and not
      to receive an early replacement of fibrinogen by control group.
