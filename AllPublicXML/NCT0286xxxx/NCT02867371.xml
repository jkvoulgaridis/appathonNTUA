    <textblock>
      The Archimedes System is an image-guided navigation system used to access tissue samples in
      the lungs. This study is being conducted to confirm the performance of the Archimedes System
      in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose highly suspicious lung
      cancer or metastatic disease. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor
      is conducted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 21-75 years at screening

          2. Highly suspicious pulmonary nodule(s), defined as distinct nodule with a diameter of
             ≥8mm in its largest dimension

          3. No known endobronchial tumor

          4. Tumor located anywhere in parenchymal tissue &gt;1 cm from pleura and accessible
             bronchoscopically through a POE.

          5. Willing to participate in all aspects of study protocol for duration of study

          6. Able to understand study requirements

          7. Subject or legally authorized representative signs study-related informed consent
             document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any contraindication to bronchoscopy, for example:

               1. Untreatable life-threatening arrhythmias

               2. Inability to adequately oxygenate the patient during the procedure

               3. Acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia (unless the patient is intubated and
                  ventilated)

               4. Recent myocardial infarction

               5. Previously diagnosed high-grade tracheal obstruction

               6. Uncorrectable coagulopathy

         12. Inability to stop anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, Warfarin) or antiplatelet agents
             (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel) prior to procedure

         13. Participation in any other study in last 30 days

         14. Prior thoracic surgery on the same side of the lung as the SPN.
