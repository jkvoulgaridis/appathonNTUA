  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin (Jardiance), a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the sodium-glucose
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), was approved in Europe in May 2014 for the treatment of type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycaemic control in adults. As part of the risk
      management plan, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (BI) has committed to conduct a
      post-authorisation safety study (PASS) to evaluate the liver and renal safety of
      empagliflozin. The study will also evaluate the risks of severe complications of urinary
      tract infections (UTIs) and genital infections. To evaluate the association between
      empagliflozin use and mentioned outcomes routinely collected health information from the
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), the Hospital Episodes Statistics, and Office of
      National Statistic will be used. This PASS will be conducted through an observational cohort
      study among adult patients with T2DM and at least 12 months of continuous enrolment in the
      CPRD where new users of empagliflozin will be compared to new users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4
      (DPP4) inhibitors. Estimations will be made on the crude and adjusted incidence rates and
      adjusted incidence rate ratios of the primary and secondary outcomes.
