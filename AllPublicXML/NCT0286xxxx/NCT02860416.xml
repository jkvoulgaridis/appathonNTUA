      To collect additional Investigational cognitive tasks and additional clinical data for
      subjects tested with ElMindA's Brain Network Activation (BNA™).

      The BNA™ technology was developed and is utilized by ElMindA Ltd. The (BNA™) Analysis System
      is cleared for use by qualified medical professionals for the post hoc statistical analysis
      of the human electroencephalogram (&quot;EEG&quot;), utilizing evoked response potentials (&quot;ERP').
