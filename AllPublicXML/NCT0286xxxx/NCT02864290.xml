  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP1235 (AGS62P1)
      given at three dosing schedules (Schedule A, every three weeks [Q3W] or Schedule B, every
      other week of a 4 week cycle [Q2W] or Schedule C once a week for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle)
      in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
      In addition, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), the immunogenicity and the
      anti-leukemic activity of ASP1235 (AGS62P1).
