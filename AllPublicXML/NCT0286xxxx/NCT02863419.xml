    <measure>Change in DTSQs: Individual Items and Total Treatment Satisfaction Score (6 of the 8 Items Summed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - status version (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 26 (wk 26) and week 52 (wk 52). The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction.</description>

          <title>Oral Semaglutide 14 mg</title>
          <description>Participants were to take once-daily oral semaglutide tablets for 52 weeks. Participants started oral semaglutide at 3 mg and were dose-escalated in 4-week increments until the final maintenance dose of 14 mg once-daily was reached (i.e. 3 mg from week 0 to week 4, 7 mg from week 4 to week 8 and 14 mg from week 8 to week 52). In addition, participants were to take liraglutide placebo once-daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) from week 0 to week 52. Participants were to continue their anti-diabetic background medication (metformin alone or in combination with a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) throughout the entire trial.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was evaluated at week 26. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product. The endpoint was also evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature trial product discontinuation.</description>

The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product. The endpoint was also evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature trial product discontinuation.</description>

            <description>Participants were to take once-daily oral semaglutide tablets for 52 weeks. Participants started oral semaglutide at 3 mg and were dose-escalated in 4-week increments until the final maintenance dose of 14 mg once-daily was reached (i.e. 3 mg from week 0 to week 4, 7 mg from week 4 to week 8 and 14 mg from week 8 to week 52). In addition, participants were to take liraglutide placebo once-daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) from week 0 to week 52. Participants were to continue their anti-diabetic background medication (metformin alone or in combination with a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) throughout the entire trial.</description>

        <title>Participants Who Achieve HbA1c &lt;7.0 % (53 mmol/Mol) Without Hypoglycaemia (Severe or BG Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemia) and no Weight Gain (Yes/no)</title>
        <description>Participants who achieved HbA1c less than 7.0 % without severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia and without weight gain (yes/no) at weeks 26 and 52 are presented. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or take other corrective actions. BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode with plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in electrocardiogram (ECG) was evaluated at weeks 26 and week 52. Change from baseline results are presented as shift in findings (normal, abnormal and not clinically significant (NCS) and abnormal and clinically significant (CS)) from week 0 to week 26 and week 52. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

          <title>Change in ECG Evaluation</title>
          <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in electrocardiogram (ECG) was evaluated at weeks 26 and week 52. Change from baseline results are presented as shift in findings (normal, abnormal and not clinically significant (NCS) and abnormal and clinically significant (CS)) from week 0 to week 26 and week 52. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>
          <population>Overall number of participants analyzed = SAS which comprised all randomised participants who received at least one dose of trial product. Number Analyzed = number of participants with available data.</population>

        <title>Change in Physical Examination</title>
        <description>Participants with physical examination findings, normal, abnormal NCS and abnormal CS at baseline (weeks -2) and weeks 52 are presented. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product. Results are presented for the following examinations: 1) Cardiovascular system; 2) Central and peripheral nervous system; 3) Gastrointestinal system, incl. mouth; 4) General appearance; 5) Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck; 6) Lymph node palpation; 7) Musculoskeletal system; 8) Respiratory system; 9) Skin; 10) Thyroid gland.</description>

            <title>Oral Semaglutide 14 mg</title>
            <description>Participants were to take once-daily oral semaglutide tablets for 52 weeks. Participants started oral semaglutide at 3 mg and were dose-escalated in 4-week increments until the final maintenance dose of 14 mg once-daily was reached (i.e. 3 mg from week 0 to week 4, 7 mg from week 4 to week 8 and 14 mg from week 8 to week 52). In addition, participants were to take liraglutide placebo once-daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) from week 0 to week 52. Participants were to continue their anti-diabetic background medication (metformin alone or in combination with a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) throughout the entire trial.</description>

        <description>Participants with eye examination (fundoscopy) findings, normal, abnormal NCS and abnormal CS at baseline (week -2) and week 52 are presented. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

            <title>Oral Semaglutide 14 mg</title>
            <description>Participants were to take once-daily oral semaglutide tablets for 52 weeks. Participants started oral semaglutide at 3 mg and were dose-escalated in 4-week increments until the final maintenance dose of 14 mg once-daily was reached (i.e. 3 mg from week 0 to week 4, 7 mg from week 4 to week 8 and 14 mg from week 8 to week 52). In addition, participants were to take liraglutide placebo once-daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) from week 0 to week 52. Participants were to continue their anti-diabetic background medication (metformin alone or in combination with a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) throughout the entire trial.</description>

Participants started oral semaglutide at 3 mg and were dose-escalated in 4-week increments until the final maintenance dose of 14 mg once-daily was reached (i.e. 3 mg from week 0 to week 4, 7 mg from week 4 to week 8 and 14 mg from week 8 to week 52). In addition, participants were to take liraglutide placebo once-daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) from week 0 to week 52. Participants were to continue their anti-diabetic background medication (metformin alone or in combination with a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) throughout the entire trial.</description>

          <title>Participants With Treatment-emergent Severe or BG-confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
          <description>Treatment emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded from week 0 to week 57 (52-week treatment period plus the 5-week follow-up period). Hypoglycaemic episodes with onset during the on-treatment observation period were considered treatment-emergent. On-treatment observation period was defined as the time period when a subject was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or take other corrective actions. BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: Confirmed by a glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

        <title>Change in DTSQs: Individual Items and Total Treatment Satisfaction Score (6 of the 8 Items Summed)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - status version (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 26 (wk 26) and week 52 (wk 52). The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction.</description>

      <time_frame>Week 0 to week 57 (52 weeks treatment period + 5 weeks follow-up period). Results are based on the safety analysis set (SAS), which comprised all randomised participants who received at least one dose of trial product.</time_frame>
      <desc>Serious adverse events and other AEs were based on the on-treatment observation period, i.e., the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication. All-cause mortality were based on the in-trial observation period, i.e., the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</desc>

          <description>Participants were to take once-daily oral semaglutide tablets for 52 weeks. Participants started oral semaglutide at 3 mg and were dose-escalated in 4-week increments until the final maintenance dose of 14 mg once-daily was reached (i.e. 3 mg from week 0 to week 4, 7 mg from week 4 to week 8 and 14 mg from week 8 to week 52). In addition, participants were to take liraglutide placebo once-daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) from week 0 to week 52. Participants were to continue their anti-diabetic background medication (metformin alone or in combination with a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) throughout the entire trial.</description>
