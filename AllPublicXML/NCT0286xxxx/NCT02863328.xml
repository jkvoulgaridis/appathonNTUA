    <time_frame>Weeks 0-57</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent hypoglycaemia is an episode with onset in the on-treatment observation period (the time period where participants are considered treated with trial product) and was assessed up to approximately 57 weeks (52-week treatment period plus the 5-week follow-up period). Severe or BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia is an episode that is severe according to the American Diabetes Association classification or blood glucose-confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Results are based on the data from the on-treatment observation period. On-treatment observation period: the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication.</description>

    <measure>Change in Short Form Health Survey Version 2.0 (SF-36v2™, Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains and Summaries of the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

    <measure>Change in CoEQ: Scores From the 4 Domains and the 19 Items</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ) was evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. The CoEQ comprised 19 items to assess the intensity and type of food cravings, as well as subjective sensation of appetite and mood, with the 4 domains: 'craving control' (items 9-12, 19), 'positive mood' (items 5-8), 'craving for savoury' (items 4, 16-18) and 'craving for sweet' (items 3, 13-15). The 19 items were scored on an 11-point graded response scale ranging from 10 to 0, with items relating to each of the 4 domains being averaged to create a final score. A low score in the domains 'craving for sweet and 'craving for savoury' represents a low level of craving; whereas a high score in the domains 'craving control' and 'positive mood' represents good control and a good mood, respectively. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was evaluated at week 26. The endpoint was evaluated based on data from the in-trial observation period which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product. The endpoint was also evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in fasting free fatty acids (FFA) (mmol/L) at week 26 and week 52 is presented as ratio to baseline. The results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period. Because of an issue with the handling of the blood samples for FFA, all FFA data are considered invalid for this trial; thus, no conclusion with regards to FFA levels can be made based on the FFA data.

        <title>Change in Short Form Health Survey Version 2.0 (SF-36v2™, Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains and Summaries of the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in CoEQ: Scores From the 4 Domains and the 19 Items</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ) was evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. The CoEQ comprised 19 items to assess the intensity and type of food cravings, as well as subjective sensation of appetite and mood, with the 4 domains: 'craving control' (items 9-12, 19), 'positive mood' (items 5-8), 'craving for savoury' (items 4, 16-18) and 'craving for sweet' (items 3, 13-15). The 19 items were scored on an 11-point graded response scale ranging from 10 to 0, with items relating to each of the 4 domains being averaged to create a final score. A low score in the domains 'craving for sweet and 'craving for savoury' represents a low level of craving; whereas a high score in the domains 'craving control' and 'positive mood' represents good control and a good mood, respectively. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>
