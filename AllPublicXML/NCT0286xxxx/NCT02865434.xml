      A Manocept Platform prospective, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, safety with PK and
      dosimetry study of injected Tc 99m tilmanocept in the detection of and assessment of
      localization to skeletal joints in subjects with and without active RA by SPECT imaging. All
      subjects will receive IV administration at one of 3 mass doses: 50 µg, 200 µg, or 400 µg.
      Within each mass dose group, subjects will receive Tc 99m tilmanocept labeled with one of 3
      radiolabel doses: 1 mCi, 5 mCi, or 10 mCi.

      All subjects will have a whole body planar SPECT scan. Subjects enrolled in Groups 1-9 will
      receive a whole body and planar hands scan followed by SPECT/CT scans on areas of interest
      post injection at 60 minutes ± 15 minutes and 180 minutes ± 15 minutes. Subjects enrolled in
      Groups 10-11 will receive a whole body planar SPECT scan performed at 4 specified time points
      post injection: 15 ± 5 minutes, 60 ± 15 minutes, 180 ± 15 minutes and 18-20 hours. Planar
      hand scans will be collected at 60 ± 15 minutes and 180 ± 15 minutes post-injection. PK blood
      sampling will be performed before injection (within 15 minutes), immediately following
      injection (within 5 minutes) and at each scanning timepoint. Dosimetry tests will be
      performed at each scanning timepoint. PK of urine will be assessed through counts of the
      bladder wall obtained from cumulative quantitative planar imaging from radiation dosimetry.
