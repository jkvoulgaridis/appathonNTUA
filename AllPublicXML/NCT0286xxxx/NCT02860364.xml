  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermic circulatory arrest is an important surgical technique, allowing complex aortic
      surgeries to be performed safely. Hypothermic circulatory arrest provides protection to
      cerebral and visceral organs, but may result in longer cardiopulmonary bypass times during
      surgery, increased risks of bleeding, inflammation, and neuronal injury. To manage these
      consequences, a trend towards warmer core body temperatures during circulatory arrest has
      emerged. This trial will randomize patients to either mild (32°C) or moderate (26°C)
      hypothermia during aortic hemiarch surgery to determine if mild hypothermia reduces the
      length of cardiopulmonary bypass time and other key measures of morbidity and mortality.
