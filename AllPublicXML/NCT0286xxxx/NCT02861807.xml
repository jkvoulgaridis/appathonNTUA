  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) impacts millions of Americans and is associated with significant
      behavioral, social, economic, medical, and neurobiological dysfunction, yet current
      behavioral treatments for AUD are only modestly effective. The proposed research will test
      the efficacy of a novel behavioral intervention, which combines brain stimulation with
      mindfulness-based relapse prevention, and is hypothesized to improve neural dysfunction and
      ultimately lead to large effect size reductions in heavy drinking among individuals with AUD.
      Given that mindfulness and brain stimulation are already available for &quot;home use&quot; there is
      great potential for the ultimate dissemination of the intervention on a large scale, which
      could have a significant impact on public health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heavy drinking (defined as 4+/5+ drinks per occasion for women/men) and alcohol use disorder
      (AUD) are a significant public health problem. Modestly effective pharmacological and
      psychosocial treatments for AUD exist, yet some heavy drinking (i.e., relapse) is the most
      common outcome following AUD treatment. Continued development of innovative and efficacious
      interventions that reduce heavy drinking and specifically target risk factors for heavy
      drinking is thus clearly warranted. One novel intervention that has considerable promise for
      reducing heavy drinking is mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP). MBRP is a behavioral
      intervention for substance use disorder that was designed to target experiences of craving
      and other risk factors for heavy drinking. Based on the results of numerous studies, MBRP is
      feasible and efficacious in the treatment of AUD. However the effect sizes of MBRP remain
      small and many individuals struggle with engaging in the mindfulness practices early in
      treatment. There is preliminary evidence that combining a non-invasive form of brain
      stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), may improve engagement with
      mindfulness practices and lead to significant reductions in heavy drinking following
      treatment. The goal of the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of a mindfulness + tDCS
      intervention in reducing heavy drinking and impacting hypothesized mechanisms of behavior
      change among individuals with AUD who are interested in reducing their heavy drinking. In the
      proposed study, a research team with complementary expertise in AUD treatment,
      mindfulness-based interventions, brain stimulation, and cognitive neuroscience will combine
      self-report, behavioral, and neurophysiological data collection via electroencephalography
      (EEG) to study the psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms of treatment efficacy
      following a novel, promising intervention that combines brain stimulation with mindfulness
      training. The mindfulness based intervention in combination with active tDCS is hypothesized
      to lead to significant reductions in drinks per drinking day after 8 weeks of treatment and
      these reductions will be maintained up to 2 months following treatment. Further, the effect
      of active tDCS on drinks per drinking day at the 2 month follow-up will be mediated by
      greater mindfulness, greater inhibitory control and reductions in craving and negative affect
      during treatment and at the post-treatment assessment. Approximately 86 individuals meeting
      criteria for AUD will be randomly assigned to 8 sessions of either MBRP combined with active
      tDCS (up to 2.0 milliamp current) or MBRP combined with a sham tDCS (no current) control
      condition. The proposed study will examine the efficacy (Primary Aim) and psychological and
      neurophysiological mechanisms of treatment efficacy using behavioral measures and EEG
      (Secondary Aim). In addition to addressing the question of whether adding active tDCS to MBRP
      enhances efficacy, it will further examine issues of neurophysiological and behavioral
      treatment mechanisms to better inform the design of a future large efficacy trial.

    <measure>Cue Reactivity at the Post-Treatment Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To measure cue reactivity to alcohol, the investigators will use a visual cue presentation task. Participants will view pictures of alcohol containing beverages and neutral pictures from the International Affective Pictures Series (IAPS)118 and from the web. Alcohol and neutral pictures will be matched for color and complexity as well as other potentially important confounds (e.g., presence of people). The investigators will examine responses to approximately 100 trials each of alcohol pictures and control pictures in a mixed event design (~15 minutes), in order to reduce predictability of the picture type. After viewing pictures participants reported craving for alcohol on a scale from 1 to 9 (1=no craving, 9=extreme craving) with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Improvements in Inhibitory Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To examine inhibitory control, the investigators will use a Stop Signal Task in which participants make left-right judgments of the directionality of an arrow presented on the screen. For each trial, a circle will appear for 500 ms, followed by a left or right-pointing arrow for up to 1 second and between 500 ms and 2500 ms jittered inter-trial interval to reduce anticipatory responses. Approximately 25% of trials will be &quot;stop trials&quot; with a tone played to signal participants to inhibit the current response. This timing of the tone is dynamically adjusted to ensure successful inhibition on approximately 50% of trials. There will be 240 trials across 6 blocks (~10 minutes). Inhibitory control is measured by stop signal reaction time.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators will make the data publicly available given that it will be a unique data set that will not only allow for further exploration by alcohol researchers, but also allow for methods development by the broader research community. The investigators plan to release the data to the public once the primary manuscripts describing the main findings of the study have been accepted for publication. Anonymized and preprocessed EEG data as well as deidentified behavioral and questionnaire data will be shared with investigators from institutions with a Federal Wide Assurance; all investigators with whom the data is shared will be included in the annual progress report. To ensure accessibility of the data set, instructions for obtaining the data set will be included in publications of the data collected under this grant.</ipd_description>

        <title>Cue Reactivity at the Post-Treatment Assessment</title>
        <description>To measure cue reactivity to alcohol, the investigators will use a visual cue presentation task. Participants will view pictures of alcohol containing beverages and neutral pictures from the International Affective Pictures Series (IAPS)118 and from the web. Alcohol and neutral pictures will be matched for color and complexity as well as other potentially important confounds (e.g., presence of people). The investigators will examine responses to approximately 100 trials each of alcohol pictures and control pictures in a mixed event design (~15 minutes), in order to reduce predictability of the picture type. After viewing pictures participants reported craving for alcohol on a scale from 1 to 9 (1=no craving, 9=extreme craving) with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

        <title>Improvements in Inhibitory Control</title>
        <description>To examine inhibitory control, the investigators will use a Stop Signal Task in which participants make left-right judgments of the directionality of an arrow presented on the screen. For each trial, a circle will appear for 500 ms, followed by a left or right-pointing arrow for up to 1 second and between 500 ms and 2500 ms jittered inter-trial interval to reduce anticipatory responses. Approximately 25% of trials will be &quot;stop trials&quot; with a tone played to signal participants to inhibit the current response. This timing of the tone is dynamically adjusted to ensure successful inhibition on approximately 50% of trials. There will be 240 trials across 6 blocks (~10 minutes). Inhibitory control is measured by stop signal reaction time.</description>
