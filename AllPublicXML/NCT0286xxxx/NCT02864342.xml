      A randomized clinical study to assess the impact of Symbicort® pMDI medication reminders on
      adherence in COPD patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with substantial associated
      morbidity and mortality. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the US and claimed
      133,965 US lives in 2009. In 2011 12.7 million US adults were estimated to have COPD.
      However, approximately 24 million US adults have evidence of impaired lung function,
      indicating an under diagnosis of COPD. COPD also has a potentially harmful economic impact.
      In 2010, COPD resulted in over 10 million office visits, nearly 1.5 million emergency
      department visits, 700,000 hospitalizations, and 133,575 deaths in the US. In 2010, US total
      medical treatment costs attributed solely to COPD (i.e., excluding comorbidities) were
      estimated to be $32.1 billion with an additional $3.9 billion in COPD costs resulting from
      worker absenteeism. Even in industrialized countries such as the US, where anti-smoking
      initiatives have been relatively successful, the legacy of past smoking behavior in aging
      populations ensures that the COPD burden will unavoidably continue to climb over the next 20
      to 30 years. Adherence rates for inhaled combination therapy is poor (average 3.9 refills per
      year). COPD patients with lower adherence tend to have higher overall healthcare costs, as
      demonstrated in a 24 month study of 33,816 patients in the US, which found: Patients
      continuing therapy had lower costs of care by $3764 compared with patients who had ceased to
      take their maintenance therapy. COPD patients with higher adherence to prescribed regimens
      experienced fewer hospitalizations and lower Medicare costs (-$2185) than those who exhibited
      lower adherence behaviors. Given the poor adherence with inhaled combination therapy seen in
      patients with COPD, and associated morbidity/mortality and economic costs, the present study
      is being conducted to see if medication reminders can be used to improve adherence in this
      population.

    <measure>Mean Number of Adherent Sets of Symbicort Puffs Per Day Over the 26-Week Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of treatment (EOT), (6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of adherent sets of Symbicort puffs per day for each group, over an average of 26 weeks was calculated. An adherent set of puffs was defined as exactly 2 sets of 2 Symbicort puffs per day. The 2 puffs that constitute a set must have been taken within 60 minutes of each other. A mean of 2.00 sets would be equal to 100% adherence (2 sets of 2 puffs). Subjects who did not take exactly 2 sets of 2 puffs on any given day throughout their device time on study were considered non-adherent for that day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) Scores at Baseline, EOT, and Mean Change in Score Over the 26-Week Study Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to EOT (6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The CCQ is a 10-item measure of a subject's COPD symptoms, divided into 3 domains (Symptoms: Items 1, 2, 5 and 6; Functional State: Items 7, 8, 9, and 10; and Mental State: Items 3 and 4). Individual items within the CCQ were equally weighted. The total score was calculated by adding the scores of the 10 items and dividing that number by 10 (=number of items). In addition, individual domain scores were calculated. The total CCQ score and each of the 3 domain scores range from 0 (very good health status) to 6 (extremely poor health status). CCQ data was collected for all subjects at baseline and EOT visits. The mean CCQ total and domain scores at both baseline and 26 weeks (EOT) are presented along with the mean change from baseline at EOT or week 26. A positive change indicates worsening symptoms and a higher value is indicative of a poorer health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Total and Domain Weekly CCQ Scores Over Each 2-Month Study Interval for the Intervention Group.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to EOT (6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The CCQ is a 10-item measure of a subject's COPD symptoms, divided into 3 domains (Symptoms: Items 1, 2, 5 and 6; Functional State: Items 7, 8, 9, and 10; and Mental State: Items 3 and 4). Individual items within the CCQ were equally weighted. The total score was calculated by adding the scores of the 10 items and dividing that number by 10 (=number of items). Individual domain scores were also calculated. The total CCQ score and each of the 3 domain scores range from 0 (very good health status) to 6 (extremely poor health status). Subjects in the intervention group took the CCQ weekly throughout the study. The 26-week treatment period was broken down into 3, 2-month intervals: Interval 1: from study day 1 to study day 63 (inclusive), Interval 2: study day 64 to study day 126 (inclusive), Interval 3: study day 127 to EOT (inclusive). The last week of each 2-month interval was used to represent that interval and results are presented for the total CCQ score and the 3 domain scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Number of Adherent Sets of Puffs Per Day for Each 2-Month Study Interval.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to EOT (6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of adherent sets of Symbicort puffs per day was calculated for each subject, for each of the 3, 2-month study intervals. Interval 1: from study day 1 to study day 63 (inclusive); Interval 2: study day 64 to study day 126 (inclusive); Interval 3: study day 127 to EOT (inclusive). A set is 2 puffs taken on the same calendar day, with the 2 puffs taken within 60 minutes of each other. The mean number of sets of Symbicort puffs per day was determined only for the days during device time on study for each subject.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Number of Adherent Days Over the 26-Week Study Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to EOT (6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of adherent days was defined as the number of treatment days a subject took 2 sets of 2 puffs of Symbicort and the inhalations in a puff set were within 60 minutes of each other. Subjects who did not take exactly 2 sets of 2 puffs on any given day throughout their device time on study were considered non-adherent for that day. The total number of adherent days for each subject was counted over the 26 week treatment period and the mean number of adherent days per group is presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Number of Symbicort Prescription Refills at Pharmacy Over the 26-Week Study Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to EOT (6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of Symbicort prescriptions filled at a pharmacy during the 26-week treatment period was counted per subject. The mean number of Symbicort 30-day prescription refills per subject was then calculated and presented per group.</description>

          -  Patients who have been randomized in a clinical study and received an investigational
             product within 30 days of Visit 1 (participation is defined as the completion of a
             treatment related visit).

          -  Current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Known history of drug or alcohol abuse which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             interfere with subject's ability to participate or comply with the study.

          -  An acute exacerbation of COPD that required hospitalization or emergency room visit or
             treatment with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics during the 28 days before Visit 1.
             Patients who had a COPD exacerbation within 28 days of Visit 1 can be re-screened
             once. Re-screening can occur no earlier than 28 days from the last dose of systemic
             steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalization, whichever is later.

          -  Enrolled patients that have a COPD exacerbation during the run-in period, defined as
             worsening symptoms which in the judgment of the Investigator requires treatment with
             systemic steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalization. Patients who had a COPD
             exacerbation during the run-in period can be re-screened once. Re-screening can occur
             no earlier than 28 days from the last dose of systemic steroid and/or antibiotics
             and/or hospitalization, whichever is later.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were recruited into 8 study sites in the United States from August 2016 to October 2017. The study evaluated the impact of medication reminders on adherence to Symbicort pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) using a BreatheMate bluetooth device that monitored daily Symbicort inhaler use.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects who entered the study already on a stable dose of Symbicort were enrolled and randomized at Visit 1 followed by a 26-week treatment period. Subjects who converted to Symbicort were enrolled at Visit 1 and entered a 25-day run-in period after which they were randomized at Visit 2, followed by a 26-week treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Control Group</title>
          <description>All subjects took Symbicort pMDI budesonide/formoterol, 160/4.5 micrograms (mcg) x 2 actuations twice daily (BID), for oral inhalation from day 1 (baseline) of the treatment phase.
Subjects randomized to the control group received Symbicort pMDI and a BreatheMate bluetooth monitoring device that monitored daily Symbicort inhaler use, as well as a study-supplied cellular phone that paired with the BreatheMate device to transmit data regarding Symbicort usage. Subjects in the control group did not receive any reminders to take their Symbicort or any feedback regarding medication compliance.</description>

        <title>Mean Number of Adherent Sets of Symbicort Puffs Per Day Over the 26-Week Study Period</title>
        <description>The mean number of adherent sets of Symbicort puffs per day for each group, over an average of 26 weeks was calculated. An adherent set of puffs was defined as exactly 2 sets of 2 Symbicort puffs per day. The 2 puffs that constitute a set must have been taken within 60 minutes of each other. A mean of 2.00 sets would be equal to 100% adherence (2 sets of 2 puffs). Subjects who did not take exactly 2 sets of 2 puffs on any given day throughout their device time on study were considered non-adherent for that day.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline to end of treatment (EOT), (6 months).</time_frame>
        <population>The FAS consisted of screened subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 inhalation of Symbicort during the treatment phase of the study.</population>

Subjects randomized to the control group received Symbicort pMDI and a BreatheMate bluetooth monitoring device that monitored daily Symbicort inhaler use, as well as a study-supplied cellular phone that paired with the BreatheMate device to transmit data regarding Symbicort usage. Subjects in the control group did not receive any reminders to take their Symbicort or any feedback regarding medication compliance.</description>

        <title>Mean Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) Scores at Baseline, EOT, and Mean Change in Score Over the 26-Week Study Period.</title>
        <description>The CCQ is a 10-item measure of a subject's COPD symptoms, divided into 3 domains (Symptoms: Items 1, 2, 5 and 6; Functional State: Items 7, 8, 9, and 10; and Mental State: Items 3 and 4). Individual items within the CCQ were equally weighted. The total score was calculated by adding the scores of the 10 items and dividing that number by 10 (=number of items). In addition, individual domain scores were calculated. The total CCQ score and each of the 3 domain scores range from 0 (very good health status) to 6 (extremely poor health status). CCQ data was collected for all subjects at baseline and EOT visits. The mean CCQ total and domain scores at both baseline and 26 weeks (EOT) are presented along with the mean change from baseline at EOT or week 26. A positive change indicates worsening symptoms and a higher value is indicative of a poorer health status.</description>

        <title>Mean Total and Domain Weekly CCQ Scores Over Each 2-Month Study Interval for the Intervention Group.</title>
        <description>The CCQ is a 10-item measure of a subject's COPD symptoms, divided into 3 domains (Symptoms: Items 1, 2, 5 and 6; Functional State: Items 7, 8, 9, and 10; and Mental State: Items 3 and 4). Individual items within the CCQ were equally weighted. The total score was calculated by adding the scores of the 10 items and dividing that number by 10 (=number of items). Individual domain scores were also calculated. The total CCQ score and each of the 3 domain scores range from 0 (very good health status) to 6 (extremely poor health status). Subjects in the intervention group took the CCQ weekly throughout the study. The 26-week treatment period was broken down into 3, 2-month intervals: Interval 1: from study day 1 to study day 63 (inclusive), Interval 2: study day 64 to study day 126 (inclusive), Interval 3: study day 127 to EOT (inclusive). The last week of each 2-month interval was used to represent that interval and results are presented for the total CCQ score and the 3 domain scores.</description>

        <population>The FAS consisted of screened subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 inhalation of Symbicort during the treatment phase of the study. Only subjects with CCQ results available for analysis are presented.</population>

            <description>All subjects took Symbicort pMDI, budesonide/formoterol, 160/4.5 mcg x 2 actuations BID, for oral inhalation from day 1 (baseline) of the treatment phase.
Subjects randomized to the intervention group received Symbicort pMDI, a BreatheMate bluetooth monitoring device that monitored daily Symbicort inhaler use, as well as a study-supplied cellular phone that paired with the BreatheMate device to transmit data regarding Symbicort usage. Subjects in the intervention group also received audio-visual daily reminders (beeps and flashes) to take their Symbicort on the BreatheMate Bluetooth monitoring device, and medication reminders from the cellular phone application.</description>

        <title>Mean Number of Adherent Sets of Puffs Per Day for Each 2-Month Study Interval.</title>
        <description>The mean number of adherent sets of Symbicort puffs per day was calculated for each subject, for each of the 3, 2-month study intervals. Interval 1: from study day 1 to study day 63 (inclusive); Interval 2: study day 64 to study day 126 (inclusive); Interval 3: study day 127 to EOT (inclusive). A set is 2 puffs taken on the same calendar day, with the 2 puffs taken within 60 minutes of each other. The mean number of sets of Symbicort puffs per day was determined only for the days during device time on study for each subject.</description>
