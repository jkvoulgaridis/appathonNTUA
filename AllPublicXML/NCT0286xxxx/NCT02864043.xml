      The NvisionVLE® Dysplasia Detection Pilot Study is a prospective, non-randomized trial for
      participants who have a prior biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of BE with dysplasia and are
      scheduled to have an endoscopic evaluation of your esophagus for BE surveillance by a
      standard procedure called EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) as well as an imaging procedure
      called VLE (volumetric laser endomicroscopy).

      The NvisionVLE® Dysplasia Detection Pilot Study is a collection of data for research.
      Participation is completely voluntary and does not affect the patient's medical care that
      chooses not to participate. The purpose of this Study is to determine the performance of the
      NvisionVLE® Imaging System in determining features of dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus (BE).
      This is done by the collection and analysis of the medical record information, imaging data,
      and pathology results. The information is then stored and may be used at a later time for
      various future analyses and publications. Any future analyses involving this Study will only
      use the information collected in this Study. No further involvement or additional informed
      consent of participants will be needed if future analyses are performed.

      This Study is designed for participants who have a prior biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of BE
      with dysplasia and are scheduled to have an endoscopic evaluation of your esophagus for BE
      surveillance by a standard procedure called EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) as well as an
      imaging procedure called VLE (volumetric laser endomicroscopy).

      The NvisionVLE® Imaging System is cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA).

      Patients who undergo an endoscopic evaluation of the esophagus with the NvisionVLE® Imaging
      System at participating hospitals will be invited to participate in this Study. The Study is
      taking place at up to 4 hospitals, and as many as 100 patients may participate in this Study.
