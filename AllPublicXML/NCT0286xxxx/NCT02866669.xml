  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central objective of this proposal is to rigorously compare two strategies designed to
      improve BP control in primary care practices serving rural Southeastern African Americans
      with low socioeconomic status (SES) living in the &quot;Black Belt&quot;.

      In year 1, we're engaging community members (community members who have experience being
      community peer advisors or have high blood pressure) to develop the study interventions and
      protocols. In years 2-5, the investigators will test the interventions.

      Year 2-5, Aim 3: Enroll 80 practices and 25 African American patients with uncontrolled HTN
      at each practice (total n=2000) in a cluster-randomized, controlled, 4-arm pragmatic
      implementation trial to evaluate the three multi- component, multi-level functional
      interventions finalized in the UH2 phase compared with enhanced usual care.

      The study's 4 arms are:

        1. Enhanced Usual Care: Practices are provided with educational materials and tools to
           enhance patient care

        2. Peer Coaching: Patients enrolled in these practices will be matched with a peer coach.
           The peer coach helps the patient to set goals around self-management, including
           medications, home monitoring, and diet and exercise, and she helps the patient to
           strategize how to accomplish the goals, using motivational interviewing techniques

        3. Practice Facilitation: Practices randomized to this arm will work with a practice
           facilitator. Practice facilitation is a highly customized, staged approach to helping a
           practice to implement process and structural changes to enhance the quality of care and
           improve patient and staff satisfaction

        4. Peer coaching and practice facilitation: Practices randomized to this arm will receive
           both the peer coach intervention and the practice facilitation intervention. Practice
           facilitators and peer coaches will receive the same training for this hybrid
           intervention, but the practice facilitator change packet will add examples of activities
           that integrate peer coaches.
