    <textblock>
      Newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) with complete or partial surgical resection, CMV
      seropositive patients will be eligible to enroll on this trial. Patients will be enrolled
      following standard of care chemoradiation and prior to initiation of post-radiation cycles of
      temozolomide (TMZ) provided they meet all eligibility criteria. Eligible patients will
      receive a tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccination. Patients will then be randomized to one of two
      arms of the study: Arm 1 will received standard TMZ and Arm 2 will receive dose-intensified
      TMZ. All patients will receive a pre-conditioning injection of tetanus on day 22 of the first
      post-radiation cycle of TMZ. The following day, patients will receive the first of 3
      intradermal (i.d.) injections of the study drug cytomegalovirus peptide (PEP-CMV), which
      contains what is referred to as Component A. Vaccines #2 and #3 will be given at 2 week
      intervals. Patients who are MGMT (O[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) unmethylated will
      receive one adjuvant cycle of the TMZ regimen according to their assigned randomized arm.
      Patients who are MGMT methylated or whose methylation status is inconclusive will continue
      with up to 12 cycles of TMZ. After the completion of a patient's last TMZ cycle, vaccines
      will continue every 4-6 weeks for a maximum number of 20 vaccines (unless tumor progression
      occurs).

      Patients may be enrolled following radiation therapy and prior to initiation of
      post-radiation therapy cycles of adjuvant TMZ provided they meet all eligibility criteria.
      After signing main consent, patients will undergo immune monitoring blood work and
      Tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccination with 0.5 mL of Td (tetanus, diphtheria toxoid,
      adsorbed). After meeting all eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of two
      arms:

        -  Arm 1 will receive standard TMZ (150-200 mg/m^2/day on days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle)
           with vaccination on Day 23 (-1 day, + 2 days) of each TMZ cycle

        -  Arm 2 will receive dose-intensified TMZ (75-100 mg/m^2/day on days 1-21 of each 28-day
           cycle) with vaccination on day 23 (-1 day, +2 days) of each TMZ cycle.

      Each arm will have 18 patients. For both arms, the patients must be screened at Duke within 3
      +/- 1 weeks after completion of standard of care radiation. For both arms, the initial cycle
      of adjuvant TMZ will begin as soon as possible following randomization. For Arm 1, the
      adjuvant TMZ cycle(s) will be given as described above. If a patient has an MGMT unmethylated
      tumor, they will discontinue TMZ after the 1st cycle.

      All patients will receive a tetanus pre-conditioning injection in the right groin on day 22
      (+1 day) of cycle 1 of adjuvant TMZ. On the following day, patients will receive the study
      vaccine prepared as follows: 500 µg of PEP-CMV Component A mixed with Montanide ISA-51
      intradermally administered with half in the right groin and half in the left groin. Vaccines
      #2 and #3 will be given at 2 week intervals (+ 3 days), which will result in a ~35-day delay
      before starting TMZ cycle 2. MGMT unmethylated patients will not receive subsequent cycles of
      TMZ, but will continue to receive vaccines approximately every 4 (+2) weeks.

      An unacceptable toxicity will be defined as any vaccine-related or any non-neurologic ≥ Grade
      3 toxicity of any duration not attributable to TMZ, bevacizumab, and/or disease progression;
      any Grade 4 toxicity, including neurologic events not due to progressive disease; or any life
      threatening-event not attributable to concomitant medication, co-morbid event, or disease
      progression. Although not considered an unacceptable toxicity, any patient with ≥ Grade 2
      urticaria will not receive further vaccines, will be withdrawn from the study, and will be
      replaced if less than 3 vaccines have been administered without unacceptable toxicity. The
      prevalence of unacceptable toxicities occurring during the vaccinations administered
      concurrently with temozolomide will be continuously monitored. If more than 25% of accrued
      patients experience unacceptable toxicities, then accrual will be suspended and reported
      toxicity will be carefully reviewed to determine if modifications to the protocol treatment
      should occur. Peptide vaccinations employing Montanide ISA-51 as adjuvants have generally
      been well tolerated in human patients in numerous phase I-III trials.

      Patients will be imaged with contrast-enhanced MRI within 2 weeks (+3 days) after vaccine 3
      and then approximately every 8 weeks. RANO criteria will be used for assessment of
      pseudo-progression, and patients demonstrating definitive progression will be removed from
      study. Blood for immune monitoring will be obtained as well at several time points.
