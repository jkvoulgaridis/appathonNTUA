  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to examine whether there are structural or functional differences in the
      brains of individuals who use cocaine or amphetamines as opposed to control participants who
      have never used cocaine or amphetamines. More specifically, it will allow the investigator to
      see how the brain changes once people get sober and how those changes relate to successful
      recovery. This study will allow the investigator to examine the interaction between
      cocaine/amphetamines and impulsivity (meaning to act on impulse rather than thought). Results
      from this study will inform new biologically-based interventions to compliment existing
      treatment programs, in the hope of leading the field in a new direction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 but no more than 45 years old at the time of consent.

          -  Able to provide written consent and comply with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition or treatment with neurological sequelae (i.e. stroke, tumor,
             loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes, seizures, HIV).

          -  Any contraindications to MRI scanning (i.e. metal implants, pacemakers, etc.).

          -  Intellectual developmental disorder as defined in the DSM-V. Participant may have a
             diagnosis of an Axis I disorder (i.e. anxiety disorders, mood disorders, eating
             disorders, psychotic disorders), but it must be considered stable.

          -  Actively suicidal.

          -  Positive screen for alcohol and/or drugs. Participants who screen positive for drugs
             and/or alcohol may return at a later date to screen for the study again.

          -  Evidence for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

          -  Healthy Controls may never have had any form of substance use disorder other than
             caffeine or nicotine. Nicotine use will be recorded but will not be an exclusion
             criterion.
