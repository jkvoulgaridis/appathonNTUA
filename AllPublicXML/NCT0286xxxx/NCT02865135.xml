  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a therapeutic vaccine, named DPX-E7, as a possible treatment
      for Human Papilloma Virus or HPV related head and neck, cervical or anal cancer (positive for
      HLA-A*02).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II clinical trial. DPX-E7 is a therapeutic vaccine, intended to treat
      HPV-related head and neck, cervical or anal cancer. DPX-E7 is an investigational vaccine and
      the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved DPX-E7 vaccine as a
      treatment for any disease.

      DPX-E7 is being tested in humans for the first time. DPX-E7 is a kind of immunotherapy that
      will make the immune system to elicit an anti-tumor response by generating CD8+ T-cells. CD8+
      T-cells play a very important role in fighting against viral infections

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each patient must be positive for HLA-A*02 and meet all of the following inclusion
             criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven HPVOC or cervical cancer or anal cancer, based
             on expression of HPV type16 in immunohistochemistry and/or HPV 16 DNA analysis by ISH
             of tumor tissue from the primary or metastatic lesions.

          -  Incurable HPVOC, as defined by:

               -  Relapsed or progressive disease at the primary site and/or regional lymph nodes
                  after initial treatment (e.g. Surgery, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) with no
                  potentially curative option (i.e. surgery or radiation); OR

               -  Distant metastasis

          -  Incurable cervical or anal cancer, as defined by:

               -  Relapsed or progressive disease at the primary site and/or regional lymph nodes
                  after initial treatment (e.g. systemic chemotherapy) with no potentially curative
                  option (i.e. surgery or chemoradiotherapy). Chemotherapy administered in
                  conjunction with primary radiation as a radiosensitizer will not be counted as a
                  systemic chemotherapy regimen; OR

               -  Distant metastasis refractory to initial treatment (at least one prior
                  chemotherapeutic regimen which can include a single chemotherapeutic, a
                  combination of chemotherapeutics, or biologic drugs such as bevacizumab).

          -  Inaccessible tumor or lack of consent for sequential biopsies

          -  Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases (i.e. known CNS lesions that are
             radiographically unstable, symptomatic and/or requiring escalating doses of
             corticosteroids);

          -  Active hepatitis, known HIV, or other condition that requires immunosuppressive
             therapy, including current use of high dose systemic corticosteroids;

          -  Autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosis or rheumatoid arthritis, that
             is active and requires current immunosuppressive therapy;
