  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, randomized controlled study is to ascertain whether the
      perioperative use of the FloTrac device to guide fluid and vasopressor management during
      esophagectomy improves patient outcomes. The primary outcome is cardiopulmonary
      complications; however, the secondary outcome of decreasing patient morbidity (acute renal
      injury, anastomotic leak, and overall length of both ICU (intensive care unit) and hospital
      stay.
