  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vast evidence supports use of physical exercise and cognitive stimulation for lowering risk
      for cognitive decline and dementia, with combinations of non-pharmacological interventions
      providing greatest promise for impacting cognitive aging. This, paired with limited cognitive
      benefits from pharmacological interventions in dementia, has shifted focus to
      non-pharmacological interventions administered earlier in the disease course. This
      application, therefore, proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT; 12-week active
      intervention, 3- and 6-month follow-up) comparing 3 conditions: walking program (guided
      progressive increases in weekly step counts), computer-based cognitive training program
      (Brain HQ, Posit Science), and combination of the exercise and cognitive program, on
      cognitive, functional, and diagnostic outcomes in 60 sedentary, community-dwelling adults
      with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

    <measure>Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT) is an ecologically valid assessment of cognitive functioning that tests some skills specifically trained in the CT condition (e.g., name learning, and story learning) but also additional untrained skills such as prospective memory. Belongings subtest scaled scores: Minimum score = 1, Maximum score = 19; higher values represent better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Everyday Cognition Scale (ECog) assesses (via informant report) everyday cognitive functioning in memory, language, visuospatial, and executive functioning domains. Average total score was used: Minimum = 1, Maximum = 4, higher scores indicate greater impairment</description>

    <measure>Older Peoples Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self report assessment of quality of life specific to older adults. Assessment covers life overall, health, social relationships and participation, independence, control over life and freedom, home and neighborhood, psychological and emotional well-being, financial circumstances, leisure/activities, and culture and religion. Total score minimum = 35, max = 175; lower scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The walking intervention will begin following baseline assessments and will be continued for 12 weeks. Participants will be given a pedometer to use daily and log their daily steps, with an identified goal of increasing step counts by 3000 steps a day over the course of the intervention. After obtaining a week long baseline step count, individuals in the intervention group will progressively increase their step counts by 100 steps daily each week for the first three weeks, by 200 steps daily for weeks four through six, by 300 steps daily for weeks seven through nine, and by 400 steps daily for weeks ten through twelve. Mean baseline step counts for sedentary older adults in our pilot work were 4150 per day; therefore, most participants will almost double their daily activity by the end of the intervention.</description>

    <description>In the CT condition, participants will use Brain HQ, a computer cognitive training program (Posit Science Corporation, San Francisco, CA), shown to be well tolerated by older adults with positive short- and long-term cognitive outcomes. Participants will use the program 60 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks. If participants do not have a home computer/internet access, they can complete the modules at another location such as a public library, senior center, or at the MARC, but training will still be self-directed.</description>

        <title>Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test</title>
        <description>The Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT) is an ecologically valid assessment of cognitive functioning that tests some skills specifically trained in the CT condition (e.g., name learning, and story learning) but also additional untrained skills such as prospective memory. Belongings subtest scaled scores: Minimum score = 1, Maximum score = 19; higher values represent better performance.</description>

            <description>Walking Intervention: The walking intervention will begin following baseline assessments and will be continued for 12 weeks. Participants will be given a pedometer to use daily and log their daily steps, with an identified goal of increasing step counts by 3000 steps a day over the course of the intervention. After obtaining a week long baseline step count, individuals in the intervention group will progressively increase their step counts by 100 steps daily each week for the first three weeks, by 200 steps daily for weeks four through six, by 300 steps daily for weeks seven through nine, and by 400 steps daily for weeks ten through twelve. Mean baseline step counts for sedentary older adults in our pilot work were 4150 per day; therefore, most participants will almost double their daily activity by the end of the intervention.</description>
