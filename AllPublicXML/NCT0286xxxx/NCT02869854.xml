      In a pilot study 90 physically inactive patients will be randomized to three different
      intervention groups; mindfulness training, mindfulness training and Physical Activity on
      Prescription (PAP) or only PAP Follow-up will be done at baseline, three and six months with
      questionnaires, accelerometers and analysis of traditional risk factors to evaluate whether
      mindfulness may increase physical activity and decrease physical inactivity.

      All patients between 40 and 65 years of age who fulfills the inclusion criteria will be asked
      to participate in the study. Posters with information about the study will be put in the
      waiting room and on other strategic places. Patients who accept to participate will get both
      written and orally information, after the information they will sign a informed consent. The
      patients will estimate their level of physical activity in minutes per week to control
      inclusion criteria. The patients will return a morning for fasting blood samples and get an
      accelerometer attached to them to wear during 7 days. During this time randomization will be
      preformed. They will also get to answer a couple of different surveys. The results from the
      surveys and blood samples will be the study baseline.

      All patients with abnormal test results will follow specific flow diagram for the usual care.
