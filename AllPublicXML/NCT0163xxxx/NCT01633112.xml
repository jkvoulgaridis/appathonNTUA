  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that at least one dose (0.5 mg followed by 0.25
      mg) of fingolimod is superior to glatiramer acetate 20 mg SC in reducing the ARR up to 12
      months in patients with relapsing-remitting MS

    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomized, rater- and dose-blinded, study to compare the efficacy
      and safety of 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg of fingolimod with glatimer acetate 20 mg s.c. in patients
      with RRMS.

      This study consisted of 3 periods:

        -  Screening Period: up to 45 days for all patients

        -  Treatment Period: 12 months of glatiramer acetate 20 mg, fingolimod 0.25 mg, or
           fingolimod 0.5 mg

        -  Follow-up occurred 3 months (12 weeks) after the last dose of study drug for all
           patients The informed consent form was signed prior to any study related activities at
           the screening visit. Randomization to either treatment group was preformed at visit 1
           after a diligent check of applicable in- and exclusion criteria in a 1:1:1 ratio
           (changed to 5:3:2 after implementation of Amendment 2 in 2015).

      Treatment groups:

        -  fingolimod 0.5 mg/day orally for up to 12 months

        -  fingolimod 0.25 mg/day orally for up to 12 months

        -  glatiramer acetate 20 mg/day subcutaneously for up to 12 months

    <description>Annualized relapse rate (ARR) was defined as the average number of confirmed relapses per year (i.e., the total number of confirmed relapses divided by the total days in the study multiplied by 365.25). The number of relapses included all the confirmed relapses experienced during the study from first dose to end of study.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs) were collected during treatment exposure and follow up where: AE summaries on the follow-up set were conducted for time periods defined by days relative to study drug discontinuation: days 1 – 45 after discontinuation, or day 46 or later after drug discontinuation. For SAEs (death and non-fatal ), all SAEs starting after the first dose date, including those starting &gt; 45 days after study drug discontinuation, were included in the safety set summaries.</time_frame>
