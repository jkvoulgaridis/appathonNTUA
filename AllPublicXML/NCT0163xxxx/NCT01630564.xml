      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of donor cord blood T-cells after
      stem cell transplant in treating patients with relapsed hematological malignancies. After
      umbilical cord blood transplant, stem cells are collected from the donor's cord blood and
      stored. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells
      that were destroyed by treatment. Removing the T cells and treating them in the laboratory
      before infusing them in the patient may also help boost the patient's immune system.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of infusion of ex vivo expanded
      cord blood T cells (CLI), in cord blood (CB) transplant recipients with relapsed
      hematological malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete remission rate and overall response as a result of CLI infusion.

      II. To determine the effect of CLI infusion on the chimerism. III. To evaluate the incidence
      rate and grade of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after CLI infusion.

      IV. To determine the disease-free survival, cytopenia rate, relapse incidence after CLI
      infusion.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ex vivo-expanded T-cells.

      Patients undergo ex vivo-expanded umbilical cord blood progenitor cell donor T cell infusion
      with aldesleukin 11-14 days after T-cell co-stimulation begins.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.
