    <textblock>
      This will be a systematic investigation of the role of walnuts in preventing or slowing age
      related cognitive decline and age related macular degeneration. 700 subjects will be
      recruited between 2 sites, Loma Linda University in California, USA and Hospital Clinic in
      Barcelona, Spain. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the walnut group or the
      control group for a 2 year intervention. Baseline and annual data will be collected and
      analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies suggest that nutrients such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid,
      antioxidants and B-vitamins may protect against age related cognitive decline. Small human
      studies have shown beneficial effects of polyphenol rich foods on cognition and age related
      macular degeneration. Walnuts are a rich source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid,
      alpha-linolenic acid, antioxidants, polyphenols and other bioactive compounds. A 2-year
      intervention will be conducted with healthy, elderly subjects to investigate the role of
      walnuts in preventing or slowing age related cognitive decline and age related macular
      degeneration.

      350 subjects, age 63 to 79 years, will be recruited at each of 2 sites, Loma Linda University
      in California and Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. Participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of two groups: walnut group (habitual diet with 1 or 2 oz/d walnut supplement) or control
      group (habitual diet only). At baseline and yearly, cardiometabolic risk factors, red blood
      cell membrane fatty acids, urinary polyphenols and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidation
      will be measured. Eye exam, blood pressure and cognitive function tests will be measured at
      the beginning and end of 2 years. At the Barcelona site only, participants will be given a
      brain MRI and carotid ultrasound.

      Descriptive results will be reported as mean plus/minus standard deviation. Primary analysis
      will be carried out on the basis of groups as randomly assigned. Results will be presented as
      appropriate effect sizes with a measure of precision (95% CI). Analysis of covariates gender,
      age, educational status will be conducted.

    <measure>Changes from baseline in global cognitive composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The composite score will be calculated using the scores from the tests listed below. We will calculate the standardized scores of each test as the score of each participant minus the group mean and divide by its standard deviation. The composite score is the mean of the standardized scores.
The 12 tests are: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF), Semantic Fluency (Animals), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP), Block Design section from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), Trail Making Test (TMT), FAS Word Fluency, Stroop Color Word Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SMDT) Digit Span from the WAIS-III and Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT-II).</description>
