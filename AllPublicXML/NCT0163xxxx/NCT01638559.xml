  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of immunosuppression withdrawal
      (ISW) in pediatric liver transplant (tx) recipients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-rejection medicines, also known as immunosuppressive drugs, are prescribed to organ
      transplant recipients to prevent rejection of the new organ. Long-term use of these medicines
      places transplant recipients at higher risk of serious infections and certain types of
      cancer.

      This study seeks to:

        -  Find out if it is safe to slowly reduce and then completely stop the immunosuppression
           taken by children who have received liver transplants. This process is called
           'immunosuppression withdrawal'or ISW.

        -  Find blood or liver biopsy tests that can help transplant doctors in the future to
           predict if it is safe to decrease or stop immunosuppression drugs in children who have
           had a liver transplant.

    <measure>Number and Severity of Biopsies Read as Histologic Acute Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from immunosuppression withdrawal through a minimum of 36 months and maximum of 48 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Number of biopsies that were diagnosed as histologic acute rejection in participants who initiated immunosuppression withdrawal by severity of rejection episode. Rejection severity (mild, moderate, severe) is based on the Banff global assessment grade according to the central pathology reading of the liver biopsy. Mild severity criteria: rejection infiltrate in a minority of triads that is generally mild and confined within the portal spaces. Moderate rejection criteria: rejection infiltrate expanding most or all of the triads. Severe rejection criteria: rejection infiltrate expanding most or all of the triads with spillover into periportal areas and moderate to severe perivenular inflammation that extends into the hepatic parenchyma and is associated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis.
BPAR: biopsy-proven acute rejection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Severity of Acute Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from immunosuppression withdrawal through a minimum of 36 months and maximum of 48 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical severity of acute rejection was descriptively analyzed using hierarchical categories, as follows:
Dose increase: Increase in IS dose and/or frequency but to a level less than the regimen at study entry, prior to initiating ISW
Reinstitution: Returning to the regimen at study entry, prior to ISW
Intensification: Increased IS dose compared with the dose at study entry, prior to ISW
Conversion: Change to different IS drug
Addition: Initiation of a second IS drug;
Corticosteroids: Administration of any intravenous or oral corticosteroids
Antibody (Ab) treatment: Administration of any rabbit thymoglobulin; usually with corticosteroids</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of Immunosuppression Withdrawal (ISW) on Allograft Histology</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from screening biopsy to end of study (month 48) biopsy</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of ISW on allograft fibrosis using the Ishak scoring system to measure the change in fibrosis from the screening liver biopsy to the end-of-study (month-48) liver biopsy.
In the Ishak histologic scoring system, the higher the score/stage, the more fibrosis: Scores range from 0 to 6, with 6 representing the most fibrosis: 0=No fibrosis; 1=Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa; 2=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa; 3=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with occasional portal to portal bridging; 4=Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (portal to portal) as well as portal to central; 5=Marked bridging (portal to portal and/or portal to central) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis); and 6=Cirrhosis, probable or definite.
Decrease in score from screening (baseline) indicates improvement</description>

    <time_frame>Time from immunosuppression withdrawal through a minimum of 36 months and maximum of 48 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change of immunosuppression (IS) dose from baseline to end of study for all participants not deemed tolerant by the trial definition either due to discontinuing IS withdrawal or completing withdrawal but not meeting the criteria for tolerance on the primary endpoint biopsy assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Child Health Related Quality of Life Scores Between Tolerant and Non-tolerant Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from immunosuppression withdrawal through a minimum of 36 months and maximum of 48 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life was measured by the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core scale, the Multidimensional Fatigue scale, and the PedsQL 3.0 Transplant module. Change was calculated as the difference between the questionnaire completed at the initiation of withdrawal and at month 36 for the total generic score, the total fatigue score, and total transplant score. This change was calculated separately for tolerant and non-tolerant subjects. Each score ranges from 0-100, with a higher score indicating a better quality of life.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>161 participants were enrolled (11 sites in the US,1 site in Canada) between August 2012 and April 2014. N=88 of the enrolled participants were eligible to initiate immunosuppression withdrawal (ISW) and the remaining N=73 participants were terminated (e.g., ineligible to proceed with ISW) based on biopsy findings or other pre-specified criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Informed consent was obtained from eligible individuals who then underwent a study-mandated biopsy to determine if they were eligible to initiate immunosuppression withdrawal, based on pre-specified histologic and other criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Number of biopsies that were diagnosed as histologic acute rejection in participants who initiated immunosuppression withdrawal by severity of rejection episode. Rejection severity (mild, moderate, severe) is based on the Banff global assessment grade according to the central pathology reading of the liver biopsy. Mild severity criteria: rejection infiltrate in a minority of triads that is generally mild and confined within the portal spaces. Moderate rejection criteria: rejection infiltrate expanding most or all of the triads. Severe rejection criteria: rejection infiltrate expanding most or all of the triads with spillover into periportal areas and moderate to severe perivenular inflammation that extends into the hepatic parenchyma and is associated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis.

        <description>The impact of ISW on allograft fibrosis using the Ishak scoring system to measure the change in fibrosis from the screening liver biopsy to the end-of-study (month-48) liver biopsy.
In the Ishak histologic scoring system, the higher the score/stage, the more fibrosis: Scores range from 0 to 6, with 6 representing the most fibrosis: 0=No fibrosis; 1=Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa; 2=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa; 3=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with occasional portal to portal bridging; 4=Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (portal to portal) as well as portal to central; 5=Marked bridging (portal to portal and/or portal to central) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis); and 6=Cirrhosis, probable or definite.
Decrease in score from screening (baseline) indicates improvement</description>

In the Ishak histologic scoring system, the higher the score/stage, the more fibrosis: Scores range from 0 to 6, with 6 representing the most fibrosis: 0=No fibrosis; 1=Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa; 2=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa; 3=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with occasional portal to portal bridging; 4=Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (portal to portal) as well as portal to central; 5=Marked bridging (portal to portal and/or portal to central) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis); and 6=Cirrhosis, probable or definite.
Decrease in score from screening (baseline) indicates improvement</description>
