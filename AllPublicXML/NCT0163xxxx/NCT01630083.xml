  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to assess the therapeutic effects and the safety profile of
      IMAB362 combined with EOX (epirubicin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine) as first-line treatment for
      patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach, the esophagus or the gastroesophageal
      junction compared to EOX alone.

      Furthermore, sufficient binding of IMAB362 to the target cells is necessary for antitumoral
      activity. Thus, two dose levels ensuring a serum level above the in vitro predicted clinical
      efficacy threshold will be investigated.

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of disease progression (based on central reading) or death from any cause (as assessed by the independent reviewer).

    <measure>Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 94</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the fraction of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (as assessed by the investigator reviewer). CR according to RECIST v1.1 is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph node must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm, disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level should occur as well as no simultaneous appearance of new lesions. PR according to RECIST v1.1 is defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the screening sum longest diameter and no simultaneous increase in the size of any lesion or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 94</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the fraction of participants with CR or PR or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 (as assessed by the investigator reviewer). SD according to RECIST v1.1 is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started, measurements must meet the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval not less than 6 weeks, no simultaneous increase in the size of any lesion or the appearance of new lesions should occur, evaluable lesions must remain stable or regress for this category.</description>

    <description>DOR will be determined as the time when criteria for CR or PR are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death occurs (as assessed by the independent reviewer).</description>

Prior to administration, zolbetuximab will be reconstituted with 1.1 mL (22 mg zolbetuximab vials) or 5.0 mL (105 mg zolbetuximab vials) water for injection, which will result in a concentration of 20 mg/mL zolbetuximab. The extractable volume per vial will be 1 mL (for 22 mg zolbetuximab vials) or 5 mL (for 105 mg zolbetuximab vials).
