  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to see if antiretroviral therapy (ART) is safe and works at
      getting rid of malaria in blood and to see whether one type of ART is better than another.
      This study may offer information for further research in looking at whether ART plays a role
      in the prevention and treatment of malaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A5297 was a Phase I/II, open-label, proof of concept, two-step, two-arm, randomized
      controlled clinical trial (RCT) to test the superiority of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (nNRTI)-based ART for
      clearance of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) subclinical parasitemia (SCP).

      The study consisted of two steps. At study Step 1 entry, participants were randomized 1:1 to
      either LPV/r-based ART or nNRTI-based ART for 15 days. In study Step 2, all participants
      received nNRTI-based ART and TMP/SMX prophylaxis for 15 days. The total study duration was 30
      days.

      Study visits occurred every 3 days in Step 1, and every 5 days in Step 2. At each study
      visit, 2 samples were taken for measurement of parasite density, except day 15 and day 30 at
      which 3 samples were taken.

      Adverse events which occurred after randomization were also recorded. Signs/symptoms and
      diagnoses were evaluated at each visit, while safety labs (including Hemoglobin, hematocrit,
      white blood cell count (WBC), differential WBC, platelet count, and absolute neutrophil count
      (ANC), glucose, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate), total bilirubin, AST
      (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine) were taken at day 15 and
      day 30, or if indicated at other study visits.

    <time_frame>Day 15 (3 samples collected, separated by at least 5 hours and all three collected within 24-hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Pf SCP clearance defined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) &lt; 10 parasites/µL on three consecutive occasions within a 24-hour period.
If a participant had missing data on day 15, they were considered as not having clearance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Pf SCP Clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>From study entry up to day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Time to clearance is defined by time to first measurement with PCR &lt; 10 parasites/µL, and is evaluated as the point estimate and 95% CI for the day when 50% of participants cleared parasite.</description>

    <measure>Log10(Pf Parasite Density)</measure>
    <time_frame>Entry, days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30</time_frame>
    <description>Pf parasite density was determined by PCR. If parasite density equals 0, the value is set to 0.01 before log10 transformation. The value 0.01 was chosen based on the smallest observed parasite density value of 0.017.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in log10(Pf Parasite Density) From Entry to Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Entry, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Change is evaluated as log10(Pf parasite density) at day 30 minus log10(Pf parasite density) at entry.
Change is evaluated in four groups:
Randomized to nNRTI‐based ART with continued Pf SCP at day 15
Randomized to nNRTI‐based ART with clearance of Pf SCP at day 15
Randomized to LPV/r‐based ART with continued Pf SCP at day 15
Randomized to LPV/r‐based ART with clearance of Pf SCP at day 15</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Uncomplicated Clinical Malaria</measure>
    <time_frame>From study entry to day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Uncomplicated clinical malaria is defined as the presence of non-severe fever/symptoms and parasitemia without organ complication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Detectable Pf Gametocyte Density</measure>
    <time_frame>Entry, days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with detectable Pf gametocyte density as determined by PCR. Due to the large number of undetectable results, this outcome was measured as dichotomous.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in log10(Pf Gametocyte Density) From Entry to Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Entry, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Change in log10(Pf gametocyte density) as evaluated using a Hodges-Lehmann estimate from entry to day 30 is evaluated in two groups:
Randomized to nNRTI‐based ART with continued Pf SCP at day 15
Randomized to LPV/r‐based ART with continued Pf SCP at day 15
Analysis was not conducted in either group with clearance at day 15 due to the small sample size and high number of undetectable samples in both clearance groups at entry and day 30.</description>
