    <textblock>
      Study participants receive stable standard therapy for lupus in addition to receiving either
      placebo (no active medicine) or belimumab. The controlled period of the study is 52 weeks.
      The random assignment in this study is &quot;2 to 1&quot; which means that for every 3 participants, 2
      will receive belimumab and 1 will receive placebo. Participants who successfully complete the
      52-week study may enter into a 6-month open-label extension. All participants in the
      open-label extension receive belimumab plus standard therapy.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 40 through Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Average (avg.) daily prednisone (PRED.) dose was calculated taking into account all steroids taken intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermally and orally for both Systemic Lupus Erythema (SLE) and non-SLE reasons. A responder was defined as having a PRED. reduction [REDN.] by &gt;=25% from Baseline to &lt;=7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52. Drop-outs and Treatment failures were imputed as having no REDN. in PRED. (if Baseline PRED. &gt;7.5 mg/day). At Baseline, the avg. daily prednisone dose [PD] was the sum of all PDs over 7 consecutive days [excluding Day 0], divided (DIV.) by 7. For analysis, the avg. PD was the total PD during Weeks 40 through 52 DIV. by the number of days during Weeks 40 through 52. Analysis was performed using a logistic regression model with covariates treatment group, Baseline PD, Baseline SS-S2K score, (&lt;=9 vs &gt;=10), Baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and region (US/Canada vs. Rest of World).</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of belimumab compared with placebo in adult participants with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). This was a multicenter study conducted at United States (88 centers), United Kingdom (6), South Africa (5), France (4), Columbia (6) and Brazil (18).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 503 participants were randomized of which 496 received at-least one dose of study medication during double-blinded phase (7 participants were randomized but not treated as they were randomized in error). A total of 359 out of 373 participants who completed double-blinded phase opted to continue optional open-label (OL) extension phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>SRI response is defined as &gt;=4 point reduction, from Baseline in safety of estrogen in Lupus National Assessment(SELENA)SLEDAI[SS] score (with modified SLEDAI-2K scoring for proteinuria [PU]), no worsening (increase of &lt;0.30 points from Baseline) in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) and no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group of SLE clinics(BILAG)A organ domain score [ODS] or 2 new BILAG B ODS compared with Baseline. Drop-outs and treatment failures were set to non-responders. Analysis performed using a logistic regression model for comparison between belimumab and placebo with covariates treatment group, Baseline SS score (with modified SLEDAI-2K scoring for PU) (&lt;=9 versus [vs.] &gt;=10), Baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and region (United States [US]/Canada vs. Rest of World). The Modified Intention-To-Treat (mITT) population comprised of safety population excluding participants who had any assessment at 3 sites (202196, 202513 or 107286).</description>

          <description>SRI response is defined as &gt;=4 point reduction, from Baseline in safety of estrogen in Lupus National Assessment(SELENA)SLEDAI[SS] score (with modified SLEDAI-2K scoring for proteinuria [PU]), no worsening (increase of &lt;0.30 points from Baseline) in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) and no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group of SLE clinics(BILAG)A organ domain score [ODS] or 2 new BILAG B ODS compared with Baseline. Drop-outs and treatment failures were set to non-responders. Analysis performed using a logistic regression model for comparison between belimumab and placebo with covariates treatment group, Baseline SS score (with modified SLEDAI-2K scoring for PU) (&lt;=9 versus [vs.] &gt;=10), Baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and region (United States [US]/Canada vs. Rest of World). The Modified Intention-To-Treat (mITT) population comprised of safety population excluding participants who had any assessment at 3 sites (202196, 202513 or 107286).</description>
          <population>mITT Population. One participant in the mITT population Belimumab 10 mg/kg arm did not have a screening or Baseline PGA assessment; therefore, this participant did not contribute to the SRI/component analysis.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Toxicity Grade of 3 or 4 for Clinical Chemistry Parameters [OL Phase]</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of liver function and other chemistry parameters. The parameters assessed were alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and urate. Grading was assigned as mild (Grade 1), moderate (grade 2), severe (Grade 3) and potentially life-threatening (Grade 4) according to DMID AE Severity Grading. Number of participants with worst toxicity Grade of 3 or 4 for liver function and other chemistry parameters have been presented. For Safety, participants that completed DB and OL phase, an additional 8 weeks follow-up was conducted (Week 84).</description>

        <description>Time to first severe SLE flare is defined as the number of days from treatment start date until the participant met an event (event date - treatment start date +1). Analyses of severe SLE flare was performed on modified SS SLE flare index that excludes severe flares (SF) that were triggered only by an increase in SS score to &gt;12 (this may only represent a modest increase in disease activity). Treatment failures were imputed as SF. For participants who died, data were censored at date of death if no SF occurred before death. Only post-Baseline SF were considered. Analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards model for the comparison between belimumab and placebo adjusting for Baseline SS-S2K score (&lt;=9 vs. &gt;=10), baseline complement levels (at least 1 C3/C4 low vs. no C3/C4 low), and region (US/Canada vs. Rest of World). Median and inter-Quartile range (1st and 3rd Quartiles) have been presented.</description>

        <description>Average (avg.) daily prednisone (PRED.) dose was calculated taking into account all steroids taken intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermally and orally for both Systemic Lupus Erythema (SLE) and non-SLE reasons. A responder was defined as having a PRED. reduction [REDN.] by &gt;=25% from Baseline to &lt;=7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52. Drop-outs and Treatment failures were imputed as having no REDN. in PRED. (if Baseline PRED. &gt;7.5 mg/day). At Baseline, the avg. daily prednisone dose [PD] was the sum of all PDs over 7 consecutive days [excluding Day 0], divided (DIV.) by 7. For analysis, the avg. PD was the total PD during Weeks 40 through 52 DIV. by the number of days during Weeks 40 through 52. Analysis was performed using a logistic regression model with covariates treatment group, Baseline PD, Baseline SS-S2K score, (&lt;=9 vs &gt;=10), Baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and region (US/Canada vs. Rest of World).</description>

          <description>Average (avg.) daily prednisone (PRED.) dose was calculated taking into account all steroids taken intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermally and orally for both Systemic Lupus Erythema (SLE) and non-SLE reasons. A responder was defined as having a PRED. reduction [REDN.] by &gt;=25% from Baseline to &lt;=7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52. Drop-outs and Treatment failures were imputed as having no REDN. in PRED. (if Baseline PRED. &gt;7.5 mg/day). At Baseline, the avg. daily prednisone dose [PD] was the sum of all PDs over 7 consecutive days [excluding Day 0], divided (DIV.) by 7. For analysis, the avg. PD was the total PD during Weeks 40 through 52 DIV. by the number of days during Weeks 40 through 52. Analysis was performed using a logistic regression model with covariates treatment group, Baseline PD, Baseline SS-S2K score, (&lt;=9 vs &gt;=10), Baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and region (US/Canada vs. Rest of World).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of liver function and other chemistry parameters up to 52 Weeks. The parameters assessed were ALT, AST, GGT, albumin, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Grading was assigned as mild (Grade 1), moderate (grade 2), severe (Grade 3) and potentially life threatening according to DMID AE Severity Grading. Only those participants with worst toxicity Grade of 3 or 4 for other chemistry parameters have been presented.</description>
