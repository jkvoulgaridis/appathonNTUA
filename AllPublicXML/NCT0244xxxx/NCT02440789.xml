  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to find out about the safety of sirolimus in individuals with
      HIV infection who were also being treated with ART. The investigators wanted to learn whether
      sirolimus decreases inflammation and immune activation in the body; whether sirolimus changes
      the level of HIV in the participants' blood; and how sirolimus interacts with ART in the
      blood. Sirolimus is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent organ
      rejection in patients aged 13 years and older receiving kidney transplants. Sirolimus had
      also been used for the prevention of complications after stem cell transplants and as a
      treatment for certain kinds of cancers in HIV-infected patients.

      The study was conducted with an initial lead-in period of 12 weeks where participants
      remained on ART, without study intervention. Samples were collected to define the
      pre-intervention steady-state of HIV, inflammation and immune activation parameters.

      At week 12, sirolimus therapy was initiated for the planned 20 weeks of treatment. In order
      to achieve therapeutic levels, sirolimus therapy was initiated with lead-in dose of 0.025 or
      0.05 mg/kg/day, depending on the ART regimen. Doses for each participant were then adjusted,
      based on trough blood sirolimus concentrations, to achieve target concentrations between 5
      and 10 ng/mL. There were frequent initial visits for sirolimus trough concentration
      monitoring and potential dose adjustments, at weeks 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5 and
      16. Then visits occurred at weeks 18, 20, 24, 28 and 32. After the week 32 visit, the planned
      end of study treatment, there was an additional 12 weeks of post-sirolimus follow-up, with a
      final visit at week 44.

      Study visits included physical examinations, clinical assessments, safety monitoring, and
      blood and oral swab collection. Anal swabs were collected at week 12 and 32. Samples were
      stored for subsequent protocol testing for the study outcomes.

      In the primary analysis, the significance level was 0.05 for all analyses.

    <description>The study-defined primary safety endpoint was a composite endpoint. A participant was considered to have met the endpoint if the participant 1) experienced a new Grade ≥3 Adverse Event (AE), including signs/symptoms, lab toxicity or clinical event, that was definitely, probably or possibly related to study treatment, as judged by the core team, or 2) had a change in CD4+ cell count ( confirmed &gt;50% decline or to &lt;300 cells/mm3) while on sirolimus. The screening visit occurred within 60 days of study entry.</description>

        <description>The study-defined primary safety endpoint was a composite endpoint. A participant was considered to have met the endpoint if the participant 1) experienced a new Grade ≥3 Adverse Event (AE), including signs/symptoms, lab toxicity or clinical event, that was definitely, probably or possibly related to study treatment, as judged by the core team, or 2) had a change in CD4+ cell count ( confirmed &gt;50% decline or to &lt;300 cells/mm3) while on sirolimus. The screening visit occurred within 60 days of study entry.</description>
