    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well rituximab and pembrolizumab with or without lenalidomide
      works in treating patients with follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that
      has returned after a period of improvement. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      rituximab and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      rutuximab with pembrolizumab and lenalidomide may work better at treating follicular lymphoma
      and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) in subjects with relapsed follicular lymphoma
      (FL) treated with rituximab plus pembrolizumab.

      II. To determine the ORR in subjects with relapsed/refractory FL and relapsed/refractory
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have failed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell
      therapy and are treated with rituximab in combination with pembrolizumab and lenalidomide.
      (Cohort 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and toxicity. II. To determine the complete response rate (CRR).
      III. To determine the overall progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To compare PFS between
      patients relapsing =&lt; one year vs &gt; one year after last prior therapy.

      V. To determine the overall survival (OS). VI. To determine the safety and toxicity. (Cohort
      2) VII. To determine the CRR. (Cohort 2) VIII. To determine the overall PFS. (Cohort 2) IX.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over 4-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV over 1 hour on day 2 every 3 weeks for up to 16
      cycles (1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-8 hours on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and
      day 1 of cycle 2. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV over 1 hour on day 2 every 3 weeks
      for up to 2 years, and lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-14 every 3 weeks for up to 12
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
