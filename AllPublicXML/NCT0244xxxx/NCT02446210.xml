  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long‐term goal is to acquire scientific knowledge that can be used to develop
      mechanistic-driven intervention strategies aiming at restoring upper and lower-limb motor
      function in individuals with cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). The proposed
      project will examine cortical, corticospinal, and spinal contribution to bilateral hand and
      arm muscle activity during bilateral movements and spinal contributions to lower limb muscle
      activity. By comparing changes in different sites within the Central Nervous System (CNS),
      the investigators may also identify key mechanisms that might be differentially affected by
      the injury, plasticity, and training.

      If the participant qualifies to take part in this research study, they will be asked to
      participate in 15-190 study visits,to complete the experimental procedures. These procedures
      have been broken up into &quot;Phases&quot; and will be completed in any order. Phase I and Phase IIa
      includes 2-30 total visits - approximately 2-3 hours each to measure arm and finger strength
      and ability to move. Phase IIb includes 2-30 total visits - approximately 2-3 hours each, to
      measure leg strength and ability to move. Phase IIIa includes up to 40 total visits -
      approximately 2 hours each, the investigator will again evaluate the participant's ability to
      use both arms. The participant will be asked to complete a series of tasks such as stacking
      checkers, turning over cards, squeeze a device to determine how strong their grip is, and see
      how well they are able to feel sensations on the surface of their skin. The investigators
      will complete these assessments at pre-determined times during the study participation. Phase
      IIIb includes up to 40 total visits - approximately 2 hours each, the investigator will again
      evaluate the participant's ability to use both legs. Assessments of the participant's legs
      will include walking around the lab space, how well they can bend their ankles and hips, and
      how well they are able to feel sensations on the surface of the participant's skin.
