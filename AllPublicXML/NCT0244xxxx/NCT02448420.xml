  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PATRICIA is a phase II, open-label, multicentre, Simon's two-stage-design study of the
      combination of palbociclib plus trastuzumab, with or without letrozole, in post-menopausal
      patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have
      received chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab for their metastatic disease. Cohorts A,
      B1, and B2 based on their HR status and treatment allocation were planned.

      Cohort A included patients with hormone receptor-negative, HER2 positive breast cancer, who
      received trastuzumab + palbociclib.

      Cohort B1 included patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who
      received trastuzumab + palbociclib.

      Cohort B2 included patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who
      received trastuzumab + palbociclib + letrozole.

      The aim of the PATRICIA study is to test the hypothesis that the addition of Palbociclib to
      standard therapy is well tolerated and can provide a benefit in progression-free survival.

      Based on interim results from this trial that support the benefit of CDK4 / 6 inhibition in
      luminal disease, two additional cohorts will be included.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the amendment of PATRICIA study, two additional cohorts will be included:

        -  Cohort C1: will include patients with OR+, HER2 positive, Luminal intrinsic subtype
           determined by PAM50 who will receive trastuzumab + palbociclib + endocrine therapy (ET)

        -  Cohort C2: will include patients with OR+, HER2 positive, Luminal intrinsic subtype
           determined by PAM50 who will receive treatment of physician's choice.

      When the recruitment of those cohorts C begins, the recruitment in cohorts A and B will be
      closed.

      For cohorts C, an adaptive design will be applied to compare arms of treatment in patients
      with Luminal subtype locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

      All patients in those cohorts will have histologically- confirmed HR+/HER2-positive and
      PAM50-confirmed Luminal intrinsic subtype breast adenocarcinoma, and must have received at
      least 1 (and no more than 4) previous lines of anti-HER2 regimens for locally advanced
      disease or MBC (including prior treatment with a taxane, trastuzumab and Antibody-Drug
      conjugate).

      Stratification factors will include number of previous regimens for advanced breast cancer
      (one and two vs three and four) and presence of visceral disease (yes vs no).

      Treatment in all cohorts will be administered until progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      patient consent withdrawal, or death 516 patients will be screened and a total of 232
      patients will be included. The inclusion period will be divided in two phases. During phase I
      it is planned to include 60 patients in 24 months; considering early stopping rule according
      to SF rate. During phase II, the trial will continue until the final evaluable number of
      patients are included.

    <description>The FACT-B consists of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) (27-items) and a breast-specific module: a 10-item instrument designed to assess patient concernsrelating to BC. The FACT-G is a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into 4 domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. Patients are asked to respond to a Likert scale where 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D is designed to assess health status in terms of a single index value or utility score. It contains 5 descriptors of current health state (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression) with each dimension having 5 levels of function (1=no problem, 2=slight problem, 3=moderate problem, 4=severe problem, and 5=unable/extreme). The scores on the 5 descriptors are summarized to create a single summary score. The EQ-5D also includes a visual analog scale (VAS), in which the patients self-rate their overall health status on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable).</description>

         15. If female of childbearing potential, must have a negative result of serum pregnancy
             test performed within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.

         16. Participants with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided they meet
             all of the following criteria:

               -  Disease outside the CNS is present.

               -  No evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy
                  and the screening radiographic study.

               -  No history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage.

               -  Stable doses or no need of corticosteroids and anti-convulsants for symptomatic
                  control

               -  Minimum of 3 weeks between completion of CNS radiotherapy and Cycle 1 Day 1 of
                  study treatment; and recovery from any significant (Grade ≥ 3) acute toxicity

        Exclusion criteria

        For cohorts A, B and C

          1. Treatment with any investigational anticancer drug within 14 days of the start of
             study treatment.

          2. Patient has received more than 4 previous lines of treatment (anti-HER2 drug +/-
             chemotherapy) for metastatic breast cancer or locally advanced disease. Exclusively

          3. Previous treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.

          4. History of other malignant tumours in the past 5 years, with the exception of
             adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, non-melanoma carcinoma of the
             skin, uterine cancer in stage I or other malignant tumours with an expected curative
             outcome.

          5. Radiation therapy for metastases outside the brain carried out in the 21 days prior to
             inclusion in the study and/or patients who have received radiation to &gt; 30% of the
             bone marrow.

          6. Symptomatic hypercalcemia requiring treatment with bisphosphonates in the 21 days
             prior to inclusion in the study. Biphosphonates will be permitted for the prevention
             of bone events.

          7. History of exposure to cumulative anthracycline doses greater than follows:

               1. Adriamycin &gt; 400 mg/m2

               2. Epirubicin &gt; 720 mg/m2

               3. Mitoxantrone &gt; 120 mg/m2

               4. Idarubicin &gt; 90 mg/m2

               5. If another anthracycline or more than one anthracycline has been used, the
                  cumulative dose must not exceed the equivalent of 400 mg/m2 of adriamycin.

          8. Cardiopulmonary dysfunction, defined as:

               1. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg)
                  despite optimum medical treatment.

               2. Angina pectoris or arrhythmia poorly controlled with optimum medical treatment.

               3. History of congestive heart failure NCI CTCAE version 4.0 grade ≥ 3 NYHA class ≥
                  2.

               4. History of LVEF decrease to &lt; 40% or symptomatic congestive heart failure during
                  prior treatment with trastuzumab.

               5. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomisation.

               6. Resting dyspnoea due to complications of the malignant disease, requiring
                  continuous oxygen therapy.

          9. Any other severe, uncontrolled disease (pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, or
             haematological disorder, wound healing disorders, ulcers, bone fractures, infectious
             processes).

         10. Major surgery in the 28 days prior to randomisation or foreseeable during study
             treatment period.

         14. Inability, in the opinion of the investigator, to comply with the protocol
             requirements or any comorbidity that might hinder study follow-up, response evaluation
             or the informed consent process.
