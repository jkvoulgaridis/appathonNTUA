    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open label study of the efficacy of
      AVAPS-AE to prevent re-hospitalization in hospitalized patients with comorbid COPD.
      Hospitalized patients with comorbid COPD who are at high risk for readmission will be
      recruited. Specifically patients with comorbid COPD who are to be discharged with (a)
      admission diagnosis of COPD (GOLD stage II or greater); AND (b) either a prior non-elective
      hospitalization (one in the past 12 months) OR active smoker. Such participants will undergo
      questionnaire-based screening for sleep-disordered breathing (STOP-BANG questionnaire) and if
      they have a high risk for Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) (&gt; 3 points) will undergo an
      overnight portable sleep study for screening prior to hospital discharge (AHI &gt; 10 per hour;
      &gt;3% oxygen desaturation for hypopneas).

      After randomization and prior to discharge, participants will either be initiated on AVAPS-AE
      therapy (intervention arm) for 60 days or will be referred to the sleep center for further
      diagnostic testing and therapy initiation (standard of care arm). Participants will complete
      quality of life questionnaires Functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire (FOSQ) at baseline
      (in-person), and in 30 and 60 days (by mail) post discharge. Information regarding hospital
      admission, diagnostic tests, medication changes, and procedures will be collected from all
      participants. Discharge summaries of re-hospitalizations and office or ER visits, as well as
      diagnostics tests and therapies received will be collected for measuring healthcare costs.

      Participants will have an option to enroll in a registry for a 3 year follow-up and will also
      be queried on a yearly basis regarding hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, and
      assessment of vital statistics in the National Death Index registry. The study will conclude
      when all randomized participants have been followed for a minimum of 60 days.

The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is a set of quality of life measures. Scoring for this is a two step process, scores are converted to answers of zero to 100. Those scores are than averaged based upon category so that the lowest possible score is zero and highest possible score is 100. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (FOSQ) at 30 and 60 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>30 and 60 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>FOSQ is a quality of life questionnaire for sleep disorders. It's a 30 question survey with 5 subgroups: general productivity (8 questions), social outcome (2 questions),activity level (9 questions), vigilance (7 questions) and intimate relationships &amp; sexual activity (4 questions).
Scores are provided on a 0 to 4 scale:
0- I don't do this activity for other reasons or missing response
1- Yes, extreme difficulty 4- no difficulty The average score was calculated based upon average sub-scores. The total score was, calculated using the mean of the subscale scores and multiplying the mean by the number of subscales. The range of scores for the total score is 5-20. The measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on activities of everyday living and the extent to which these abilities are improved by effective treatment. The lower the score the more difficulty a person has carrying out certain activities because they are too sleepy or tired.</description>

The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is a set of quality of life measures. Scoring for this is a two step process, scores are converted to answers of zero to 100. Those scores are than averaged based upon category so that the lowest possible score is zero and highest possible score is 100. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life (FOSQ) at 30 and 60 Days</title>
        <description>FOSQ is a quality of life questionnaire for sleep disorders. It's a 30 question survey with 5 subgroups: general productivity (8 questions), social outcome (2 questions),activity level (9 questions), vigilance (7 questions) and intimate relationships &amp; sexual activity (4 questions).
Scores are provided on a 0 to 4 scale:
0- I don't do this activity for other reasons or missing response
1- Yes, extreme difficulty 4- no difficulty The average score was calculated based upon average sub-scores. The total score was, calculated using the mean of the subscale scores and multiplying the mean by the number of subscales. The range of scores for the total score is 5-20. The measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on activities of everyday living and the extent to which these abilities are improved by effective treatment. The lower the score the more difficulty a person has carrying out certain activities because they are too sleepy or tired.</description>

            <title>AVAPS-AE Non-invasive Ventilation Therapy</title>
            <description>Participants will be initiated on AVAPS-AE therapy (intervention arm) for 60 days. AVAPS-AE is a mode of therapy (Philips Respironics Inc, Monroeville, Pa) with potential advantages over the currently established modes of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (CPAP and bilevel therapy). This mode of therapy incorporates AVAPS (automated adjustable IPAP setting to maintain target ventilation with a settable rate of change), Auto EPAP and Auto Back up Rate.
AVAPS-AE Non-invasive ventilation therapy: Participants will use the device greater than or equal to 4hrs per night for the 60 days after discharge.</description>
