  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1b, open label, multi center, multi-dose trial designed to estimate the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended dose for phase 2 (RP2D)
      investigations of PF- 05082566 in combination with KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. Once the MTD of PF-05082566 administered in combination with KW-0761
      is estimated (dose finding), one or more expansion cohorts of patients with selected advanced
      solid tumors (dose-expansion ) will be enrolled to further characterize the combination in
      term of safety profile, anti tumor activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      biomarkers modulation.

  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated due to marginal efficacy and change in sponsor prioritization. The
    combination had a manageable safety profile.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a product or medical device without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions); resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment. AEs were graded by the investigator according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03 (Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE).

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities)</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a product or medical device without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions); resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment. AEs were graded by the investigator according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03 (Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE).

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a product or medical device has a causal relationship with PF-05082566. SAEs were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions); resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment. AEs were graded by the investigator according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03 (Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE). AEs included non-serious AEs and SAEs.</description>

        <description>TTR was defined, for participants with an OR, as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of OR (CR or PR), which was subsequently confirmed. irTTR was defined, for participants with an irOR, as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of irOR (irCR or irPR) which was subsequently confirmed. CR: Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease; PR: Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions.</description>
