      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when
      given together with stereotactic body radiation therapy or non-stereotactic wide-field
      radiation therapy (conventional radiation therapy) and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special
      equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This
      method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to
      normal tissue. Giving pembrolizumab together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of intravenous MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)
      administered in combination with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) targeting 1-4
      liver or thoracic lesion(s) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      (Phase I) II. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of intravenous MK-3475 administered
      in combination with non-stereotactic wide-field radiation therapy (WFRT) targeting 1-4 liver
      or thoracic lesion(s) in patients with metastatic NSCLC. (Phase I) III. To determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MK-3475 and SBRT
      combination therapy. (Phase I) IV. To determine the MTD and DLTs of MK-3475 and WFRT
      combination therapy. (Phase I) V. To determine the rate of out-of-field objective responses
      (either complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) of the non-irradiated disease sites.
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of radiation therapy (XRT) to MK-3475 can improve the
      progression free survival (PFS) rate compared to MK-3475 alone. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab followed by a phase II
      study.

      PHASE I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion of size and location amenable to SBRT receive
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive SBRT in 4
      fractions daily on days 2-5 or either intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), proton
      beam radiation therapy (PBRT), or 3 dimensional conformation radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in 15
      fractions total concurrent with pembrolizumab administration on days 1-19. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion of size or location not amenable to SBRT, but
      amenable to WFRT receive pembrolizumab as in Group I and either IMRT, PBRT, or 3D-CRT in 15
      fractions total concurrent with pembrolizumab administration.

      PHASE II: Patients for whom SBRT is recommended are randomized to Group 1 or 2, patients for
      whom conventional radiation therapy is recommended are randomized to Group 3 or 4, and
      patients with lesions amenable to SBRT or WFRT are assigned to Group 5.

      GROUP I: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion with size and location amenable to SBRT receive
      pembrolizumab IV on day 1 and SBRT on days 44-47 or IMRT, PBT, or 3D-CRT on days 43-61.
      Treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion with size and location amenable to SBRT receive
      pembrolizumab IV as in Group I without XRT. At the first planned efficacy evaluation (5
      weeks), patients exhibiting progressive disease (PD) are treated with SBRT concurrent with
      the remaining cycles of pembrolizumab. In the event that lesion size has progressed to the
      point where the attending physician no longer considers SBRT safe, then the patient will be
      salvaged with IMRT, PBRT, or 3D-CRT and analyzed as part of the fourth treatment group.

      GROUP III: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion with size and location not amenable to SBRT,
      but amenable to WFRT receive pembrolizumab IV as in Group I and IMRT, PBRT, or 3D-CRT on days
      43-61.

      GROUP IV: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion with size and location not amenable to SBRT, but
      amenable to WFRT receive pembrolizumab IV as in Group I without XRT. The decision on when to
      start XRT will be assessed first at week 5 (after the second dose of pembrolizumab). If a
      patient has PD based on immune response related criteria (irRC) then XRT will be delivered
      after the third dose of pembrolizumab, while patients with stable disease (SD) or PR will not
      start XRT and will continue to be followed. These patients will then have follow up computed
      tomography (CT) scans 5 weeks after course 3 three and then approximately every 3 months for
      the remainder of the trial; any patient at this point with PD will then have XRT delivered
      with the sixth dose of pembrolizumab.

      GROUP V: Patients with lesions amenable to SBRT or WFRT receive pembrolizumab IV as in Group
      I. Patients also receive either IMRT, PBRT, or 3D-CRT in 15 fractions to the primary lesions
      and low dose radiation therapy to other lesions on days 43-61 or SBRT in 4 fractions to
      primary lesions and low dose radiation therapy to other lesions on days 44-47.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.

             unirradiated

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent (except glutamine) or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment; unless the steroid therapy is for physiological replacement

          -  Has a diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other autoimmune disease which by the
             opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy

          -  Has had prior radiation therapy to all available thoracic and liver lesions such that
             additional radiation therapy is unsafe by the opinion of the treating radiation
             oncologist

          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, which ever is
             shorter, prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy within 2 weeks prior to
             study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse
             events due to a previously administered agent

               -  Note: Subjects with =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and

             resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule; subjects that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study; subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy or hospital admission

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

             [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA]
             [qualitative] is detected)

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment

          -  Symptomatic brain metastasis

          -  Has experienced a dose limiting toxicity on treatment with either prior radiation or
             anti programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
             inhibitor therapy
