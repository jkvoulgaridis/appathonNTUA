    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the biological effects of abemaciclib in combination
      with anastrozole and compare those to the effects of abemaciclib alone and anastrozole alone
      in the tumors of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline to 2 Weeks in Ki67 Expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor tissue collected through a core biopsy at baseline and at the end of cycle 1 was used to determine Ki67 expression. Ki67 expression is defined as the percent of cells staining positive by validated central assay.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pathologic Complete Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Start of Treatment Up to 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>pCR is defined as absence of invasive cancer in the breast and sampled regional lymph nodes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR): Clinical Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From Start of Treatment to Objective Progression or Start of New Anticancer Therapy (Up to 16 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical objective response is defined as the percentage of participants with the best overall response rate (ORR) with a best OR of CR or PR, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1. ORR is recorded from the start of the study treatment until the earliest of objective progression or start of new anticancer therapy. A responder depends on target and non-target disease and the appearance of new lesions. CR is defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. All lymph nodes are non-pathological or normal in size (&lt;10mm short axis). Progressive disease (PD) is a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, a relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 5 mm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Radiologic Response or Partial Radiological Response: Radiological Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From Start of Treatment to Objective Progression or Start of New Anticancer Therapy (Up to 16 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Radiological response is the percentage of participants with CR or, PR according to RECIST v.1.1. A responder is defined as any participant who exhibits a CR or PR. CR is the disappearance of all target lesions. PR is a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD is 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum and the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 2 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 was a self-administered questionnaire with multidimensional scales that measures 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, or social functioning), global health status and symptom scales of fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, or financial difficulties. A linear transformation is applied to standardize the raw scores to range between 0 and 100 per developer guidelines. For functional domains and global health status, higher scores represent a better level of functioning. For symptoms scales, higher scores represented a greater degree of symptoms.</description>

        <description>Clinical objective response is defined as the percentage of participants with the best overall response rate (ORR) with a best OR of CR or PR, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1. ORR is recorded from the start of the study treatment until the earliest of objective progression or start of new anticancer therapy. A responder depends on target and non-target disease and the appearance of new lesions. CR is defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. All lymph nodes are non-pathological or normal in size (&lt;10mm short axis). Progressive disease (PD) is a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, a relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 5 mm.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 2 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 was a self-administered questionnaire with multidimensional scales that measures 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, or social functioning), global health status and symptom scales of fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, or financial difficulties. A linear transformation is applied to standardize the raw scores to range between 0 and 100 per developer guidelines. For functional domains and global health status, higher scores represent a better level of functioning. For symptoms scales, higher scores represented a greater degree of symptoms.</description>
