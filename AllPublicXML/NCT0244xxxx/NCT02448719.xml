  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability profile of TAK-792
      when administered as a single oral dose in healthy Japanese and Caucasian male participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be double-blind and placebo-controlled to avoid subjective bias in the
      assessment of safety and tolerability of TAK-792. Sentinel dosing will be used in the first
      cohort (cohort 1) to ensure adequate safety and tolerability evaluation prior to
      administering TAK-792 to the remainder of participants within the cohort. The dose escalation
      to the next cohort for Cohorts 2 to 6 will occur after full review of safety and tolerability
      of the current cohort, and available pharmacokinetic data up to 24 hours in the preceding
      cohorts. The planned dose levels are 30, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1250 mg, to be administered
      in the morning after a fast of at least 10 hours.

The GSRS a 15-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of GI symptoms during the past week on a scale from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort). Possible overall scores range from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life with respect to GI symptoms. TEAEs related to GSRS were reported as follows: Diarrhoea, Constipation, Faeces hard, and Faeces soft.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With TEAE Related to Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)</title>
        <description>The gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (abdominal pain, heartburn, acid regurgitation, hunger pains, nausea, borborygmus, abdominal distension, eructation, increased flatus, constipation, diarrhoea, loose stools, hard stools, urgent need for defecation, and feeling of incomplete evacuation) using GSRS questionnaires at each assessment point. The GSRS a 15-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of GI symptoms during the past week on a scale from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort). Possible overall scores range from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life with respect to GI symptoms. TEAEs related to GSRS were reported as follows: Diarrhoea, Constipation, Faeces hard, and Faeces soft.</description>
