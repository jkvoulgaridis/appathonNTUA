  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization among
      patients randomized on the BMT CTN 1302 protocol, &quot;Multicenter Phase II, Double-blind Placebo
      Controlled Trial of Maintenance Ixazomib after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Transplantation for High Risk Multiple Myeloma&quot;. It is hypothesized that Ixazomib maintenance
      therapy will result in improved PFS in patients with high-risk multiple myeloma following
      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) compared to placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a Phase II, multi-center double-blind trial that randomizes patients
      with high risk Multiple Myeloma to Ixazomib maintenance or placebo 60-120 days after
      allogeneic HSCT. The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare progression
      free survival from randomization as a time to event endpoint between patients randomized to
      Ixazomib maintenance or placebo. Secondary objectives are to describe for each treatment arm:
      rates of grade II-IV and III-IV Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, best disease
      response rates, disease progression, transplant related mortality, overall survival, rates of
      Grade ≥ 3 toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      Version 4.0, incidence of infections, and health-related quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must meet one of the following disease criteria:

             a. Patients with high risk multiple myeloma in partial response (PR) or better with no
             prior progression and are ≤ 24.0 months after autologous HCT (single or planned
             tandem), or are ≤ 24.0 months after initiation of systemic anti-myeloma therapy for
             patients without prior autologous HCT; or

             i. High risk is defined by the presence of any one of the following detected at any
             time prior to enrollment: deletion of chromosome 13 by conventional cytogenetics,
             hypodiploidy, abnormality in chromosome 1(1q amplification or 1p deletion), t(4;14),
             t(14;16), t(14;20) or deletion of 17p by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or
             conventional karyotyping; high risk criteria based on commercially available gene
             expression profiling (GEP)

             b. Patients with high risk multiple myeloma (see criterion 2.a.i. above) in very good
             partial response (VGPR) or better with 1 prior progression which occurred ≤ 24.0
             months after autologous HCT (single or planned tandem), or ≤ 24.0 months after
             initiation of systemic anti-myeloma therapy for patients without prior autologous HCT;
             or

             i. Patients with one prior progression without measurable monoclonal paraprotein at
             the time of disease progression or relapse (&lt; 1.0 g/dl in serum or &lt; 200 mg/24hrs in
             urine) may be considered to have met VGPR criteria if &lt; 5% plasma cells in bone marrow
             and ≥ 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels from
             baseline (time of progression/relapse).

             ii. In patients with IgG kappa MM receiving daratumumab: International Myeloma Working
             Group criteria for VGPR may not be achieved since daratumumab is known to increase the
             IgG kappa spike. In such cases the FLC and marrow may be used to establish VGPR, as
             above, with prior approval from the protocol co-chairs.

             c. Patients with standard risk multiple myeloma in VGPR or better (see criteria 2.b.i.
             and 2.b.ii. above) at the time of enrollment with 1 prior progression ≤ 24.0 months
             from single or planned tandem autologous HCT; or d. Patients with primary plasma cell
             leukemia in VGPR or better with no prior disease progression and are ≤ 18.0 months
             after autologous HCT, or are ≤ 18.0 months after initiation of anti-myeloma therapy
             without prior autologous HCT.

          2. Patients must have a related or unrelated peripheral blood stem cell donor that meet
             one of the following criteria:

               1. A sibling donor who is a 6/6 match at HLA-A and -B (intermediate or higher
                  resolution) and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing) and must be
                  willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet institutional criteria for
                  donation OR

               2. A related donor (other than sibling) who is a 8/8 match for HLA-A, -B, -C (at
                  intermediate or higher resolution) and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based
                  typing) and must be willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet
                  institutional criteria for donation OR

               3. An unrelated donor who is an 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 (at high
                  resolution using DNA-based typing) and must be willing to donate peripheral blood
                  stem cells and meet institutional criteria for donation.

          3. Cardiac function: Ejection fraction &gt; 40%

          4. Estimated creatinine clearance greater than 40 mL/minute (using the Cockcroft-Gault
             formula and actual body weight)

          5. Pulmonary function: Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥ 40%
             (adjusted for hemoglobin) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 50%

          6. Liver function: total bilirubin &lt; 2x the upper limit of normal and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5x the upper normal limit
             (Patients with Gilbert's Disease are permitted to exceed the defined bilirubin value
             of 2x the upper limit of normal, however measurements of direct bilirubin should be
             done to confirm this diagnosis).

          7. Female subjects (unless postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit,
             or surgically sterilized), agree to practice two (2) effective methods of
             contraception at the same time, or agree to practice true abstinence when this is in
             line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (Periodic abstinence [eg,
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception) through 90 days after the last dose of
             maintenance therapy (see Section 2.6.2 for definition of postmenopausal).

          8. Male subjects (even if surgically sterilized) must agree to one of the following:
             practice effective barrier contraception (see Section 2.6.4.1 for list of barrier
             methods), or practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
             usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days after last dose of
             maintenance therapy.

          9. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

         10. Able to comply with the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.
