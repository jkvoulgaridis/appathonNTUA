  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ROHHAD (rapid onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic
      dysregulation) syndrome is a rare pediatric disorder associated with a cancer called
      neuroblastoma and presumed to be driven by an attack of the immune system on specific area in
      the brain. Patients develop severe symptoms and often succumb to this disease. Based on the
      researchers' experience the investigators conduct a clinical trial to study intensive
      immunosuppression with high-dose cyclophosphamide in these patients. In addition to
      describing the symptomatic improvement, the investigators' trial seeks to define objective
      markers of disease activity.

      Baseline evaluation will include:

      Sleep study and pulmonary evaluation Hormone levels Determination of up to 6 key
      ROHHAD-related symptoms to be followed Hyperphagia questionnaire
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)
      scan Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis

      Patients will be treated with cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/kg (ideal body weight)/dose daily for 4
      days, with Mesna and hydration as prophylaxis against hemorrhagic cystitis. Supportive care
      will include mucosal care, transfusions, infection prophylaxis, and empiric treatment for
      febrile neutropenia.

      Composite severity score will be assessed to measure response of key symptoms, and formal
      neuropsychological testing, sleep study, and hormone studies will be performed.
