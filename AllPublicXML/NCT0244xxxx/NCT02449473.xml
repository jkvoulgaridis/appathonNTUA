  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, phase 2
      study to designed evaluate the effect of a 300 mg dose of tralokinumab administered
      subcutaneously every 2 weeks on airway inflammation in adults with asthma inadequately
      controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with or without other controllers. Approximately
      80 subjects will be randomized. Subjects will receive tralokinumab, or placebo, administered
      via subcutaneous injection at the study site, over a 12 week treatment period.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12, Expressed as a Ratio, in Number of Airway Submucosal Eosinophils</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The number of airway submucosal eosinophils per millimetre squared (mm^2) was determined by microscopic evaluation of bronchoscopic biopsies. The ratio of post-randomisation value at Week 12 to baseline value was computed as (Week 12 value / baseline value). The change from baseline to Week 12 (ratio) in the number of airway submucosal eosinophils is presented as geometric mean ± standard deviation (SD) of log values.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12, Expressed as a Ratio, in Number of Blood Eosinophils</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The blood eosinophil count was obtained from the total and differential white blood cell counts. The ratio of post-randomisation value at Week 12 to baseline value was computed as (Week 12 value / baseline value). The change from baseline to Week 12 (ratio) in the number of blood eosinophils is presented as geometric mean ± SD of log values.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12, Expressed as a Ratio, in Number of Differential Sputum Eosinophils</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum induction was performed to obtain satisfactory samples of sputum originating from the airways. The ratio of post-randomisation value at Week 12 to baseline value was computed as (Week 12 value / baseline value). The change from baseline to Week 12 (ratio) in the number of eosinophils in induced sputum is presented as geometric mean ± SD of log values.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ECP concentrations were determined to assess evidence of activation of eosinophils in blood. The ratio of post-randomisation value at Week 12 to baseline value was computed as (Week 12 value / baseline value). The change from baseline to Week 12 (ratio) in blood free ECP concentrations is presented as geometric mean ± SD of log values.</description>
