    <description>Three treatment cycles, each six (6) weeks followed by a two (2) week rest period. Treatment uses 0.25% SGX301 in USP Hydrophilic Ointment (or placebo) applied twice per week followed by fluorescent light therapy.
Cycle 1: Patients randomized 2:1 to active/placebo will have three (3) index lesions treated and evaluated.
Cycle 2: All patients will have three (3) index lesions treated and evaluated with active SGX301 ointment.
Cycle 3: All patients will be given the opportunity to enter an open-label cycle of active SGX301 ointment treatment for all lesions (index and non-index).</description>
