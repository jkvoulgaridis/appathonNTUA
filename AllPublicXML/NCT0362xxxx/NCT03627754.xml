      This is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel group, single dose study to investigate the effect of
      hepatic impairment on the PK of glasdegib after administration of a single oral 100 mg dose.
      Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment will be enrolled, followed by healthy

          9. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the dose of glasdegib (whichever is longer).

         10. Subjects with a history of or current positive results for human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV).

         11. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or laboratory abnormality that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Subjects with Normal Hepatic Function:

        In addition, subjects in the normal hepatic function cohort (Cohort 3) presenting with any
        of the following will not be included in the trial:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies deemed relevant for participation in this
             study, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of
             dosing).

          2. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of

             least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is =&gt; 140 mm Hg (systolic) or =&gt; 90 mm Hg
             (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the three BP
             values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          4. 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at Screening. If
             QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility.

          5. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of lasdegib. As an
             exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of =&lt;1 g/day. Limited use of
             nonprescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case by case basis following
             approval by the sponsor. Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must have
             been discontinued at least 28 days prior to the dose of investigational product.

          6. Subjects with a history of or current positive results for hepatitis B or hepatitis C,
             including hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HepBcAb),
             or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb).

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Subjects With Impaired Hepatic Function:

        In addition, subjects in the hepatic impairment cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2) presenting with
        any of the following will not be included in the trial:

          1. Other clinically significant disease that contraindicates study drug or that may
             affect the PK of glasdegib (stable, chronic, controlled disorders such as hypertension
             and diabetes may be acceptable).

          2. Hepatic carcinoma and hepatorenal syndrome or life expectancy &lt;1 year.

          3. Undergone porta-caval shunt surgery. NOTE: Subjects with a transjugular intrahepatic

             Classification criteria

          4. History of gastrointestinal hemorrhage either due to esophageal varices or peptic
             ulcers less than one month prior to study entry.

          5. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality except for those parameters
             influenced by hepatic impairment. Due to potential for alteration of hepatic function
             in renally impaired patients, subjects must have an estimated glomerular filtration
             rate (eGFR) corrected for their body surface area of =&gt; 75 mL/min based on the
             Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, with a single repeat permitted
             to assess eligibility, if needed.

          6. Presence of clinically active stage 3 or 4 encephalopathy.

          7. Severe uncontrolled ascites and/or pleural effusion.

             mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the
             three BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          9. Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;470 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec.
             If initial QTcF exceeds 470 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated
             two more times and the average of the three QTcF or QRS values should be used to
             determine the subject's eligibility.

         10. Use of food, drugs, or dietary supplements that may affect the PK of glasdegib within
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the dose of glasdegib. Use of
             medications that are not believed to affect subject safety and are medically necessary
             for the treatment and maintenance of hepatic disease and other pre-existing and/or
             concurrent stable comorbid conditions are permitted with approval by the sponsor.
             Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not believed to affect subject
             safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case by case basis
             with approval by the sponsor. Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must
             have been discontinued at least 28 days prior to the dose of investigational product.

         11. Concurrent use of any of the following food or drugs known to inhibit CYP3A4 (consult
             the sponsor if in doubt whether a food or a drug falls into any of the above
             categories) within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the dose of
             glasdegib, until the completion of the last PK sample collection. Use of strong or

             applicable), such as 2% ketoconazole cream, is allowed. All concomitant medications
             must be approved by the sponsor.

         12. Concurrent use of any of the following food or drugs known to induce CYP3A4 (consult
             the sponsor if in doubt whether a food or a drug falls into any of the above
