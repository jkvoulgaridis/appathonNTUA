  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to compare the benefits and risks of tisagenlecleucel to blinatumomab or
      inotuzumab in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. This trial investigates
      tisagenlecleucel as an additional treatment option for this patient population with high
      unmet medical need.

  <why_stopped>
    Novartis is no longer pursuing this study because of planned investigation of novel CAR-T

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase III, open label, multinational, randomized trial. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to Tisagenlecleucel treatment strategy (tisagenlecleucel after optional bridging chemotherapy and lymphodepleting chemotherapy) or control arm treatment strategy (blinatumomab or inotuzumab per investigator's discretion after optional bridging chemotherapy).
The randomization will be performed stratifying for the number of prior salvage therapies (0 vs. 1) and prior allogenic stem cell transplant (yes vs. no).</intervention_model_description>
