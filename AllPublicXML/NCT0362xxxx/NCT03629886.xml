  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to enable all subjects who received placebo in the HPV-039 study
      (NCT00779766), to also receive GSK Biologicals' Human Papillomavirus (Types 16, 18) Vaccine,
      Adsorbed. Safety data in terms of serious adverse events (SAEs), any adverse events
      (AEs)/SAEs leading to premature discontinuation of the study, potential immune mediated
      diseases (pIMDs) and pregnancies (and their outcomes) will be collected during the study
      period.

      In addition, this study will assess the long term protective effect of the vaccine, in an
      exploratory manner, in terms of rates of HPV-related (vaccine type) incident cervical
      infection up to approximately 10 years after vaccination in subjects who participated in
      HPV-039 study (NCT00779766).

    <textblock>
      Treatment allocation depends on the randomization in the previous study i.e. only the
      subjects from the control group of HPV-039 study will receive HPV vaccination in the current
      study. Subjects who previously received the Human Papillomavirus (Types 16, 18) Vaccine,
      Adsorbed in HPV-039 study will not receive vaccination in this study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.
Any is defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE/SAE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>
