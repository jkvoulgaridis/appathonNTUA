    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effectiveness of Prolonged Exposure Therapy on a population of
      individuals with spinal cord injuries. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a
      treatment as usual or Prolonged Exposure therapy group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center estimates 282,000 people in the US live
      with spinal cord injury (SCI), with approximately 17,000 new cases occurring each year. There
      has been tremendous progress in the medical and rehabilitative management of people who have
      sustained SCI including improved clinical outcomes, decreased mortality during the first year
      after injury, and increased life expectancy. However, there has been less innovation to
      support mental health among SCI patients. In addition, most attention has been focused on
      addressing the elevated rate of depression in people with SCI. Much less attention has
      focused on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) despite prevalence estimates suggesting that
      it affects up to 60% of those with SCI compared to only 7% of the general US population.
      Notably, PTSD prevalence estimates among those with SCI are similar to those reported in a
      recent meta-analysis that showed 23% of veterans who served in conflicts in Afghanistan and
      Iraq experienced PTSD. PTSD can be a disabling psychological consequence of surviving SCI,
      impacting one's health and function, including the ability to return to normal activities of
      daily life (e.g., work, school, social relationships). Further, PTSD is one of the most
      costly of all anxiety disorders because of work impairment, hospitalization, and physician
      visits. Fortunately, there are highly effective treatments for PTSD. The most researched and
      effective treatment for PTSD is Prolonged Exposure Therapy. In 12 sessions over 6 weeks, 85%
      of patients with PTSD respond to treatment and the dropout rate is similar to all other
      treatments (20%). Thus far, PE has been tested within survivors of combat, rape, non-sexual
      assault, motor vehicle collisions, natural disasters, males/females, civilians/military, and
      adolescents. However, this treatment has not been tested with this population despite
      evidence that there is no reason to expect it would not be effective. In summary, greater
      attention has focused in recent years on PTSD and developing evidence-based approaches to
      treat it due to the number of veterans returning from conflicts in the Middle East dealing
      with the condition. Despite this increased overall focus on PTSD, and despite the higher
      prevalence of PTSD among people with SCI than among those in the general population, the
      literature lacks studies of PTSD in patients with SCI. Thus, the primary aim of the current
      study (Field Initiated Projects Program - Research HHS-2017-ACL-NIDILRR-IFRE-0192) is to use
      a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of Prolonged Exposure Therapy
      (PE) on PTSD symptoms among SCI patients. First, the investigators expect that individuals
      with SCI who receive the PE intervention for PTSD will show statistically significantly
      greater improvements in PTSD symptoms relative to the treatment as usual (TAU) control group.
      Second, the investigators hypothesize that compared to the TAU control group, those
      randomized to the PE will experience: a) significantly greater reduction in pain, b)
      significantly greater improvement in depression, c) significantly greater improvement in
      sleep, and d) significantly greater improvement in quality of life. Finally, we expect that
      PE will be feasible and acceptable in this population.

    <time_frame>Used to assess change in Posttraumatic Stress entomology at Baseline, 6 week, 10 week, and 32 week about their past two week experiences.</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSI-5 is a 24-item, semi-structured interview that assesses PTSD symptoms in the past two weeks, and makes a diagnostic determination based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria. The interviewer rates participant responses to symptom questions on a 5-point scale of frequency and severity, from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;6 or more times a week/severe&quot;) with a higher total score meaning more Posttraumatic stress symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at Baseline, at every Prolonged Therapy Session, 6 week, 10 week, and 32 week about their past month experiences.</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at Baseline, at every Prolonged Therapy Session, 6 week, 10 week, and 32 week about their past month experiences.</time_frame>
    <description>The Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI) is a 36-item instrument that assesses dysfunctional post-trauma cognitions across self, world, and self-blame to yield a total score. The PCTI is rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Baseline,10 week, and 32 week about their past week experience.</time_frame>
    <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) has been validated as a measure of pain intensity and is one of the most commonly used measures in assessing pain. The NRS asks patients to rate their pain severity on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 being &quot;so severe that you can't stand it.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum for PTSD (PSQI-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Baseline,10 week, and 32 week about their past month experience.</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum for PTSD (PSQI-A), is a 7-item, self-report instrument that assesses the frequency of disruptive nocturnal behaviors, which are often associated with PTSD. Each item is rated on a 0-3 scale referring to frequency of each disturbance, where 0=not in the past month, 1=less than once a week, 2=once or twice a week, and 3=three or more times a week. A global score is obtained from the sum of all seven items, and has a range of 0-21. The PSQI-A includes three additional items regarding the frequency of anxiety and anger accompanying DNB and the timing of these events during the night.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at Baseline,10 week, and 32 week about their past week Past 7 Days experience.</time_frame>
    <description>SCI Quality of Life- Positive Affect &amp; Well-Being - Short Form (SCI-QOL) is a 10- item, self-report measure that assesses participants' positive affect and well-being (e.g., &quot;I thought positively about my future&quot;) in the past 7 days on a Likert scale of 1-5, with 1 representing &quot;never&quot; and 5 representing &quot;always.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at 32 week about their past week Past Month experience.</time_frame>
    <description>The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) is an instrument for assessing positive outcomes reported by persons who have experienced traumatic events. This 21-item scale includes factors of New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Personal Strength, Spiritual Change, and Appreciation of Life. A 6-point Likert response format was used, ranging from &quot;I did not experience this change as a result of my crisis&quot; (scored 0), to &quot;I experienced this change to a very great degree as a result of my crisis&quot; (scored 5). Intermediate scores were given for a very small degree (1), a small degree (2), a moderate degree (3), and a great degree (4).</description>

    <description>Participants in the control arm will not receive the PE therapy, but they will rather receive the standard clinical treatment receive by all SCI patients at BIR. This includes an evaluation by a licensed psychologist and continued follow-up psychotherapy as needed. This therapy does not consist of trauma-focused therapy and will be summarized in the analysis as a part of standard of care. TAU participants will have a posttreatment assessment, as well as follow-up assessments at one and 6 months</description>
