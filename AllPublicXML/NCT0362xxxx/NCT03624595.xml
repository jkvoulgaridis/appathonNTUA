  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acutely occurred and fluctuating cerebral dysfunction characterized with
      inattention, altered consciousness, cognitive decline and/or abnormal perception. It is
      common in the elderly after cardiac surgery and is associated with worse outcomes. Causes
      leading to delirium are multifactorial but sleep disturbances remains an important one. In
      previous studies, sedative-dose dexmedetomidine improves sleep quality in ICU patients with
      mechanical ventilation; and low-dose dexmedetomidine improves sleep quality in postoperative
      patients without mechanical ventilation. In recent studies of elderly after noncardiac
      surgery, night-time infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine reduces delirium and improves 2-year
      survival. The investigators hypothesize that, for elderly patients after cardiac surgery,
      night-time infusion of dexmedetomidine may also improve sleep quality, reduce delirium
      development and improve 2-year survival.

      Delirium is an acutely occurred and fluctuating cerebral dysfunction characterized with
      inattention, altered consciousness, cognitive decline and/or abnormal perception. It is
      common in the elderly after cardiac surgery and is associated with worse outcomes.

      The development of delirium is a consequence of multiple factors. For patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery, surgical stress and/or cardiopulmonary bypass can produce hyper-inflammatory
      and stress response, both of which are important factors leading to delirium. Meanwhile,
      patients in ICU after major surgery often develop sleep disturbances, which are also
      associated with increased risk of delirium.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic and
      anxiolytic properties. In previous studies of elderly patients admitted to ICU after
      non-cardiac surgery, continuous infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine during nighttime
      improves sleep quality, reduces delirium, and improves 2-year survival.

      The investigators hypothesize that, for patients admitted to ICU after cardiac surgery,
      nighttime infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine can decrease the incidence of delirium and
      improve long-term survival. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of
      nighttime infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine on postoperative sleep quality, delirium, and
      2-year survival in elderly patients admitted to ICU after cardiac surgery.
