  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common chronic painful musculoskeletal condition among older
      adults. It poses great challenge to the health care system due to its inability to be cured.
      Understanding factors associated with disease progression in KOA should assist the
      development of novel prevention/rehabilitation strategies. This study investigate factors
      including muscle properties, lower limb alignment and joint loading in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis before and after a six-week exercise program.
