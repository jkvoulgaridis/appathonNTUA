  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for new evidence-based strategies for safe primary and secondary prevention
      for cardiovascular disease (CVD) - the leading cause of death and disability globally.
      Secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has improved during the last
      decades but readmissions and death following AMI remain large health care challenges.
      Hyperlipidemia and inflammation are believed to be critical for new cardiovascular events and
      novel pharmacological treatments for these conditions are prohibitively expensive and
      associated with serious side effects.

      Oats containing beta-glucans have an established cholesterol lowering effect. Moreover,
      Swedish bilberries are rich in a number of polyphenols, and particularly anthocyanins (ACs).
      ACs may have positive effects on lipids and inflammation, and also on exerciser tolerance.
      Berry and oat consumption might therefore be utilized as a new, effective and safe supplement
      for prevention and control of CVD. Accumulating evidence show that ingestion of some types of
      berries is associated with a wide range of beneficial biological effects on cardiovascular
      parameters. However, clinical trials in patients with overt disease including AMI are scarce.
      No previous study has to date evaluated the potential additive or synergistic effects of
      bilberry intake combined with oats.

      We recently published an open-label pilot study (N=50) on the effect of 2 months of bilberry
      supplement after AMI. Our results suggest positive effects on LDL cholesterol and exercise
      capacity. Encouraged by these results we now plan to conduct a multicenter, prospective,
      randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 in a
      three-month intervention period to one of four study arms: 1) bilberry powder/shake (40 g per
      day, equivalent to 480 g fresh berries), 2) a liquid oat shake 3) a combination shake with
      both bilberry and oats, 4) a control group receiving a placebo/reference shake.

      The primary objective is to assess the LDL cholesterol lowering effect of dried bilberry
      supplement, liquid oats or their combination compared with a neutral isocaloric placebo
      reference, initiated within 72 hours of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for AMI. We
      hypothesize that standard medical therapy supplemented with either dried bilberries, liquid
      oats, or a combination of bilberry and oats after AMI will have a more beneficial effect than
      medical therapy alone on cardiovascular risk markers such as LDL cholesterol. Secondary
      objectives are to study the effect on exercise capacity and inflammatory and other
      biomarkers. We will also address to what extent gut microbiota composition and activity
      (addressed by untargeted metabolomics) may explain differences among responders and
      non-responders to the bilberry, oats or their combined intervention.
