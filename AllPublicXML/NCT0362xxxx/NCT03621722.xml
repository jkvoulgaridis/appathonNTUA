  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is comparing the difference between the use of Elequil Aromatabs versus standard of
      care practice treatments on Blood Marrow Transplantation patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to examine whether there are differences in the level of anxiety and
      nausea between patients in the treatment and control groups.

      The secondary objective is to compare the number of as needed (PRN) antiemetics and
      anxiolytics, as well as the duration of prolonged standardized antiemetic and anxiolytic
      regimen for the treatment and control cohorts.

      The sample size of 200 patients is anticipated to be enrolled over a period of 1 year. A
      total of 50 patients will be enrolled in each of the four groups The enrollment procedure
      will begin with a screening of patients who are admitted within 24 hours of admission for
      blood and marrow transplantation conditioning to evaluate if they meet the inclusion
      criteria. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be offered an opportunity to participate
      in the study.

      The patient will complete an informed consent form, then assessed to identify their
      predominant symptom:anxiety or nausea. Based on the patients' primary symptom, they will be
      randomized into either control or treatment group for a total of four groups (nausea
      treatment, nausea control, anxiety treatment, and anxiety control). The study will be using a
      Wei's Urn algorithm for the randomization sequence. The randomization sequence and patient
      information will be stored in a protected SharePoint folder between the 8PE and 8PW nurses
      enrolled with the Institutional Review Board as study staff.

      Patients enrolled in the nausea control/treatment group will be required to complete a
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) form to determine the baseline of anxiety.
