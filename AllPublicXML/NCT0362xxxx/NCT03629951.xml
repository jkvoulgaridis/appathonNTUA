  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify if there are self‐reported/caregiver reported or
      objective measures that can predict near‐term relapse (within 1 month or at another
      identified time point before meeting the criteria for relapse) or early symptomatic changes
      indicative of pre‐relapse.

    <description>Relapse is defined as achieving any of the following: clinically meaningful worsening of symptoms as determined by the treating physician's judgment; involuntary or voluntary admission to a psychiatric hospital for decompensation of the participant's schizophrenic symptoms (psychiatric hospitalization); deliberate self‐injury and/or violent behavior resulting in clinically significant injury to the participant or another person or property damage; suicidal or homicidal ideation and aggressive behavior considered as clinically significant (in frequency and severity) in the treating physician's judgment; an increase of at least 2 points from the lowest reported Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score (ranging from 1 [not ill] to 7 [extremely severe]) captured either at baseline or post baseline. Number of participants with relapse will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants in each Clinical State of Schizophrenia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants in each clinical state (Acute, Stable, and Remission) of schizophrenia will be assessed. The clinical states are defined as: 'Acute' - Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI‐S) score (ranging from 1 [not ill] to 7 [extremely severe]) greater than or equal to (&gt;=)5 anytime during the study; 'Stable' (Tier I) - control of acute symptoms, defined as having a CGI‐S score of less than or equal to (&lt;=)3 for a minimum of 3 months and/or (Tier II) - stable dosage of oral antipsychotic (OAPs) for a minimum of 3 months and control of acute symptoms, defined as having a CGI‐S score of &lt;=4 for a minimum of 3 months; and 'Remission' - a continuous CGI-S scale score of &lt;=2 for 6 months.</description>

    <description>Participants will not receive any intervention as a part of this study. Participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving oral antipsychotics (OAP) for example, risperidone (1 to 6 milligram [mg] once daily [OD] to twice a day [BID]), olanzapine (5 to 20 mg OD), haloperidol (5 to 20 mg OD to thrice a day [TID]) etc, per their treating physician/clinician instruction will be observed. The primary data source for this study will be the clinical assessments by the treating physician of each participant conducted as a part of routine clinical practice.</description>

    <description>This is an observational study. Participants enrolled in this study will continue to receive routine treatment of OAPs for example, risperidone (1 to 6 mg OD to BID), olanzapine (5 to 20 mg OD), haloperidol (5 to 20 mg OD to TID) etc, as directed by their treating physician.</description>
