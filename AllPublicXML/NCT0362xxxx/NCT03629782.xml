  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-country, multicentre, observational cross-sectional one-visit study of
      patients suffering from severe asthma in primary and secondary care settings in Europe
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to generate real-world data on the characteristics of patients considered to
      have severe asthma in primary and secondary care settings that should be referred for
      assessment for biologics. It is anticipated that these data from European countries, will
      help to estimate the unmet need for better treatments in severe asthma patients and will
      provide supporting evidence on the current shortcomings in referrals to asthma specialist or
      secondary care clinics. This information could also support the development of better severe
      asthma care pathways across Europe.

      Approximately 1,500 other patients like you will take part in the RECOGNISE study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients aged 18 years or older with physician's confirmed diagnosis of
             asthma.

          -  Diagnosis of asthma defined as severe according to American Thoracic Society/European
             Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines, i.e.: Asthma requiring high-dose ICS plus at
             least one of the following additional controller[s] for 12 months (GINA Step 4/5):
             Long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), leukotriene modifier, theophylline, or continuous or
             near continuous OCS [i.e.,maintenance OCS for ≥50% of the previous year])(controlled
             or uncontrolled). NB: High dose ICS defined according to GINA

          -  One documented blood EOS (%) or absolute count in the last 12 months

          -  Twelve months of documented baseline data in medical records or asked on study visit
             day including asthma medication, especially oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment and
             history of asthma exacerbations (number and severity)

          -  Evidence of one pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)
             in last 12 months or on study visit day

          -  Patients must be able and willing to read and comprehend written instructions, and
             comprehend and complete the questionnaires required by the protocol

          -  After full explanation, patients must have signed an informed consent document
             indicating that they understand the purpose of and the procedures required for the
             study and are willing to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other respiratory conditions including: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (as main
             diagnosis), bronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension,
             alpha-1-antitrypsine-deficiency, and malignancy of any kind (NB: the following
             conditions are permitted: nasal polyposis, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis,
             non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).

          -  Concurrent biologics for asthma except for stable allergen immunotherapy (defined as a
             stable dose and regimen at the time of the study visit). Acceptable washout periods
             for other asthma biologics:

               1. Other eosinophil lowering products indicated for asthma (including mepolizumab or
                  reslizumab): at least 4 months.

               2. Prior omalizumab use: at least 1 month

          -  An acute or chronic condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would limit the
             patient's ability to complete questionnaires or participate in this study or impact
             the interpretations of results

          -  Patient is participating in an ongoing randomized clinical trial or participation in
             an observational trial that might, in the investigator's opinion, influence the
             assessment for the current study.
