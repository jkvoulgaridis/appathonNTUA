  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect and compare clinical image quality measurements of randomly
      scheduled, asymptomatic, screening mammography patients, right breast mammogram performed
      with and without the use of Bella Blankets protective coverlets on the receptor plate.

      The measurements will determine if the use of Bella Blankets protective coverlets increases
      the mammogram's clinical image quality and if Bella Blankets protective coverlets can be used
      as an aid for EQUIP compliance.

      In addition, a patient satisfaction survey will be conducted with participants to determine
      if the use of Bella Blankets protective coverlets improves patient satisfaction.

    <description>Comparison of the Clinical Image Quality (CIQ) analytics, automatically captured by VolparaEnterprise, for the participant's right breast mammogram performed on a receptor plate with Bella Blankets protective coverlets to the same right breast mammogram performed on a bare receptor plate during the same screening mammogram visit.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the completion of 100 participants; approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire completed by the participant after their mammogram and prior to exit. The one-page questionnaire requires the participant answers each question by selecting one Likert Scale option about their experience with the use and without the use of Bella Blankets protective coverlets.</description>

    <description>A right breast screening mammogram will be performed with Bella Blankets protective coverlets on the imaging receptor plate, then removed from the equipment.
The screening mammogram continues with a left breast and second right breast screening mammogram on a bare imaging receptor plate.
Clinical image quality measurements for the right breast mammograms will automatically be captured by VolparaEnterprise for a comparative analysis.
A patient satisfaction survey will be completed by each participant and the results will be analyzed.</description>
