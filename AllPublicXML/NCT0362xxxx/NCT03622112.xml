  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of multiple dose levels of AZD7594
      administered once daily (QD) by inhalation in a 12-week treatment period on asthma subjects.
      The activity will be assessed by comparing AZD7594 to placebo. The comparison between active
      comparator (FF) and placebo will be used for bench marking. The efficacy is assessed by the
      evaluation of change in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). The aim is to
      develop AZD7594 as a once daily inhaled non-steroidal selective GR modulator (SGRM), which
      may ultimately lead to better disease control of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) and asthma through improved efficacy and compliance. The overall rationale for
      developing a once daily AZD7594 in a dry powder inhaler (DPI) is to provide a safe and
      effective future treatment option for both asthma and COPD subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind multi center (8 countries: Europe,
      United States [US], South Africa, and Japan) study conducted on 714 subjects (102 subject per
      arm) with asthma symptomatic on low dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The study consists of
      3 periods:

        -  Run-in period (21-28 days; visits 1 to 3)

        -  Treatment period (12-week; Visits 4 to 7)

        -  Follow-up (1-week; visit 8).

      The Run-in period consist of 3 visits: Screening visit (1), reversibility visit (2) and
      randomization visit (3). All subjects will sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to
      participating in any study-specific procedures. Subjects found to be eligible at Visit 1
      (Screening Visit) will discontinue all asthma medications and switch to low dose budesonide
      (200 μg twice a day [BID] in Europe and 180 μg BID in US) and rescue medication will be taken
      as needed. Subjects on long-acting beta agonist (LABA), fixed dose combination ICS/LABA
      treatment or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) will return for Visit 2 between 2 to
      7 days after Visit 1 to have a sufficient wash-out time of their asthma medications. If
      reversibility criteria are met at Visit 2, subjects will proceed to Visit 3 (Randomization
      will occur within 21 to 28 days of Visit 1). At Visit 3, subjects who remain symptomatic
      while on low dose budesonide will be randomized in an overall ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 to one
      of 7 possible treatments and will receive inhalation powder via oral route:

        -  AZD7594 DPI 55μg [nominal strength]/50 μg [delivered dose] (QD)

        -  AZD7594 DPI 99 μg/90 μg QD

        -  AZD7594 DPI 198 μg/180 μg QD

        -  AZD7594 DPI 396 μg/360 μg QD

        -  AZD7594 DPI 792 μg/720 μg QD

        -  Placebo for AZD7594 QD

        -  FF 100 μg QD (open-label) The follow-up will be done by telephone contact within 7 to 10
           days after Visit 7 or last investigational product (IP) intake.

      The total duration of the study will be between 113 to 135 days for each individual subject
      and is planned to run approximately 12 months (it should not exceed 18 months).

        bronchodilators at Visit 2 (a ≥12% and ≥200 mL improvement in FEV1 after administration of
        a 4 puffs of salbutamol/albuterol) 7. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Visit 3 between 40% and
        90% predicted at either −45 or −15 minutes pre-dose 8. At Visit 3, subjects need to be
        symptomatic on low dose ICS as evidenced by combined daily asthma mean symptom score of &gt;1
        over the previous 7 days or SABA use on ≥3 of the last 7 days during the Run-in Period 9.
        Demonstrate the ability to use the study inhalation device properly 10. Subject able to
        perform acceptable pulmonary function testing for FEV1 according to American Thoracic
        Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) acceptability criteria 11. Subject is
        willing and able to follow study procedures and restrictions. Women of child bearing
        potential (WOCBP) should be stable on their chosen method of highly effective birth control
        for a minimum of 3 months prior to Visit 1, and willing to use that for the entire duration
        of the study (from the time they sign the informed consent), and for 1 month after the last
        dose of IP 12. For optional inclusion in the Gx component of the study, subjects must
        provide separate informed consent for the genomic sampling and analysis Exclusion criteria

          1. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the IPs, including budesonide, or
             excipients, including lactose

          4. History or clinical suspicion of any clinically relevant or active disease or disorder
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because
             of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to
             participate in the study, or any other safety concerns in the opinion of the
             Investigator

          5. Use of prohibited medications that cannot be stopped during the entire period of the
             study (starting Visit 1).

             Period, before randomisation

          9. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the
             digital ECG at rest and any abnormalities in the digital ECG (at Visit 1 or Visit 3)
             that, as considered by the Investigator, may interfere with the interpretation of QT
             interval corrected (QTc) interval changes

         10. Prolonged QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥450 msec based on
