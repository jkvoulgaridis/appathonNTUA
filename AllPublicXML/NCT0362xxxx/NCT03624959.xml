  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the following index inhibitors or
      inducers of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of ozanimod and its
      major active metabolite, CC112273, in healthy adult subjects: gemfibrozil (strong inhibitor
      of CYP2C8), rifampin (moderate inducer of CYP2C8 and strong inducer of CYP3A), and
      itraconazole (strong inhibitor of CYP3A).

      Study Design

      This is a Phase 1, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study with two parts, 1 and 2.
      Forty subjects will be enrolled in Part 1 and will be randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment
      groups, with 20 subjects in each treatment group. Sixty subjects will be enrolled in Part 2
      and will be randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment groups, with 20 subjects in each treatment
      group. . Study parts and treatment groups are as follow:

      Part 1:

        -  Treatment Group A (reference): A single dose of ozanimod.

        -  Treatment Group B (test): Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily (BID) on Days 1 through 17. On
           Day 4, a single dose of ozanimod will be coadministered with the morning dose of
           gemfibrozil.

      Part 2:

        -  Treatment Group C (reference): A single dose of ozanimod.

        -  Treatment Group D (test): Itraconazole 200 mg once daily (QD) on Days 1 through 17. On
           Day 4, a single dose of ozanimod will be coadministered with itraconazole.

        -  Treatment Group E (test): Rifampin 600 mg QD on Days 1 through 21. On Day 8, a single
           dose of ozanimod will be coadministered with rifampin.

      Study Population Subjects will be healthy men and non-pregnant, non-lactating women, ages 18
      to 55 years, inclusive, with a body weight of at least 110 pounds (50 kg); body mass index
      (BMI) within the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.

      Length of Study The study duration ranges from 43 days to 50 days.

               -  Negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and Day -1 (women of child-bearing
                  potential [WOCBP] only).

               -  Postmenopausal (defined as 2 years after the last period and follicle-stimulating
                  hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 IU/L).

               -  Received surgical sterilization (eg, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral

             Must agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study
             until completion of the 75-day Safety Follow-up. Highly effective methods of
             contraception are those that alone or in combination result in a failure rate of a
             Pearl index of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.

             Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are the following:

               -  Combined hormonal (oestrogen and progestogen containing) contraception, which may
                  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,
                  which may be oral, injectable, implantable

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system

               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

             acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used
             together.

          3. Subject has a presence or history of any abnormality or illness that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination
             of the Investigational product (IP) or would limit the subject's ability to
             participate in and complete this clinical study.

             modulators (both Parts 1 and 2), gemfibrozil (Part 1 only), itraconazole or other
