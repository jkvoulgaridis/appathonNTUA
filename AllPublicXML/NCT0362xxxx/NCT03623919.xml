  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fall prevention programs should include strength and balance training, home hazard assessment
      and intervention, vision assessment and referral and also medication review with
      modification/withdrawal. Evidence exists that a tailored exercise program can reduce falls by
      as much as 54%.

      The FallSensing games software include 3 mini-games to be played by two teams with up to 3
      players each will compete against each other alternately.

      The players will perform an initial evaluation with FallSensing screening tool, 16 sessions
      of group games (2 times a week/8weeks) with FallSensing multiplayer games and a final
      evaluation also with FallSensing screening tool.

      Both initial and final evaluation include six functional tests (Grip Strength, Timed Up and
      Go, 30 seconds Sit-to-Stand, Step test, 4 Stage Balance test &quot;modified&quot; and 10 meters Walking
      Speed) and a questionnaire concerning self-efficacy for Exercise.

    <description>FallSensing multiplayer games is a technological solution based on an interactive (exer)game.
Players will wear a strap on the lower limbs contaning an inertial sensor. This device enables movement identification on the characterization in real time, triggering actions in the game.
The exercise games are based on a validated fall prevention exercise plan - the Otago Exercise Programme. The exercises were designed to promote mobility and improve muscle strength and balance.</description>
