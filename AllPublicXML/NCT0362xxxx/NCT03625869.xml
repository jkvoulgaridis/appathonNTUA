  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of Pressure-controlled
      intermittent Coronary Sinus Occlusion (PiCSO) therapy started post flow restoration but prior
      to stenting during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to standard PCI in the
      setting of acute ST-segment elevation anterior myocardial infarction (STEMI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (1:1), controlled, study. Patients with an
      ST-segment elevated anterior infarct eligible for PCI will be invited to participate in the
      PiCSO-AMI-I study. After having given verbal assent, baseline assessments will be performed.
      PCI of the culprit vessel should be performed per standard practices. After blood flow
      restoration, the subjects meeting all inclusion and none exclusion criterial will be enrolled
      into the study and randomized either to PiCSO Group or Control Group. If the subject is
      randomized to PiCSO Group, the coronary sinus (CS) will be cannulated through the femoral
      vein and the PiCSO Impulse Catheter will be placed in the CS. In the event the PiCSO Impulse
      Catheter cannot be placed in the CS within 30 minutes, the physician should proceed with the
      regular PCI and the PiCSO treatment will be considered a failure. Once PiCSO Impulse Catheter
      is placed into CS, PiCSO treatment is started followed by stenting. The physician shall
      target a PiCSO treatment of 45 minutes (at minimum 30 minutes) whereas the treatment should
      be continued during and post stent insertion, but should not exceed a maximum duration of 90
      minutes. At the end of the PiCSO treatment, the PiCSO Impulse Console is stopped and the
      PiCSO Impulse Catheter is removed. The patient is seen for seen for a FU visit at 5 days, 30
      days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 year and 3 years post index procedure. 5 days and 6 months post
      index the patient will get a CMR scan. At every FU visit safety data and health status will
      be documented and quality of life questionnaire will be completed.
