  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humanitarian crises related to the Syrian conflict have led to a large increase in refugees
      in Europe in the recent years. There is need for effective approaches to increase labor
      market participation among refugees, and to reduce the impact of unfavorable exclusion
      mechanisms among this group. The Supported Employment for Refugees (the SER-trial) is a
      randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of Supported Employment (SE) for
      newly arrived refugees who are involved in the mandatory introduction program provided for
      all refugees in Norway. SE is an intervention that has proved effective in promoting
      competitive employment among patients with severe mental illness in over twenty international
      randomized controlled trials, and is currently being evaluated for various new patient groups
      in ongoing trials. The SER-trial is however the first trial to evaluate the effect of SE for
      the target group of refugees (who may or may not have mental illness).
