  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive distracting devices (Virtual
      Reality headset, Augmented Reality Headset) are more effective than the standard of care
      (i.e., no technology-based distraction) for decreasing anxiety and pain scores in pediatric
      patients undergoing various minor procedures (i.e lumbar punctures and cardiac
      catheterization). The anticipated primary outcome will be a reduction of overall cumulative
      medication and secondary outcomes include but are not limited to: physician satisfaction,
      discharge time, pain scores, anxiety scores, and procedure time.

    <measure>Parent and Child Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Parent and child questionnaire with 5 questions asking the individual on a scale from 1-5 how much they agree with each statement (1=Not at all, 3=A little bit, 5=A lot). It has stamens such as &quot;Having the technology made me feel more relaxed before my procedure&quot; or &quot;If I ever have procedure again, I would like to use this technology&quot;</description>

    <description>Measure dosing requirements for anxiolytic and/or analgesic medications for participants thought their procedure. We will then compare these doses to their own historical chart data, since many of these patents come in routinely, and use their own data for intra-reliability measures.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Passive vs Active Interventions</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of procedure (usually no more than 2-4 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>There is variation in the immersive technology experiences (active vs passive content), as a part of the study the investigators also aim to evaluate the degree of cognitive load which is suitable for clinical applications during minor procedures. During the participants immersive experience in either AR or VR, there are embedded questions in the experience that can gage as to the patient's emotional status (happy, sad, mad) or VAS scales (0-10, 0=no pain, 10=worst imaginable pain) that can let the research personnel know if we need to increase the cognitive load. If patients are self-reporting higher VAS scores, or aversive emotional status (i.e mad) the cognitive load will be increased to enhance the distraction experience from the procedure.</description>

    <description>If parent and child consent to be in the study, the clinician will offer the use of one of the technologies: Virtual Reality (VR) headset or Augmented Reality (AR) headset. Active content includes video games, interactive avatars, and interactive experiences, while passive content includes video clips and movies. All patients will be offered the opportunity to use these technologies during their minor procedures if they meet eligibility criteria. Those who decline or who are switched over to the standard of care due to patient preference, health providers monitoring and assessment during the procedure will be noted in the database.</description>
