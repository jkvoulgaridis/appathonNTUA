      This study will measure primary hemostatic ability using the T-TAS 01 System with PL chip,
      with a comparison to clinical truth. The study will be conducted at 3 locations in the United
      States and will enroll approximately 335 subjects. The following subject populations will be
      enrolled into the study (expected enrollment numbers indicated in parentheses):

        -  Ostensibly healthy subjects without primary hemostasis abnormalities, e.g. a &quot;healthy
           platelet&quot; normal control population (N = 150)

        -  Subjects taking 81+ mg daily aspirin (N = 81)

        -  Subjects taking dual antiplatelet therapy (N = 51)

        -  Subjects with von Willebrand disease (vWD; N = 47)

        -  Subjects with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (N = 5)

      Subjects may be recruited either prospectively or based on their simultaneous participation
      in other studies involving blood collection, provided that the enrollment criteria. Blood
      samples will be collected after enrollment and subject participation will be complete after
      blood samples are collected and all necessary information is collected to complete the case
      report form (CRF). Blood sample testing with T-TAS 01 will occur locally at each
      investigational site. Blood sample testing for clinical truth assessment may be tested either
      locally or remotely, depending on the local availability of the various tests used for
      determining clinical truth.
