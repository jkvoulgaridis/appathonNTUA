  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic disease and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rapidly increasing
      as a result of population ageing, urbanization and associated lifestyle changes. Recently,
      the use of natural products in chronic diseases such as diabetes has gained more attention.
      Chlorella is a single-celled green algae that contains essential nutrients including amino
      acids and fatty acids as well as some vitamins and minerals. There have been some studies on
      the effects of chlorella supplementation in chronic diseases such as NAFLD, prediabetes and
      diabetic mice, but none of them examined the effects of chlorella in patients with type 2
      diabetes. Thus the present study designed to evaluate the effects of chlorella
      supplementation on glycemic control, lipid profile and anthropometric measurements in type 2
      diabetic patients.

      This study is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. 84 patients with type 2 diabetes
      are recruited. After informing the patients about this study and filling the consent letters,
      they are randomly assigned into intervention group (n=42) or placebo group (n=42) receiving
      1500 mg chlorella Vulgaris or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Patients are asked not to change
      their regular physical activity, diet, medicine and dosage during the study. Anthropometric
      and blood pressure measurements are collected and 24-hour food intake recall, IPAQ physical
      activity, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI) and Beck anxiety and depression
      questionnaires are filled by each patients at the beginning and end of the study. In
      addition, blood samples are collected at the beginning and end of the study to determine the
      changes of FBS, HbA1c, insulin concentration and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and lipid
      profile.

    <masking_description>This study is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Subjects will be randomly allocated into two groups and each one will receive the supplement (Chlorella Vulgaris) or placebo for 8 weeks. To prevent selection bias, the study participants, investigators and the laboratory staff will be all blinded to treatment assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>The beck anxiety inventory (BAI) is used for the evaluations. The total range of this 21 item questionnaire is from zero to 63. Responses are rated on a 4-point Likert scale and range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). These points are summed and the total score of 0-7 for sub-scales is considered nonexistence or the least form of anxiety,8-15 slight,16-25 moderate and 26-63 indicate the severe form of it.</description>

BDI items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. These points are summed and the total score of 0-10 for sub-scales is considered normal,11-16 Mild mood disturbance,17-20 borderline clinical depression, 21-30 moderate depression, 31-40 severe depression and over 40 is considered extreme depression.</description>
