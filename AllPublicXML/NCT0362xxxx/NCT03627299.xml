  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, individuals without hepatitis C infection who are on the kidney transplant
      waitlist will receive a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C infection and will be
      treated for hepatitis C at the same time. Treatment will include glecaprevir 300 mg /
      pibrentasvir 120 mg (G-P) administered on-call to the operating room for the renal transplant
      procedure and continued for 4 weeks post-renal transplant.

      In this study, individuals without hepatitis C infection who are on the kidney transplant
      waitlist will receive a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C infection and will be
      treated for hepatitis C at the same time. Treatment will include glecaprevir 300 mg /
      pibrentasvir 120 mg (G-P) administered on-call to the operating room for the renal transplant
      procedure and continued for 4 weeks post-renal transplant. The participant will continue to
      be tested for Hepatitis C for 12 weeks post-treatment.

      The primary hypothesis is that prophylactic treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir before
      and after transplant will prevent the establishment of HCV infection in the recipients of
      kidneys from HCV-infected deceased donors. Based on the success of preliminary studies, the
      objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4 weeks of G-P as
      prophylaxis for HCV D+/R- kidney transplant.

    <description>Proportion of participants with grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (AE) as assessed by US Department of Health and Human Services Common Terminology of AEs version 4. An AE is an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5. Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE. The investigator will determine if the AE is related to the treatment.</description>
