    <textblock>
      A clinical trial comparing laser treatment and conventional mucosal flap surgery for
      treatment of peri-implantitis. The main aim of the study is to evaluate if treatment of
      peri-implantitis with a novel blue laser (445 nm) combined with scaling and root planning
      (SRP) is clinically comparable to conventional mucosal flap surgery in terms of pocket
      probing depth reduction.

      The present project aims to evaluate a novel method in treating peri-implantitis, with focus
      on decreasing the patient's suffering as well as disease progression. Peri-implantitis has a
      direct influence on both physical and psychological well-being and have been related to
      difficulty in chewing due to loss of implants, bad esthetic appearance as well as high costs.
      Therefore, it is of importance for the individual as well as for the society to thoroughly
      investigate any new treatment approaches.

      The study is a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing laser treatment (test group)
      and conventional mucosal flap surgery (active control group). Assessment of clinical
      variables at baseline and after 6 months. Patient reported outcomes at baseline, directly
      after treatment and after 10 days.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate if treatment of peri-implantitis with a novel blue laser (445 nm) combined with
      scaling and root planning (SRP) is clinically comparable to conventional mucosal flap surgery
      in terms of pocket probing depth reduction.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate other clinical and radiological variables connected to peri-implantitis and
           the inflammation surrounding the dental implant.

        -  To evaluate the patient experience of a novel blue laser for treatment of
           peri-implantitis.

        -  To evaluate the inflammatory and microbial response after laser treatment

    <description>The participants in the laser group are treated by a combination of scaling and root planning (SRP) and 445 nm diode laser. The peri-implant pocket will be radiated with the 445 nm laser, removing bacteria, diseased epithelium and granulation tissue. The Power setting on the laser will be 0.7 W continuous wave and will be used at maximum 20 s Before cooling water is applied. Total treatment time will vary with the depth of the pocket and size of the surrounding bone crater.</description>
