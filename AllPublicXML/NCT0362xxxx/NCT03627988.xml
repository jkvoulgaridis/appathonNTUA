      Prospective, multicentric, non-randomized phase II study evaluating the surgical treatment by
      mastectomy with immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction in patients with breast cancer and
      receiving adjuvant therapy by TomoTherapy +/-Chemotherapy.

      Patients with non-inflammatory and non-metastatic invasive mammary carcinoma will be included
      in this study.

      The study procedure will be a surgical treatment by mastectomy with immediate prosthetic
      breast reconstruction followed by an adjuvant therapy: TomoTherapy +/-Chemotherapy (radiation
      therapy alone or preceded by chemotherapy).

      The nature of the chemotherapy treatment will be decided according to the standards of each
      center.

      The patients will be followed for the study up to 36 months after the surgical procedure.
