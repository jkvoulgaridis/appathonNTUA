      A multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized Phase II study to compare efficacy by
      measuring rates of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months in patients with Ph+ chronic
      phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) randomized to receive either dasatinib 50 mg QD or
      dasatinib 100 mg QD. Approximately 100 patients are expected to be randomized. The duration

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Diagnosis of Ph+ or BCR-ABL positive CML in early CP (i.e. time from diagnosis &lt;12
             months). Except for hydroxyurea and/or 1-2 doses of cytarabine (up to 6g/m2 total),
             patients must have received no or minimal prior therapy, defined as 30 days of prior
             approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

          3. Clonal evolution defined as the presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities other
             than the Ph-chromosome has been historically included as a criterion of accelerated
             phase (AP). However, patients with clonal evolution as the only criterion of AP have a
             significantly better prognosis, and when present at diagnosis may not impact the
             prognosis at all. Thus, patients with clonal evolution and no other criteria for AP
             will be eligible for this study.

          4. ECOG performance of 0-2.

          5. Adequate end organ function defined as the following: total bilirubin &lt;1.5x ULN
             (unless secondary to Gilbert's disease, in which case it should be &lt;2.5x ULN), SGPT
             &lt;2.5x ULN, creatinine &lt;1.5x ULN.

          6. Patients must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study, in keeping with the policies of the hospital

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. NYHA cardiac class 3-4 heart disease

          2. Cardiac symptoms - Patients meeting the following criteria are not eligible unless
             cleared by a cardiologist:

               1. Uncontrolled angina within 3 months

               2. Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome

               3. Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as
                  ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or torsades de pointes)

               4. Prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (&gt;460 msec)

          3. History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer including:

               1. Diagnosed congenital bleeding disorders (e.g. Von Willebrand's disease)

               2. Diagnosed acquired bleeding disorder within one year (e.g. acquired anti-factor
                  VIII antibodies)

               3. Isolated thrombocytopenia without recurrent bleeding episodes shall be considered
                  eligible for study entry

          4. Patients with active uncontrolled psychiatric disorders including: psychosis, major
             depression, and bipolar disorders

          5. Women of pregnancy potential must practice an effective method of birth control,
             unless otherwise instructed, during the course of the study in a manner such that risk
             of failure is minimized

               1. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be
                  advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and
                  the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy

               2. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered
                  of non-childbearing potential

               3. Women must continue birth control for the duration of the study and at least 3
                  months after the last dose of study drug

          6. Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded

             a. All WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test prior to first receiving the study
             drug. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive the study drug
             and must not be enrolled in the study.

          7. Patients in late chronic phase (i.e. time from diagnosis to treatment &gt;12 months),
             accelerated phase (except as noted in inclusion criteria 2) or blast phase are
             excluded.
