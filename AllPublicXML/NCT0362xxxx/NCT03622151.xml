  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to evaluate the impact of the Primer La Llar housing program for the
      homeless population on the mental health of the participants.

      The hypothesis is that the housing program, which follows Housing first model, for the
      homeless population has a positive impact on the mental health of the participants, compared
      to the group that does not receive the intervention -treatment as usual group (meaning the
      &quot;positive impact&quot; a lower score on the symptomatology scales and lower toxic intake in the
      group receiving the intervention).

      The specific objectives are:

      Identify the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants.

      Compare the severity of psychiatric symptoms and improvement among the participants in the
      intervention group and the control group (depressive, anxious, psychotic or manic
      symptomatology, depending on the case).

      Compare the consumption of alcohol and drugs among the participants of both groups.

      Compare the basic daily life skills among the participants in both groups, as well as the
      improvement of them in the experimental group.

      Compare the use of services and between the participants of the intervention group and the
      control group.

      Intervention group receives entry to the program (which means individual and permanent
      housing without previous requirements such as abstinence, compliance with treatment or
      sobriety.

      Control group receives treatment as usual, as they are users of homeless population network
      of Barcelona.
