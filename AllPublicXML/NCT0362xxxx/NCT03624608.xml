  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of the AuryzoN devices in the ear and nose reconstruction
      surgeries, both in terms of operative time and overall quality of reconstruction. Research
      participants will undergo reconstruction either using the AuryzoN device or through current
      methods (traditional manual processing) at the discretion of their surgeon prior to the start
      of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AuryzoN devices are a family of two (2) devices that, in conjunction, serve to process
      substrates of autologous-derived or cadaveric cartilage used in the reconstruction of various
      structures of the body, namely ear and nose. The devices are to be used in the operating room
      to cut and carve substrates of tissue into components, which are then assembled into the
      final ear or nose, that will then be implanted by the plastic surgeon into the appropriate
      area. This device family serves to replace the current step in this reconstructive procedure,
      which involves the time-consuming and error-prone process of manual cartilage processing.

      Participants will be given the option to participate in the study. If the participants so
      choose, they will undergo ear or nose reconstruction using the AuryzoN devices or traditional
      manual processing at the discretion of their surgeon prior to the start of surgery. The
      following outcome measures will be measured: operative time, error rates, objective quality
      outcomes of reconstruction, subjective quality outcomes of reconstruction, and patient
      satisfaction.

    <description>An objective scoring system will be developed to score ears and noses based on anatomic accuracy, and reconstructed ears/noses will be scored using this system.
Scoring system scale: The following metrics will be assessed by independent observers on a scale from 0-5, with 5 indicating perfect anatomic fidelity as compared to the patient's contralateral ear (or a model ear if no contralateral ear is available) or model nose and 0 indicating complete anatomical difference or loss of that structure.
The following ear and nose subcomponents will be graded:
Ear: Helix, antihelix, tragus, crus, anatomical proportion of all substrates as compared to each other substrate.
Nose: Septum, alar cartilages, lateral cartilages, horizontal strut, anatomical proportion of all substrates as compared to each other substrate.</description>
