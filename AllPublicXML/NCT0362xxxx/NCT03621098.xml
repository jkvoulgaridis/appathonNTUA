  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of the effects of weight loss on
      the lungs in older adults. Different types of tests to understand the effects of the EMPOWER
      interventions on lung function will be administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of the effects of structured aerobic exercise and a
      sedentary behavior intervention during weight loss on respiratory function. Site will enroll
      150 older (65-85 years), obese (BMI=30-45 kg/m2), sedentary men and women from EMPOWER.
      EMPOWER is a 3-group design where participants will undergo a 9-month weight loss (WL)
      intervention (6-mo intensive phase and 3-mo reduced contact phase), followed by a 9-month
      self-managed follow-up phase with minimal contact. The diet element of the interventions is
      identical across groups, but groups differ by activity intervention: 1) moderate-intensity
      aerobic exercise (WL+EX); 2) intervening on SB (WL+SitLess); or 3) (WL+EX+SitLess)

    <measure>Lung volumes</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Lung volumes measures measures the volume of gas within the lungs and is considered a standard for lung volume measurements. Participants are asked to sit comfortably. They are then asked to breath through a mouthpiece that is connected to a sensor that will be recording changes in the concentration of gas washed out from the lungs with each breath taken. Scores based on mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale</description>

    <measure>Diffusing capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Diffusing Capacity will be measured by carbon-monoxide single-breath wash out. This test examines the alveolar uptake efficiency for carbon monoxide and therefore reflects the quality of alveolar-capillary gas uptake (how well gas diffuses through alveoli into the capillaries to get to the red blood cells).</description>

    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle strength is assessed by measuring the maximal inspiratory the maximal expiratory pressures. The maximal inspiratory pressure reflects diaphragmatic and inspiratory muscle strength while the maximal expiratory pressure reflects abdominal muscle and expiratory muscle strength. Paired t-test analysis will be used to compare within treatment group pre- and post outcomes with adjusted analysis. ANOVA with adjusted analysis will be used to make between group comparisons and to compare changes in outcomes between treatment groups after the 6-month intensive weight loss phase.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 6 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-minute walk test s a validated test in chronic respiratory disease. It is self-paced of walking capacity and participants are encouraged to cover as much distance as they can in within 6 minutes. The 6-minute walk distance will be measured which is strongly associated with clinical outcomes. Pulse oximetry will be continuously measured</description>

    <measure>Dyspnea scores based on mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The mMRC is a 1 question, five-item instrument to assess a patient's degree of breathlessness in relation to physical activity. Participants are given a brief description of an activity and then are asked to select the statement that best describes their experience with dyspnea. The score on the mMRC is weighted on a 0-4 scale and quantifies disability and exercise limitation associated with breathlessness.</description>

    <measure>Dyspnea scores based on USCD SOBQ (University of California Shortness of Breath Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>SOBQ is a 24-item questionnaire; 21 items assess severity of breathlessness during specific activities of daily living and 3 items assess limitations due to shortness of breath, fear of harm from overexertion, and fear of shortness of breath. Each item is weighted on a 0-5 scale, and are totaled for a final score of 0-120 with high scores indicating increased severity with performing activities.</description>
