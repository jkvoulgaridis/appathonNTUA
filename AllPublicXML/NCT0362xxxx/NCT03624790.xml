      This study will evaluate the safety, infectivity and replication, and immunogenicity of a
      recombinant respiratory syncytial virus (rRSV A/Maryland/001/11) challenge virus administered
      intranasally to healthy adults.

      Participants will be admitted to the inpatient isolation unit and will receive a single dose
      of 10^5 plaque forming units (PFUs) of rRSV A/Maryland/001/11, delivered intranasally on Day
      0. Participants will be enrolled outside of the RSV season between April 1 and October 31.

      Participants will remain in the inpatient isolation unit for a minimum of 8 days after the
      challenge and will be discharged after two RSV reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR) results lower than 3 Log10 genome equivalents per mL of nasal wash.

      Upon discharge from the inpatient unit, participants will attend outpatient visits on Days 10
      (if previously discharged), 28, and 56. These study visits may include physical examinations,
      blood collection, and nasal washes. At 6 months, there will be a follow-up phone contact to
      assess for any new chronic conditions or serious health events/hospitalizations.
