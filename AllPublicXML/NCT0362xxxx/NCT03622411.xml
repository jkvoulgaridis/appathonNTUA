  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is one of the most common and disabling disorders following stroke, in many cases
      resolving in long-term deficits. There is evidence that intensive aphasia therapy is
      effective for language recovery, even in the chronic phase post-stroke. However, as many
      patients are left with residual language disorders and intensive aphasia rehabilitation is
      difficult to achieve, the investigators are exploring tablet-based therapies to further
      facilitate language recovery in a cost-effective manner.

      This study will investigate the clinical effects of intensive tablet-based aphasia therapy as
      an add-on to conventional aphasia therapy (= high intensive) compared to conventional aphasia
      therapy (either alone, or in combination with recreational tablet use (= low intensive) in
      patients with aphasia following stroke, as measured by specific linguistic tests, within task
      improvements, functional communication and quality of life.

      Furthermore, the investigators want to learn more about the recovery of specific underlying
      language processes via event-related potentials (ERPs). At last, the investigators aim to
      explore whether patients with aphasia are satisfied with a tablet-based aphasia therapy,
      whether the app is user-friendly and which barriers the participants might have encountered.
