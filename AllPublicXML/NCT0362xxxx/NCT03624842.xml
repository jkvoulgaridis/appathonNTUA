  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To afford urgent access to a potential-disease modifying treatment, Dr. Diana Kerwin, in
      partnership with CTD Holdings, the manufacturer of Trappsol (R) Cyclo(TM), will administer
      the product to a patient with Alzheimer's Disease who has no other disease-modifying
      treatment options.

    <textblock>
      Trappsol(R) Cyclo(TM) will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. The initial dose
      will be 500 mg/kg (T=Day 0). Subsequent dosing is anticipated to increase over 9 months, with
      all subsequent doses given monthly at the maximum dose determined by tolerability, lack of
      toxicity or adverse event, pharmacokinetic analysis and patient preference. So long as the
      overall risk/benefit profile favors continued dosing, the patient will continue to receive
      Trappsol (R) Cyclo (TM) for a minimum of 12 months, if not perpetually.

      Risk/benefit assessments will include:

        -  Vital signs, ECG and laboratory parameters (CBC, chemistry panel, hematology,
           urinalysis, lipids, coagulation)

        -  Brain MRI without gadolinium for safety monitoring

        -  Amyloid and Tau PET (positron emission tomorgraphy) imaging

        -  Adverse Events

        -  Mini-mental status score

        -  Digital Cognition Technologies (DCT) Clock

        -  Changes in blood biomarkers

        -  Pharmacokinetic data
