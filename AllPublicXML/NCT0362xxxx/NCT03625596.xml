  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese people have a disturbed postprandial metabolism and thereby a decreased postprandial
      vascular function. Nitric oxide plays an important role in the postprandial vascular
      function. Multiple studies already focused on various nutritional compounds to improve the
      postprandial vascular function by increasing the nitric oxide bioactivity. However, the vast
      majority of the trials has been performed with relatively high doses of the individual
      components, which are problematic to convert into daily food measures, thereby preventing
      translation of these findings. Well-designed trails studying the effect of feasible amounts
      of nutritional supplements on the bioactivity of nitric oxide and vascular function are
      missing.
