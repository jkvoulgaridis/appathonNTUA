  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase
      2 dose as well as to establish the safety profile of GEN3013 (DuoBody®-CD3xCD20) in patients
      with Relapsed, Progressive or Refractory B-Cell Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an open-label, multi-center safety trial of GEN3013 (DuoBody®-CD3xCD20). The
      trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation part (phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) and an
      expansion part phase 2a). The expansion part of the trial will be initiated once the
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) has been determined.

    <intervention_model_description>A Minimum Anticipated Biologic Effect Level (MABEL) -derived starting (priming) dose of 4.0 μg (microgram) is administered as a flat dose. The priming dose for the first patient will be followed with a subsequent dose that will be as a maximum 12.8 μg (microgram) flat dose. Dose escalation steps are based on all available data with increments not exceeding a half-log10 (3.2-fold) increase in the accelerated titration part and not exceeding 100% (2-fold) increase in the standard titration part.</intervention_model_description>
