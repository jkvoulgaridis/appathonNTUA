  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iopromide (trade name is Ultravist) is on the market for more than 30 years and has been used
      more than 250 million times as X-ray contrast medium for patients. It is known that Iopromide
      may cause allergy-like reactions after being injected. With this study researchers want to
      find out, if the risk of severe allergy-like reactions is lower, when Iopromide will be
      injected into an artery, compared to the risk after an injection of Iopromid into a vein. To
      find this out data from four trials on Iopromide that are already completed will be combined
      and newly analyzed. The database used for this analysis will contain data from more than
      150,000 patients.
