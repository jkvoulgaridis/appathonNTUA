  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and find the tolerated ultrasound dose of transient
      opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by using the NaviFUS System in recurrent GBM
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility, open-label, single-arm, and dose escalation study. Eligible patients
      will be enrolled through the process of informed consent. Patients will be assigned into
      different dose groups generated from the NaviFUS System to transiently open the BBB in
      patients with recurrent GBM who will undergo surgery within 2 weeks. The focused ultrasound
      (FUS) dose is selected based on the results of pre-clinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
      safety studies as well as other non-GLP primate studies. This study will evaluate the safety
      and the tolerated ultrasound dose of temporary disruption of the BBB in patients with
      recurrent GBM. To find the tolerated ultrasound dose, the data and safety monitoring board
      (DSMB) will review the study data and provide the recommendations regarding continuation,
      termination, or other modifications of the study based on evaluation of observed adverse
      effects of the intervention. The extent and magnitude of BBB opening will be evaluated using
      of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).
