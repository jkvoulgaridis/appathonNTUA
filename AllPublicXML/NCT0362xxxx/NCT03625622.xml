      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be performed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of treating AR1001 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease
      for 26 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in The United
      States affecting approximately 5.4 million Americans. AD is characterized by progressive loss
      in memory and as well as a decline in the ability to learn that is associated with neuronal
      death. Well known hallmarks of AD are neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and
      extensive inflammation. Currently, no treatment has been developed to fully cure or prevent
      the progression of dementia that is associated with AD.

      AR1001 is being developed as a treatment for AD and shows great potential with favorable
      attributes for a central nervous system (CNS) drug (i.e., high specificity and potency, as
      well as good pharmacokinetic, bioavailability, CNS penetration, and ensured safety).

      The clinical study of AR1001 aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AR1001 as a
      potential treatment for AD. Based on the preclinical results, AR1001 could be an effective
      treatment option with a mechanism of action that has not been explored for AD indication.
