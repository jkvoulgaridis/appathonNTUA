  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placebo controlled, randomized, double blind, cross-over design.

      Single vape of 0.25ml 5% CBD e-liquid (12.5mg CBD) and single vape of 0.25ml e-liquid, tastes
      like lemon and madeleine. 15min vape time each.

      A total of 34 participants, equal number of male and female. There will be replacement of
      Drop-Outs until data from 34 participants are completed.

      The primary endpoint will be performance in a verbal memory task. The secondary endpoint will
      be performance in a working memory test.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal memory task</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoint 21 minutes after first medication.</time_frame>
    <description>Three series of five semantically unrelated nouns will be presented. Total score is calculated by summing the number of correctly recalled words. Higher scores represent a better outcome. Score Minimum 0 and score maximum 15.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoint 15 minutes after medication.</time_frame>
    <description>Working memory will be assessed by means of a letter 0-back and 2-back task (Papassotiropoulos et al., 2011). The 0-back condition serves as a low-load control condition, measuring general attention and does not require the manipulation of information within working memory. In the 2-back condition, participants have to compare the currently presented letter with the one presented 2 steps before and have to indicate whether they are identical or not. The 2-back condition requires online monitoring, updating and manipulation of remembered information and therefore is assumed to involve key processes of working memory. Accuracy and reaction time will be measured.</description>
