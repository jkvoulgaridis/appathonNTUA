  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a common condition and has a significant impact on the individual in
      terms of pain and disability. Lumbar radiculopathy occurs often with LBP and may be the
      result of a lumbar herniated disc which will irritate a lumbar nerve trunk resulting in
      intraneural inflammation. There is evidence supporting the use of manual therapies of lumbar
      radiculopathy. One potential manual therapy is neurodynamic mobilization technique. No
      scientific evidence, based on a RCT, exists that this particular approach is beneficial for
      individuals with LBP and lumbar radiculopathy

    <description>A Numerical Pain Rate Scale (NPRS, 0-10) where 0 represents no pain and 10 the maximum pain will be used to record the mean intensity of pain in the lower extremity</description>

    <measure>Changes in Neuropathic Mechanism Consideration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 4 treatment sessions, after 8 treatment sessions,and 2 months after last treatment session</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Scale (S-LANSS) will be used for assessing neuropathic mechanism. The S-LANSS is a 7-item tool for identifying patients whose pain is dominated by neuropathic mechanisms. Each item is a binary response (yes or no) to the presence of symptoms (5 items) or clinical signs (2 items). The total score is 24 points and a value ≥ 12 points is indicative of a neuropathic component of pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, after 4 treatment sessions, after 8 treatment sessions,and 2 months after last treatment session</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire will be used for assessing related-disability. The score can range from 0-24 with higher scores indicative of higher related-disability.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 8 sessions of motor control exercise program of 30 min duration for 4 weeks, twice per week. Exercises will be demonstrated to the participants by an experienced physical therapist. On each session, the therapist will correct each subject personally. Participants will be asked for practicing the exercises at home once daily for 20 minutes over the 8-week intervention period. The motor control exercise program will consist of a progression from isolated contraction of the transversus abdominis and/or isolated contraction of the multifidi to combined contraction of both transversus abdominis in different positions from supine or prone to bridging or four-point kneeling.</description>
