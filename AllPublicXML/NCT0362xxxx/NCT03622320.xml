      This study aims at detection of incidence of metabolic syndrome in vitiligo patients and
      possible contribution of the age of onset of the disease. This involves detection of waist
      circumference, body mass index, index of central obesity, systolic and diastolic arterial
      blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides, in addition
      to insulin resistance as Homeostatic Model Assessment- insulin resisitance (HOMA-IR) and
      serum leptin in vitiligo patients. The outcomes will be correlated to extent/
      severity/duration/ activity of vitiligo as well as to the age of onset. This is assumed to be
      of profound impact on vitiligo patients by properly assessing these patients for associated
      metabolic risk factors and helping prevent such metabolic derangements by detection of
      possible contributing factors such as insulin resistance and high serum adipokines as leptin.

      Since there is temporal relation between nutrition, metabolic derangements and skin diseases
      where nutritional deficiencies as minerals, vitamins and fatty acids can lead to cutaneous
      manifestations and , on the other hand; skin diseases could contribute to metabolic
      derangements and nutritional deficiencies, the investigator's study will focus on nutrition
      and dietary habits and there possible contribution to any associated metabolic risk in
      vitiligo patients.

      This is likely to open new horizons in the management of vitiligo, possibly through control
      of metabolic syndrome risk factors and insulin resistance as well as revealing possible
      temporal relation to dietary habits that are overlooked in vitiligo patients.
