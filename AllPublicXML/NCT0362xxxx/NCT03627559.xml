  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leakage of the pancreatojejunostomy is often discovered with considerable delay,
      causing severe peritonitis, hemorrhage due to erosion of vessels, sepsis, and death.
      Microdialysis catheters can detect focal inflammation and ischemia, and has a potential for
      early detection of anastomotic leakage. This observational study will examine if monitoring
      with microdialysis catheters can detect anastomotic leakage after pancreaticoduodenectomy
      earlier than current standard of care.

    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (WhippleÂ´s procedure) offers the only potential cure for patients
      with tumor in the head of the pancreas, bile duct or periampullary region. This procedure is
      associated with high perioperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity. Postoperative
      pancreatic fistulae (POPF) is the most feared complication, and is often discovered with
      significant delay resulting in development of organ dysfunction and sepsis. Current standard
      for clinical detection of POPF is limited and nonspecific.

      Microdialysis catheters allow bedside measurements of metabolism such as lactate, pyruvate,
      glucose and glycerol. The method has a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting
      complications in several types of abdominal surgery. However, microdialysis used after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy is not well documented. This observational study examine if
      monitoring with microdialysis catheters can detect anastomotic leakage after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy earlier than current standard of care.
