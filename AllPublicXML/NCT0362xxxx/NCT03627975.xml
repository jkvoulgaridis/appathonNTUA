  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moyamoya Disease(MMD), also known as spontaneous basilar artery occlusion, is characterized
      by the gradual thickening of arterial intima at the distal carotid artery and the proximal
      portion of anterior/middle cerebral artery, the gradual stenosis or occlusion of arterial
      lumen, and the compensatory expansion of basilar cerebral perforating arteries. Cerebral
      infarction and cerebral hemorrhage are common clinical symptoms of MMD with high morbidity of
      disability. For ischemic moyamoya disease, intracranial/extracranial revascularization is the
      preferred treatment. However, for patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease, there is
      controversy about whether to have surgical treatment, the timing and the method of surgical
      treatment, and the effect of surgical treatment to prevent rebleeding due to the lack of
      large sample, multi-center, prospective randomized studies. At present, the studies on the
      effect of revascularization and conservative treatment on hemorrhagic moyamoya disease are
      retrospective case analyses without randomized control. The sample size of these studies are
      small, and the conclusions obtained are inconsistent. Due to the differences in the
      epidemiology and episode type of moyamoya disease in different countries, there is no
      prospective, randomized controlled study of blood type moyamoya disease in China to confirm
      the efficacy of revascularization and lack of uniform norms and standards.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to perform a prospective, randomized study on hemorrhagic
      moyamoya disease to confirm the effect of revascularization in China, and to establish
      specifications and standards to guide the treatment options for hemorrhagic moyamoya disease
      as well.

      Design: This study is a single-center study and plan to include 108 patients. According to a
      random number table, hemorrhagic moyamoya patients will be assigned to three groups:
      conservative treatment group, direct revascularization group and indirect revascularization
      group. A prospective, randomized study will be carried out to evaluate the effect of
      revascularization and conservative treatment on the reduction of rebleeding risk and
      improvement of ischemia in adult patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease.

      Observation Measures: 1.Rebleeding; 2.Cerebral infarction resulting in severe disability (mRS
      score≥3); 3.Severe disability or death caused by other reasons; 4. Patients in conservative
      treatment group need revascularization due to progressive ischemic stroke or progressive
      Transient ischemic attack(TIA).

    <description>Conservative treatment. The conservative treatment of hemorrhagic moyamoya disease mainly includes the control of hypertension, the prevention and treatment of secondary epilepsy, the control of intracranial hypertension(including the application of mannitol and glycerol fructose, etc.), and the corresponding symptomatic and neurotrophic treatment. Non-specific treatment is mainly deal with intracranial hematoma, including intraventricular drainage, intracranial hematoma evacuation, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt.</description>

    <description>Direct vascular reconstruction surgery. In addition to the pharmacotherapy used in conservative treatment, the superficial temporal artery(STA) and middle cerebral artery(MCA) bypass surgery is performed. The operation is the modified EDAS which basically similar to EDAS, but the surgical incision is as low as possible. And if necessary, the STA may not be preserved. The bone flap should be large enough to select the right recipient blood vessel.</description>
