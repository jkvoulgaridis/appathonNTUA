  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TolaSure is a topical gel for the promotion of wound healing. This phase I study will assess
      the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of TolaSure when applied to skin wounds created
      by punch biopsy in healthy participants. A total of 26 healthy volunteers, males and females
      ages 18 years or older, will be enrolled. Subjects will monitored for safety and efficacy
      over the course of 2 weeks following daily topical administration of TolaSure.

    <description>Cutaneous tolerability will include an evaluation of erythema and edema following the modified Draize scoring system. Draize scores will be recorded and changes from baseline Draize scores will be monitored over the course of the time frame.
Draize Scoring System. Erythema: 0-No Erythema, 1-Slight Erythema, 2-Well Defined Erythema, 3- Moderate or Severe Erythema, 4- Severe Erythema or slight eschar formation.
Edema: 0- No Edema, 1- Very Slight Edema(barely perceptible), 2-Slight Edema (well defined edges), 3-Moderate Edema (raised &gt;1mm), 4- Severe Edema (raised &gt;1mm and extending beyond the area of exposure)</description>
