  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated CVD risk is a significant public health problem that contributes greatly to the
      increased morbidity and shortened lifespan of individuals with RA and PsA. Over the past
      decades, there has been great progress into the understanding of the severity of CVD risk in
      these patients but these risk factors are not well managed. The development of the high-risk
      strategy is therefore necessary, with more intensive therapy reserved for patients identified
      as high-risk, e.g. because they have high-risk FRS. However, these risk scores
      under-estimated CV risk in patients with RA and PsA. An intermediate approach is to use
      quantification of preclinical vascular disease to further identify high-risk patients.
      Results from this study will provide clinical implications in terms of detecting and managing
      cardiovascular morbidity in patients with RA and PsA.

      Objectives This study investigates the impact of a nurse-led programme on cardiovascular (CV)
      risk screening with and without carotid ultrasound for carotid plaque on CV risk factor
      control in asymptomatic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients.

      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that CV risk stratification and management in RA and
      PsA may be improved by incorporation of carotid ultrasound to assess for carotid plaque.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Framingham Risk Score is a gender-specific algorithm used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual. Individuals with low risk have 10% or less CHD risk at 10 years, with intermediate risk 10-20%, and with high risk 20% or more. Change in Framingham risk score between subject in two group will be evaluated. A positive change in score indicates increased CV risk, vice versa.</description>

    <intervention_name>Atorvastatin</intervention_name>
    <description>Group 1 patients will be prescribed statin when FRS &gt; 10%; while group patients will be prescribed statin upon presence of carotid plaque as reported from carotid ultrasound. The decision will solely be made base on the randomized group by either FRS&gt;10% or presence of carotid plaque.
Atorvastatin 20 mg is recommended as the preferred initial high intensity statin to use because it is clinically and cost effective for the primary prevention of CVD according to the national institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline from the United Kingdom.</description>
