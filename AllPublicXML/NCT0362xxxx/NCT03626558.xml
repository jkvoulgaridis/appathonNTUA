  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability throughout the world. Motor function deficit
      is one of the common consequences. It is usually described for the peripheral muscles that
      there is a cortical representation contralaterale with a crossed cortico-spinal route: the
      consequence is a contralaterale motor disorder on the brain damage.

      The impact of a stroke on diaphragm movements have been described in 6 studies: however, they
      were all observational and transversal studies evaluating diaphragm function.

      Assessment using diaphragm thickness is another technique described in the literature.
      Visualization of diaphragm in the zone of apposition allows to assess diaphragm thickness at
      inspiration and expiration. The impact of a stroke on diaphragm thickening has been reported
      in only one recent observational study.

      It seems that diaphragm would be damaged after a stroke, but unilateral or bilateral
      dysfonction is yet to be confirmed. Moreover, only a few measurements were performed in these
      studies, and not a diaphragm function follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, no longitudinal study evaluated diaphragm movements and diaphragm thickness
      fraction. This study is a preliminary study which aims to evaluate diaphragm function after a
      stroke and its evaluation within the first months.

      Starting hypothesis is the following: after a stroke, patients with a unilateral motor
      dysfunction have a diaphragm dysfunction predominant on the same side as the motor
      dysfunction. After a few months, retrieval is insufficient and they could benefit from a
      specific reinforcement program.

    <description>For every patient include in the study, ultrasound measures at the admission/discharge of hospitalization will be realized.
All the patients will see each other suggested participating in a new collection of remote ultrasound measures of the stroke (around 2-3 months). These measures will be made during the usual consultation proposed by the department of neurology. This medical consultation is a part of the follow-up post--stroke recommended by the High Authority of Health. These measures will allow us to highlight the kinetics of recovery of the diaphragmatic function except any intervention of reeducation of muscles inspirers.</description>
