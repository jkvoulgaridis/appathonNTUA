      This study is a prospective cohort study.The main study content is the feasibility and
      advantages of painless indwelling catheter in perioperative period of uniportal
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in lobectomy of lung cancer,divided into exposed and
      non-exposed groups.The exposed group was painless indwelled urethral catheter, the
      non-exposed group was indwelled urethral catheter routinely.

      This study is a prospective cohort study.The main study content is the feasibility and
      advantages of painless indwelling catheter in perioperative period of uniportal
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in radical resection of lung cancer,divided into exposed
      and non-exposed groups,divided into exposed and non-exposed groups.Communicating with the
      surgeon and patients who meet the inclusion criteria, decide whether to enter the exposed or
      non-exposed group.The exposed group was painless indwelled urethral catheter, the non-exposed
      group was indwelled urethral catheter routinely.By collecting personal information of two
      groups of patients and the corresponding observation indicators to analyze whether the
      painless indwelling urethral catheters in lobectomy of lung cancer is more beneficial than
      the indwelled urethral catheter routinely in lobectomy of lung cancer, and it is safe and
      feasible.
