    <textblock>
      A dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      efficacy of venetoclax, in combination with gilteritinib, in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have failed to respond to, and/or have
      relapsed or progressed after at least 1 prior therapy.
