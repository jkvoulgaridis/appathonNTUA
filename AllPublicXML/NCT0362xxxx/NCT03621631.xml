  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to identify the biomechanical mechanisms of Tai Chi (TC) exercise
      and test a novel optimized TC intervention by modifying newly identified mechanisms for those
      with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to assess the changes in mechanical load with the
      intervention. It combines unique real time torque biofeedback approach, and uses external
      knee adduction moment (EKAM) as modulation target tailored to TC intervention in this
      population. The potential benefit from this project is to provide biomechanical insights of
      TC and this novel TC approach may produce meaningful changes of mechanical load in these
      patients who can learn and practice safely during this intervention.

    <textblock>
      Disabilities that arise from typical impairments of knee osteoarthritis (OA) include
      decreased muscle strength, reduced range of motion, and decreased aerobic cardiovascular
      function. A large number of individuals with knee OA experience disability and require
      rehabilitation. Traditional TC intervention has been a promising therapeutic intervention in
      knee OA, but the efficacy of TC as a knee OA intervention has proven inconclusive presumably
      because individuals with knee OA perform different TC components (steps) with widely varying
      mechanical knee joint loads. This variation could be a confounding factor in the way in which
      TC affects knee OA. Therefore, a feasibility study is proposed here to quantify external knee
      adduction moment (EKAM) response to the different TC steps, and then determine if it is
      feasible to use biofeedback of torque acting on the knee to modify some TC steps so as to
      reduce the EKAM they produce. Those TC steps whose EKAM can be easily reduced below mean EKAM
      during walking and those already below that level will constitute an optimized form of TC for
      knee OA; the remainder will be discarded. A phase 1 randomized controlled trial will be
      conducted to compare the optimized TC intervention to traditional TC training in reducing
      EKAM. The proposed research represents the first study to identify the biomechanical
      mechanisms of TC and to target EKAM by using a real-time biofeedback approach to manipulate
      EKAM during TC performance.
