    <textblock>
      Retrospective, multicenter study including pts with metastatic pancreatic cancer who started
      first-line treatment with napaclitaxel plus Gemcitabine between December 2013 and June 2015
      according to the routine practice. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)
      were assessed for the total sample and the exploratory subgroups based on treatment and
      clinical characteristics of the study pts.

      This observational, retrospective, multicenter study included patients with metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma (either recurrent or de novo) from 20 Spanish hospitals, who
      started first-line chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®, Celgene Europe Limited) plus
      gemcitabine between December 2013 and June 2015 according to routine clinical practice. The
      record included all adult patients (i.e., aged ≥ 18 years) with measurable metastatic disease
      at baseline in at least one dimension of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST), version 1.1,[15] who received at least one dose of combined treatment with
      nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. Data were retrieved from patients' medical records and
      lasted until death or the closure of the database on 16 March 2017. All patients signed the
      corresponding informed consent for their clinical data being used in this study, which was
      conducted in accordance with the local personal data protection law (LOPD 15/1999). The study
      protocol was approved by the local independent ethics committee.
