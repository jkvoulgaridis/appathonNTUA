  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a most common, heterogeneous, complex endocrinopathy
      disease.Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in the treatment of PCOS for many
      years. However, the mechanism underlying TCM remains obscure and challenging.In the present
      study, a metabolomics approach based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)
      coupled with linear ion trap Orbi-trap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbi-trap MS) is used to
      investigate serum metabolic changes of TCM intervention to PCOS.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PCOS diagnostic criteria: According to the diagnostic criteria revised by the European
             Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the American Society for Reproductive
             Medicine at the Rotterdam in 2003, PCOS patients can be diagnosed if two of the three
             criteria are present after excluding congenial adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's
             syndrome, androgen secreting tumors, or other related disorders. The three criteria
             are (1) oligo- and/or anovulation; (2) clinical and/or biochemical signs of
             hyperandrogenism (clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism include presence of
             acne, hirsutism, and androgenic alopecia); (3) polycystic ovaries by ultrasound
             examination: presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2-9 mm on
             diameter and/or ovarian volume&gt;10 ml.

          -  Age between 14 and 40 years.

          -  2 years after menarche

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Administration of other medications known to affect reproductive function or
             metabolism within the past three months, including oral contraceptives,
             Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists, anti androgens,
             gonadotropins, anti-obesity drugs, Chinese herbal medicines, anti diabetic drugs such
             as metformin and thiazolidinediones, somatostatin, diazoxide, and calcium channel
             blockers.

          -  Patients with other endocrine disorders including 21-hydroxylase deficiency,
             hyperprolactinemia, uncorrected thyroid disease, suspected Cushing's syndrome.

          -  Patients with known severe organ dysfunction or mental illness.
