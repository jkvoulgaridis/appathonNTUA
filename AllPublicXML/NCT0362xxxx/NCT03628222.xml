      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance and safety of electromagnetic
      navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) system and system kit (iLungTM SuperNavigator) .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, randomized, multicenter, superiority study. 8 top centers in China was
      chosen. Subject which has peripheral lung lesions (PLLs) detected by chest CT scan, requires
      biopsy diagnosis, and meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be included in this
      trial. Firstly physician determines the lesion biopsied, then the subject will be randomized
      to experimental or control group. The experimental group is treated with ENB guided
      transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB)(ENB-TBLB): Under ENB guidance, the location sensor reaches
      the edge of the lesion, and X-ray is used for actual distance confirmation, if physician
      determines the distance is enough for biopsy, TBLB will be conducted. The control group will
      be treated with TBLB using X-ray guidance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the diagnostic yield of ENB-TBLB with that of X-ray-TBLB</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic yield = Lesions with definitive diagnosis /total lesions with biopsies.
Comment: Lesions with definitive diagnosis: 1. Biopsy pathologic results show as benign or malignant lesion (fungi, tuberculosis, or nodule disease,etc.); 2. Biopsy pathologic results are abnormal lung tissue, but through later diagnosis, treatment and other observation measures, the lesion is proved to be benign; 3. When the patient cannot be diagnosed after a 6-month following-up, a CT or enhanced CT scan is needed and the physician make a final diagnosis based on the scan results.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of navigation success</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 day of ENB procedure</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome just apply to experimental group. Incidence of navigation success = the number of lesions navigated successfully/total lesions with ENB procedure × 100%.
Criteria for navigation success: When the navigation software shows the distance of location sensor to the target ≤10mm, using X-ray to confirm the actual distance, if the physician determine that biopsy can be conducted, the navigation is successful, if not, the navigation fails.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lesion detection rate</measure>
    <time_frame>About 3-7days after ENB or X-ray procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the biopsy pathologic results, evaluate the lesion detection rate of experimental and control group.
Lesion detection rate = Total lesions detected / Total lesions with biopsies. Comment: 'Lesions detected' indicates pathologic result shows as abnormal lung tissue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Navigation time</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 day of ENB or X-ray procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate navigation time of experimental and control group. Experimental group: After registration, the location sensor returns the carina. Navigation begins from the carina and ends when the sensor reaches the edge of the lesion, which is verified by the X-ray. This period is defined as navigation time of experimental group.
Control group: Under X-ray guidance, the bronchoscope moves from the carina to the edge of the lesion. This period is defined as navigation time of control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the user satisfaction of ENB system and system kit</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 day of ENB procedure</time_frame>
    <description>After each ENB procedure, the investigator evaluate the operational performance of ENB system and system kit through a pre-designed questionnaire which includes terms related to the device function, convenience, reliability and safety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The adverse events and device defects related to the ENB system and system kit</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events: Include incidence of pneumothorax, bleeding, respiratory failure, etc.</description>

The location catheter is inserted into the guide catheter beforehand, then both are introduced via the working channel of the bronchoscope. Under guidance of ENB system, the location catheter reaches the lesion, and actual distance is confirmed by the X-ray.
TBLB: Location catheter is retracted, then the biopsy forceps and brush was introduced, and pathologic specimens are obtained.</description>
