  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept, single center study for the donation of HCV-positive kidney to
      HCV negative recipient patients, with preemptive, interventional treatment with 12 weeks of
      commercially available DAA therapy to prevent HCV transmission upon transplantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if preoperative dosing and sustained administration of
      pan-genotypic DAA therapy after kidney transplantation prevents the transmission of hepatitis
      C virus (HCV) infection from an HCV positive donor kidney to an HCV naïve recipient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Met MGH transplant center criteria and already listed for kidney transplant

          -  No available living kidney donor

          -  Has ≤ 730 days (two years) of accrued transplant waiting time if blood type A and ≤

             &lt;15mL/min/1.73m2 at the time of screening

          -  Must agree to birth control. Women must agree to use birth control in accordance with
             Mycophenolate Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy and at least one barrier method

          -  Weigh at least 50kg

          -  Serum ALT within normal limits with no history of liver disease

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to tacrolimus that would require administration of
             cyclosporine rather than tacrolimus given the known drug-drug interaction between
             cyclosporine and Mavyret

          -  Positive donor specific antibodies or positive cross match deemed to be clinically
             relevant and increasing risk of rejection per the transplant surgeon or nephrologist
