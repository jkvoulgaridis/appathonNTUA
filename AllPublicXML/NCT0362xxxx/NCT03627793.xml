  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the age of 40-45 years muscle mass and function progressively decline, reducing older
      peoples' abilities to perform tasks of daily living and also increase the risk of falls. It
      is known that, across the life course, resistance exercise can be of benefit in increasing
      muscle mass and function, yet how hard the exercise should be performed has received little
      attention. Current recommendations are for older people to perform exercise at 70% of the
      maximum they can lift, quite a high intensity that often puts older people off participating.
      Recent evidence in younger people has suggested that such intensities are not required.

      The investigators aim to determine the feasibility of a study to investigate recruitment and
      adherence of older people to a study of exercise training at different intensities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cohort will comprise two sets of participants: frail older adults and non-frail older
      adults.

      Each participant will receive 8 weeks of twice weekly supervised resistance training. Both
      the frail and non-frail participants will be randomised into either receiving high load
      resistance training or low load resistance training. High load resistance training will be
      delivered at 70% of the participants maximal capacity and low load resistance training will
      be delivered at 30% of maximal capacity. All resistance training will focus on the lower limb
      and regardless of intensity each exercise will be done to failure (unable to complete another
      full repetition).
