  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a novel block developed by Forero to treat severe
      neuropathic pain and was firstly reported in 2016. Anatomical and radiological investigations
      in fresh cadavers indicate that its site of action is likely at the dorsal and ventral rami
      of the thoracic spinal nerves. The ESP block has a clear and simple sonoanatomy, it is easy
      to perform, not time consuming and generally well tolerated by the patients. So, the
      investigators believed that the ESP block may be an effective and safer alternative to
      paravertebral block, epidural analgesia and other myofascial thoracic wall blocks in breast
      surgery and designed a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial for pain management.

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric rating scale (NRS) at rest and in motion will be recorded at intervals. NRS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. The NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Degree of sedation</measure>

    <description>Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) will be used to assess degree of sedation. The RSS was designed as a test of arousability. The RSS scores sedation at six different levels, according to how arousable the patient is. The RSS defines the conscious state from a level 1: the patient is anxious, agitated or restless, through the continuum of sedation to a level 6: the patient is completely unresponsive.</description>

    <description>The bilateral erector spine plane (ESP) block will be performed with ultrasound guided, preoperatively. Following antiseptic preparation of block site with povidone iodine, ultrasound probe will be placed 3 cm lateral to spine at T5 level. After identifying the erector spinae muscle and transverse process, the overlying skin will be infiltrated with local anesthetics and 20 mL local anesthetics (10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine + 10 mL 1% lidocaine) will be injected deep to the erector spinae muscle. The same procedure will be performed on the other side. Also, patients will receive intravenous patient controlled analgesia with morphine, and 1 g acetaminophen for supplemental analgesia if pain score raises over 5/10 on NRS and 50 mg meperidine for rescue analgesic for persistent pain.
