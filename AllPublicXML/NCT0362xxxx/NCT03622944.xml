  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of exercise and two different manual therapy
      methods on pain, quality of life and posture in people with neck pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep friction massage will use on cervical regions in first group, muscle energy technic will
      use second group and cervical stabilization exercise will use as an third group. For all
      groups, pain intensity, Quality of life and posture will assess.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in pain sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline PPT at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>pressure pain threshold (PPT) was measured with digital algometer. Pressure pain threshold which identifies minimum levels increasing mechanical stimulus is gold standard method for measuring pain sensitivity. PPT was measured from cervical vertebrae's spinous process and muscle belly's. Algometer range was set 0 kgF to 12kgF. Higher values represent increased pressure sensation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Light touch sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline light touch sensation at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Semmes weinstein monofilaments were used to determine light touch sensation. It has twenty different evaluator size. Evaluator size was started 2.83 point and higher values represent worse outcome. Upper extremity dermatomes were tested.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in upper extremity disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline disability at six weeks .</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire was used.The questionnaire has 34 item which each item scored 1 to 5 points. All responses summed and averaged.This value is then transformed to a score out of 100 by subtracting one and multiplying by 25. This transformation is done to make the score easier to compare to other measures scaled on a 100 scale. Minimum score is &quot;0&quot; and total score is &quot;100&quot;. higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in posture</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline posture at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Posture was assessed with global postural system. This computer generated system has two cameras and lets three different plane postural assessment. the assessments and postural deviation calculate with computer programme.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in perceived life quality</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline life quality at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>perceived quality of life was assessed with nottingham health profile. the questionnaire has 38 questions in 6 subareas, with each question assigned a weighted value; the sum of all weighted values in a given subarea adds up to 100. higher values represent better life quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline functional disability at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neck Disability Index (NDI) was used.NDI total scores ranged from 0 (no disability) to 50 (severe disability) which have ten items assessing perceived neck pain during daily living activities such as lifting, reading, driving, sleeping and recreational activities.</description>
