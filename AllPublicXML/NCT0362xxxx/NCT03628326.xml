      Anatomic variations of the pulmonary arterial tree can cause technical difficulties during
      pulmonary lobectomy in general and video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Using CT
      angiography and 3D reconstruction, the investigators sought to identify anatomic variations
      of the pulmonary arterial tree and assess their respective frequencies.

      Purpose Anatomic variations of the pulmonary arterial tree can cause technical difficulties
      during pulmonary lobectomy in general and video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Using CT
      angiography and 3D reconstruction, the investigators sought to identify anatomic variations
      of the pulmonary arterial tree and assess their respective frequencies. Methods the
      investigators retrospectively studied 88 pulmonary arterial trees in 44 patients having
      undergone VATS lobectomy for lung cancer over an 18-month period in Amiens University
      Hospital's Department of Thoracic Surgery. Each CT angiography with 3D reconstruction of the
      pulmonary arterial tree was performed by two experienced operators, according to a
      standardized procedure.

    <description>The primary objective of the present study was to use CT angiography and 3D reconstruction to assess the pulmonary arterial tree and its anatomic variations in patients having undergone VATS lobectomy for stage I-II lung cancer. The investigators studied patients having undergone VATS lobectomy for stage I-II lung cancer at the Amiens University Hospital's Department of Thoracic Surgery between October 2012 and March 2014. The investigators performed 3D reconstruction of the pulmonary arterial tree on the CT angiography data set acquired during preoperative work-up. Patients having undergone CT angiography in another hospital, those not having undergone CT angiography of the arterial tree, and those having been operated on more than once for lung cancer were excluded from the study.</description>
