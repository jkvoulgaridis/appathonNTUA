      This study is a multi-center, multi-national, open label, single arm phase 2 study of
      single-agent denosumab.

      The objective of the trial is to evaluate the risk versus benefit of denosumab in maintenance
      setting in patients requiring long-term use (&gt; 1 year) of denosumab. For that purpose, the
      treatment schedule with reduced dose density (120mg SC 12-weekly instead of 4-weekly) will be
      investigated, starting after 1-year (12-15 months) of denosumab full dose, as per current
      label. The impact on OsteoNecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) without compromising disease control will
      be assessed.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven primary or metastatic unresectable GCTB or resectable GCTB but
             not a candidate for surgery, excluding primary or metastatic GCTB in the jaw.

          -  Evidence of active disease at time of registration based on local investigator's
             assessment (according to RECIST v1.1)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old and skeletally mature (ie, radiographic evidence of at least 1
             mature long bone (e.g. humerus with closed growth epiphyseal plate)

          -  Patient must have received denosumab before entering this trial:

          -  The duration of treatment with full dose denosumab (120 mg SC ) as per current label
             must be at least 12 months and patient may have received up to 15 months of denosumab.

          -  And patient must have received at least 12 doses of denosumab 120 mg before entering
             into this trial.

          -  ECOG/WHO PS 0-2

          -  Albumin-adjusted serum calcium level ≥ 2.0 mmol/L (8.0 mg/dL)

          -  Representative formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor blocks or unstained tissue
             slides, either from the primary tumor or a metastatic lesion, must be available for
             histological central review.

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum (or urine)
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first reduced dose of study treatment.

          -  WOCBP should use adequate birth control measures, as defined by the investigator,
             during the study treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last treatment
             cycle. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as a method which results
             in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and
             correctly. Such methods include:

          -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)

             of the patient)

          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first
             dose of study treatment and until 5 months after the last study treatment.

          -  Treatment with other investigational device or drug 30 days prior to registration
