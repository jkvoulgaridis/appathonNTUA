  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver does not function properly due to long-term
      damage. This damage is characterized by the replacement of normal liver tissue by scar
      tissue.

      The liver carries out several necessary functions, including synthesis of proteins
      participating in blood coagulation process. Some of these proteins contribute to coagulation
      and others make blood more fluid. In healthy people there is a balance between the two.

      In cirrhotic patient, there is an imbalance inducing hypercoagulation (hypercoagulability
      state). Cirrhotic patients are so known to be at risk of vein thrombosis (for example portal
      vein thrombosis: clot in hepatic vein).

      Mechanisms leading to this imbalance are unclear. Studies need to be completed to improve
      patient's management.

      The EPCRs (Endothelial Protein C Receptor soluble) takes part in blood coagulation process.
      Previous studies have shown that blood levels of EPCRs are increased in patients with
      cirrhosis.

      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate if the EPCRs could play a role in
      cirrhosis-associated hypercoagulability state.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three groups will be constitued: one with cirrhotic patients, one with healthy volunteers,
      and one with patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer (previous studies
      have also shown that blood levels of EPCRs are increased in these patients).

      All participants will undergo a unique visit at hospital. An informed consent will be
      obtained before any related study procedures*.

      * procedures: physical examination (including height, weight, waist measurement), vital signs
      (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature), medical history, concomitant medication, blood
      sample.
