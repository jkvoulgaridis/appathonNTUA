  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there are markers in plasma that can be used to
      develop a diagnostic panel for early detection and diagnosis of high grade serous epithelial
      ovarian cancer.

      This study has two phases: &quot;Discovery&quot; cohort and &quot;Validation&quot; cohort.

      The &quot;Discovery&quot; phase of this study will obtain tissue samples in a retrospective manner. The
      investigators will perform genome-scale DNA Methylation analysis to obtain a panel of
      candidate methylated DNA biomarkers. Twenty archival primary serous epithelial ovarian cancer
      and twenty archival normal ovarian and salpingeal tissues will be identified by running a
      report of diagnosis.

      During the &quot;Validation&quot; phase of this study, blood and tissue samples will be obtained in a
      prospective manner. The patients will be undergoing consultation for undiagnosed pelvic mass
      and are being scheduled for a diagnostic laparoscopic biopsy. At the time of their
      consultation, patients will be recruited and consented for this phase of the study.

      During the retrospective phase of the study, archival tissue samples will undergo
      genome-scale DNA methylation analysis (Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, RRBS).

      Blood and tissue samples will be obtained from patients who consent to enroll in the
      prospective phase of this study. Samples will undergo a biomarker validation by performing
      quantitative RT-PCRs for methylated DNA biomarkers.
