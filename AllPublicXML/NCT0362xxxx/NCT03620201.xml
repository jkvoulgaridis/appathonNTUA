  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 (M7824) works
      in treating patients with stage II-III HER2 positive breast cancer. Immunotherapy with M7824
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the change in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) percentage pre and post
      M7824 therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of M7824 in early stage breast cancer (stage
      II/III).

      II. To evaluate pathological response at the time of surgery after 2 doses of M7824 followed
      by neoadjuvant (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) HER2 targeted therapy in
      combination with chemotherapy of physician's choice.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate imaging based response to M7824. II. To evaluate potential systemic and tumor
      based predictive biomarker candidates of response.

      III. To evaluate immune responses induced by exposure to M7824 systemically and in tumor
      microenvironment (TME).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on
      days 1 and 15. During days 28-56 patients receive planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
