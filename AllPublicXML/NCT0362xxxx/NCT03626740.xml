  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining dental pulp vitality is crucial for tooth preservation and functionality.
      Untreated dental caries may lead to pulp necrosis and infection, affecting children's growth
      and well-being. The first permanent teeth erupt around 6 years old. These are the first
      molars (FPM), which are frequently affected by caries, soon after their eruption.

      In the present application, our main goal is to determine whether two treatment groups (MTA
      and TheraCal) are long-term effective in preserving pulp vitality among children' FPM
      affected by deep caries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the most frequently used materials for pulp capping are calcium hydroxide, mineral
      trioxide aggregate (MTA), and, more recent, TheraCal. All of them are biocompatible and
      induce the formation of coronal hard tissue barriers (tertiary reparative dentin). Calcium
      hydroxide, considered for a long time the gold standard of direct pulp capping materials, has
      excellent antibacterial and remineralisant properties; however, it lacks adhesion, especially
      at moist dentin, and reparative dentin is less homogenous.

      MTA proved to stimulate protective dentin bridge formation without inflammatory changes and
      least necrosis. It is also moisture tolerant, but it is more expensive, has poor handling
      characteristics and slow setting time.

      TheraCal bonds to deep moist dentin, has strong physical properties, no solubility, high
      radioopacity and higher calcium releasing abilities than MTA or calcium hydroxide.

    <description>Pulpal survival is defined by positive response without lingering sensation to the cold test, absence of clinical signs and symptoms, and no apical radiolucency on the periapical radiograph.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of apical root maturation (apexogenesis)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will investigate the treatment effect on apexogenesis in children who had incomplete root formation at the beginning of the study and preserve their pulp vitality at the end of the study. The outcome will be compared radiographically with apical maturation in molar pairs (healthy contralateral molar, where applicable).</description>
