  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by t(15;17)(q24;21) and the fusion gene
      PML-RARA. We have formulated an oral preparation of As2O3 (oral-As2O3), and shown that it is
      efficacious for APL in R1, inducing CR2 in more than 90% of patients. Furthermore, in an
      effort to prevent relapse, we have moved oral-As2O3 forward to the maintenance of CR1. This
      strategy results in favorable overall-survival (OS) and leukemia-free-survival (LFS),
      implying that prolonged treatment with oral-As2O3 may prevent relapses. Current protocols
      have incorporated i.v.-As2O3 in the treatment of newly-diagnosed APL. In regimens comprising
      i.v.-As2O3, ATRA and chemotherapy, 5-year overall survivals in excess of 90% is achieved. In
      this study, we evaluate the use of oral-As2O3 and ATRA based induction regimens in newly
      diagnosed patients with APL. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      frontline oral arsenic trioxide-based regimen in newly diagnosed patients with acute
      promyelocytic leukaemia
