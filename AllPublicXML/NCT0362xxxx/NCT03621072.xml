    <textblock>
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) initiated a generic consistency evaluation program
      to evaluate the quality and efficacy of the products manufactured in China in 2016. This is a
      bioequivalence study to support the program and to demonstrate the bioequivalence between the
      150 mg fluconazole capsule manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China (the localized originator,
      Test) and the 150 mg fluconazole capsule manufactured at Pfizer Fareva, Amboise, France (the
      originator, Reference) in healthy Chinese subjects under fasted and fed conditions. This
      open-lable, randomized, single-dose 2-way crossover study will enroll approximately 18
      subjects for each condition. The primary endpoints are fluconazole area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve from time zero to 72 hours post-dose (AUC72) and Cmax.

    <textblock>
      This trial is a bioequivalence study to support a generic consistency evaluation program,
      initiated by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), for the evaluation of quality and
      efficacy of the products manufactured in China. The selected strength of 150 mg capsule is
      the approved highest strength of capsule formulation in China. The 150 mg dose was selected
      for evaluation in this study as it is one of the commonly used clinically approved doses. The
      primary objective is to demonstrate the bioequivalence between the 150 mg fluconazole capsule
      manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China (the localized originator, Test) and the 150 mg
      fluconazole capsule manufactured at Pfizer Fareva, Amboise, France (the originator,
      Reference) administered as a single oral dose in healthy Chinese subjects under fasted and
      fed conditions. The primary endpoints are fluconazole area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve from time zero to 72 hours post-dose (AUC72) and peak plasma
      concentrations (Cmax).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fluconazole
      administered as a single oral dose of 150 mg capsule manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China and
      150 mg capsule manufactured at Pfizer Fareva, Amboise, France in healthy Chinese subjects
      under fasted and fed conditions. The secondary endpoint is adverse events (AEs). Other
      endpoints include time to reach Cmax (Tmax) of fluconazole, safety laboratory tests and vital
      signs.

      In each group, subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment sequences. Each
      treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods, separated by a washout period of at least 14
      days between each period.

      On Day 1 of each period in both groups, each subject will be administered investigational
      product at approximately 8:00 AM (Â± 2 hours). Blood samples for the analysis of fluconazole
      in plasma will be collected at pre-dose (within 1 hour prior to dosing) and at 0.25, 0.5, 1,
      1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 48 and 72 hours post dose in each period. Vital signs,
      physical examination, laboratory tests and 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed
      at specified times. Tolerability and safety will be assessed for all treatments by monitoring
      AEs.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          5. Subjects must be of Chinese ethnicity (individuals currently residing in mainland
             China who were born in China and have both parents of Chinese descent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          3. A positive urine drug screen.

          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for female subjects or
             14 drinks/week for male subjects (1 drink = 150 mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or (45 mL
             of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

          5. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day within 3 months of Screening; a positive urine nicotine test.

          6. Treatment with an investigational drug (which has not been approved for registration)
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of investigational product. If the
             investigational drug has a long elimination half-life, the washout period will be
             longer with a recommendation of five elimination half-lives.

          7. Screening BP &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least 5
             minutes of rest. If BP is &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to
             determine the subject's eligibility.

          8. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec or
             a QRS complex &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential and fertile male subjects who are unwilling
             or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this

             in this protocol.

         17. Subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of
             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.

         18. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
