    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of an experimental power
      brush to a regular manual brush in the reduction of gingivitis and dental plaque over an 8
      week period by using the Modified Gingival Index, the Gingival Bleeding Index and the Rustogi
      Modification of the Navy Plaque Index.
