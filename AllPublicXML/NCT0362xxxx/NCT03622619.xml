  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, Manuka honey has been used to combat against bacteria and reduce inflammation
      (the body's way of reacting to infection, irritation or other injury). Due to the
      inflammatory nature of dry eye, Manuka eye drops show promise as a treatment for dry eye
      disease. The aim of this research is to compare the effects of two over the counter eye drops
      that are used to treat dry eye conditions over a one month period.

      The aim of the present study is to conduct a randomised clinical trial to compare the effect
      on tear film properties and dry eye signs and symptoms of Optimel Manuka eye drops compared
      to Systane Ultra, a widely available over the counter aqueous tear supplement as a control
      eye drop. This investigation will involve a minimum of 40 participants who have dry eye, who
      are randomly put into two groups receiving either Optimel Manuka drops or Systane Ultra used
      three times daily for one month. Both of these products are commercially available in
      Australia. Results from this study will inform practitioners as to the potential benefits of
      Manuka eye drops on tear film characteristics and signs and symptoms of dry eye.
