  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications are one of the most common complications after surgery.

      Noninvasive ventilation has been proposed post-operatively to prevent postoperative pulmonary
      complications.

      Prophylactic noninvasive ventilation performed systematically in a non-specific population is
      without interest.

      The difficulty for the practitioner is to target patients at higher risk of developing a
      postoperative pulmonary complications in order to guiding them to a post-operative
      specialized care pathway.

      The use of the ARISCAT score, validated on a large European prospective cohort, makes it
      possible to evaluate, preoperatively, the risk of occurrence of postoperative pulmonary
      complication in the patient.

      The hypothesis of the present research is that early postoperative preventive treatment with
      noninvasive ventilation, in patients at risk of postoperative pulmonary complications
      according to the preoperative evaluation according to the ARISCAT score, could have an
      interest in reducing these complications with a superior efficiency over standard techniques.

    <textblock>
      After verification of eligibility criteria and ARISCAT score, patients at high risk of COPD
      are randomized in the study.

      At the exit of the operating room, patients are referred to the services according to their
      randomization arm :

        -  arm with prophylactic noninvasive ventilation in intensive care unit. Patients will
           receive noninvasive ventilation for a maximum of 48 hours. Sessions last 1 hour and are
           repeated every 2 to 3 hours

        -  arm with standard care in conventional care unit. Patients receive standard care such as
           physiotherapy.

      In both arms, patient follow-up is 7 days maximum.
