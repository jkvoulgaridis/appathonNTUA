  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic approach for patients with cancers. Patients with
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing early relapse less than 18 months from
      diagnosis had very poor prognosis with 5-year survival rate of 21% (1). Recent clinical
      trials demonstrated that infusions of autologous T cell modified with chimeric antigen
      receptors (CARs) induced durable complete remissions in patients with relapse or refractory
      B-cell ALL (2-4). The editors of Science Journal announced cancer immunotherapy as the
      breakthrough of the year for 2013 (5). On Jan 30, 2015, Dr. Steven M. Altschuler, chief
      executive officer of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and 9-year-old ALL patient Emily
      Whitehead with 3-year leukemia free after CAR-T cell infusion were invited to White House for
      President Barack Obama's announcement of the Precision Medicine Initiative. The MIT
      Technology Review announced that the top one breakthrough technology in 2016 is genetically
      engineered immune cells saving the lives of cancer patients. This project will focus on the
      manufacturing of clinical-grade anti-CD19 CARs for B-cell malignancies in the future clinical
      trials.
