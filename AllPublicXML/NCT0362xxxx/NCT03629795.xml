      Blood samples collected will be shipped to the sponsor's laboratory to establish analytical
      performance characteristics of the ADVIA Centaur® Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein A
      (PAPP-A) and ADVIA Centaur® Free Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (Free βhCG) assays.

      Blood samples are to be collected from pregnant women attending their scheduled 1st Trimester
      scan; the samples are to be collected immediately after the subject's routine blood sample at
      the clinic visit. No extra venepuncture will be required.
