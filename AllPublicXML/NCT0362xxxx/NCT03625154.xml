  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the failure rate and difference in
      clinical outcomes between operative and non operative treatment of patients with Weber B
      lateral malleolus ankle fractures with medial clear space widening on gravity stress views.
      All patients presenting will be treated non operatively, and compared to an observational
      group comprised of patients with Weber B lateral malleolus ankle fractures without medial
      clear space widening, for which the standard of care is non operative management.

      Patients who decline non operative management and elect to undergo operative open reduction
      internal fixation with plates and screws will comprise an operative observational cohort.

      All patients will be followed for a total of 12 months from the time of injury. Clinical
      outcomes will be based on radiographic monitoring for ankle mortise congruency, as well as
      standardized SF-36 and AOFAS questionnaire scores.
