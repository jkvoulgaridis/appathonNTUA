      This study evaluates whether the addition of tetanizing burst therapy reduces the pain
      associated with ICD shocks

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The implantable cardioverter defibrillator is a device designed to rescue patients from
      life-threatening arrhythmias by delivering a defibrillation shock to allow restoration of
      cardiac rhythm. These defibrillation shocks are extremely painful, owing to sudden rapid
      contraction of thoracic and abdominal skeletal muscle, which, in addition to the heart, are
      stimulated by the defibrillation shock. Tetanizing Burst Therapy is a novel electrical
      waveform which tetanizes skeletal muscle with a brief burst of stimulation prior to the ICD
      shock, thereby reducing muscular contraction due to the shock. This study is designed for
      those patients who are already undergoing ICD replacement.

    <measure>Less pain after TBT impulse with ICD shock compared to ICD shock alone</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will receive 2 therapies in random order delivered 5 minutes apart:
Tetanizing Burst Therapy + shock; and
Pure shock alone. Using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) after each shock, the subject will be asked to provide a verbal score between 1 and 10, where 1 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The efficacy of tetanizing burst therapy in subjects undergoing ICD replacement as assessed by NRS verbal score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After each shock, a blinded assessor will ask the subject to provide an NRS verbal score between 1 and 10, where 1 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable. The percent change in the NRS score will be calculated for each subject along with the change in skeletal muscle force waveform</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety of tetanizing burst therapy in subjects undergoing ICD replacement as assessed by adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence rates of all adverse events will be calculated and compared to event rates in the literature. They will also be analyzed by severity and relationship to the device and/or study procedures.</description>
