      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity of AB154 as monotherapy and in combination with
      zimberelimab (AB122) in participants with advanced solid malignancies.

      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity of AB154 as monotherapy and in combination with
      zimberelimab in participants with advanced solid malignancies. In this dose escalation study,
      participants will receive AB154 administered intravenously as monotherapy or in combination
      with zimberelimab. Treatment will continue until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, or other reasons for study drug discontinuation occurs.

             period

          4. Participants with any pathologically confirmed solid tumor type for which no standard
             of care therapy exists

          5. Must have at least 1 measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The measurable lesion must be outside of a radiation field if
             the participant received prior radiation

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1

          7. Confirmation that an archival tissue sample is available and ≤ 6 months old; if not, a
             new biopsy of a tumor must be obtained

          8. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small-molecule therapy, immunotherapy (tumor vaccine,
             cytokine, or growth factor given to control the cancer) or biologic agents must have
             been discontinued at least 4 weeks before investigational product administration, and
             all AEs have either returned to baseline or ≤ Grade 1

          9. Immunosuppressive doses of systemic medications, such as corticosteroids or absorbed
             topical corticosteroids (doses &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be
             discontinued at least 2 weeks (14 days) before investigational product administration.
             Physiologic doses of corticosteroids ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent may
             be permitted

         10. Prior surgery that required general anesthesia or other major surgery as defined by

             make the administration of investigational product hazardous (eg, interstitial lung
             disease, active infections requiring antibiotics, recent hospitalization with
             unresolved symptoms)

          3. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          4. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 100 days after the last dose of AB154 as monotherapy and in combination with
             AB122.

          5. Participants who require a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to provide informed
             consent on their behalf.

          6. Any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or history
             of a syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except
             for vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Participants with asthma who require
             intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this
             study

          7. Prior malignancy active within the previous year except for locally curable cancers
             that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer,
             superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or prostate
             cancer

          8. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small-molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 or has not recovered from AEs due to a previously
             administered agent

          9. Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days or at least 5 half-lives before
