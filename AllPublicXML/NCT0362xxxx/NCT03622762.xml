  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most feared complications of Diabetes Mellitus type 2,
      characterized mainly by the decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and an increase in
      protein secretion by the kidney, that results in proteinuria. This has led to the development
      of intensive treatment regimens for patients with diabetes and preventive measures since once
      the complications have already presented the improvement of glycemic control alone may not be
      enough, to prevent the progression of pathological processes. Currently, interventions to
      delay the progression of kidney damage, include changes in lifestyle, nutritional advice and
      regular exercise, achieve optimal levels in glycemic control and use of pharmacological
      therapies with nephroprotector, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARBs) and
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). The most important biochemical mechanism
      proposed for this progression is the excessive binding of glucose to proteins, better
      described as the final products of advanced glycosylation (AGEs); the interaction of AGEs
      with its receptor (RAGE), participates in the metabolic and biochemical pathways in
      intracellular signaling, either by favoring or aggravating cell nephron damage. Recently,
      numerous RAGE isoforms have been described as: soluble RAGE, which are devoid of cytoplasmic
      domains, which bind to ligands that include AGEs and can antagonize intracellular signaling.
      Therefore, the need to seek for alternative therapies like nutraceuticals is arising, mainly
      due to its low toxicity and lower cost. Such is the case of green tea extract, which due to
      its chemical composition, especially of flavonoids that generate antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory effects, In vivo and in clinical trials have shown that it could impact the
      progression of the diabetic neuropathy , through the modulation of the biological process,
      including molecular and biochemical pathways such as release of soluble RAGE.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of the administration of green tea
      extract on soluble RAGE and renal damage in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, by means
      of a clinical trial, double blind, with randomization and placebo control group. In male and
      female population, with a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus type 2, under treatment with
      hypoglycemic agents and / or insulin and kidney damage, 2 - 3a grade according to
      classification of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines and HbA1c
      levels 9 - 12% who sign the letter of consent under information, from 35 to 65 years of age,
      residents of the metropolitan area of Guadalajara.

      All patients who meet the selection criteria and who sign their informed consent will be
      given the clinical history, as well as anthropometric and laboratory determinations. Once
      these values are known, the intervention will proceed with the research product, extract of
      green tea 400 mg twice a day or placebo 400 mg twice a day, this will be according to the
      technique of masking by the closed envelope technique for 12 weeks. Patients will be
      evaluated at 30, 60 and 90 days of intervention, for attachment assessment, tolerability of
      treatment, side effects and laboratory safety determinations. At the end of the 12 weeks of
      the intervention, the anthropometric and laboratory determinations will be made again as well
      as the determination of soluble RAGE by means of Elisa sandwich type, in serum obtained at
      the beginning and at 12 weeks of intervention.

      The database will be developed in the statistical program Statistical software (SPSS) version
      21.0. The qualitative variables will be expressed in frequencies and percentages, while the
      quantitative variables will be expressed in means and standard deviations, the normality test
      will be carried out through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and, according to the result, it will
      be decided for the analysis intra group perform paired t or Wilcoxon method and for
      intergroup t student or Mann-Whitney U. A value of p â‰¤0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant.
