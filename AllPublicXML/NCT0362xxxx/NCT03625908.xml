  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no definite conclusive work about the benefit of OCT-guided PCI, which should be
      determined in complex PCI, assuming better stent optimization by OCT. In the study, we will
      explore the clinical implication of OCT-guided PCI of complex lesions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either OCT-guided PCI arm and
      angiography-guided PCI with routine high pressure NC ballooning arm in 1:1 ratio. Within
      OCT-guided PCI arm, the use of OCT will be also assigned to full OCT-guidance arm and
      postprocedural OCT only arm. and comparison of stent implantation with and without
      preprocedural OCT will be evaluated by postprocedural OCT (OCT-defined stent optimization
      will be assessed). In angiography-guided PCI arm, PCI for complex lesion will be performed
      without guidance of intravascular imaging, and routine use of high pressure postdilation with
      NC balloon will be also recommended. Primary endpoint will be evaluated during 12 months
      after PCI.

    <description>The attainment(optimal or acceptable) of criteria regarding stent expansion is strongly recommended. As for the other criteria, further procedures could be decided by the operators' decisions considering the situations.
Stent expansion Optimal - meeting of all criteria Acceptable - meeting of any one criteria 1) MSA≥80% of mean reference lumen area 2) ≥100% of distal reference lumen area 3) MSA of &gt;4.5 mm2 in non-left main lesion
Stent apposition Optimal - acute stent malposition&lt;200μm Acceptable - acute stent malposition&lt;400μm
Edge dissection(Definition of major edge dissection; any one of the followings) 1) ≥60°of the circumference of the vessel at site of dissection 2) Length of dissection ≥3mm 3) Deeper vessel injury(intramural hematoma or penetration to the media or adventitia)</description>
