      Objective: To investigate the factors associated with improvement after intraarticular
      steroid injection for patients with Frozen shoulder

      Design: Prospective study.

      Participants: Patients with Frozen shoulder were recorded the demographic data, associated
      disease, ultrasound findings at baselines.

      Intervention: One shot intraarticular steroid hydrodilatation

      Main Outcome Measures: Visual analog scale (VAS) of the shoulder pain, Constant score, SPADI
      score, and angles of active and passive shoulder range of motion (flexion, abduction,
      external rotation, and internal rotation) at pre-treatment, post-treatment at week 8

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of constant shoulder score between week 0 and week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 8 wks</time_frame>
    <description>the total constant score ranges from 0 to 100 points, with higher scores indicative of better function. The score is divided into four sections: pain, activity of daily living, ROM and strength</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 8 wks</time_frame>
    <description>pain intensity was measured by visual analog scale. Each patient was asked to indicate his/her current level of pain by marking a point on a 100-mm VAS, for which 0 represented no pain and 100 represented unbearable pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain And disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 8 wks</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.</description>
