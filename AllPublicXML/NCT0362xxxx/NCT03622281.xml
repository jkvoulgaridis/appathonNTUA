    <textblock>
      Quality measures in colonoscopy are important guides for improving the quality of patient
      care. But quality improvement intervention is not taking place, primarily because of the
      inconvenience and expense. To address the difficulties above, we used artificial intelligence
      for quality control of colonoscopy.
