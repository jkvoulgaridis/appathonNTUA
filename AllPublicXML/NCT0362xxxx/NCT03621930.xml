  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The REspiratory Syncytial virus Consortium in EUrope (RESCEU) is an Innovative Medicine
      Initiative (IMI) funded by the EU under the H2020 framework to define and understand the
      burden of disease caused by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. RSV causes
      severe disease in individuals at the extremes of the age spectrum and in high risk groups. It
      was estimated that RSV was associated with 34 million cases of acute respiratory tract
      infection (ARTI), 3.4 million ARTI hospitalizations and 55,000 to 199,000 deaths in children
      &lt;5 years in 2005 worldwide. The estimated burden of disease in older adults is comparable
      with non-pandemic influenza A (for which a vaccine is available). These estimates were based
      on limited data and there is a substantial gap in knowledge on morbidity and associated
      healthcare and social costs in Europe. New vaccines and therapeutics against RSV are in
      development and could soon be available on the European market. RESCEU will deliver knowledge
      of the incidence and burden of RSV disease in young children and older adults in Europe,
      which is essential for stakeholders (governments, etc.) to take decisions about prophylaxis
      and treatment.

      Objective:

      To determine the burden of disease due to RSV in older adults.

      Study design:

      Prospective epidemiological, observational, multi-country, multicenter cohort study.

      Study population:

      Adults aged 60 years and up (n=1,000) of which approximately 50% is above 75 years of age.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The primary endpoints of the study are;

        -  The incidence of RSV infection-associated ARTI.

        -  RSV associated medically attended (MA) ARTI.

        -  RSV related hospitalization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, 1000 participants are recruited in three European countries (the Netherlands,
      Belgium and the United Kingdom). Participants, older adults above the age of 60 years, are
      recruited from general practitioners offices. Individual participants will be followed for
      one year (at least one winter season). For the individual participant the study procedures
      are described below:

      Baseline visit:

      Baseline visits are performed either at home or at the participating site before the start of
      the RSV season. The beginning of the season is to be determined per site in accordance to the
      local virologic surveillance reports. In general, baseline visits are performed between
      August and the beginning of October.

      A questionnaire on demographic, social and clinical status is completed during this visit.
      Additionally, vital signs are recorded such as oxygen saturation, heart frequency and
      breathing frequency. During the baseline visit a blood sample (60 ml, serum, paxgene, whole
      blood) and nasopharyngeal swab (microbiome) will be collected.

      Weekly follow-up during the RSV season:

      From October until May participants are contacted weekly to check whether there are signs of
      a respiratory tract infection. If respiratory symptoms are present, the study team will
      perform a home visit or ask the participant to visit the site to perform a rapid Polymerase
      Chain Reaction (PCR)-based point of care test (POCT) for RSV using a nasopharyngeal swab.
      Additionally both an oro- and nasopharyngeal swab are collected for standard PCR, vital signs
      are recorded. Participants are asked to complete a daily dairy on respiratory symptoms,
      health care use and quality of life during 28 days from the moment of infection. If symptoms
      are not present anymore for two consecutive days, the participant can stop completing the
      diary.

      In case of a positive RSV infection, additional sampling is performed by the study team. This
      consists of a nasopharyngeal swab (microbiome) and blood (Serum/PaxGene/whole blood). The
      same materials (minus serum and PaxGene sample) are collected again in convalescence (1-2
      weeks after infection).

      End of season visit:

      At the end of the RSV season (May-June), again sampling is performed combined with recording
      vital signs. Samples collected are; blood (serum/PaxGene) and a nasopharyngeal swab
      (microbiome). In addition, a questionnaire will completed on respiratory symptoms, health
      care use, social status and quality of life.

    <measure>Number of participants with a Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed RSV infection (incidence of RSV infection).</measure>
    <time_frame>Data is collected during the RSV season by weekly contact and viral swab diagnostics for RSV in case of respiratory infection. Medically attended RSV will be recorded throughout the one year follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome of the study is to determine the burden of RSV in the older adult population. Therefore the incidence rate of all RSV in the overall study population of older patients is investigated, including medically attended RSV infection-associated ARTI in both inpatients and outpatients. Nasal swabs are collected by the study team in case of a respiratory infection and tested with RT-PCR for presence of RSV. The incidence of RSV is calculated by dividing the number of RSV positive infections by the total number of study participants. The number of RSV positive infections divided by the total number of infections is calculated as well.</description>

    <description>worsening of cardiorespiratory status is monitored using the questionnaire data collected at baseline and follow-up after 1 year. This includes questions on medication usage, new chronic diagnoses and doctor visits for all cause respiratory illness.</description>

    <measure>Change in frailty over the course of study using the Groningen Frailty indicator (GFI) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Data on the change in frailty is collected during individual study participation of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty is assessed using the Groningen Frailty Indicator questionnaire which is included in the baseline and 1 year follow-up questionnaire. The GFI is a 15-item screening instrument to determine the level of frailty, which is available in a professional and self-report version. It measures the loss of functions and resources in 4 domains: physical (mobility functions, multiple health problems, physical fatigue, vision, hearing), cognitive (cognitive dysfunction), social (emotional isolation), and psychological (depressed mood and feelings of anxiety). All answer categories were dichotomized and a score of 1 indicates a problem or dependency. The range of the GFI score is 0 to 15. Geriatric experts agreed that a score of 4 or higher represents moderate to severe frailty</description>
