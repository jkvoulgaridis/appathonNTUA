  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the performance of a novel tau imaging ligand in up
      to 36 subjects (12 AD, 3 FTD, 3 PSP, 3 CBS, 3 VCI and 12 HV). Subjects will be recruited from
      the patient population and healthy volunteers of Taiwan residents. This study protocol
      requires each subject to complete the following components: screening evaluation, brain MRI
      and 18F-PM-PBB3 PET imaging up to two sessions. The screening procedures will include
      neuropsychological assessments, vital signs, ECG, physical examinations and laboratory tests.
      In addition, 18F-AV-45 PET imaging result will be as a part of inclusion criteria to confirm
      presence of amyloid deposition in patients with clinically diagnosed probable AD or absence
      of amyloid deposition in FTD, VCI and HV subjects. Furthermore, 18F-AV-133 PET imaging data
      will also be as a part of inclusion criteria to confirm the diagnosis of PSP and CBS. All
      subjects will complete clinical assessments and clinical safety tests to ensure the subject
      is medically stable to complete the study protocol. The screening procedures will occur
      within 30 days prior to 18F-PMPBB3 PET imaging.

    <measure>The primary outcome measures are to evaluate the dosimetry of novel radiotracer 18F-PM-PBB3 in human.</measure>
    <time_frame>YEAR ONE</time_frame>
    <description>Time-integrated activity in each organ will be calculated by trapezoidal integration of the first 45 min of the organ's time-activity curve, followed by a single-exponential fit to the remaining data points (based on the 4 whole-body images) extrapolate to infinity, all base on non-decay-corrected data.Residence times will be obtained by dividing the time-integrated activity by the injected amount of activity.</description>

    <measure>Optimal scanning time for brain imaging using 18F-PM-PBB3 .</measure>
    <time_frame>YEAR ONE</time_frame>
    <description>PET data will be acquired using SIMENS PET/CT or PET/MRI scanner with an axial field of view of 15.7cm. For PET/CT protocol, a 50-min dynamic brain PET scan (6x10s, 4x60s, 5x180s, 6x300s) will be started simultaneously with the injection of 10mCi of 18F-PM-PBB3 after a low-dose CT scan for patient positioning and attenuation correction.</description>
