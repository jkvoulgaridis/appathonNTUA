  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to test a novel behavioral treatment - Unified Protocol
      Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (UP-CBT)1 - to enhance quality of life in women with pelvic floor
      disorders. Emotional distress is treatable using behavioral procedures, and effective
      treatment would increase women's emotional health and help to reduce urinary symptoms (e.g.,
      incontinence, frequent urination). Women with pelvic floor disorders are often seen in the
      urogynecology clinic, which makes this setting ideal for offering additional interventions
      that may improve their quality of life. Unfortunately, many women with pelvic floor disorders
      may not receive effective behavioral treatment, such as cognitive behavior therapy, because
      urogynecologists and other medical professionals may not be aware of providers in their
      community who offer this treatment. The investigators will enhance treatment options by 1)
      providing evidence for an all-purpose cognitive-behavioral intervention (i.e., UP-CBT), 2)
      offering treatment in the urogynecology clinic, maximizing convenience, and 3) improving
      clinical outcomes for these patients.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To demonstrate that UP-CBT is an effective form of therapy for women with lower urinary
           tract symptoms.

        2. To use baseline characteristics in moderation analyses to determine which women will be
           most likely to have a good response to therapy.

        3. To use mediation analyses to test a possible causal chain of events - Does treatment
           lead to lower anxiety, which in turn leads to fewer urinary symptoms?

    <time_frame>1 week; Administered at baseline, mid-treatment (6 weeks), post-treatment (12 weeks), and 3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of anxiety symptoms. Min T Score = 40.3; Max T Score = 81.6. Raw scores are summed, then converted to T Scores from a lookup table. Higher T scores represent a worse outcome (i.e., greater number of anxiety symptoms).</description>

    <time_frame>3 months; Administered at baseline, mid-treatment (6 weeks), post-treatment (12 weeks), and 3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of urinary symptoms and bother. Scores are scale scores: mean value of items answered multiplied by 25; min scale score = 0; max scale score = 100. This scale score can be combined with the scale scores of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory (POPDI-6) and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory (CRAD-8) to form the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) summary score: add three scale scores together (range 0 to 300). Higher score indicates worse outcome (i.e., greater urinary symptoms and bother).</description>

    <description>Self-report measure of pelvic symptoms and bother. Sores are scale scores: mean value of items answered multiplied by 25; min scale score = 0; max scale score = 100. This scale score can be combined with the scale scores of the UDI-6 and CRAD-8 to form the PFDI-20 summary score: add three scale scores together (range 0 to 300). Higher score indicates worse outcome (i.e., greater pelvic symptoms and bother).</description>
