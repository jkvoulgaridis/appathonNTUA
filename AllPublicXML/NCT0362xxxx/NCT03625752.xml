  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of tDCS in combination with TUS for the
      treatment of pain and functional limitations in subjects with Diabetic Neuropathic Pain. The
      investigators hypothesize that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active
      stimulation, when compared to sham stimulation.
