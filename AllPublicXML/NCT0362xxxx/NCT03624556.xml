    <textblock>
      To evaluate safety and tolerability of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in children from 6 to
      12 years old with Intellectual Developmental Disorders (IDD) (Down syndrome or Fragile X
      syndrome).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project first objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the EGCG molecule
      (extracted form green tea) on children from 6 to 12 years old with Intellectual Development
      Disorder (Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the benefits of the EGCG on attention, memory,
      executive functions, language and adaptive behaviour of these children. Dyrk1A and
      homocysteine in plasma will also be quantified, using them as biomarkers of efficacy.

    <intervention_model_description>Cohort I (Down Syndrome children): Phase II Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups to evaluate safety and tolerability of EGCG in children. The experimental group will take 10mg/kg/day of FontUp (EGCG on a dietary supplement with chocolate like shake flavor, two times a day) while the placebo group will take the same product but without the EGCG in it, taken with the same posology.
Cohort II (Fragile X syndrome children): exploratory open label study (pilot study) to assess safety and tolerability of EGCG. These patients will receive 10mg/kg/day of FontUp.
This cohort will only be recruited in Spanish sites.</intervention_model_description>
