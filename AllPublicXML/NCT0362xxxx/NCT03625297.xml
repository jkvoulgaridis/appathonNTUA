      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the introduction of a
      shelter cat into the family of a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder on the social skills and
      anxiety of the child, and to examine stress in the cat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many families in the United States live with cats as companion animals, including families of
      children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). One in 68 children are diagnosed with ASD.
      There is no cure for ASD, and no one treatment works for all children. Symptoms of ASD
      include a lack of social skills and anxiety. Companion animals have been helpful for children
      with ASD. However, no one has studied stress of cats living in families of children with ASD.
      This study will place 64 pre-screened shelter cats in pre-screened homes and monitor the
      stress of the cats. Cats ages 10 months to four years that have been screened for calm
      behavior using a temperament, test will be adopted by families in the study. Families will
      also be screened for pet issues. No cat will be placed in a home with a child who has a
      history of aggression to animals. The study will also examine the social skills and anxiety
      of the children with ASD, and bonding of the parents and children with their cats. Five to
      eight million dogs and cats are relinquished to animal shelters in the United States each
      year. Thirty-eight percent of cats are given up for behavioral reasons. Studying cat stress
      and the placement of cats, with calm and non-aggressive characteristics into homes of
      families of children with ASD may help shed light on the likely success of the relationships
      between shelter cats and these families.
