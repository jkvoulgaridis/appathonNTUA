      Phase II trial evaluating to assess the feasibility and efficacy as first-line therapy for
      patients with non-resectable locally advanced HPV negative HNSCC of Durvalumab a
      PDL1-Inhibitor plus Tremelimumab a CTLA-4- Inhibitor in combination with radiotherapy and
      Durvalumab in combination with radiotherapy as first-line therapy.

      2-arm, randomized, multicenter, phase II. Step 1 is Registration. All patients need to sign
      the informed consent form for registration. Tumor tissue then be send to the central lab for
      defining the HPV status. If the patient is HPV negative the site will be notified if they can
      further proceed to patient randomization.

      Step 2 is Randomization of all eligible patients with a centrally diagnosed, HPV negative
      tumor in one of the two arms (Durvalumab plus Tremelimumab + radiotherapy; Durvalumab +
      radiotherapy) after signing the informed consent form for step 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to explore the feasibility and efficacy in terms of treatment
      discontinuation due to toxicity and in terms of 1-year progression free survival of a
      PDL1-Inhibitor plus a CTLA-4 Inhibitor in combination with radiotherapy and a PDL1-Inhibitor
      in combination with radiotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with non-resectable
      locally advanced HNSCC in the poor prognostic subgroup.

      Secondary objectives are to investigate the benefit of the addition of a CTLA-4 Inhibitor
      and/or a PDL1-Inhibitor to radiotherapy in terms of overall progression free survival,
      overall survival and to investigate the approach in terms of safety, chronic toxicity and
      quality of life.
