  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma is an epithelial cell malignancy arising from varying locations within the
      biliary tree and is difficult to diagnose due to the often-silent clinical nature. The best
      chance of long-term survival and potential cure is surgical resection with negative surgical
      margins, but many patients are unresectable due to locally advanced or metastatic disease at
      diagnosis. Because cholangiocarcinoma is difficult to diagnose at an early stage and extends
      diffusely, most patients have unresectable disease at clinical presentation, and prognosis is
      very poor (5-year survival is 0-40% even in resected cases)

      There is a need for better visualization of tumor tissue, lymph nodes and resection margins
      during surgery for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHCC). Optical molecular imaging of PHCC
      associated biomarkers is a promising technique to accommodate this need. The biomarkers
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and
      c-MET are all overexpressed in PHCC versus normal tissue and are proven to be valid targets
      for molecular imaging. Currently, tracers that target these biomarkers are available for use
      in clinical studies. In previous studies with other tumor types, the investigators tested the
      tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW for the biomarker VEGF-A with very promising results. Since all
      markers show roughly similar expression in ex vivo studies, the initial study will be
      performed with bevacizumab-IRDye800CW as the investigators have the most experience with this
      tracer. The investigators hypothesize that the tracer bevacizumab-IRDye 800CW accumulates in
      PHCC tissue, enabling visualization using a NIR intraoperative camera system and ex vivo NIR
      endoscopy. In this pilot study, the investigators will determine if it is possible to detect
      PHCC intraoperatively and by ex vivo NIR endoscopy using bevacizumab 800CW, and which tracer
      dose gives the best target-to-background ratio. The most optimal tracer dose will be selected
      for a future phase II trial.
