  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior knee pain is one of the most frequent reasons for consultation within knee
      conditions in adolescents and young adults. However, despite the high prevalence of this
      disorder, its pathogenesis and therefore its treatment are not clearly understood. Foam
      rolling has become a common intervention to enhance joint mobility and muscle recovery after
      exercise. the aim of this study is analyze the effectiveness of a roller intervention in
      patients with anterior knee pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mechanosensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline mechanosensitivity at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanosensitivity is going to be assessed by a hand-held pressure algometer. The pressure will be applied perpendicular to the skin at a constant rate of 30 kPa/s until the patient felt the pressure change to pain and pressed a button defining the PPT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vertical jump assessment with a mat</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject started with the foot of the designated testing leg on the contact mat and their hands on their hips, they were then instructed to sink and hold a knee position (approximately 1208 knee angle), and the experimenter then counted out 4 s. On the count of four the subject was instructed to then jump as high as possible.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Isokinetic strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic strength of the knee flexors and extensors of each leg will be measured using an isokinetic Biodex dynamometer (Biodex Corporation, Shirley, NY), which recorded instantaneous muscular torques.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. The Brief Pain Inventory is a pain assessment tool used to measure pain intensity and pain interference. Patients rate the severity of their pain at its worst and least during the previous week, on average, and &quot;right now&quot;. Patients rate their level of pain interference in different contexts.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional knee limitation assessed by the Kujala Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kujala Knee Score questionnaire will be selected for self-reported functional activity level of the patients. The composite score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no functional limitation.</description>
