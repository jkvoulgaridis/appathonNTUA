  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents who have experienced adversity (childhood maltreatment and other forms of broader
      victimisation experiences) will be randomly allocated to receive a 5-session cognitive bias
      modification training (with attention and interpretation bias modification modules) or a
      control condition. Outcome measures include measures of cognitive biases and symptoms of
      psychopathology; in addition, in a subset of adolescents, brain activity data will be
      acquired. All adolescents will complete a feedback form, upon which acceptability of the
      intervention will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 80 adolescents aged 12-18 years who have experienced adversity (childhood maltreatment
      and other forms of broader victimisation experiences) from India and Nepal will be randomly
      allocated to receive a 5-session cognitive bias modification training (with attention and
      interpretation bias modification modules) or a control condition over a 2-week period.

      Pre and post-assessment measures include measures of attention and interpretation biases and
      symptoms of internalising and externalising psychopathology. In addition, in a subset of
      adolescents, brain activity data acquired using EEG will be acquired either during resting or
      viewing emotional face stimuli. Data from these measures will be used to generate effect
      sizes of changes for each group as well as being used in a limited number of
      significance-testing analysis. All adolescents will complete a feedback form, upon which
      acceptability of the intervention will be assessed.

    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators have developed a 19-item self-report feedback, comprising quantitative ratings and qualitative responses. Across eleven items, young people rate on a 4-point Likert scale whether they found the training useful, satisfying, engaging, realistic, whether it impacted anxiety, mood, coping strategies, and other difficulties , and whether they would feel motivated to complete the sessions, including without a researcher present. Higher scores reflect greater endorsement. Each of these items will be reported separately rather than used to create composite scores. There are also 8 open ended questions for young people to leave their feedback on aspects they found helpful, unhelpful, liked, disliked, improvements they would want, and other general comments.</description>
