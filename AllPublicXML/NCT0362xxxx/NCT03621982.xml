    <textblock>
      This study evaluates ADCT-301 in patients with Selected Advanced Solid Tumors. Patients will
      participate in a Treatment Period with 3-week cycles and a Follow-up Period every 12 weeks
      for up to 1 year after treatment discontinuation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, open-label study with a dose-escalation part and a dose
      expansion part.

      The duration of the study participation for each patient is defined as the time from the date
      of signed written informed consent to the completion of the follow-up period, withdrawal of
      consent, loss to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first.

      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 21 days), a Treatment Period (with cycles
      of 3 weeks for a Q3W dosing regimen), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week
      visits) for up to 1 year after treatment discontinuation
