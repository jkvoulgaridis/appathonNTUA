    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the clinical effects of self-administered acupressure for treating
      insomnia disorder delivered by a training course. Subjects will be offered either
      self-administered acupressure training or sleep hygiene education. Their insomnia severity
      will be compared after 8 weeks.

      Objectives: To evaluate the clinical effects of self-administered acupressure for treating
      insomnia disorder delivered by a training course.

      Hypothesis: Subjects in the self-administered acupressure group will have greater improvement
      in insomnia symptoms and daytime impairment than those in the sleep hygiene education (SHE)
      group at 4 weeks and 8 weeks.

      Design and subjects: A randomized controlled trial. 184 subjects with insomnia disorder
      recruited from the community will be randomized to self-administered acupressure or SHE
      groups in a 1: 1 ratio.

      Study instrument: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) will be used to assess insomnia symptoms and
      daytime impairment.

      Interventions: Subjects in the self-administered acupressure group will attend two training
      lessons (2-hour each) to learn self-administered acupressure and practice it every night for
      4 weeks; subjects in the SHE group will receive sleep hygiene education with the schedule and
      duration that are same to the self-administered acupressure group.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the ISI score. Other measures include
      sleep parameters by subjective sleep diary and objective actigraphy, Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale, and SF-6D at 4 and 8 weeks. Acceptability and compliance of
      self-administered acupressure will be evaluated.

      Data Analysis: Differences in the questionnaire scores, subjective and objective sleep
      parameters will be examined using a mixed-effects model.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a seven-item self-rating scale. The subjects rate the severity of insomnia, distress and functional impairment associated with insomnia on a 5-point Likert scale. The total score will be reported. The score ranges from 0 to 28; a higher score indicates a more severe condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week8</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item self-administrated questionnaire, which assesses the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The anxiety and depression subscore will be reported. The subscore ranges from 0 to 21; a higher score indicates a more severe condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form- 6 Dimensions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week8</time_frame>
    <description>It is a preference-based measure of health derived from the Short Form-36. It includes six dimensions: physical functioning, role participation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality. The total score will be reported. The score ranges from 0 to 1; a higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Credibility of Treatment Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item Credibility of Treatment Rating Scale will be used to assess subjects' expectation towards the intervention in both groups. The score of each item will be reported. The score of each item ranges from 1 to 6. A higher score indicates a higher confidence toward the intervention.</description>
