  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB078 in
      adults with C9ORF72-Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The secondary objectives of this
      study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of BIIB078 and to evaluate the effects of
      BIIB078 on clinical function. As the first-in-human study, the study enrolls a small number
      of participants in each cohort. Every participant in a cohort is treated with the same dose
      or placebo. The study is designed to evaluate and confirm the safety of each dose before
      enrolling and exposing new participants to a higher dose in the next cohort. Therefore,
      proceeding from cohort to cohort, the recruitment status of &quot;Active, not recruiting&quot; may
      change. Please contact clinicaltrials@biogen.com for further information.

    <description>The ALSFRS-R has been demonstrated to predict survival. The ALSFRS-R measures 4 functional domains, including respiratory, bulbar function, gross motor skills, and fine motor skills. There are a total of 12 questions, each scored from 0 to 4 for a total possible score of 48 [Cedarbaum 1999], with higher scores representing better function.</description>

    <description>Quantitative muscle strength will be evaluated using hand-held dynamometry (HHD), which tests isometric strength of multiple muscles using standard subject positioning. Approximately 8 muscle groups will be examined (per each side) in both upper and lower extremities.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Bulbar Strength</measure>

    <description>Bulbar strength will be measured by the Iowa Oral Pressure Instrument (IOPI). The IOPI is a commercially available tongue pressure measurement system composed of an airfilled bulb connected to a pressure transducer. The bulb can be placed in different positions in the mouth in order to assess different aspects of tongue weakness.</description>
