    <textblock>
      The sit-to-stand test (STST) is a feasible alternative for measuring peripheral muscle
      strength of the lower limbs.

      Our aim was to evaluate, in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, the
      minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 30-second STST (30-STST) after pulmonary
      rehabilitation (PR).

      Stable COPD inpatients undergoing 30-STST and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) before and after PR
      were included. Responsiveness to PR was determined by pre-to-post PR (Δ) evaluation of
      30-STST. The MCID was evaluated using an anchor-based method.

      The sit-to-stand test (STST) is a feasible alternative for measuring peripheral muscle
      strength of the lower limbs used as standard test at the beginning and at the end of
      pulmonary rehabilitation programme.

      Our aim was to retrospectively evaluate, in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
      patients, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 30-second STST (30-STST)
      after pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).

      Stable COPD inpatients undergoing 30-STST and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) before and after PR
      were included. Responsiveness to PR was determined by pre-to-post PR (Δ) evaluation of
      30-STST. The MCID was evaluated using an anchor-based method.

        We examined 96 patients with COPD who attended an inpatient PR program. All patients had a
        diagnosis for COPD according to the GOLD criteria.Patients who had acute exacerbation over
        the previous four weeks were excluded. Patients who did not complete the PR program, for
        intercurrent COPD exacerbation, or any unstable medical condition, were also excluded.
        Contraindications for participation in the PR program included musculoskeletal disorders,
        malignant diseases, unstable cardiac condition, and lack of adherence to the program. All
        patients had smoking history ≥10 pack years and received regular treatment with inhaled
        bronchodilators and inhaled steroids according to current guidelines for their disease
        stage.
