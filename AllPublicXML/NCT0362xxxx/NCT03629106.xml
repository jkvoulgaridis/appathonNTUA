  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the changes in symptoms and cognition that occur
      after a 28-day abstinence period in patients with comorbid Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) and
      Bipolar (Type I or II) disorder. Stabilized bipolar patients (N=52) with CUD will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: 1) A contingent reinforcement (CR) group (n=26); 2) a
      non-contingent reinforcement (NCR) group (n=26). The study will include a total of 8 visits
      to the CAMH Russell site (screening, training, baselines, week 1-4, follow-up). Participants
      should be between the ages of 18-60, meet criteria for CUD (moderate to severe), meet
      criteria for Bipolar Disorder, be on a stable dose of mood stabilizing medication(s), and be
      non-treatment seeking cannabis user. The visits will take up a total of approximately 22.5
      hours with compensation for time provided for both groups. These visits will involve multiple
      clinical, substance use, and cognitive assessments. Abstinence will be maintained by weekly
      behavioural coaching sessions and contingency reinforcement for the CR group.
