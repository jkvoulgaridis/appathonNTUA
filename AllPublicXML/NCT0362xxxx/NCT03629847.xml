      NET originate in neuroendocrine cells throughout the body. The goal of this study is to
      assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of everolimus and the intravenous
      radiolabeled Lu-177 DOTATATE Therapy as a 1st line therapy in unresectable well to moderately
      differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of all GI, lung and pancreatic origins. This
      is a phase 1 - 2 study. The phase 1 part involves finding the maximum tolerating dose (MTD)
      of Everolimus.

      Neuroendocrine tumors NET refers to tumors that originate in neuroendocrine cells throughout
      the body (including in the thymus, lung, pancreas, gastrointestinal [GI] tract and less
      common sites). They can be broadly subclassified into well-differentiated and poorly
      differentiated cancers. Treatment of well differentiated NET are complex and involves
      surgical, Locoregional and systemic modalities depending on the manifestations as well as
      extent of disease. Treatment is best planned in a multidisciplinary tumor board. Of the
      emerging new systemic modalities are Everolimus and radiolabelled somatostatin analogue. The
      goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of everolimus and
      the intravenous radiolabeled Lu-177 DOTATATE Therapy (a somatostatin analogue) as a first
      line therapy in unresectable well to moderately differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine
      tumors of all gastrointestinal, lung and pancreatic origins. This is a phase 1 - 2 study. The
      phase 1 part involves finding the maximum tolerating dose (MTD) of Everolimus.
