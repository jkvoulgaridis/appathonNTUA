  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, FL-PR Stroke Registry will be used to determine novel data on disparities in
      stroke care and outcomes for patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) in 'real life' hospital
      setting. Investigators will evaluate clinical practice for AF detection and treatment in
      stroke patients within large stroke hospital systems of care with multi-ethnic patient
      populations and thereby representative of the states of Florida and Puerto Rico. The results
      of this study will be of critical importance for secondary stroke prevention by identifying
      gaps in stroke care for patients with AF and by recognizing the needs for developing targeted
      interventions to reduce disparities in diverse populations of stroke patients with AF and
      improve systems of care for all stroke patients with AF.

        The study population is derived from the Florida-Puerto Rico Stroke Registry to Reduce
        Stroke Disparities. In-hospital acute stroke performance measures are documented and
        obtained through the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines-Stroke
        (GWTG-S) premier hospital quality improvement program and GWTG-S data collection
        instruments. Through the GWTG-S data, the Registry currently has close to 169,000 patients
        enrolled since 2010.
