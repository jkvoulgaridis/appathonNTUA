  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether eliminating certain ingredients (caffeine, alcohol, artificial
      sweeteners, acidic juices) consumed in beverages reduces bladder symptoms of urinary
      frequency and urgency. Women with overactive bladder will be recruited. Half of these women
      will receive instructions to replace beverages containing these ingredients with beverages
      such as water or milk. The other half of participants will receive instructions on following
      the United States Department of Agriculture guidelines on healthy eating.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly believed that it is better for women's bladders if intake of certain beverages
      is eliminated. Advice is given to women with frequency/urgency symptoms to avoid coffee or
      tea, sodas or pop, or any other drinks that contain alcohol, caffeine, artificial sweeteners
      or high acidic content. Although the investigators do not know the direct cause and effect of
      consuming beverages with these ingredients, there might be reduction in &quot;irritating&quot;
      sensation to toilet often because of urgency if the beverages with these ingredients are
      replaced by &quot;non-irritating&quot; beverages.

    <measure>Perception of bladder fullness relative to urination delay ability (DeWachter, 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On 3-day diary, participants will be asked to indicate their perception of bladder fullness when they urinated that day: &quot;no bladder sensation,&quot; &quot;urinating could easily be delayed for more than 30-60 minutes,&quot; &quot;urinating could only be delayed for 30 minutes,&quot; &quot;urinating could only be delayed for 5 minutes&quot; and &quot;immediate urinating will be mandatory and/or fear of leakage.&quot;</description>

    <description>The investigators will use only the &quot;bother&quot; questions of this larger Questionnaire about bladder symptoms. We modified the original think-back period of 4-weeks to instead think back to &quot;the past 3 days&quot; to characterize the bother of bladder symptoms under the varying conditions of each specific intervention period. Bother will be measured on the final day on the bottom of each of the 3-day diaries.</description>
