  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcomas are aggressive malignant tumors issued from mesenchymatous cells. Their curative
      treatment is mainly surgical, especially in soft tissue sarcomas, which are mostly localized
      in limbs. Surgical margins remain a major prognosis factor and are directly linked to
      recurrence risk. Curative surgery applies resection margins removing healthy tissue
      surrounding the tumor and is meticulously planned thanks to tight cooperation between expert
      surgeons and radiologist, based on pre-operative Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). Resection
      planning optimizes chances to perform a safe carcinological resection procedure sparing these
      structures. Resection planning is based upon conservation (or sacrifice) of anatomic
      compartments limited by fascia and routine MRI might also be outdated in some cases to
      predict whether the fascia is involved in the tumor or not. Such uncertainties complexify the
      surgical procedure, lead to unnecessary healthy tissue sacrifices and increase functional
      impairments, which can be significant. A new MRI offering higher spatial resolution could
      allow tumoral satellites, previously undetected on conventional MRI, which might explain some
      of the observed recurrences. Ultra-high field MRI, considered as harmless and without
      pharmaceutical agent injection, could bring benefits to tumoral extension comprehension and
      should be considered as a breakthrough in medical oncology field. This is particularly true
      in soft tissue sarcoma pathology field, where the only curative treatment to date remains
      surgery.

      It will be propose in this project to determine the contribution of ultra-high field MRI in
      Soft tissue sarcomas management and to evaluate for the first time the potential superiority
      of 7 Tesla imaging over routine MRI through usual data comparison in 20 patients between
      1,5Tesla and 7 Tesla MRI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Major patients

          -  All patients with soft-tissue sarcoma

          -  Patients agreeing to participate in the study and having signed a consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a contraindication to MRI will be excluded: Claustrophobia, metallic
             foreign bodies, cardiac pacemakers, implantable chamber. There is no known additional
             risk for 7Tesla MRI scanning. The same contraindications as those of conventional MRI
             prevail.

          -  Patients with bone-component sarcomas will be excluded in order to have a homogeneous
             group of tumors localized only in the soft tissues (and simpler analysis in high-field
             MRI because of the risk of artifacts related to bone).

          -  Intermediate malignancies will be excluded for the same reasons.
