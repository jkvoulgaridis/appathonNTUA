  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, no study exists that evaluates whether functional dyspepsia patients experience
      stigma and how stigma may influence adherence. Thus, the investigators aim to evaluate the
      relationship between functional dyspepsia and stigma, and explore possible ways to improve
      treatment adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the functional but refractory nature of functional gastrointestinal diseases (FGIDs),
      large number of patients who suffer from FGIDs may not be able to fully understand their
      diagnosis, especially when they were told that they had no organic disease and their symptoms
      had a psychosomatic origin rather than a gastrointestinal one. Moreover, subjects with FGIDs
      have concerns and negative perceptions about medications, particularly in the presence of
      psychiatric comorbidity. Fearing of being labeled as insane or incapability, many patients
      with psychosomatic symptoms choose to conceal their illness to family, colleagues and
      doctors. These factors may affect willingness to initiate neuromodulator regimens and
      treatment adherence.

    <measure>compliance of psychoactive medicine</measure>
    <time_frame>week8</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance is assessed by the medication possession ratio(MPR). The MPR is often defined as the sum of the days' supply of medication divided by the number of days between the first fill and the last refill plus the days' supply of the last refill. This calculation usually results in a ratio less than 1.0 if there are lapses in prescription refilling.</description>

    <measure>stigma scale</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0</time_frame>
    <description>Stigma is assessed by internalized stigma of mental illness (ISMI) scale and perceived stigma (PSS) scale adapted for FD. The ISMI is a 29-item self-report questionnaire with items ranked on a 4-point Likert Scale (strongly disagree = 1 to strongly agree = 4 points). An optional fifth subscale for stigma resistance was not used in this study. Higher scores indicate greater internalized stigma: scores ≤ 2 would be labeled as 'minimal stigma', scores 2 - 2.5 were labeled as 'mild stigma', scores 2.5 - 3 were labeled as 'moderate stigma' , scores ＞ 3 were labeled as 'severe stigma'. The PSS is a 10-item questionnaire with items ranked on a 5-point Likert Scale (seldom = 1 to always = 5 points). Higher scores indicate greater levels of perceived stigma.</description>

    <measure>dyspepsia symptom score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2, week 4, week 6, week8</time_frame>
    <description>Participates' dyspeptic symptoms is assessed using the Leeds dyspepsia scale( LDQ), which is a reliable, valid and responsive outcome measure for quantifying the frequency and severity of dyspepsia symptoms. The LDQ contains eight items about epigastric pain, retro-sternal pain, regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, belching, early satiety and dysphagia with six grades for each item. LDQ scores of 0 - 4 were classified as very mild dyspepsia, 4 - 8 as mild dyspepsia, 9 -15 as moderate dyspepsia, and &gt; 15 as severe or very severe dyspepsia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>anxiety symptom scores</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2, week 4, week 6, week8</time_frame>
    <description>The anxiety condition is evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). The GAD-7 has good performance characteristics in screening generalized anxiety disorder and are feasible for use. The GAD-7 consists of 7 items on a four-point (0 - 3) scale. Scores of 0 to 4 can be regarded as absent of generalized anxiety disorder, , scores of 5 to 9 are suggestive of mild, scores of 10 to 14 indicate moderate, and scores of 15 or higher indicate severe generalized anxiety disorder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>depression symptom scores</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2, week 4, week 6, week8</time_frame>
    <description>The depression condition is evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 10-item questionnaire and has been proven to be a valid and efficient tool for screening depression. Scores of 0 to 4 can be regarded as none or minimal depression, scores of 5-9 as mild, scores of 10 to 14 are suggestive of moderate, scores of 15-19 as moderately severe, and scores of 20 or higher indicate severe depression.</description>
