  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presently, there isn't any international recommendation to evaluate vigilance in Obstructive
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome. The French Society of Sleep Research and Medicine (SFRMS) recommend
      evaluating professional driver with a MWT but no recommendation exists for other patients.
      After a minimal treatment of 4 weeks, the physician has to evaluate the drowsiness risk of
      these patients using either an objective test like the MWT or a subjective one. In the
      university hospital Amiens-Picardie, since the 01/01/2015, every patient with an Obstructive
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome diagnosed by a polysomnography or a ventilatory polygraphy had a MWT
      after 4 weeks of treatment. At each time of the evaluation, Epworth Sleepiness Scale,
      tiredness score of Pichot, and depressive score of Beck are performed.

        all patients more than 18 years treated by CPAP for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome
        diagnosed at the Sleep Medicine Unity of the Amiens Hospital having a MWT between the
        01/01/15 and 31/12/16 were included. Patients were excluded if they had an Central Apnea
        Syndrome, Central Hypersomnia, no driving license or if they refused.
