    <textblock>
      This trial investigates the behavioural effects of Internet-based Cognitive behaviour therapy
      for insomnia (CBT-I) in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder with sleep problems. This
      is a randomised controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems are common in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)1. Internet-based
      Cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) is considered as an evidence-based
      treatment for insomnia 2. To date, no Internet-based CBT-I delivered treatment for sleep
      problems in adolescents with ASD has been undertaken. The objective of the study is to
      investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of the Internet-based CBT-I for sleep problems in
      adolescents with ASD.

    <measure>Change in sleep impairment by using The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention (10 weeks), 3 months post intervention follow-up and 6 months post intervention follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a seven-item measure that yields a quantitative index of sleep impairment and treatment outcome. Participants rate the following components on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely): (a) severity of sleep-onset, sleep-maintenance, and early morning awakening problems; (b) satisfaction with current sleep pattern; (c) interference with daily functioning; (d) noticeability of impairment attributed to the sleep problem; and (e) level of distress caused by the sleep problem. Total scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating greater perceived insomnia severity.</description>

    <description>The DD-CGAS is an instrument used by clinicians to rate patients' global everyday functioning.</description>
