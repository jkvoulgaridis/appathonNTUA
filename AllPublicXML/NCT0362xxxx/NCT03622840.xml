  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional clinical trial that will be conducted as a pilot project.
      Investigators hope to conduct the study to obtain at least 10 study completers.

      The plan is to screen 20 Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients attending the Academic Health Care
      Center (AHCC) at NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine clinic and enroll the eligible
      candidates based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will have 11 study visits
      over the 11-week period. Subjects cognition will be assessed using a paper-based Test of
      Memory and Learning (TOMAL) tool. The same tool will be used to asses and compare the
      cognition at baseline, and end study visits. The weekly 30-mins of cognitive remediation
      exercises will be done using the Brain. HQ cognitive remediation software.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be between 40 and 75 years old (including both ages) at the time of
             study screening.

          2. Subjects must have a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease by a physician.

          3. Subjects must demonstrate adequate decisional capacity, in the judgment of the
             consenting study staff member, to make a choice about participating in this research
             study.

          4. Subjects must have been clinically stable (non-acute) for 2 weeks prior to consent; in
             the judgment of the Investigator.

          5. Subjects with a cognition level between Impaired and Average (scaled score between
             4-12 or Index Score between 70-110) based on TOMAL Cognitive assessment at Visit 1

          6. Subjects must have the visual, auditory, and motor capacity to use the intervention in
             the judgment of the Principal Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are participating in a concurrent research study or another
             interventional clinical trial 30 days prior to consenting.

          2. Subjects having a history of mental retardation or pervasive developmental disorder;
             or other co-morbid neurological disorder (e.g., epilepsy.)

          3. Subjects who appear to be intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance
             on any day of assessment must be rescheduled and may be discontinued based upon the
             discretion of the investigator

          4. Subjects on medications that affect the cognition in the last 12 hours prior to the
             study visits that assess the cognitive functions
