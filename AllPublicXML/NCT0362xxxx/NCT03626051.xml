  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and purpose:

      Ankle inversion sprains are the commonest injuries of the lower extremities. Taping is
      routinely used after ankle sprain to support the joint and prevent reinjury. The effect of
      taping on functional performance in participants after ankle sprain has received little
      attention and generally with inconsistent findings. Besides, the perception of confidence and
      reassurance that may come with the ankle being taped might lead to the improvement of
      functional mobility performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the
      effects of rigid ankle tape and fibular tape on functional performance, self-efficacy and
      perceived stability, confidence and reassurance during functional tasks in participants with
      functional ankle instability.

      Methods:

      This study is a randomized controlled trial. Forty subjects with functional ankle instability
      will be recruited and randomly assigned into the rigid tape group and the fibular tape group.
      Participants will perform functional mobility tests with and without the ankle taped. The
      functional tests are: figure-8 hopping test, lateral hopping test, star excursion balance
      test (SEBT), single-leg stance and stair decent test. Secondary outcome measures were
      self-efficacy and perception measure.

      Statistics:

      Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to determine the effects of
      intervention on each dependent variable. Model effects were group, time (pre, post), and
      their interaction. Post hoc pairwise comparisons between pre and post in each group, and
      independent t test between groups, were used to document the difference. The statistical
      significance was set at p less than 0.05.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Figure-8 hopping test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at one hour</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of hopping twice around a 5 m course on the test foot in a figure-8, as quickly as possible. The time taken for the participant to complete two circuits of the figure-8 was measured using a stopwatch, and the average of the two best times out of three attempts was recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lateral hopping test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at one hour</time_frame>
    <description>participants were instructed to hop laterally 30 cm and back for a total of 10 repetitions. The total time was recorded with a handheld stopwatch to the nearest 0.01 second.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Star excursion balance test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at one hour</time_frame>
    <description>This test examined the ability to balance on the affected leg while reaching in various directions with the other foot. Participants stood on the test foot at the central point, and using the other foot reached as far as possible in each of three of the 8 directions of the star excursion balance test (anterior, posterior and postero-medial, relative to the test foot). Only three directions were used due to redundancy among the eight directions. Participants made three attempts in each test direction with the average of the best two attempts for each direction recorded in centimetre</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single-leg stance test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were instructed to balance on one leg for 30 s with their eyes closed, arms at their side, and the other foot touching the medial side of the supporting calf. If they lost their balance, participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed and attempt to re-establish their balance. The number of foot movements made by the stance foot during the 30 s was counted. A foot movement was counted if any of the following occurred: loss of contact with the ground by any part of the foot; a change in foot direction; or each instance when the contralateral foot touched the ground. The lowest total number of foot movements from three attempts was recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stair decent test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were instructed to run down a flight of 11 stairs as quickly as possible, ensuring that they made contact with every step with one foot, and without using the handrail.The time taken from the first step to touchdown by both feet at the bottom of the flight of stairs was measured. The two best times out of three attempts was averaged.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at one hour</time_frame>
    <description>The self-efficacy questionnaire was modified from the pain self-efficacy questionnaire, to compare participants' self-reported confidence in performing a range of functionally challenging tasks. The questionnaire consisted of 17 items related to tasks of increasing difficulty. Participants rated their level of confidence in their ability to perform each activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-perception measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Three perception measures were recorded at the completion of each functional test to determine whether there was a difference in participants' perceptions between the tape and no tape conditions. Participants recorded their perception of ankle stability, confidence and reassurance. Stability was defined as &quot;how stable your ankle felt during the test&quot;, confidence as &quot;how positive you felt during the test&quot;, and reassurance as &quot;how safe you felt during the test&quot;.</description>
