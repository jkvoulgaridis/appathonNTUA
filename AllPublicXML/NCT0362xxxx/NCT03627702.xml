  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulty healing wounds have a significant effect to the general fitness of the patient and
      his quality of life. On Account of the frequency of their appearing, constitute the serious
      health and social problem. In comprehensive dealing with such patients physiotherapy will
      matter greatly. The visible polychromatic polarized light is most often used physical factor
      assisting comprehensive treatment bedsores.

      Purpose of the work: Analyze of using the visible polychromatic polarized light in the
      comprehensive process of healing bedsores at elderly people with the limited motor activity.

      Material and methods: Participants receive interventions as part of routine medical care, and
      a researcher studies the effect of the intervention. The study was conducted in people over
      65 years old, with bedsores grade III and IV in Torrance scale. The therapy included
      radiation of bedsores with VIP light. Effectiveness of the method of treatment was examined
      using photographic images and to measure the extent of the wound.

      18 people were examined. In all subjects, were assessed the risk of developing bedsores
      according to the scale Dutch Consensus Prevention of Bedsores CBO. All bedsores were
      irradiated with a Bioptron lamp (20 sessions, twice a day). Photo and measurement of bedsores
      size and Torrance score, were made:on the first, 9, 18 and 36 day of therapy.
