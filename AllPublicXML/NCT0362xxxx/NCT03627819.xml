  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the prevalence of obesity is reaching epidemic proportions, the prevalence of
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
      increases concomitantly and becomes a major global health hazard. Successful pharmacological
      interventions to treat or prevent NASH are not available and so far only weight loss has
      clear benefits, but sustained weight-loss is difficult to achieve on the longer-term. We
      recently demonstrated in mice that plant sterol and stanol ester consumption inhibited the
      development of liver inflammation, which needs to be validated in humans in a translational
      approach. In the current proposed pilot study, the effect of consuming plant sterol or plant
      stanol esters on biopsy proven liver inflammation will be investigated in NAFLD patients.

      The objective is to assess the effect of consuming plant sterol or plant stanol esters (3
      grams/day) for 12 months on biopsy proven liver inflammation in NAFLD patients.

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded pilot study with a run-period
      of 2 weeks, an intervention period of 12 months and a wash-out period of 1 month.

      The study population consists of 15 patients with biopsy-proven liver inflammation, aged
      18-75 years.

      All subjects will start a run-in period of two weeks during which they consume daily 20 grams
      of control margarine after which they will be randomly allocated to consume 20 grams control
      margarine or plant sterol or plant stanol enriched margarine on a daily basis for a period of
      12 months. The primary outcome parameter in this study is biopsy proven liver inflammation.
