      A study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of an investigational drug in subjects with
      schizophrenia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, inpatient, single
      ascending dose (SAD) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of
      lurasidone injectable suspension in subjects with schizophrenia. This study will determine
      the minimum intolerable dose (MID), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lurasidone injectable
      suspension, and characterize the PK profiles of lurasidone and its metabolites in serum
      (ID-14283, ID-14326, ID-11614, ID-20219, and ID-20220) and urine (ID-14283, ID-14326, and
      ID-11614) in this subject population. The potential effects of gender on the PK of lurasidone
      injectable suspension and its metabolites will also be evaluated when applicable.

          -  1. Subject has capacity; is willing and able to provide written consent for use and
             disclosure of protected health information per requirements of 45CFR164.508 (Health
             Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; HIPAA) prior to initiating any study
             procedure after being informed of the nature of the study, in the opinion of the study
             staff and PI.

             2. Subject is male or female 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive. 3. Subject has a
             diagnosis of schizophrenia as per DSM-IV-TR criteria, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator has been clinically stable for the past 6 months.

             4. Subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 19.5 and less than or
             equal to 38 kg/m2.

             5. Subject does not have clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values per
             Investigator discretion.

             6. Subject does not have clinically relevant findings from vital signs measurements
             per Investigator discretion.

             7. Female subject is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:

             a. Non-childbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is pre-menarchal or post-menopausal);

          -  Postmenopausal females defined as being amenorrheic for greater than 2 years (or
             confirmed by FSH level) with an appropriate clinical profile.

          -  Women who have not been confirmed as postmenopausal should be advised to use
             contraception as outlined below.

          -  Women who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy
             (as determined by subject's medical history).

             b. Child-bearing potential (all females ≤ 65 years of age), has a negative pregnancy
             test at screening and agrees to satisfy one of the following requirements:

          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse (as part of an abstinent lifestyle) a minimum of
             2 months prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, throughout the
             Treatment Period, and for a minimum of 3 months after completion or premature
             discontinuation from the study drug; or,

          -  Established use of highly effective methods of contraception from 1 month prior to

             days after completion or premature discontinuation from the study drug.

               -  Because of the unacceptable failure rate of barrier (chemical and/or physical)
                  methods, the barrier method of contraception must only be used in combination
                  with a highly effective method. Post-coital methods of contraception are not
                  permitted.

                  8. Male subjects with partners of child bearing potential must be practicing
                  abstinence, part of an abstinent life style or using protocol-specified methods
                  of birth control throughout the study and for 30 days after completion or
                  premature discontinuation from the study drug.
