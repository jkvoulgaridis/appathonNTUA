  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to reduce tinnitus (ringing in the ear) loudness and improve the
      quality of life for those that are affected by tinnitus. This study will enroll subjects who
      have bothersome and constant subjective tinnitus with no greater than a mild hearing loss and
      the ability to control ringing in the ears by doing something with your body or head.
      Subjects will be given both the treatment and sham arms (this study will randomly assign
      which treatment will be first) and have a washout period in between the two treatment groups
      that could be as many as 10 weeks. The study will take approximately 32 weeks for study
      subjects and the study will enroll approximately 100 individuals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Objective Tinnitus Loudness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and up to 38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Tinnitus by the TinnTester software. Participants are guided through a self-directed computerized assessment software that estimates how loud (in decibels) they perceive their tinnitus to be (TinnTester). These will be collected weekly during each treatment arm and washout. Absolute differences are averaged relative to baseline to determine loudness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and up to 38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TFI is a clinical questionnaire that assesses tinnitus impact on a subject's quality of life. It uses a scale of 0 - 100 where 0 means no negative impact on quality of life from tinnitus and 100 is devastating impact.These will be collected weekly during each treatment arm and washout.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and up to 38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 25 item questionnaire which assesses subjective impacts of tinnitus related to quality of life on a 100 point numeric scale. Scores 17 points or higher are considered bothersome tinnitus. The higher scores reflecting greater self-perceived tinnitus handicap. These will be collected weekly during each treatment arm and washout.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tinnitus bandwidth/spectrum (TinnTester Interactive Software)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and up to 38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Near its start the TinnTester software asks subjects to indicate which of three sounds best resembles their tinnitus; 5 kHz pure tone (&quot;tonal&quot; tinnitus), a narrow band noise centered at 5 kHz (±5% of CF, BPN5 masker, &quot;ringing&quot; tinnitus), or a wider band of noise centered at 5 kHz (±15% of CF, BPN15 masker, &quot;hissing&quot; tinnitus). We will relate treatment outcomes to tinnitus bandwidth by these measurements. We will also be able to determine whether the treatment alters bandwidth.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimum masking level (MML)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and up to 38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if the MML for a 5kHz tone is reduced in the active treatment arm.</description>

    <measure>Change Residual Inhibition as measured by the TinnTester software</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and up to 38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if residual inhibition changes in the active treatment arm</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus Hearing Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and up to 38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10 question survey with a scale from 0 to 4 to determine if active treatment has an effect or interaction with perceived handicap due to hearing loss and sound level tolerance. Categories are comprised of tinnitus, hearing, and sound tolerance. An answer of 0 is no/not a problem up to 4 that is yes/a very big problem.</description>

    <description>Active: Bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation
Sham: Sham Bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation
Subjects receive both a sham treatment and an active treatment. The subjects will be blinded to which treatment they are receiving. Both treatments are delivered using a take-home device programmed in the lab.
During active treatment, the device will deliver electric somatosensory and auditory stimulation.</description>

    <description>The auditory stimulus will be individualized based on subject baseline audiogram and tinnitus test results and is presented through a calibrated earphone.
Somatosensory stimulation will be delivered by pads positioned on the cheek overlying the trigeminal ganglion, the juncture of the temporomandibular joint or on the neck at overlying cervical nerves, c1 or c2, determined by the manner in which the subject can modulate the tinnitus.
For each arm of the study subjects will have daily treatments for 30-60 minutes for 6 weeks.</description>
