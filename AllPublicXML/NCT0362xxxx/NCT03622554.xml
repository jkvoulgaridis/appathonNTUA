    <textblock>
      Preventing falls among people 65 years of age or older is a priority to promote healthy aging
      and reduce the number of hospitalizations, institutionalizations and years lived with
      disability. A preliminary study carried out at the Balaruc-les-Bains Thermal Center showed
      that one-third of people aged 65 are at significant risk of falling. Thermal establishments
      could therefore play a role in initiating measures to prevent falls among people aged 65 and
      over screened at risk.The main objective is to evaluate the impact on the incidence of falls
      at 12 months (M12) to add to the usual care (control group) a program combining, during the
      treatment, adapted physical activities (APA) and a Therapeutic patient education (FTE)
      followed by an educational follow-up for 12 months (intervention group) for people aged 65
      and over who were at risk of falling on arrival at the Thermal
