  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that nutritional intervention with dietary polyphenols can
      positively modulate the gut microbiota to improve cardiometabolic health. Whether the
      beneficial effects of raspberry on obesity and the metabolic syndrome can be linked to their
      potential impact on the gut microbiota and intestinal integrity remains speculative at this
      time. Moreover, the mechanisms of action underlying health benefits associated to raspberry
      consumption are still unknown. The investigators are thus proposing to combine the study of
      metagenomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics to test whether a prebiotic activity of
      raspberry can play a role in the prevention of obesity-linked metabolic syndrome in a
      clinical setting.
