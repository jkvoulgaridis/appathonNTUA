  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of paclitaxel-releasing coronary
      balloon (Catheter SeQuent® Please) versus rapid exchange PTCA balloon catheter (SeQuent® Neo)

          -  Women of childbearing potential may not be pregnant nor have the desire to becoming
             pregnant during the study. Hence, patients will be advised to use an adequate birth
             control method up to (including) the end of follow-up;

          -  Patients must agree to undergo the 9-month angiographic follow-up and the clinical
             follow-up at 30 days, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after operation;

          -  Patients who are psychologically and linguistically able to understand the purpose of
             the study, and show sufficient compliance with the study protocol;

          -  Patients who have expressed acknowledgment of the risks and benefits described in the
             informed consent document by providing informed consent;

        Criteria related to lesions

          -  The target lesion is primary, in situ coronary artery lesion located in 1 or 2
             different coronary arteries, with no more than 1 target lesion in each coronary
             artery;

          -  The reference vessel diameter is within the range of 2.0 mm - 2.75 mm; (visually
             measured)

          -  Interventional treatment should be conducted on lesion(s) of non-target vessel(s) in
             advance (which must be concurrent treatment), and management of random and target
             lesions should be performed after successful treatment of non-target lesion(s);

          -  The pre-operative diameter stenosis must be either ≥ 70% or ≥ 50% with ischemia;
             (visually measured)

          -  Each target lesion should be treated with only one SeQuent® Please or SeQuent® Neo.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Criteria related to subjects

          -  Patients with recent myocardial infarction (within one week), or patients with
             myocardial infarction over one week but whose troponin level has not recovered to

             lesion with branch vessel diameter ≥ 2.5 mm, and bypass graft lesion;

          -  There is non-target lesion(s) in the proximal large vessel and target lesion(s) in the
             distal small vessel of the same vessel (eligible if there is non-target lesion(s) in
             proximal large vessel and a target lesion in the bifurcated small vessel);

          -  The target vessel is distorted or has calcified lesion(s);

          -  Lesion within 5 mm away from the coronary artery ostium;

          -  Lesion that cannot be treated with PTCA or other interventional techniques;
