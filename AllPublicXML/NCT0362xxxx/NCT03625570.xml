  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) experience walking limitations which negatively
      influence their ability to physically participate in day to day life. The investigators
      propose that impaired muscle power generation is the key limiting factor affecting walking
      activity and participation. This proposal represents a combined approach where participants
      undergo resistance training for muscle power generation in combination with locomotor
      treadmill training that is based on typical pediatric walking and activity patterns rather
      than adult protocols, which are endurance or time-based. Therefore, the primary objective of
      this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effect of lower extremity Power Training
      combined with interval Treadmill Training (PT³) on functional walking capacity and
      community-based activity and participation in children with CP. We hypothesize that
      remediating the most pronounced muscle performance impairment (i.e., muscle power) with power
      training combined with a task- specific approach to walking that is developmentally
      appropriate will have a significant effect on walking capacity and performance.

      The primary purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the effect of Power
      Training combined with interval Treadmill Training (PT³) on walking capacity and performance
      in children with CP with walking limitations. To identify key muscular mechanisms associated
      with improved walking mobility, the effects of PT³ on muscle performance and architecture
      will be examined. The premise of the PT³ protocol is that a combined impairment and
      task-specific approach that is developmentally appropriate and targets muscle power deficits
      specifically, is necessary to drive changes in both clinic and community-based walking
      activity.

      In this randomized multi-site clinical trial, 48 ambulatory participants with CP will receive
      either PT³ or an equivalent dosage of traditional strength training combined with traditional
      treadmill training (comparison group) for 24 sessions, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Outcomes
      will be collected at baseline and immediately post-treatment. Short and long-term retention
      effects will be assessed at 2 and 6 months post.
