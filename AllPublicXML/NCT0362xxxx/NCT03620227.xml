  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decrease in estrogen in postmenopausal women leads an increase in endocrine metabolic
      dysfunctions, such as changes in lipid profile and blood pressure. Thus, one of the
      alternatives for prevention and treatment is the practice of physical exercise associated
      with diet containing precursors of nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator.
      Therefore, this study intends to verify if supplementation of beetroot juice changes the
      hemodynamic and salivary markers in postmenopausal and hypertensive women. Therefore, the
      intervention consists of 350ml of concentrated beetroot juice or placebo, which will be
      ingested in fasting. After 2 hours will be carried out a session of aerobic physical exercise
      in treadmill and blood pressure will be measured each 15 minutes for 90 minutes after the end
      of the session, in addition to the 24-hour measurement that will be performed by an ABPM
      device. Salivary samples will be held: before the juice ingest, right after exercise, 90
      minutes after and 24 hours after the end of the exercise. With the development of this study,
      it is expected to find blood pressure reduction and normalization of the inflammatory profile
      through salivary samples, after the period of supplementation associated with physical
      exercise practice.

      The intervention protocol will last 3 days. On the first day there will be the collection of
      anthropometric data, the signature of a consent term and delivery of the list of foods that
      should be avoided 24 hours before the tests and a treadmill familiarization. On the second
      and third day the physical intervention will be performed associated with juice or placebo
      supplementation. A wash out period of at least 7 days will be performed between the second
      and third day. The volunteers will arrive at the laboratory at 7am in the fasted state and
      will be rested until 07:20am and then the blood pressure (BP) measurement (collected three
      times, with an interval of 1 minute between measurements), collection of the saliva and the
      measurement of heart rate (HR). Approximately at 07:30am they will start drinking the juice
      and will have up to 15 minutes to consume. BP will be measured at 08:00am, 08:30am, 09:00am
      and 09:30am. At 9:30am a physical exercise session will begin, during which will be monitored
      by a cardio-frequency monitor, which will remain until 11h10am (period referring to the end
      of BP monitoring in the laboratory). At 10:10am the workout will be finished, and then the
      saliva will be collected. After this period, the volunteers can take up to 250 ml of water
      until 11:10am, and every 15 minutes, BP will also be measured. and at 11:10am a collection of
      saliva will be performed. The volunteers will have the period of 15 minutes to be hygienised,
      and at 11:25am the ABPM will be placed (ambulatory blood pressure monitor). The ABPM will be
      taken the day after the test at 10:10 am (time for the first post-exercise BP measurement),
      and the last collection of saliva will be carried out concurrently with the ABPM removal.

    <time_frame>Every 15 minutes during 24 hours from 60 minutes after exercise</time_frame>
    <description>All volunteers were submitted to a 24-hour Blood Pressure (BP) assessment by Ambulatorial Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) 60 minutes after exercise. A device was used associated with a diary of examination to self-report of activities of daily living (sleep, work, food) or any event that could interfere abnormally with BP or device measurements. The device was always placed 7am and the measurements were made every 15 minutes from 7h to 23h and every 30 minutes from 23h to 7h. The monitoring was considered valid when it happened for a period of 24 hours. The following results were evaluated: systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure and heart rate in awake, sleep and 24-hour periods.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 20 minutes before and after the exercise and during the execution of the exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate (HR) was recorded using a heart rate monitor in a beat-by-beat basis. HR was registered in a seat position for 20 min of rest. Prior to the HR Variability (HRV) analysis, the RR intervals (RRi) were visually inspected and filtered using a moving average filter. The HRV was analyzed in both time-, frequency- and nonlinear-domain. Being that for frequency-domain analysis, firstly the RRi series were interpolated at 4 Hz and then the signal linear trend component removal was performed using the smooth priors approach.</description>

    <measure>Changes in salivary oxidative stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Before supplementation, right after, 60 minutes and 24 hour after exercise sessions</time_frame>
    <description>The salivary was collected after 12-hours fasting and the total antioxidant capacity was evaluated using the Ferric-Ability of Plasma (FRAP) methodology and calculated from the standard trolox curve. The activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined based on the auto oxidation capacity of pyrogallol and catalase activity (CAT) by monitoring the consumption of hydrogen peroxide at 240 nm. Lipid peroxidation levels were determined by the TBARS method (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), using as standard a curve of 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane (TMP). The total protein concentration was obtained by the Bradford method (BRADFORD, 1976), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. The amounts of nitric oxide (NO) were estimated by the determination of total nitrite by the Griess colorimetric method.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Ambulatorial Blood Pressure Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 15 minutes during 24 hours from 60 minutes after exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Based on Systolic, Diastolic and Mean Ambulatorial Blood Pressure data, were calculated Blood Pressure Variability by: 24-hour standard deviation weighted by the time interval between consecutive readings; the mean diurnal and nocturnal deviations weighted for the duration of the daytime and nighttime interval; the average real variability weighted for the time interval between consecutive readings; the ambulatory arterial stiffness index calculated by the slope of the trend curve of the dispersion of pressure data; the morning surge that represents the dynamic daytime variation in morning pressure that tends to increase, being assessed from the point of least pressure during sleep in relation to the first two hours after waking; and nocturnal dipping, that represents the average percentage drop of sleep pressure in relation to wakefulness, and individuals with falls of 10% or more are considered dippers and below that are considered nom-dippers.</description>
