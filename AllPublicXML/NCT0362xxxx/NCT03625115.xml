  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor urban minority children often experience delays in their early development leading to
      health disparities. Publicly funded early intervention services are available to improve
      child development among these children in Philadelphia, but few children access and complete
      these services. This can be due to parents misunderstanding what the services include or may
      be due to difficulties parents experience in overcoming barriers to participating. This study
      will test the effectiveness of the Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program, a patient
      navigation intervention designed to improve families' engagement with early intervention
      services and overcome barriers to access these services, on early child development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Developmental delays are frequently encountered among young children and disproportionately
      affect impoverished minority children leading to disparities in early child development. To
      promote healthy child development, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
      mandated early intervention (EI) services be made available to young children with delays,
      but only half of at-risk children initiate and complete EI services. As a result, many
      at-risk children may not receive needed services to improve their development. To foster
      initiation and completion of EI services, Investigators developed the Opening Doors to Early
      Intervention Program, a patient navigation intervention based on the Health Belief Model and
      targeted to at-risk urban minority children. An initial pilot study among at-risk children
      demonstrated feasibility and generated promising results. Therefore, this Community-Based
      Participatory Research application proposes to test the effectiveness of this program in a
      single urban county using a randomized trial design. The specific aims are to 1) determine
      the effectiveness of the Opening Doors to early Intervention Program on child developmental
      status and EI referral and services use, 2) assess whether parent engagement in early
      intervention mediates the effects of the program, and 3) explore whether the home learning
      environment, parental health literacy, and poverty moderate the effects of the program. This
      application addresses health disparities in early childhood by testing an intervention
      designed to improve participation rates in EI among urban minority children and their
      families on measures of early child development and EI services use. Three to four primary
      care pediatric clinics that provide care to this diverse urban community will be recruited to
      participate. Three hundred sixty children who are less than 30 months of age and have been
      identified as developmentally at-risk and referred for EI services at participating clinics
      will be randomized to receive the Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program or usual care.
      Urban minority parents who have previously participated in EI services will be trained as
      patient navigators to provide education, motivation, and assistance for families with
      initiation and completion of EI referrals and services. Clinicians and Child Find staff will
      provide usual care consisting of developmental screening and referrals without assistance.
      Information on participant demographic characteristics, health literacy, and the home
      learning environment at baseline; parent engagement and EI referral and services completion
      at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; and child development at 12 months will be collected during
      scheduled study visits. Differences in outcomes between intervention and control participants
      will be compared using intention-to-treat analysis. Findings from this comparative
      effectiveness study can be disseminated to similar large urban counties across the U.S. to
      inform Child Find and EI procedures and address disparities in early child development.

    <measure>Evaluation of the child's Cognitive functioning (i.e., sensorimotor development, problem solving skills)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) is a validated assessment of infant and toddler development for use with 1-42 month olds. The Cognitive domain consists of developmental play tasks that are administered to obtain a developmental quotient in order to determine the child's level of cognitive functioning. The composite score of the Cognitive domain is derived from a single scaled test score from the Cognitive Scale (as opposed to being comprised of the summation of scaled scores from multiple subscales, such as with the BSID-III Language and Motor composite scores). The total composite score may range from 40 to 160. Higher values denote stronger skills and abilities in the domain, indicating better outcomes. Composite scores are scaled to a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BSID-III motor functioning scale will be used to assess Fine Motor and Gross Motor skills such as manipulating small objects, stacking blocks, sitting, walking, and climbing stairs. The composite score of the Motor functioning domain is composed of the sum of both the Fine Motor and Gross Motor subscales' scaled scores.The total Motor composite score may range from 40 to 160. Higher values denote stronger skills and abilities in the domain, indicating better outcomes. Composite scores are scaled to a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the child's overall Language functioning (Receptive and Expressive Language skills and abilities)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BSID-III language scale will be used to assess both the understanding of language (receptive language) and use or expression of language (expressive language) skills, such as following simple directions, and naming or identifying objects and pictures. The total composite score of the Language functioning domain is composed of the sum of both the Receptive Language and the Expressive Language subscales' scaled scores. The total Language composite score may range from 40 to 160. Higher values denote stronger skills and abilities in the domain, indicating better outcomes. Composite scores are scaled to a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the child's Social-Emotional functioning (i.e. self regulation, emotional skills)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BSID-III social-emotional functioning scale is a parent-report measure in the format of a questionnaire. This scale will be used to assess the parent's report about the child's behaviors related to ease of calming, social responsiveness, imitation play, and adaptive behaviors. The total Social-Emotional composite score may range from 40 to 160. Higher values denote stronger skills and abilities in the domain, indicating better outcomes. Composite scores are scaled to a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.</description>

    <ipd_description>A complete, cleaned, and de-identified dataset will be made available to other investigators after all analyses have been conducted and within twelve months of the end of the final year of funding to allow for publication of all study aims. To obtain this data set, other investigators will need to contact the study Principal Investigator (PI) who will provide a data sharing agreement. The data sharing agreement will permit a deidentified data set to be shared once an Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol has been approved at the investigators' home institution and the investigators have signed a pledge to not attempt to identify individual study subjects. The data set will be made available on a Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) or through a secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site.</ipd_description>
