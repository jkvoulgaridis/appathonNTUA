      To evaluate the safety and exploratory efficacy of 1.0mg of Luminate® in patients with
      Intermediate Non-Exudative Macular Degeneration
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 eligible subjects who have been diagnosed with intermediate Non-Exudative
      AMD, that require treatment will be enrolled and randomized (1.7:1) to one of 2 treatment
      groups:

      Treatment Group 1: 25 Non-Exudative AMD subjects with BCVA of 20/40 - 20/200 will be injected
      intravitreally with 1.0mg of Luminate® Treatment Group 2: 15 Non-Exudative AMD subjects with
      BCVA of 20/40 - 20/200 will be treated with a sham injection

      At the 16-week visit, the study will be unmasked to the sponsor and injecting investigator
      (observing investigators will remain masked). Subjects in the treatment group will receive a
      2nd dose of Luminate®. Subjects in the control group will be offered the opportunity to
      crossover to treatment with a single dose of Luminate®.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients, 50 to 85 years of age at screening visit

          -  Subject has signed the Informed Consent form

          -  Subjects with Non-Exudative AMD having ETDRS BCVA between 33 and 72 letters read
             (equivalent to 20/40 - 20/200 on Snellen Chart) with the level of vision caused by the
             non-exudative AMD and no other factor/s

          -  Subjects with symptomatic decrease in visual acuity in the last 12 months

          -  Subjects with combination of areas of RPE disturbances (hyper or hypopigmentation)
             and/or &gt; 1 large druse(n) (&gt;125 microns) and/or multiple intermediate drusen (62-124
             microns) in the macula as confirmed by the central reading center

          -  Subjects with evidence of reasonably well-preserved areas of RPE by clinical
             examination and well-defined RPE and outer segment ellipsoid line by OCT examination
             in the central 1 mm of the macula as confirmed by the central reading center. More
             specifically, reasonable reasonably well- preserved central 1 mm of the macula means:

          -  The RPE and outer retinal layers throughout the central 1 mm are intact

          -  No signs of NVAMD such as intraretinal or sub retinal fluid, or sub retinal
             hyper-reflective material

          -  No serous pigment epithelium detachments &gt;100 microns in height

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy during the study or who are of
             childbearing potential not using a reliable method of contraception and/or not willing
             to maintain a reliable method of contraception during their participation in the
             study. Women of childbearing potential with a positive urine pregnancy test
             administered at baseline are not eligible to receive study drug.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 90 days of screening

          -  Subjects with active exudative AMD in the fellow eye

          -  Subjects who had anti-VEGF IVT in either eye in the past 90 days

          -  Subjects with pigment epithelium detachments

          -  Subjects with active exudative AMD

          -  Subjects with any prior retina surgery

          -  Subjects with pathology that could prevent observation and follow-up of macular
             structures and measurement of BCVA (i.e. advanced primary open angle glaucoma, any
             stage of normal tension glaucoma and corneal opacification)

          -  Subjects that are likely to require cataract surgery in the opinion of the
             investigator within the study protocol period
