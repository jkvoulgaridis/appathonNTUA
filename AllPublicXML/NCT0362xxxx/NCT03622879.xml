  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of concurrent mirror therapy (MT) and
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in augmenting the efficacy of the lower
      limb task-oriented training in people with stroke. It is hypothesize that MT combined with
      TENS would be superior to sham-mirror therapy with TENS, or MT with placebo-TENS, or control
      training only in improving lower limb motor functions and walking ability in people with
      stroke when combined with the lower limb task-oriented training.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) over a paretic lower
      limb could augment the effects of task-oriented exercise therapy on lower limb motor function
      in people with stroke, possibly through increased excitability of sensorimotor cortex.

      In mirror therapy (MT), the intact limb performs motor tasks while its mirror reflection is
      superimposed over the covered paretic limb, creating a visual illusion of enhanced function
      over the paretic limb. The visual input during MT could substitute for reduced proprioceptive
      inputs and increase spatial attention of the paretic limb, which could improve motor function
      of the paretic limb, possibly through increased cortical activity in the lesioned hemisphere
      and mirror neurone system.

      The next question concerns whether MT could be combined with TENS and whether their
      synergetic effects could maximise the motor output of paretic limbs in people with stroke.
