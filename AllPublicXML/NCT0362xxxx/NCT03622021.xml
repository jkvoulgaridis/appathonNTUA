  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose-escalation
      first-in human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity of AK111
      in healthy subjects following SC administration. The study will consist of cohorts of healthy
      subjects. Cohort 1, four unique subjects will be randomized to receive either active AK111
      (N=3) or matching placebo (N=1). Cohorts 2, 3, 4 and 5, eight unique subjects will be
      randomized to receive either active AK111 (N=6) or matching placebo (N=2). Approximately 36
      subjects will be treated in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria (as applicable) to be eligible
        for participation in this study.

          1. Have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF), which
             must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures.

          2. Female or male between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive, at screening.

          3. Must have a calculated body mass index (BMI) 19 ≤ BMI ≤ 32(inclusive) at screening,
             and a total body weight ≥ 50 kg for male or ≥ 45 kg for female at screening.

          4. Females of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in serum at
             screening and a negative serum pregnancy test on Day -1, either be of non-child
             bearing potential, defined as being:

               1. Postmenopausal (for at least 2 years before screening), verified by serum
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 mIU/mL at screening, or

               2. Permanently sterilized (eg, tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral
                  salpingectomy), or

               3. Congenitally sterile

          5. Women of child-bearing potential must use one of the following methods of
             contraception, from screening until at least 120 days after dosing:

             A highly effective method with a failure rate of less than 1%:

               -  Implant contraceptive (e.g. Jadelle)

               -  Intra-uterine device (IUD) containing either copper or levonorgestrel (e.g.
                  Mirena)

               -  Male sterilization (vasectomy)

               -  Female sterilization (e.g. by bilateral tubal ligation ('tying tubes') or
                  hysterectomy)

             A method for which the failure rate is between 5% and 10% in real life use, in
             combination with a barrier method (male condom):

               -  Injectable contraceptive (e.g. Depo Provera)

               -  Oral Contraceptive Pill (combined hormonal pill or progestogen-only 'mini-pill')

               -  Vaginal contraceptive ring (e.g. NuvaRing) Please note that condoms alone are not
                  highly effective methods of contraception. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm
                  method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control.

          6. Nonsterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception as listed above
             from Day 1 through 120 days after receipt of the last dose of study medication. It is
             strongly recommended for the female partner of a male subject to also us an effective
             method of contraception throughout this period.

          7. Must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be in good general health based upon medical
             history, physical examination (including vital signs), 12-lead ECG and clinical
             laboratory tests must fall within the clinical laboratory's reference normal ranges
             unless the results have been determined by the Investigator to have no clinical
             significance).

          8. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,
             and other study procedures as specified in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be
        enrolled in this study.

             of study medication (both men and women) while enrolled in the study.

          3. Have previously participated in an investigational trial involving administration of
             any investigational compound within 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)

             in the 4 weeks prior to the study dosing; Vitamin therapy or dietary supplements
             within 7 days prior to the study dosing and for the duration of the study; Herbal

             QuantiFERON screening. If the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test is indeterminate, a retest is
             allowed if results can be obtained. If the retest is also indeterminate, the subject
             will be excluded from the study. Subjects who have had household contact with a person
             with active TB are excluded.

         20. Have a history of lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphoma, or signs suggestive
             of possible lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or

             &gt;90 mmHg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the
             three BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.
