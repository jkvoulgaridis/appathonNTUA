  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate an educational video intervention (called Starting the
      Conversation) aimed to enhance breast cancer patients' beliefs about and communication with
      respect to sexual concerns. In the current study, 128 breast cancer outpatients will be
      randomized to either participate in the video intervention and to receive a resource guide
      addressing sexual and menopausal health or to receive the resource guide alone. Patients will
      be asked to participate in the video and/or read through the resource guide prior to their
      clinic visit with their breast cancer provider. The investigators will examine effects of the
      interventions on patients' beliefs about communication about sexual health and on patients'
      communication about sexual health during clinic visits with their providers. Secondarily, the
      investigators will examine effects of the interventions on sexual outcomes and other health
      outcomes, including psychological well-being and health-related QOL.
