  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fertility is of great importance to young women with cancer. Concerns about the ability to
      become pregnant after cancer treatment may influence treatment decisions and fertility
      decision-making is challenging. Despite these challenges, there is a lack of fertility
      decision support tools. Our team developed the Begin Exploring Fertility Options, Risks and
      Expectations (BEFORE) decision aid for young breast cancer patients in Canada. This study
      aims to evaluate the implementation of the BEFORE decision aid in hospital settings through a
      stepped wedge cluster randomized trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial to sequentially
      implement the BEFORE decision aid in clinical settings that are currently recruiting young
      breast cancer patients for the Reducing the bUrden of Breast cancer in Young women (RUBY)
      Study (www.womensresearch.ca/ruby-study/).

      For this trial 24 participating RUBY sites were grouped into 14 clusters (1 to 3 sites per
      cluster). The decision aid intervention will be sequentially rolled out over the course of 48
      weeks to all clusters. None of the clusters will be switched from control to intervention
      during the first 6 weeks of the study to establish a baseline. Then two clusters will move
      from the control to the intervention every 6 weeks (called a 'step'). There will be 7 steps
      total during the study period. At the end of the 7th step all clusters (i.e., participating
      RUBY sites) will have received the decision aid intervention. The time-point of when the
      clusters will be switched from control to intervention will be randomized.

      The data collection includes obtaining secondary data collected as part of the RUBY study
      from all patient participants who were enrolled in RUBY during the study period. The primary
      outcome is the number of patients reporting that fertility tools were recommended to them,
      based on RUBY participant responses to a 3-month fertility questionnaire. The investigators
      hypothesizes that following the implementation of the decision aid intervention a 20%
      difference will be observed, from 10% in the control to 30% in the intervention, in the
      number of patients who report that someone in their care team recommended a fertility tool.

    <description>Evaluate more intensive strategies to promote use of the BEFORE decision aid through:
We will advertise the availability of the BEFORE decision aid with posters placed in clinic areas at each RUBY site, and will have small handouts available to be distributed in clinic.
We will conduct an educational intervention describing and promoting the use of the BEFORE decision aid and general oncofertility information to nurses and support staff at each RUBY site. This will include an optional 1hr informational webinar, direct outreach and training of nurses/support staff on the use of the tool.</description>
