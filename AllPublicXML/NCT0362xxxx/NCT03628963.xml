      The study aims to develop a module of an eHealth platform, do a feasibility study through a
      pilot cluster randomized control trial and assess the scalability of the solution.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multimorbidity increases care needs and primary care use among people with chronic diseases
      (1). The Concerto Health Program (CHP) has been developed to optimize chronic disease
      management in primary care services. However, in its current version, the CHP primarily
      targets clinicians and does not aim to respond directly to the needs of patients and their
      informal caregivers for chronic disease management . This project aims to develop, implement
      and evaluate a user-centered, multifunctional and personalized eHealth platform (CONCERTO+)
      to promote a more active patient role in chronic disease management and decision-making
      through three phases.

      For phase1: A first prototype will be developed by the design and technology teams, in close
      collaboration with researchers, health professionals and patient representatives who will
      identify the functionalities to include in the CONCERTO+ solution.

      The Phase 2 of the project will consist in a feasibility study based on a pilot cluster
      randomized clinical trial (c-RCT) where patients with chronic diseases from a primary
      healthcare practice will receive CONCERTO+ and be compared to patients from a control
      practice receiving usual care.

      For Phase 3, the analysis of CONCERTO+ potential for scaling-up will be done by documenting
      factors and conditions associated with the sustainability and scaling-up of the solution. To
      do so, the investigators will conduct: 1) two focus groups with patients and informal
      caregivers who participated in the study (one with the experimental group and one with the
      control group, each group gathering between eight and twelve participants); 2)
      semi-structured individual interviews with health professionals at the two study sites, as
      well as with health care managers, information officers, and representatives of the Ministry
      of Health and Social Services.

    <description>The Patient Activation Measure -13 (2) is built on patient knowledge, skills and confidence that are directly targeted by the intervention and is associated to their activation level. Patients who are more activated have better health outcomes. Patients answer to a survey of 13 questions with the following scoring for each answer:
Strongly disagree = 1; Disagree = 2; Agree = 3; strongly agree = 4
The score of the activation level obtained (between 0 and 100) shows the degree of ability to manage their health with confidence according to the following scale ranges:
Not believing that activation is important (≤ 47)
Lack of knowledge or confidence to take action (47.1 - 55.1)
Beginning to take action (55.2 - 67)
Taking action (≥ 67.1).</description>

    <description>The effects of the use of Concerto + will be assessed and measured, using an adapted version of a survey from Glasgow et al. [3] and validated in the previous CHP (Concerto Health Program) assessment. Patients answer to a questionnaire six months after the use of Concerto+. 5 scales based on the key components of Concerto + are defined, and each scale include items: Solving-problems/Advices (4 items), Delivery System Design/Decision support (3 items), Goal Setting/Tailoring (5 items), Follow-up/coordination (5 items), Overall care (9 items). Items are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (Almost never) to 5 (Almost always), through following subscales 2 (Generally not); 3 (Sometimes); 4 (Most of the time). Higher scores from the assessment survey have better effects in care outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The acceptability of the device Concerto+ will be assessed by patient and informal caregiver, at the end of the intervention with:
A short survey adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model [4] that includes 3 criteria (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, behavioral intention to use) with the following scoring: Strongly disagree = 1; Disagree = 2; Agree = 3; strongly agree = 4. Higher scores rates have a better acceptance of the use of Concerto+.
The use of CONCERTO+ that will be measured by logs (Tests numbers, emergency visits, hospitalizations).</description>
