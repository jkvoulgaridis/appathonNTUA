      Comparison of trichloroacetic acid versus cantharidine for the treatment of perenial warts.

    <textblock>
      Warts are one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. They are caused by the human
      papilloma virus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer. Warts can grow, obstruct labor, and
      spread. Patients presenting to the obgyn clinic with perenial warts were randomized to
      treatment with trichloroacetic acid (one of the many types of treatments) or to the treatment
      with cantharidine group. Cantharidine is a vesicant extracted from beetle bugs which
      painlessly causes a small blister to form and cures the patient from the HPV infection
      causing the wart . We compared cosmesis, scar formation, pain and number of treatments
      (visits) as well as effectiveness in both groups.

      Objectives

        1. Determine if cantharone is more effective than trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for removal of
           warts

        2. Compare pain levels (pain during application) for each method

        3. Compare patient satisfaction for each method

        4. Compare scar formation and cosmesis for each method

    <description>Comparison of pain when treatment is applied. The patient is asked on a scale of 0-5 (with 5 being extreme pain, 4 being severe pain, 3 being moderate, 2 being mild, 1 being slight and zero being no pain, how do you rate your pain.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of a patient's likelihood of using this method again as measured on a survey question</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks from starting therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire given to the patient at the conclusion of the study and containing the question &quot;on a scale from 1-5 (5 most likely) how likely are you to recommend this method to a friend or using it again yourself&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of scarring or skin discoloration</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks from starting therapy</time_frame>
    <description>At the time of wart eradication, the treatment area is examined for healing. The clinician rates cosmesis on a scale from 0-5 with 5-skin grows back perfectly, 4-slight discoloration, 3-thickened skin, 1-slight scarring and 0-scarring.</description>

    <description>A thin film of cantharidin is applied to the surface of the wart and to 1 millimeter area surrounding the wart. After the film dries, it is covered with an occlusive dressing for 24 hours. The patient removes the area the next day and thoroughly washes the area with soap and water. Patients return to clinic a week later.</description>
