  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, physicians have several options in addressing the anatomic and physiologic sequela
      of facial paralysis. However, strategies to address the psychologic and coping ability for
      patients have not been investigated.

      The goal is to investigate the effect of mindfulness meditation on social functioning in
      patients with facial paralysis. This study will also explore whether increasing social
      functioning in patients with facial paralysis will improve overall quality of life. These
      questions will be answered using a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study population, facial paralysis was significantly associated with increased
      loneliness, decreased social function, decreased comfort with socializing, and worse quality
      of life scores. Furthermore, prior studies have shown that facial paralysis increases the
      likelihood of depression as measured on validated psychometric instruments. Currently,
      treating physicians have several options in addressing the anatomic and physiologic sequela
      of facial paralysis. However, strategies to address the psychologic and coping ability for
      patients have not been investigated. To better provide patient-centered care, physicians
      should consider the psychosocial impact of facial paralysis to identify patients who may
      benefit from additional support interventions to complement facial reanimation treatment
      plans.

      This is a prospective repeated measures study examining psychosocial status as measured by
      validated psychometric instruments. The intervention group will participate in mindfulness
      meditation using a phone application. Assessment of social functioning and quality of life
      will be conducted using survey instruments.
