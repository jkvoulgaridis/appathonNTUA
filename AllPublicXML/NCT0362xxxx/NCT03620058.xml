    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - 1. Patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL:

        a. Patients with 2nd or greater relapse or refractory to 1st salvage as defined by: i.
        Recurrent disease in the bone marrow identified morphologically, by immunohistochemistry or
        by Flow cytometry.

        ii. Patients with extramedullary relapse only (no bone marrow involvement) will be eligible
        if disease response can be assessed radiographically b. Patients with refractory disease as
        defined by: i. Failure to achieve remission (&lt;5% bone marrow blasts) after 2 cycles of
        induction chemotherapy ii. Patients that achieve remission but remain MRD+ after ≥2 cycles
        of induction chemotherapy.

        c. Patients with Ph+ ALL are eligible provided they are intolerant to or have failed
        tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

        d. Patients with prior or current history of CNS3 disease* will be eligible only if CNS
        disease is responsive to therapy.

        i. *CNS disease definitions:

          1. CNS1 - no blasts seen on cytocentrifuge (CNS negative);

          2. CNS2 - total nucleated cell count &lt;5x106/L, but blasts seen on cytocentrifuge;

          3. CNS3 - total nucleated cell count 5x106/L with blasts on cytocentrifuge and/or signs
             of CNS leukemia (i.e. cranial nerve palsy).

               -  2. For Cohort 1: Documentation of CD22 expression on malignant cells at relapse.

          -  5. Active acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring systemic
             therapy.

          -  6. Planned concurrent treatment with systemic steroids or immunosuppressant
             medications. Patients may be on a stable low dose of steroids (&lt;10mg equivalent of
             prednisone) for chronic respiratory conditions or adrenal insufficiency. For
             additional details regarding use of steroid and immunosuppressant medications.

          -  7. CNS3 disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that
             might increase the risk of CNS toxicity.
