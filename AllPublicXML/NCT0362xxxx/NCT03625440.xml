      Title: Acute effects of waterpipe smoking (WPS) on cognitive measures and cardiorespiratory
      parameters

      Objectives: To evaluate the acute effect of one cession of water pipe smoking on:

        1. executive functions which evaluated by cognitive tests administered included the digit
           span subtest Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-version III hebrew battery, and
           the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)

        2. Cardiorespiratory parameters included vital signs, spirometry parameters and lung
           clearance index (LCI) value

        3. serum carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cytokines

      Design: Prospective study evaluating these parameters before and after 30 minutes of water
      pipe smoking (WPS).

      Sample size: 55 participants (35 study group, 20 control group) Participant selection: Adults
      subjects who regularly smoke water pipe. Intervention: Each subject will undergo evaluation
      including cognitive tests, Cardiorespiratory parameters, carboxy- hemoglobin levels, nicotine
      levels, serum cytokines levels.

      All measurements will be evaluated before and after one cession of 30 minutes water pipe
      smoking

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of repeated testing 30 minutes apart without water pipe smoking (WPS) was
      evaluated in a group of 20 volunteers (age and sex matched).

      Primary outcome parameter: Change in cognitive tests scores Secondary outcome
      parameter:Change in Cardiorespiratory parameters included vital signs, spirometry parameters
      and lung clearance index (LCI) value, serum carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cytokines,
      before and after water pipe smoking

    <time_frame>Change from baseline immediately after 30 minutes of smoking</time_frame>
    <description>The digit span subtest Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) version III hebrew battery. Participants hear digit sequences of increasing lengths and have to recall them forward and in reversed order. Each level contains two equal number series with different numbers. Higher values represent a better outcome. Maximus score is 30 points.
Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) - Single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the participant must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The score is the total number correct out of 60 possible answers. Higher values represent a better outcome. Maximus score is 60 points.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after 30 minutes of smoking</time_frame>
    <description>LCI [multiple breath washouts (MBW)] measurements were performed using the Easy-One Pro, MBW Module (NDD Medical Technologies). The system consists of a side stream ultrasonic transducer for temperature- and humidity-independent sampling of the molar mass (MMss), a mainstream ultrasonic transducer for flow sampling, and a side stream infrared CO2 analyzer (DUET ETCO2 Module, Welch Allyn OEM Technologies, Beaverton OR) to correct the MMss signal for exhaled CO2. LCI was calculated as the cumulative expired volume during the washout phase divided by the functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the number of FRC turnovers required to washout the nitrogen. An increased LCI indicated more FRC turnovers required for the washout, reflecting ventilation inhomogeneity. At least three technical acceptable MBW tests were required for inclusion of the participants in the final analysis.</description>

    <description>The serum cytokines interleukin (IL) 2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) were measured and analyzed using Human Inflammatory Cytokines Multi-Analyte ELISArray™ Kit [Qiagen, kit# 336161, Hilden, Germany].
