  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, the safety and the main predictors of
      success of bronchoscopic Argon Plasma Coagulation in patients with hemoptysis caused by
      endobronchial malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemoptysis is a challenging symptom which may be frequently related to endobronchial
      malignancies. Patients with central neoplasms and hemoptysis show a lower median survival
      than patients with no bleeding and endobronchial neoplasms and/or patients with hemoptysis
      and peripheral malignant lesions.

      Hemoptysis control without recurrence at 48 hours after bronchoscopic interventions may
      improve survival in patients with mild bleeding and endobronchial malignancies.

      Argon Plasma Coagulation is considered one of the most effective techniques for endobronchial
      management of hemoptysis in this subset of patients. Nevertheless, few data are available in
      literature on its efficacy and safety, and the main predictors of success are still unclear.

      In this prospective, observational study, investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy (i.e.
      immediate bleeding cessation without recurrence during the following 48 hours) of endoscopic
      Argon Plasma Coagulation in patients with hemoptysis caused by endobronchial neoplasms.

      Investigators will also evaluate the safety of the procedure, the main variables associated
      to a successful intervention, the presence of hemoptysis relapses and patients overall
      survival to 3,5 months after the bronchoscopic intervention.

    <description>Patients will be treated with Argon Plasma Coagulation. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a form of non contact electrocoagulation. APC utilizes electrically conductive argon plasma as a medium to deliver high-frequency current via a flexible probe. The argon plasma flow transfers electricity between the probe and the target tissue. Tracheobronchial access is obtained by passing the probe through the working channel of the bronchoscope. On arrival to the tissue, the application of energy causes uniform zones of desiccation, coagulation and devitalization in the areas receiving treatment, thus inducing hemostasis.</description>
