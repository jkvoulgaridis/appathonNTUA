  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of gynecological prolapse (organ removal) can be done by laparoscopy or
      vaginally. Laparoscopy is used in 1 out of 2 cases, but learning is difficult and operation
      time is long. One of the technical difficulties is related to the sutures to the threads.
      Some surgeons therefore use a glue to fix prosthetic reinforcements more easily and quickly,
      but this sizing technique has only been evaluated very little. Our study proposes to compare
      the technique of suture with the thread at the gluing of the prostheses in order to validate
      the merits of this new technique

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic promontofixation is a surgical technique considered by some as the reference
      technique. Its difficulty of learning and the duration of operation are factors limiting its
      diffusion. The use of cyanoacrylate glue is proposed to simplify the procedure, without there
      being any comparative studies between the sutures over and the sizing of prosthetic
      reinforcements.

      The main objective of the study is to compare the operative time of promontofixation by
      coelioscopy with suture using threads to promontofixation using glue.

      Secondary objectives are the comparison between the two groups of complications per and
      postoperative, objective anatomical results and functional results of the tissue reaction
      judged by clinical examination (palpation) and ultrasound and direct cost.

    <description>The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 questionnary: it is both a symptom inventory and a measure of the degree of bother and distress (quality-of-life) caused by pelvic floor symptoms.The PFDI-20 includes 20 questions and 3 scales. Each of the 3 scales is scored from 0 (least distress) to 100 (greatest distress). The sum of the scores of these 3 scales serves as the overall summary score of the PFDI-20 and ranges from 0 - 300. The 3 scales include questions taken from the following widely used outcome measures: Urinary Distress Inventory - 6 questions, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory - 6 questions, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory - 8 questions</description>
