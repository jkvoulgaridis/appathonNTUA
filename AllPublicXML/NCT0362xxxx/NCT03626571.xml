  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET scanning (positron emission tomography) is a well-established technique used to identify
      areas of interest within the body. It involves injecting a radioactive tracer which
      highlights abnormal areas. It has recently been combined with CT (computed tomography) and
      MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning to more accurately identify abnormalities within
      the heart. Infective endocarditis (infection of the heart valves or lining of the heart) and
      device infection (where a pacemaker device or wire becomes infected) are of particular
      interest in this area.

      The study makes use of hybrid PET/MR scanning using a designated scanner which enables PET
      scanning combined with MRI scanning. PET scanning combined with CT scanning will be used
      instead for patients who aren't able to undergo MRI scanning. This will allow abnormal areas
      within the heart in these conditions to be characterised, alongside treatment regimens, in a
      way which hasn't been done before.

      All participants will undergo PET scanning, where a radioactive tracer is injected into a
      vein before the scan. The radioactive substance only lasts for a short time, passed out of
      the body in urine. Patients with infective endocarditis involving their own heart valve will
      undergo an MRI scan as part of the PET scan. Patients with infective endocarditis involving a
      metal or prosthetic heart valve and also patients who have pacemaker infections, instead of
      an MRI, will have a CT scan. The reason for this is that CT is better for looking at metal
      and prosthetic heart valves and patients with pacemakers can't have MRI scans because the
      strong magnet in the scanner can affect the pacemaker. The scan will be performed twice; once
      before treatment and once after treatment has been established.

      If successful, this imaging method will play a key role in diagnosing, quantifying and
      monitoring these conditions.
