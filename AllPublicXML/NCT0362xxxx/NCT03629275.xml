  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study of stereotactic, intracerebral injection of CTX0E03 neural stem cells into patients
      with moderate to moderately severe disability as a result of an ischemic stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. Patients with persistent
      disability 6-24 months following an ischemic stroke will be enrolled following confirmation
      of eligibility. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to undergo a stereotactic surgery and receive
      a single administration of CTX0E03 Drug Product by intracerebral implantation or undergo sham
      surgery only (placebo). Patients will be followed for 12 months after surgery with follow-up
      assessments occurring at various time points over the 12 months. All eligible patients will
      be assigned a standardized Physical Therapy (PT) program. Patients will complete their daily
      PT exercises at home for 12 weeks after their surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects in which Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) improves by â‰¥1 point at Month 6 from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mRS is an ordinal scale from 0-6, where 0 represents no disability, and each grade above 0 represents a subject's increased level of disability and dependence upon others to perform daily activities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in a subject's ability to execute activities of daily living using the Barthel Index (BI).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BI is an ordinal scale used to measure a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living. Sum scores from 10 items are calculated with total possible scores ranging from 0-100, with lower scores indicating increased disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in restoring a subject's motor function using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke (FMA).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FMA is used to assess motor function in post-stroke, hemiplegic patients. The FMA is comprised of 5 sections, and respective items within each section are scored using a 3-point ordinal scale with 0 representing inability to perform task. Total possible score is 226.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in a subject's perception to stroke recovery using the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS is a stroke-specific, comprehensive measure of health status. The SIS is comprised of 59 items with each item rated on a 5 point Likert scale in terms difficulty. A score of 1 represents an inability to complete an item, where a score of 5 represents no difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in a subject's health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rate each of 5 dimensions with a numerical rating (1-5) where 1 represents no difficulty to 5 representing an inability, and where a lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>
