  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 dose-escalation
      clinical trial. The objective of the trial is to determine if IBC adjuvanted with MAS-1 is
      safe and will favor tolerogenic pathways to restore immunologic balance and reverse T1D
      autoimmunity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this four-arm (cohort) study, subjects (5 active MER3101 per arm plus 2 MAS-1 placebo)
      will be randomized to receive two intramuscular doses at days 1 and 28. Subjects will receive
      either MAS-1 placebo emulsion, or MAS-1 adjuvanted IBC at 33, 109 and 327 µg IBC in 0.25 mL
      MAS-1 adjuvanted emulsion, followed by an additional arm to receive the maximum safe IBC dose
      selected from the first 3 arms in an increased dose volume of 0.5 mL MAS-1 emulsion and 2
      subjects to receive 0.5 mL MAS-1 placebo control emulsion. All groups will receive standard
      intensive diabetes treatment with insulin and dietary management. The primary endpoint is to
      assess the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of progressively higher IBC antigen doses of
      the vaccine, and at 2 dose volumes (0.25 and 0.5 mL) of MAS-1 adjuvant emulsion at the
      maximum safe dose of IBC antigen. In addition, to determine if the vaccine induces a shift
      towards protection shown by increased levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and TGF-b and regulatory
      changes in insulin-specific T and B cells using novel reagents to detect these unique
      populations of cells in treated subjects.
