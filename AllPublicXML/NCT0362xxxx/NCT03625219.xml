  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 cohorts.

      In Cohort A, approximately 40 subjects will participate in a single-center, open-label,
      non-randomized, parallel-group trial to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in
      delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to various antigens and assess the most appropriate skin
      challenge antigen to study the effect of systemic treatments on T cells.

      Following evaluation of the results in Cohort A, approximately 20 healthy volunteers will be
      enrolled in Cohort B. This cohort will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized, two-arm,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid treatment on the molecular
      and cellular phenotype of delayed hypersensitivity response to one if the antigens previously
      studied in Cohort A.

             For woman of childbearing potential, has had a negative urine pregnancy test at
             screening and on Day 1 (baseline).

          -  Subjects has acceptable reaction to selected antigens.

          -  Subject is willing to participate and is capable of giving informed consent. Note:
             Consent must be obtained prior to any study-related procedures.

          -  Subjects must be willing to comply with all study procedures and must be available for
             the duration of the study.

        Cohort B:

          -  Subject is in good general health, according to the investigator's judgment based on
             vital signs, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests performed.

          -  For subject (woman) involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead to pregnancy,
             subject agrees that an effective contraceptive method will be used, from at least 4
             weeks prior to screening until at least 4 weeks after the last study product
             administration. Effective contraceptive methods include hormonal contraceptives
             (combined oral contraceptive, patch, vaginal ring, injectable, or implant),
             intrauterine devices or intrauterine systems, vasectomized partner(s), tubal ligation,

        for at least 4 weeks before Day 1 and will continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal
        intercourse throughout the study. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be
        evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual
        lifestyle of the participant.
