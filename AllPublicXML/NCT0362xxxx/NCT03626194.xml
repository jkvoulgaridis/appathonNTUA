    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective registry of patients undergoing endoscopic suturing and/or clip
      placement at our institution to assess the efficacy and safety of endoscopic tissue
      apposition.

      1.1 Hypothesis: Endoscopic tissue apposition is efficacious and safe in the practice of
      gastrointestinal endoscopy.

      1.2 Aims: To prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of Endoscopic Tissue Apposition
      in the practice of gastrointestinal endoscopy.

        A prospective database/registry of patients undergoing endoscopic tissue apposition will be
        formed. Women and minorities will be included as they are frequently found to have
        indications for which endoscopic tissue apposition may be indicated.
