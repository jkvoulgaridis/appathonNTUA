    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 and
      Prevnar 13™ in healthy infants switched from Prevnar 13™ to V114 during the Pneumococcal
      Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) immunization schedule.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days after each Prevnar 13™ and V114 vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. Injection-site AEs solicited on the Vaccination Report Card are swelling, redness, pain or tenderness, and hard lump.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. Systemic AEs solicited on the Vaccination Report Card are irritability, drowsiness, appetite loss, and hives or welts.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a Vaccine-related Serious Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after Dose 4 (Study Month 19)</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that is life-threatening, requires or prolongs an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is another important medical event deemed such by medical or scientific judgment. Relatedness of an SAE to the study vaccine will be determined by the investigator.</description>
