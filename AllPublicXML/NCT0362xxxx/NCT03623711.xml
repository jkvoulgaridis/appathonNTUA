  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressants is the primary treatment for depression, but only less than 50% of the
      patients get clinical remission. There is no objective markers to select antidepressants for
      clinical treatment . Clinical choose usually use experience and waste a lot of time, even the
      patients cannot be treated timely and effectively. The investigators found that the later
      antidepressant effect for 8 weeks is related with early brain functional response. Present
      prospectively drug treatment and follow-up study intends to adopt pharmacological imaging
      research methods to detect the brain function or structure change of three different
      mechanisms of antidepressant drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,
      escitalopram), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, duloxetine),
      norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs, bupropion) in depression patients.
      Brain functional or structural magnetic resonance imaging data were collected at baseline, 1
      days, 14 days and 12 weeks after treatment. The investigators want to observe the changes of
      brain functional networks and structure at different time points, acute and chronic treatment
      induced during drug treatment. Combined with the blood concentration detection, symptom
      change, cognitive function tests, the investigators also hope to determine the different
      mechanisms of drug efficacy of antidepressants with different mechanisms. The second aim is
      to explore different mechanisms of brain function for effective or ineffective drug response.
      The results of the study will help to further explain the mechanism of different
      antidepressants, to facilitate the development of early indicators for drug efficacy and
      individual treatment decision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      about 150 depression patients were divided into three subgroups, for each group was treated
      by one antidepressant eg.escitalopram,duloxetine,bupropion.Brain magnetic resonance imaging
      data were conducted for all patients at baseline, 1 days, 14 days and 12 weeks after
      treatment. The blood concentration detection, symptom change, cognitive function tests were
      also conducted. combined with these results the investigators aim to determine the different
      mechanisms of drug efficacy of antidepressants with different mechanisms and to explore
      different mechanisms of brain function for effective or ineffective drug response
