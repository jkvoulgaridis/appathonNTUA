  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal injury (AKI) is a common complication after cardiac surgery and is associated
      with worse outcomes. It is now realized that intraoperative hypotension is an important risk
      factor for the development of AKI. In a recent randomized controlled trial of patients
      undergoing major noncardiac surgery, intraoperative individualized blood-pressure management
      reduced the incidence of postoperative organ dysfunction. The investigators hypothesize that,
      for patients undergoing off-pump CABG, targeted blood-pressure management during surgery may
      also reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI.

    <textblock>
      Acute renal injury (AKI) is a common complication after cardiac surgery. In patients
      undergoing noncardiac surgery, intraoperative hypotension may lead to hypoperfusion of
      important organs and result in organ injuries such as AKI, myocardial injury, and stroke. The
      development of organ injuries is associated with wose outcomes including higher 30-day or
      even 1-year mortality. In a recent randomized controlled trial, patients undergoing major
      noncardiac surgery received either individualized (systolic blood pressure [SBP] maintained
      within 10% of the reference level) or standard (SBP maintained above 80 mmHg or within 40% of
      the reference level) blood-pressure management strategy during surgery. The results showed
      that individualized blood-pressure management reduced the incidence of postoperative organ
      dysfunction. Intraoperative hypotension is very common during off-pump coronary artery bypass
      grafting (CABG) surgery. The investigators hypothesize that, for patients undergoing off-pump
      CABG, good blood-pressure management with norepinephrine may also reduce the incidence of
      postoperative AKI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of targeted
      blood-pressure management during off-pump CABG surgery on the incidence of postoperative AKI.
