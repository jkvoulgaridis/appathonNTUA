  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 39 million people of adults aged 20-79 are living with Diabetes in MENA region
      in 2017, Egypt is number 8 in the top 10 countries in number of adults with Diabetes (8.2
      million), where Egypt represents 21% of the Diabetics in MENA region.

      Metformin is used as 1st line oral anti-diabetic drug in most cases. Sulfonylureas (SU) are
      used as frequent first add-on after failure of metformin monotherapy. Sodium Glucose
      Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a newer class of therapy which has a lower incidence
      of hypoglycemia and in addition helps in weight and BP reduction. In Egypt, SGLT2 inhibitors
      were introduced in 2016. It is not yet widely used for various reasons including lack of wide
      clinical experience in Egyptian patients and safety concerns particularly related to
      infections and some rare Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). Also, usage of SGLT2 inhibitors is
      limited in the early stage of diabetes as they are usually preferred as 3rd or 4th add-on
      therapy.

      The existing dapagliflozin phase-3 clinical trial program on SGLT2 inhibitors didn't include
      subjects from Egypt. There is no study available which evaluates the effect of dapagliflozin
      in real world scenario in Egypt. Key opinion leaders in diabetes in Egypt have also
      identified the need for study on Egyptian subjects to observe the usage pattern and effect of
      dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, in this specific real world setting. Therefore, there is a
      need for data on real world setting across Egypt. With this aim in mind, the present study
      has been planned.

        This study is a non-interventional, multi centre, retrospective -prospective, observational
        study to be conducted at up to 50 sites in Egypt. The study targets to enroll 200 patients.
        The study would enroll T2DM patients who are/were inadequately controlled (HbA1c &gt;7%) with
        existing antidiabetic medications and who have been prescribed dapagliflozin at least 3
        months prior to study initiation. No study medication will be prescribed or administered as
        a part of study procedure. Patients, who have been treated as per Investigators' routine
        clinical practice and prescribed dapagliflozin at least 3 months before will be screened
        for enrolment in study. Dosage of dapagliflozin and other medications should be as per the
        routine clinical practice and prescribing information. The study will be initiated after
        obtaining written approval of Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) /Institutional Review
        Board (IRB).
