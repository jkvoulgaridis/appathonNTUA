  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares effects of 4-week walking training program on a walking track with
      difference surface [WTDS] and a firm ground on functional ability of ambulatory individuals
      with incomplete spinal cord injury [iSCI], using within- and between-group comparisons.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10-meter walk test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects walk at a comfortable pace along a 10m walkway. The test records the time use over the middle 4m of the walkway in order to minimize acceleration and deceleration effects. Then the average time over the 3 trials is converted to walking speed using the formula v=distance (m) /time (s)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test (TUGT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects stand up from a standard armchair, walk around a traffic cone that is located 3m away from the chair, and return to sit down on the chair at a maximum and safe speed. The test records the time taken from the command &quot;Go&quot; until the subject's back against the backrest of the chair. Then the average times finding over the 3 trials is used for data analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Five times sit-to-stand test (FTSST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time taken to complete 5 chair-rise cycles at a fastest and safe speed is measured for each subject. Then the average time over the 3 trials is used for data analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects walk along a rectangular walkway as long as possible in 6 minutes. Every minute during the test, they are informed the time left and encouraged to continue in a good manner. Subjects are able to take a period of rest as needed and continued walking as soon as they can. The distance covered after 6 minutes are recorded</description>

    <measure>Incidence of fall</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months after completing the training program.</time_frame>
    <description>Then subject will be monthly monitored for the fall data during 6 months using a fall diary and telephone.</description>
