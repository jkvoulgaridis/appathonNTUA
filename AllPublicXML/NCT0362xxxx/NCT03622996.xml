      Background: Contact sensors can cause injuries and infections in newborn infants with fragile
      skin. The impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar is recently demonstrated in adults as a
      contactless method to measure heart rate. The purpose of this study is to assess heart rate
      (HR) in neonates using IR-UWB radar and evaluate its accuracy, compared to the
      electrocardiogram (ECG) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

      Methods: HR is recorded in newborn infants using both IR-UWB radar 35 cm away from the chest
      and ECG simultaneously in the NICU. The HR data during sleeping/calm state are automatically
      collected by a software algorithm. A total values averaged from a 30-second window every 10 s
      is used for the analysis. Data acquired on the same patient with standard electrocardiogram
      has been used for comparison.

    <textblock>
      Vital sign is recorded by the radar and bedside ECG simultaneously in supine position within
      an open-air crib.

      The three electrodes of the ECG are attached at the standard positions and connected to the
      BSM-6501K patient monitor (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), and vital signs are recorded and
      extracted.

      The data from the radar is connected to a computer through a USB interface, and signal
      processing has been automatically performed by a software algorithm described by our previous
      study. A Fourier transform decomposes a signal with respect to time into a frequency
      component.

      Vital sign is recorded continuously, and digital outputs are extracted from periods when no
      large noise or fluctuation occurs in both methods. While vital sign acquisition is
      significantly interfered with moving extensively, being in nursing care, repetitive
      myoclonus, hiccupping, flopping, or crying, the IR-UWB radar system stops the measurements
      and deletes the motion-contaminated observations automatically by itself. To investigate the
      artifact and interference by body movement during measurement, the level of movement is
      integrated based on the change of distance of the body from the radar. The radar transmits
      dozens of these signals (frames) to the computer every second, and the frame would not be
      changed if there was no movement within the range of the radar. However, if there is any
      movement, the difference of two frames (previous - current) is calculated.
