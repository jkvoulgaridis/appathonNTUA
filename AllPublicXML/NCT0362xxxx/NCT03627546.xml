  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized study is to determine whether a community‐based test and treat
      model of hepatitis C (HCV) care delivery will be superior to the usual care practice of
      referral to specialist clinics for the outcomes of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks
      after treatment and initiation of HCV treatment for persons who inject drugs (PWID) between
      ages 18 and 29 who are naïve to HCV treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ST&amp;RT is a randomized open‐label clinical trial in which 54 HCV infected PWID between ages 18
      and 29 will be randomized to either receive the same‐day treatment initiation of the
      FDA‐approved fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir 400mg and velpatasvir 100mg (SOF/VEL) with
      follow up and medical monitoring at a community site (Intervention arm) or to receive
      referral to an HCV treatment provider's office (Usual Care Arm).

    <description>The intervention arm receives same‐day medical evaluation and treatment for hepatitis C. They receive medical evaluation, laboratory assessment , baseline questionnaire/interview, and distribution of a medication (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) &quot;starter pack&quot; on the day of enrollment. Participants who are HCV RNA negative are discontinued from the study. Other participants start medications and receive weekly text messages during treatment to record adherence. They have follow up visits for laboratory tests, medication distribution, and counseling for prevention of reinfection. They have HCV testing at end of treatment and 12 weeks post treatment, and at 48 weeks to assess for reinfection. Each study visit will include a brief questionnaire and qualitative interview.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control arm will be provided facilitated referral to community HCV providers by an on‐site care coordinator already facilitating care at the community site. HCV RNA negative participants will be called to inform them of these results, and then discontinued from the study. HCV RNA positive participants will be asked during the semi‐structured interviews as at 12, 24, 36 and 48 week if they engaged in HCV treatment to assess whether their HCV referral has been filled, and to record their current HCV treatment status. They will also receive repeat HCV RNA testing at week 12, 24, and 48. Participants that have started treatment will be asked to sign consent for release of medical records pertaining to HCV‐related laboratory testing to determine achievement of treatment response.</description>
