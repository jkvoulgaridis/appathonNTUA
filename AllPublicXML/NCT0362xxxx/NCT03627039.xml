  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of sodium glucose co-transporter
      2 (SGLT2) inhibitors relative to metformin for reducing subsequent cardiovascular events in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The investigators will conduct a population-based, new-user, longitudinal-cohort study using
      a nationwide US commercial insurance claims database. The investigators will compare adults
      with diabetes mellitus type 2 over the age of 18 who were newly prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor
      or metformin between March 29, 2013 (date of US approval of first SGLT2) and January 1st,
      2017 (most recent available data). Patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 will be identified
      using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 codes.
      Cohort entry date will be the date of the first prescription for an SGLT2 or metformin. New
      users of SGLT2 or metformin will be defined as those without a prior prescription for either
      class of medications, or any other medication for diabetes, in the preceding 180 days.

      Baseline Covariates: All covariates will be assessed prior to cohort entry. Covariates will
      reflect diagnoses and procedures recorded during health encounters, including chronic medical
      conditions (e.g., hypertension, coronary artery disease), diabetes severity (e.g., hemoglobin
      A1C, end-organ damage), overall healthcare utilization (e.g., recent hospitalization,
      emergency department visit), prescriber characteristics (e.g., endocrinologist, general
      practitioner), and medications (e.g., anti-hypertensives, diuretics).

      Statistical analysis Propensity score matching will be used to adjust for confounding. The
      probability of initiating an SGLT2-inhibitor will be calculated through a multivariable
      logistic regression model containing all of the baseline covariates. Using this propensity
      score, patients prescribed an SGLT2 were matched 1:1 with patients prescribed metformin using
      a caliper of up to 0.1 on the probability scale. Covariate balance between the matched
      cohorts was assessed using standardized differences. Since laboratory data were not available
      for all patients, these were not included in the propensity score estimation.

      After propensity score matching, proportional hazards models will be used to estimate the
      incidence rate, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome without
      further adjustments. Schoenfeld residuals will be plotted to assess the proportional hazards
      assumption. Predefined sensitivity and subgroup analyses included an intention to treat
      analysis where the censoring criteria of drug discontinuation, switching or augmentation are
      removed. The investigators will also assess the primary risk in a cohort restricted to
      patients with a past-history of cardiovascular disease if our sample size allows it. To test
      the specificity of our findings, the investigators will also conduct a tracer analysis using
      cellulitis as an outcome, since cellulitis is not associated with SGLT2s or metformin.
