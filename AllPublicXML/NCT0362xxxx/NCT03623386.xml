      Effect of Mental Imagery Training on Brain Plasticity and Motor Function in Individuals with
      Parkinson's Disease: A functional MRI investigation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine the effect of functional MRI-based neurofeedback on brain
      plasticity and motor performance in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in right insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex functional connectivity strength.</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The functional connectivity strength between the subjects' right insula and dorsomedial frontal cortex will be measured at baseline and post-intervention as each group of subjects engages in their respective imagery tasks. Functional connectivity will be measured as the correlation value between the functional MRI signal time courses obtained from these two brain regions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in resting-state functional connectivity of the right insula and dorsomedial frontal cortex.</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will obtain resting-state functional MRI scans from the PD-neurofeedback and PD-control groups at baseline and post-intervention to examine the changes in intrinsic functional connectivity of the right insula and dorsomedial frontal cortex with each other and with the whole brain. Functional connectivity will be measured as the correlation value between the functional MRI signal time courses obtained from these two brain regions and every other brain region.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in motor impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will administer the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III (motor exam) at baseline and post-intervention to the PD-neurofeedback and PD-control groups to measure the change in motor impairment. The MDS-UPDRS part III is a subscale that provides an objective assessment of motor impairment. The scores range between 0-132. Higher scores indicate more severe impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will administer standard motor function tests (e.g., timed up and go, 5 times sit-to-stand, 50-ft walk, 360-degree turn) at baseline and post-intervention to the PD-neurofeedback and PD-control groups to measure the change in motor function. The performance score on these tests is the time to complete the motor tasks. Shorter time indicates better performance. We will z-transform and sum the time to completion (in seconds) on each motor task to compute a composite motor function score.</description>

There will be a total of 10-12 neurofeedback sessions on two separate days. Subjects will continue practicing motor imagery at home every day throughout the study period for 4-6 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD defined according to the UK Brain Bank

          -  History of a neurological disorder such as a brain tumor, stroke, central nervous
             system infection, multiple sclerosis, movement disorder (other than PD), or seizures

             associated with parkinsonism

          -  Motor symptoms that could potentially introduce too much motion artifact in the
             imaging data (e.g., MDS-UPDRS resting tremor score &gt; 1 in limbs, head/chin tremor, or
             dyskinesia by history or exam).
