      This study compares intra-articular lidocaine to procedural sedation for the reduction of
      anterior shoulder dislocations in the emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial on a
      convenience sample of patients presenting to the ED with anterior shoulder dislocations. This
      study will enroll all patients between the ages of 18 and 70 who meet all of the inclusion
      criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria, who present to the ED with an
      anterior shoulder dislocation as determined by the ED physician. Written, informed consent
      will be obtained from each patient. After enrollment, each patient will be randomized either
      to IV sedation (with the provider's choice of propofol or etomidate) or intra-articular
      lidocaine. Randomization will be done before the initiation of data collection, and will be
      done with a random number generator. Patients who are randomized to the intra-articular group
      will receive 20 mL of 1% lidocaine injected into the glenohumeral joint using a lateral
      approach. Treating clinicians will be instructed to wait 10 minutes after injection before
      attempting reduction. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in emergency
      department length of stay between the procedural sedation and intra-articular lidocaine
      groups.
