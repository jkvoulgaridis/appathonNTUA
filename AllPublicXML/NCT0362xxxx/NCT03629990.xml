  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective and durable treatments for cannabis use disorder remain elusive. Given the
      increasing prevalence rates of cannabis use and CUD nationwide, investigation of novel
      treatments is warranted. Implicit cognitive processing is an emerging, and potentially
      critical therapeutic target.

      Cognitive models of addiction posit an override of explicit control-related cognitive
      processes by implicit reward-driven processes resulting from chronic drug exposure. One form
      of implicit cognitive processing is approach bias, or, the automatic tendency to approach
      rather than avoid drug cues, which has been identified for alcohol, nicotine, opioids, and
      cannabis. Cannabis approach bias predicts increased cannabis use, dependence severity, and
      cannabis-related problems among heavy cannabis users. Approach bias modification (ABM) is a
      novel treatment approach that seeks to reduce approach bias by attenuating the
      incentive-salience of drug cues, and subsequently, drug cue reactivity and drug use. ABM has
      been shown to reduce relapse rates in alcohol dependent adults by 10-13% at one-year
      follow-up, and dependence severity in nicotine dependent adults. Our pilot data suggests that
      ABM may also reduce cannabis craving and that gender may moderate the effect of ABM on
      cannabis sessions per day in non-treatment seeking adults with CUD. A recent fMRI study with
      alcohol-dependent adults found decreased mesolimbic activation in participants who received
      ABM compared to sham-control participants. ABM appears to target implicit reward-driven
      processes, and could be an effective adjunct to traditional psychosocial and/or future
      pharmacological interventions that target explicit control-related processes.

      Building on our promising feasibility data, the proposed K23 research study will examine the
      effects of ABM on cue-reactivity and cannabis outcomes in a four-session randomized,
      double-blind, sham-controlled pilot treatment trial. One-hundred and six (106)
      treatment-seeking adults with moderate to severe CUD will be randomized to receive either
      MET/CBT plus ABM or Motivational Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy(MET/CBT)
      plus sham-ABM. An equal number of men and women will be recruited and randomization will be
      stratified by gender. ABM sessions will occur following each of the three weekly MET/CBT
      therapy sessions. Primary outcomes will include cannabis cue-reactivity and cannabis use.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be age 18-65 and must be able to provide informed consent.

          2. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current moderate to severe CUD (past 60 days).

          3. Identify cannabis as their primary substance of choice.

          4. Consent to remain abstinent from alcohol and cannabis for 12 hours immediately prior
             to study visits and other drugs of abuse (except nicotine) for three days prior (see
             Additional Instrumentation below for methods); by restricting cannabis and other
             substance use as proposed, participants should not be under the acute effects of
             cannabis or other substances.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of, or a history of serious medical or neurological disease that may affect
             cognitive processing.

          2. History of, or current psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit
             hyperactivity disorder, or current untreated major depressive disorder as these may
             interfere with subjective measurements.

          3. Current use of psychotropic medications because these may affect subjective
             measurements (individuals taking antidepressants will be allowed).

          4. Current suicidal ideation. Individuals who endorse suicidal ideation will be seen by a
             psychologist or psychiatrist in the office and will be referred to treatment as
             necessary.

          5. Women who are pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential and not practicing an
             effective means of birth control.

          6. Moderate to severe DSM-5 substance use disorder within the past 60 days (other than
             nicotine or cannabis).
