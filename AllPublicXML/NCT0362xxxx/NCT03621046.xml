      This study will evaluate the motor and cognitive benefits of low-dose zolpidem in
      Parkinson's.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zolpidem is a hypnotic drug which at sub-sedative doses has been shown to improve both motor
      and cognitive deficits in stroke, dementia and Parkinson's. This has led to the hypothesis
      that low-dose zolpidem will be effective in early-stage Parkinson's, delaying the need for
      dopamine-replacement interventions, as an adjunct therapy, and in late-stage Parkinson's
      where current interventions are ineffective for motor and cognitive decline. At present, the
      symptoms of late-stage Parkinson's are the most debilitating and the least well-controlled.
      Here, the investigators propose a placebo controlled double-blinded proof-of-concept study in
      order to determine the benefits of taking low-dose zolpidem in late-stage Parkinson's. The
      study will take place over 12 months. 28 participants, diagnosed with Parkinson's for at
      least 5 years will be recruited; 14 participants will take zolpidem (5 mg) and 14 placebo,
      each morning for 4 days. In the clinic (day 1) clinical assessments will include the motor
      III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and cognitive verbal fluency
      tasks which will be conducted at baseline and 1 hour following drug administration. Each
      participant will then be issued with a smartphone with application to objectively test their
      motor performance 4 times a day, over the next six days (3 days on drug, 3 days off drug).
      This study will provide the necessary data on drug efficacy in order to design a phase II
      clinical trial for the use of low-dose zolpidem in late-stage Parkinson's.

    <measure>Changes in motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>In the clinic (day 1), motor function will be assessed before and after active/placebo administration using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (Part III). This involves 26 assessments (scored 0-4) including of tremor, rigidity, agility and posture. Scores therefore range from 0 to 104, the higher the score indicating reduced motor function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>In the clinic (day 1), cognitive function as measured by phonetic/letter fluency and semantic/category naming tasks. These test will be conducted on day 1 before and after active / placebo administration.
The letter fluency test involves the participant giving as many different words as possible beginning with a specific letter, in 60 seconds. The category naming tasks involves the participant giving as many different examples from a given specific category (i.e, animals) in 60 seconds. The higher the score the greater the cognitive ability.</description>

    <measure>Motor performance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Objective measures of motor performance will be conducted using a mobile phone application specifically designed for Parkinson's patients (see Arora et al., 2015. Parkinson's and Related Disorders 21; 650-653) which measures motor performance including: testing of posture; gait; tremor; and reaction times. The testing protocol is for all patients (active and placebo) to perform tests 4 times per day on each of days 2 - 7, 3 days while taking drug/placebo, then 3 days not taking drug/placebo.</description>
