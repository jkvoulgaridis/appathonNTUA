    <textblock>
      Introduction: In situ simulation is a methodology that meets the concept of permanent
      education, since it allows learning from the context of practice and in the work environment
      itself.

      Objective: to compare the development of skills (knowledge and skills) for CPR between groups
      submitted to different in situ simulation periodicities, and to identify the level of
      confidence to participate in a CPR.

      Method: A randomized controlled, non-blind study comparing 3 periodicities of educational
      intervention performed by in situ simulation. This study will include nursing professionals
      from the nephrology department of a university hospital. The sample will be composed of 24
      randomized participants in the groups, using opaque envelopes for each periodicity of
      training and professional category, being subdivided into 3 groups of periodicities with
      intervals of 2, 4 and 8 months. The instruments will evaluate the knowledge and skills in
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the perception of preparation for performing the maneuvers.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, non-blind controlled trial that will compare three periodicities of an educational intervention to be performed through in situ simulation. Group A will be submitted to intervention at 8-month intervals, group B every four months and group C every two months; each group will be divided into two subgroups, totaling six subgroups consisting of one nurse and three nursing technicians.
The research was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre, under approval certificate no. 56516216.9.0000.5345, and of the Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul/PUCRS, under approval certificate no. 56516216.9.3001.5336.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average number of hits in the test of knowledge on cardiopulmonary resuscitation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to eight months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the average/median/standard deviation of hits in the questions of the knowledge test, in each group (A, B, C,). This measurement was performed in two moments:
Pre and post initial intervention: measure performed to evaluate the impact of the initial intervention on the participants' knowledge about the issue.
After simulation intervention: measurement performed to evaluate the impact of the simulation intervention on the maintenance of knowledge, according to the periodicity group of intervention where the participant was allocated.
The measurement was applied to all groups at the same moments. The following tests were used to make comparisons among groups: Wilcoxon Test; Estimate of the size of the Cohen's d effect (paired data); Kruskal-Wallis Test - Dunn's Post Hoc; Cohen's d: Effect size measures by the &quot; Cohen's d&quot; method complemented by the Confidence Interval 95%.</description>

    <description>To compare, among groups exposed to the periodicity of different interventions, the average/median/standard deviation of hits in the accomplishment of a set of skills that matches the CPR procedures. Group A was evaluated when receiving the intervention every eight months, group B every four months, and group C every two months.
The Kruskal-Wallis Test was applied to compare the significance of the average outcomes among groups.</description>

    <description>The simulation scenarios were constructed using the service environment, with real equipment and materials and a low fidelity mannequin. The interventions were not filmed, and the clinical cases elaborated were fictitious, with clear objectives and developed according to the context of the unit. The simulations took place during the working hours of the participants, with the expected duration of the 10 minutes (average) for the scenario, and the average duration of the debriefing was 10 minutes, which took place immediately after the simulation and in the same location of the scenario.</description>
