  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether either or both nutrition supplements (Impact®
      Advanced Recovery or Boost® High Protein) ingested prior to and during concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy decreases toxic side effects of treatment in Stage IIIA-B non-small cell
      lung cancer.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment Related Adverse Events Per Study Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall toxicity from therapy as assessed by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5.0 that directly correlates with toxicity from concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Based on another randomized trial using pretreatment immunonutrition, investigators want to see if this nutritional intervention will likely decrease overall chemoradiotherapy related toxicity. All toxicity and adverse events (CTCAE v.5.0) will be assessed weekly and attributed by the treating radiation oncologist and entered into the clinical trials management database OnCore for later statistical analysis. Differences in toxicity events at the end of the study in participants receiving Impact® and those receiving Boost® will be compared using two-sample t-test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plasma Levels of IL-6 Per Study Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the marked change of IL-6 that directly correlates with toxicity from concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Multiplex immunoassay will be used to determine the plasma levels of IL-6 in pg/ml as a continuous variable. Two-sample t-test for change in IL-6 at the last visit from the baseline will be compared between the two arms. Kolmogorove-Smirnov and Jarque-Bera tests will be performed to test for normality assumption on the primary endpoints prior to t-test analysis. If either test indicates a violation of the normality assumption, investigators will use an appropriate rank-based Wilcoxon rank-sum test instead of t-test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) 9OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) defined as the length of time interval between the date of cancer treatment completion and the date of death due to any cause. Kaplan-Meier curves will be estimated for each arm. Log-rank test will be performed to examine the effect of Impact® vs. Boost® on measures of OS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed using the length of time interval from the cancer treatment completion to the earlier of the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier curves will be estimated for each arm. Log-rank test will be performed to examine the effect of Impact® vs. Boost® on measures of PFS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Treatment Changes or Interruptions Per Study Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment interruptions, chemotherapy dose reduction or hospitalizations secondary to toxicity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Participant Regimen Compliance Per Study Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of participant compliance, with immunonutrition regimen, according to participant diaries. Each participant will complete a compliance diary noting when each carton/bottle of the study agent is drunk and the card will be collected by the Study Coordinator at on treatment clinic visits (OTV) prior to receiving the new batch of study or control supplements.</description>
