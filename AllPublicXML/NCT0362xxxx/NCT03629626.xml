  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery programs are composed of preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative
      strategies combined to form a multi-modal pathway. ERAS requires a multidisciplinary team of
      anesthetists, surgeons and nurses for successful implementation and realization of its
      advantages.The aim of this study is to compare outcomes of conventional perioperative care
      with those of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) perioperative care plan in women
      undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer or suspected gynecologic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a two-arm, randomized, controlled trial. The control arm will consist of
      standard conventional perioperative care. The intervention arm will consist of a
      protocol-driven ERAS program. The investigators believe that this information will be very
      useful because although there is a national interest in creating ERAS protocols for
      gynecology, there currently is very little published on the subject. Investigators
      hypothesize that those patients randomized to the ERAS protocol will have shorter lengths of
      hospital stay and complications, without increasing readmission rates. The investigators
      would like to publish the investigators' results and protocol as a resource for other
      institutions to adopt.

    <description>preoperative management Optimization of relevant medical uncontrolled situations, avoid fasting, avoid bowel preparation, avoid premedications, nutritional assessment, stop smoking, stop alcohol and appropriate counselling
intraoperative management Multimodal prevention of prophylaxis against nausea and vomiting (PONV) (according to preoperative assessment of Apfel Score) with a combination of multiple antiemetic drugs.
postoperative management Postoperative pain control is obtained with opioid sparing strategies, in order to avoid Post Operative Ileus (POI) and PONV.
It is proposed to chew gum three times daily , fluid therapy, early mobilization, early feeding within 2 hours postoperative for at least 15 minutes and eventually to promote a faster bowel function.</description>
