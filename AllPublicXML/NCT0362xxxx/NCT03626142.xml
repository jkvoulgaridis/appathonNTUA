    <textblock>
      This study will monitor the symptoms of patients who have received an intervention on the
      psychiatric inpatient unit at Stanford hospital up to 6 months after they have received the
      intervention. Additionally, the acceptability and feasibility of interventions will be
      assessed using clinician and patient questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once patients have been discharged from hospital they will be contacted weekly for 4 weeks
      and then every 2 weeks until 6 months post-intervention in order to monitor their symptoms.
      Participants will be followed up until the end of the study (6 months after the intervention)
      or until they no longer meet responder criteria (MADRS score&gt;50% of score before they
      received the intervention) During the follow-ups for the first 8 weeks, the following
      assessments will be conducted: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Scale of
      suicidal ideation (SSI) Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD-6) Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS) Pittsburgh insomnia rating scale (PIRS-20) Quick inventory of depressive
      symptomatology (QIDS) Immediate Mood Scaler (IMS-12) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)
      C-SSRS self-report short version

      Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) will be
      collected at one month post-intervention.

      If the participant has a psychiatric diagnosis(/es) other than MDD, questionnaires measuring
      the symptoms associated with the participant's other psychiatric diagnosis/(es) will also be
      administered.

      Follow-up assessments from 10-24 weeks will include:

      MADRS SSI BDI-II C-SSRS self-report short version

      If the participant has a psychiatric diagnosis other than MDD, questionnaires measuring the
      symptoms associated with the participant's other psychiatric diagnosis/(es) will also be
      administered.

      The questionnaires that will be used to assess symptoms associated with primary psychiatric
      diagnoses are:

        -  Bipolar disorder: YMRS

        -  Schizoaffective disorder/ Schizophrenia/Schizophreniform disorder: positive and negative
           symptom scale (PANSS) and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS)

        -  Alcohol use disorder: Alcohol craving questionnaire self-report (ACQ-SR) and obsessive
           compulsive drinking scale (OCDS)

        -  Drug use disorders: Modified versions of the alcohol scales to make these relevant to
           the particular drug of abuse.

        -  Anorexia Nervosa: Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale [YBC-EDS], Eating disorder
           examination questionnaire (EDE-Q)

        -  Bulimia Nervosa: Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale [YBC-EDS], Eating disorder
           examination questionnaire (EDE-Q)

        -  Binge eating disorder: Young-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating
           [YBOCS-BE]

        -  OCD: Obsessive compulsive inventory (OCI) and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale
           (YBOCS)

        -  PTSD: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version [PCL-C]

        -  Generalized anxiety disorder: Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale

        -  Chronic pain: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Chronic Pain

        -  Panic Disorder: Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)

        -  Somatoform Disorders: The Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8)

        -  Impulse Control disorders: Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (This
           questionnaire will be adapted depending on the urges the patient cannot control e.g.
           compulsive picking) BPD: The Borderline Evaluation of Severity Over Time (BEST)

      At all time points, information regarding medication changes and other psychiatric treatments
      will be collected.

    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for first 4 weeks, followed by bi-weekly up until 24 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This is a ten-item clinician rated questionnaire in which the clinician rates each item from 0-6. Scores of 6 indicate more severe depressive symptoms. Total scores are between 0 and 60 with scores &gt;35 indicating severe depression. Response is defined as a 50% reduction or greater in MADRS score compared to baseline. Remission is defined as a MADRS score of &lt;10.</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. BDI-II items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. The maximum total score is 63.
Scores: 0-13= minimal depression, 14-19=mild depression, 20-28=moderate depression, 29-63=severe depression</description>

    <description>Self-report questionnaire identifying the presence or absence of six suicidal thoughts or behaviors in the past month or since the last visit. Each 'yes' answer is scored as 1, meaning the maximum total score is 6.
The scale identifies specific behaviors which may be indicative of a person's intent to complete suicide. An person exhibiting even a single behavior identified by the scale was 8 to 10 times more likely to complete suicide.</description>

HAMD-6 is a 6-item clinical assessment measuring depressive symptoms (scores range from 0-24 with scores of 5 or more indicating clinical levels of depression). The number of weeks in which HAMD-6 scores are lower than 50% of baseline will be calculated to provide a measure of duration of response.</description>
