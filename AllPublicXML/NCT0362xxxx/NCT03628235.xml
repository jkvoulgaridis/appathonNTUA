  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, inherited and progressive neurodegenerative disorder for
      which hallmark symptoms include movement disorders, loss of cognitive faculties and
      psychiatric disturbances. With the progression of the disease, patients require increasing
      level of medical care, caregiver support, and long-term care, which lead to substantial
      burden of illness. Very little data are available on the direct or indirect costs for HD. The
      direct medical costs of HD in the US have been summarized from retrospective commercial and
      Medicaid claims data analysis. The indirect and out-of-pocket costs of HD in the US have not
      been quantified. This study will help to bridge these gaps.

      This study is a single-assessment, cross-sectional online survey administered to Huntington
      disease gene expansion carriers (HDGECs) and companions of HDGECs by HD stage to understand
      the indirect and out-of-pocket costs of Huntington's disease in the US.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The survey collects the following data from each HDGEC and companion:

        1. Participant demographics (for HDGECs and companion)

        2. Informal care received (for HDGECs only)

        3. Out of pocket HD costs (for HDGECs and companion)

        4. Current employment status (for HDGECs and companion)

        5. Non-work and work care giving time that companion spends taking care of HDGEC (for
           companion only)

        6. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire (for HDGECs and
           companion)
