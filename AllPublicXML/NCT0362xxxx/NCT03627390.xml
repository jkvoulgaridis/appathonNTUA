  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the short-term effect and tolerability BP-C1 in
      patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who has undergone guideline-recommended
      chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BP-C1, solution for injections 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients
      with metastatic breast cancer and metastatic pancreatic cancer with palliative intent. Active
      substance of the product, which is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent developed for
      intramuscular administration, is a complex between cis-diammineplatinum(II) derived core and
      an amphiphilic polymer, containing a composition of benzene polycarboxylic acids. The
      amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a product with clear and
      significantly altered and improved properties compared to other platinum analogues, e.g.
      cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

      BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin),
      additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment in
      metastatic cancer patients:

        -  injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions;

        -  can be administered at home by a nurse or a patient;

        -  has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

      BP-C2 is a novel lignin-derived polyphenolic composition with ammonium molybdate. BP-C2,
      given orally, is believed to reduce the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents.

      This is a single center, two arm, open label pilot study (phase IIa). The eligible patients
      will be allocated either to BP-C1 arm or to BP-C1+BP-C2 arm and treated for 32 days with
      further follow-up for 28 days.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment response</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 32 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>In accordance with RECIST v1.1 the treatment response will be classified as 'complete response', 'partial response', 'stable disease' or 'progressive disease':
Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): at least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum might also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions will also be considered progression.
Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a general quality of life questionnaire for cancer patients. The questionnaire contains 30 questions. Three variables will be obtained from the EORTC QLQ-C30: the sum of scores C1 to C5 denoted as &quot;Physical activity problem last week&quot;, the sum of scores C6 to C28 denoted as &quot;Discomfort last week&quot;, and the sum of scores C29 and C30 denoted as &quot;Health and quality of life&quot;</description>
