  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      an unbalanced (2:1) randomized study comparing two methods of traumatic skin closure in an ER
      setting: BandGrip vs suture
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 45 subjects at up to 2 study sites who present to the ER for treatment of a skin
      laceration will be consented and randomized to treatment with suture or BandGrip. Subjects
      will be followed for 30 days post treatment to assess cosmetic quality of wound healing,
      evidence of adverse events related to closure method, and speed and completeness of wound
      closure and removal of closure devices.

          -  Subject presents to emergency room with at least one skin laceration that is assessed
             as requiring a suture closure on the trunk or extremities (excluding hands and feet).

          -  The length of the laceration is less than or equal to 1.5 inches.

             wound, and swimming or soaking in a tub until BandGrip or the sutures are removed.

          -  Subject agrees to return for follow-up evaluations.

          -  Subject (or guardian) is able to comprehend and give informed consent for

          -  Chronic use of oral steroids or immunosuppressants.

          -  Known personal or family history of keloid or hypertrophic scarring.

          -  History of abnormal wound healing.

          -  Burst stellate lacerations due to a crush or hard blow.

          -  Animal or human bite or scratch.

          -  Wound is in the head, hands or feet or in a high skin tension area or across an area
             of increased skin tension on a joint.

          -  Investigator objects to a patient's involvement in the study protocol.

          -  Known allergy to components to BandGrip or suture material.

          -  Known cognitive or psychiatric disorder.

          -  Wound requiring debridement of devitalized or contaminated tissue.

          -  Wound at site of active rash/skin lesion making evaluation difficult.
