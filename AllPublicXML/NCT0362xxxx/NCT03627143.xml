  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute atrial fibrillation and flutter (AAFF) is characterized by rapid heart rates with onset
      less than seven days. It's the most common type of palpitation treated in the Emergency
      Department (ED). Some Canadian ED's will discharge 95% of AAFF patients whereas others admit
      up to 40%. With hospital and ED crowding, discharge is the most optimal, effective and safe
      strategy. Our aim is to improve the care and reduce the length of stay (LOS) of ED AAFF
      patients, while decreasing unnecessary hospitalizations. First, the investigators must
      understand the local barriers. In the previous study, the investigators conducted interviews
      of emergency physicians, cardiologists and AAFF patients. In Project 1b, the investigators
      created the CAEP ED AAFF Guidelines Checklist to assist physicians to manage AAFF more
      efficiently and safely. The Guidelines are comprised of two algorithms and four sets of
      checklists for ED assessment and management. They have been endorsed by CAEP and are
      published in CJEM.

      The investigators are now planning Project 2 in which the investigators will conduct a
      cluster [group] randomized trial at 11 Canadian EDs and enroll 1,300 patients over thirteen
      months. The investigators are not randomizing individual patients or doctors; instead the
      investigators are randomizing the start date of individual hospitals. Our goal is to
      introduce the new Guidelines into these hospitals to improve the care of AAFF patients. The
      investigators hope to improve AAFF management, leading to a significant decrease in hospital
      admissions and ED LOS. Central to our plans will be engagement of our two patient partners.
      Our behaviorally optimized intervention will be developed using state-of-the-art
      implementation science approaches informed by the results of Project 1a. The investigators
      will also undertake within-project and end-of-project knowledge translation and
      implementation (KTI) strategies to facilitate scale up and roll out of our program to ED
      departments in small, medium, and large hospitals across Canada (future Project 3).
      Ultimately the investigators expect to improve ED practices and decrease AAFF admissions and
      LOS, without increasing visits.
