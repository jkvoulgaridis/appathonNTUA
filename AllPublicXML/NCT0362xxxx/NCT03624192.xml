      To evaluate whether the time to complete closure is superior for RECELL-treated
      split-thickness donor sites, compared with Control (standardized dressings only). The mean
      time for donor site healing will be compared between treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged 1 through 16 years (inclusive) with a skin defect for
             which autografting is indicated.

          2. The area of total injury or planned defect (excluding donor sites) is 5% to 25% Total
             Body Surface Area (TBSA), inclusive.

          3. Two discrete donor sites of similar size (± 25%) can be created in a similar
             non-articulating location (excluding the scalp) with each donor site representing a
             minimum of 1% TBSA.

          4. The patient and family member/parent/guardian are able to complete all follow-up
             evaluations required by the study protocol.

          5. In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient and/or parent/guardian must be able
             to:

               1. Understand the full nature and purpose of the study, including possible risks and
                  adverse events, and

          6. The patient and/or parent/guardian agrees to abstain from any other treatment of the
             wound(s) for the duration of the study unless medically necessary and comply with all
             compulsory study procedures.

          7. The patient and/or parent/guardian agrees to abstain from enrollment in any other
             interventional clinical trial for the duration of the study.

          8. The patient and/or parent/guardian can read and understand instructions and give
             informed, voluntary, written consent.

          9. Life expectancy greater than 52 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior autograft harvest at planned study donor sites.

          2. Patients with sepsis or hemodynamic instability.

          3. The patient has an infection under active management or other dermatologic condition
             at the planned donor sites or treatment areas.

          4. Patient (of reasonable age) or parent/guardian is unable to follow the protocol
             requirements.

          5. The patient has other concurrent conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator
             may compromise patient safety or study objectives.

          6. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or compound sodium lactate for
             irrigation.

          7. In post-pubescent girls, pregnant or breast-feeding (pregnancy test should be
             performed in accordance with local institutional requirements).

          8. Enrollment in a concurrent study in which the study treatment may confound the
             endpoints of this study.
