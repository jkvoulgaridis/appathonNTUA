      Objective

        1. To determine pharmacokinetic (PK) DDI between GAHT and ARVs used as PrEP and ART among
           TGW

        2. To evaluate ARV adherence among TGW

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GAHT will be initiated on week 0. ARVs, either PrEP or ART, will be initiated on week 3. GAHT
      will then be withheld on week 5, and restart at week 8.

      GAHT: Oral estradiol valerate 2 mg once daily and cyproterone acetate 25 mg once daily, which
      are the treatment of choice for GAHT in the TRC-ARC's Tangerine Community Health Center, will
      be provided to all participants.

      PrEP and ART regimen: Generic fixed-dose combination of TDF 300 mg and FTC 200 mg will be
      used for PrEP and a generic fixed-dose combination of TDF 300 mg, FTC 200 mg and efavirenz
      600 mg will be used for ART as recommended in the 2017 Thailand National Guidelines on
      HIV/AIDS Treatment and Prevention.
