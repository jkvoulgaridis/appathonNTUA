    <textblock>
      Pain is a frequent occurrence during the early life of premature newborns. Studies on the
      short term effects of pain, and potential for long-term ones, have shown that pain affects
      various physiological and behaviorial parameters. Sucrose during a painful procedure reduce
      behaviorial and cardiac manifestations in preterm infant, but a recent study casts doubt on
      its efficacy. Analgesic treatments are available, but a large number of experimental studies
      in animals ended up with questioning the safety of their use in neonates, particularly in
      premature ones. Soothing and analgesic methods have been developed such nonnutritive
      suckling, sucrose, skin to skin contact, and breastfeeding. Therefore, it is important to
      explore other methods of analgesia. Recently, the role of olfaction as a soothing tool in
      full term newborns was examined in several studies. The olfactory system is more mature at
      birth than the others senses. The neonates reacted with significant facial and respiratory
      changes to low concentration of olfactory stimuli during the various behaviorial states. The
      analysis of olfacto-facial configurations revealed that behaviorial markers of disgust
      discriminated between some odors judged as pleasant and unpleasant by adults rather.

      Objective The study was designed to assess the analgesic effect of vanilla odor on preterm
      neonates. The primary outcome was the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score. The
      secondary outcomes were: the French scale Faceless Acute Neonatal pain Scale (FANS), salivary
      cortisol.

      Study design This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind and monocentric
      trial. It is conducted in a level III maternity unit at the North Hospital in Marseille. The
      infant will feed without their own mother's breast milk, clinically stable, born between 30
      and 36 weeks and 6 days gestational age, and of less than 10 days postnatal age. In both
      groups, the painful stimulus is a venipuncture for blood collection. In the experimental
      group, called &quot;vanilla odor&quot; group, the venipuncture will be performed on the neonate in the
      presence of a diffuser spreading the vanilla odor and ingestion of water. In the control
      group, the venipuncture will be performed with an odorless diffuser and ingestion of sucrose.
      Both group have non nutritive sucking. The diffuser will place under a Hood with an air-flow
      of 7 l/min. It will manually switch on 3 minutes before the venipuncture and switch off 3
      minutes later. The type and quantity of vanillin to be used were determined during a
      pre-testing phase. Assessment Scale shows significant improvement in the neonates, with good
      interobserver agreement.

      Attempt results A current randomized study compare effects of breast milk and vanilla odors,
      on premature neonate's pain during and after venipuncture. Our previous study has shown that
      maternal breast milk odor in preterm neonates reduces PIPP scores during a venipuncture and
      markedly reduces crying after this procedure. Therefore, from a clinical perspective, the
      odor of mother's own breast milk has an analgesic effect on the premature neonate. Olfactory
      stimulation using maternal breast milk odor could have other clinical implications in
      neonatal medicine in addition to pain prevention, as does olfactory stimulation with a
      pleasant vanilla-based odor. It could be integrated into developmental care of premature
      neonates.
