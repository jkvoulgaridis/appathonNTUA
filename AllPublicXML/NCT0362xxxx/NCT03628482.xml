  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of chronic pain, disability, and decreased quality of
      life. Lesioning of genicular nerves by continuous radiofrequency treatment proved to be
      effective in relieving pain and disability caused by osteoarthritis of the knee. In contrast
      to continuous radiofrequency lesioning, pulsed radiofrequency treatment offers pain control
      with no or only minimal histological lesions. As a non-destructive alternative to continuous
      radiofrequency ablation, pulsed radiofrequency treatment may have inherent appeal because it
      may mitigate concerns regarding complications associated with the ablation of nerves.
      However, studies comparing the ability of the continuous and the pulsed modalities of
      radiofrequency treatment to relieve pain and incapacity due to osteoarthritis of the knee are
      lacking. Therefore, it was the aim of the investigators of current study to compare efficacy
      of continuous and pulsed radiofrequency treatments of genicular nerves to alleviate pain and
      disability in patients with advanced osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Following approval of the Regional Research Ethics Committee written informed consent was
      obtained from all patients. Current randomized controlled trial included patients with grade
      3-4 gonarthritis suffering from intractable knee pain, scoring ≥5 on the Visual Analog Scale
      (VAS) during &gt;6 months. Therapy was based on ultrasound guided radiofrequency treatment of
      the superior medial, superior lateral and inferior medial genicular nerves. VAS and Western
      Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthrosis (WOMAC) scores were assessed before therapy
      and at 1, 6 and 12 months following intervention. Eligible patients were randomized in two
      treatment groups according to the modality of radiofrequency current to which targeted
      genicular nerves had to be exposed, i.e, the pulsed and the continuous radiofrequency groups.
      Both two way repeated measures analysis of variance and generalized estimating equations were
      used to determine whether the VAS and WOMAC scores obtained with either the continuous or the
      pulsed radiofrequency modalities at each of the 4 times of assessment, i.e. at pre-treatment
      control and at 1, 6 and 12 months after the intervention, were different.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients suffered from chronic pain (during&gt;6months) of moderate to severe
             intensity (scoring ≥5 on a 0- to 10-point continuous visual analog scale [VAS] ranging
             from none [0] to an extreme amount of pain [10]) due to advanced osteoarthritis of the
             knee (grades 3-4 according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. The pain proved to
             be resistant to conservative treatments including physiotherapy, oral analgesics, and
             intraarticular injection with hyaluronic acids or steroids. In this study, genicular
             nerve ablation was applied as an alternative analgesic approach for those who refused
             knee arthroplasty; were judged by their surgeons as being inappropriate for surgical
             treatment, for example, because of cardiovascular or other comorbidities; or who had
             to be managed for persistent pain and stiffness after total knee arthroplasty.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria included knee-pain related disorders that might benefit from
             other interventions, for example, patellofemoral disorders, meniscal injuries,
             ligamentous laxity, and so on, acute knee pain associated with radicular neuropathy or
             intermittent claudication, connective tissue diseases, serious neurologic or
             psychiatric disorders, mental deterioration impeding adequate communication or
             collaboration, anticoagulant medications, pacemakers, prior electroacupuncture
             treatment, and injection with steroids or hyaluronic acids during the previous 6
             months.
