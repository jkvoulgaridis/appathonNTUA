  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WHO defines sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social
      well-being, related to sexuality, not only the absence of illness, dysfunction or disability.
      To acquire and maintain adequate sexual health, the sexual rights of all people must be
      respected, protected and fully exercised.

      People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) present difficulties in the development of social
      interaction skills, among other problems that directly affect their sexual health. The
      consolidated prejudices and social myths related to the sexual affectivity of people with
      ASD, and in general to people with intellectual diversity, have meant that they do not pay
      any attention to the sexual health of this group in the assessment of their needs.

      Main objectives: to understand the experience lived by young people with ASD and their
      caregivers in relation to the affective needs during adolescence and to know the cognitive
      and behavioral expression of the affective dimension of adolescents with ASD.

      Mixed simultaneous design: qualitative based on the phenomenological paradigm, in order to
      establish the perceived needs of young adults with ASD, their families and the professionals
      who attend them, with the realization of focus groups and in-depth interviews. The second
      quantitative part will be developed in adolescents (12-18 years) and their families,
      evaluating the habitual behaviors and difficulties of Interaction in the affective
      expression, by means of questionnaires and self-administered scales. It will be necessary to
      sign the Informed Consent by all the participants, with the specific acceptance of the
      project by the CEIC of the investigator's center.

    <description>The measure utilized was developed specifically for this research - the Sexual Behaviour Scale (SBS; see Appendix) - and was based upon previous studies and the issues these studies identified (cf. Haracopos and Pedersen, 1992; Ruble and Dalrymple, 1993). The SBS examined parents' reports of their child's: (1) social behaviour; (2) privacy awareness; (3) sex education; and (4) sexual behaviour; as well as (5) parental concerns about outcomes for their child.</description>
