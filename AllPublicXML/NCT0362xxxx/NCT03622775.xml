  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab works in treating participants with multiple
      myeloma that has come back after stem cell transplant. Immunotherapy with daratumumab, may
      induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the complete remission rate (CRR) by the International Myeloma Working Group
      (IMWG) criteria within 9 months post salvage auto-transplant with daratumumab maintenance
      therapy starting approximately 3 months post salvage auto-transplant in patients with
      relapsed myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To discover the impact of daratumumab on graft function and immune reconstitution.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 60-120 days after transplant, participants receive daratumumab intravenously (IV)
      over 4-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of courses 1 and 2 and days 1 and 15 of courses 3-6,
      then on day 1 of subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days for 2 years in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then
      every 4-12 weeks thereafter.

    <description>The student t-test/Wilcoxon rank test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)/Kruskal-Wallis test, or chi-squared test/Fisher's exact test will be used to test associations between the response and the prognostic factors.

    <description>Will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method (including the median, 95% confidence interval, and survival curve). The proportion of patients alive and without disease progression at 6 months of daratumumab maintenance therapy will be summarized. The estimate will be accompanied by a two-sided exact 95% binomial confidence interval. In addition, a Cox regression analysis may be performed if demographic and clinical factors potentially affecting PFS are identified.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have had relapsed disease prior to transplant, or undergone previous
             autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), followed by relapse and at least a partial
             response to salvage therapy

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0 to 2

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 50,000/mm^3 (within 5 days before the first dose of the study drug)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1000/ mm^3 (no growth factors within 5 days) (within 5
             days before the first dose of the study drug)
