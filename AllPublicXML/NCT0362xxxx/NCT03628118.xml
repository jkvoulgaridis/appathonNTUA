  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the hidden blood loss in patients who
      underwent open radical hysterectomy and identity its risk factors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The electronic medical data of 100 patients who undergo open radial hysterectomy in the
      following year to treat cervical cancer will be analyzed retrospectively in this study. The
      amount of hidden blood loss will be calculated according to Gross's formula. And multiple
      linear regression analysis will be employed to identify its risk factors.

        The planned sample size was based on data from a previous study, in which the standard
        deviation was 5. We assumed an one-tailed Î± error of 0.05 and a sampling error of 1.0. we
        propose to enroll 105 participants and allow for a dropout rate of 10% for an effective
        sample size of 100.
