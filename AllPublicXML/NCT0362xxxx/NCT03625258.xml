  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection constitutes a major public health threat worldwide. A total
      of 92 patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B infection were recruited at Amiens
      University Hospital. The diagnostic workup included a physical examination.In conclusion, the
      study results confirmed that the HBV DNA level is associated with liver fibrosis status and
      that HBV viral load is strongly correlated with BCP and PC mutations, and it demonstrated
      that the impaired base pairing 1858-1896 mutations at the base of the bulge in the e
      encapsidation signal is independently associated with high serum HBV DNA levels.

      The progression of liver disease in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is fostered by active
      virus replication. Mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) regions of the
      HBV genome are known to have an impact on viral replication. The aim of the present study was
      to assess the correlation of mutation profiles in the BCP and PC regions with the viral load
      in HBeAgnegative chronically infected patients. The HBV genotype, BCP/PC mutations, serum HBV
      DNA levels, and associated serological markers were analyzed in 92 HBeAgnegative chronically
      infected patients.

    <description>The main objective of the study is toevaluate a genotype of HBV for which the HBV viral load is a function of pre-core mutations in chronically infected patients.The HBV markers (including HBsAg, HBeAg and anti- HBe) were measured with chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays running on an Architect system.</description>

        the study will be carried out from the blood samples following consultations
        Hepatogastroenterology in the clinical follow-up of patients chronically infected with HBV.
        Blood samples are stored in the Virology laboratory as part of legislation on the
        conservation of samples during Virology analyzes.
