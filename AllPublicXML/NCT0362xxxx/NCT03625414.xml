  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Present study intended to compare diseased and healthy sites in chronic and aggressive
      periodontitis with healthy individuals. The investigators suggest that even unaffected
      healthy sites of both chronic and aggressive periodontitis patients exhibit subclinical
      inflammation and tissue destruction with decreased fibroblast cell counts and increased
      inflammatory cell counts. Investigators also suggest that a possible mechanism which might
      play a role in the disease progression might occur via a disbalance between matrix
      metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, and increased hypoxia in diseased sites.

    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease disrupts soft tissue metabolism in the gingiva through a decrease in the
      production of collagen, the quality, and quantity of the connective tissue. The etiology and
      pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis are mostly revealed however, there are many dark points
      in the etiopathogenesis of aggressive periodontitis. The existence of periodontal destruction
      at even one tooth in the mouth increases the risk of further periodontal destruction.
      However, the incidence of progression of the disease to the unaffected teeth was not
      demonstrated. Yet, the progression of the disease from diseased sites to healthy sites is
      likely to occur but no evidence is present comparing healthy and diseased sites of chronic
      and aggressive periodontitis. Present study aimed to evaluate the histological changes in
      both diseased and healthy sites in both localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) and chronic
      periodontitis (CP) patients by determining fibroblast and inflammatory cell counts in
      histologic slides and immunohistochemical staining of enzymes and hypoxia markers in order to
      better understand the dimensions of this demolition in periodontal disease.

        Healthy individuals, chronic periodontitis patients, and localized aggressive periodontitis
        patients older than 30 years old and younger than 45 years old were enrolled. The age was
        specifically chosen because aging changes periodontal and gingival tissues independently of
        other variables. Any possible factor which might alter connective tissue metabolism were
        excluded.
