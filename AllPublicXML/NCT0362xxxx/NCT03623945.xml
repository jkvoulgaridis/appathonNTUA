    <description>The data from Phase I will be tested and validated with newly diagnosed BCa patient samples from Cohort A, and age-matched healthy controls taken from Cohort D, and a risk score will be developed based on a composite of autoantibodies for breast cancer diagnosis. A Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) Regression will be used to analyze a case-cohort study design to validate the risk score by identifying breast cancer cases from those cases in Cohorts B, C and D.</description>

    <description>Patients who have recently had an abnormal mammogram, followed by a breast biopsy and an initial diagnosis of Stage I, II, III or IV invasive breast cancer, will be invited to participate. Stage I, II and III participants will be further categorized into high-risk and low-risk. For the purposes of this study, participants with at least one of the following will be considered high-risk; any triple negative cancer, any grade III cancer, lymph node involvement, tumor greater than 2cm, or any patient receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.</description>
