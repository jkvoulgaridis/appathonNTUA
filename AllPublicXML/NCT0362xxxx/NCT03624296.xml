    <textblock>
      The main aim of the present study is to assess the prevalence, the topography and the
      clinical counterpart of cortical lesions in patient included early after the first clinical
      episode of multiple sclerosis. A second aim is to assess the direct contribution of cortical
      lesions - independent of WM injury - on the diffuse grey matter damage.

      Thirty MS patients will be included in the six months after the first clinical episode of
      multiple sclerosis for a monocentric transversal MRI study at 7T to assess cortical MS
      injury. Clinical (EDSS) and neuropsychological assessments will be performed in the
      population the same day of a multi-parametric MRI. MRI protocol is designed to increase the
      detection rate of CL using multiple contrasts at high isotropic resolution (600µm3) on a
      whole brain exploration. Thus, MRI acquisition will include MP2RAGE, T2*, FLAIR and DIR as
      previously published but also recent MRI technique like FLAWS, focusing on the grey matter by
      attenuating the white matter and CSF signal. Finally, QSM sequences will be performed. QSM
      measures tissue magnetic susceptibility mostly influenced by iron, myelin and calcium content
      in the brain. Due to physical properties of the technique (bipolarity), we suppose that high
      resolution QSM will be more sensitive that previous used sequences to depict cortical
      lesions. Using this multi-contrast approach with relevant MRI sequence and with a high
      resolution whole brain exploration might improve the detection of CL in early MS.

      Furthermore, MRI protocol allow us to estimate neuronal loss (T1 relaxation time), myelin and
      iron content (QSM and T2* relaxation time) within and outside cortical lesions in GM.

      The present study is an opportunity to assess cortical pathology in MS from the onset of the
      disease, allowing to a better understanding of its origins and its impact and disease
      severity. This study is a preliminary requirement to longitudinal studies to precisely depict
      the kinetic of cortical lesion accumulation and the links with disease aggravation.
