  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The post-operative pain generated by prosthetic knee replacement surgery is known to be
      moderate to severe during two or three days following surgery.

      The most popular analgesic technique after prosthetic knee replacement surgery remains the
      femoral block (FB), whether in single injection or continuous infusion. In major knee
      surgery, FBs provide better analgesia compared to systemic morphine and FBs provide the same
      analgesia that obtained with epidural analgesia but with fewer associated adverse effects.

      Although FBs provide excellent post-operative analgesia after total knee prosthesis, they
      also provide a significant quadricepsia weakness that increases the risk of severe falls and
      complications, and hinders the rapid rehabilitation process. For these reasons, alternative
      analgesic techniques have emerged in recent years.

      To avoid the quadricipital motor block generated by FBs, some authors proposed the
      administration of local anesthetics in the adductor channel, also known as the Hunter
      channel, in order to produce a pure sensory block. With the development of ultrasound, the
      adductor channel is easily visualized in the middle of the thigh. This allows the adductor
      channel block (ACB) to be realized with a high success rate. ACB appears to decrease
      postoperative pain and morphine consumption. It also significantly improves the ability of
      patients to walk around after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) surgery.

      With the same goal of quadricipital savings, the use of the analgesic technique by
      periarticular infiltration of local anesthetics (ILA) has spread in recent years, due to the
      fact that an analgesic technique of simple realization and without apparent danger, and this
      despite limited evidence of its effectiveness.

      The Croix-Rousse Hospital is a university hospital in Lyon with a highly developed orthopedic
      surgery center, producing approximately 550 TKA per year. During the year 2016, approximately
      half were benefited from post-operative analgesia management by ACB, and the other half by
      the implementation of the ILA.

      To date few studies have been interested in comparing these two analgesic techniques in knee
      prosthesis surgery.

    <description>The block at the adductor channel will be realized under echo guidance, before the spinal anesthesia, by puncture at the upper 1/3 of the thigh. It will be used echogenic needle adapted to the morphotype of each patient, of varying length from 50mm to 100mm. A single injection of 20mL of ROPIVACAINE 2mg / ml, the efficacy of which should be checked before spinal anesthesia is performed by a cold test.
Knee analgesia will be supplemented by per-operative infiltration of 50mL of ROPIVACAINE 2mg / ml at the posterior capsule, once the surfaces joints prepared to accommodate the prosthesis and by two placebo infiltrations of 50mL each of physiological saline in the medial and lateral ligaments and in the edges of the incision.</description>

    <description>A placebo injection to the adductor channel of 20 mL of physiological serum will be performed in the pre-induction room before surgery, according to the same procedures as the patients of the ACB group.
During the surgical procedure, patients in the ILA group will receive a total dose of 300mg of ROPIVACAINE 2mg / ml in the form of 3 periarticular injections. The first injection of 50mL of ROPIVACAINE 2mg / ml will be made once the articular surfaces are prepared to receive the prosthesis, at the level of the posterior capsule. The second injection of 50mL of ROPIVACAINE 2mg / ml will be performed once the total knee prosthesis is installed, in the medial and lateral ligaments. Finally, the last injection will also include 50mL of ROPIVACAINE 2mg / ml and will be made in the edges of the incision at the time of closure.</description>
