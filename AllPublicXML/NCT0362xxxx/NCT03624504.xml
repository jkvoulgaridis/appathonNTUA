      The China Micra Transcatheter Pacing Study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm human
      clinical trial utilizing Objective Performance Criterion (OPC) to confirm the safety and
      efficacy profile of the Micra system for regulatory approval in China.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study sites will be in China. Subjects successfully implanted with the Micra system in
      all sites will be followed at implant/pre-discharge, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months, and at
      6-month intervals thereafter (if applicable) through study closure. The overall follow-up
      period of the study will end when the last enrolled patient has 6 months of follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have a Class I or II indication for implantation of a single chamber
             ventricular pacemaker according to ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 guidelines and China guideline.

          2. Subjects who are willing to participate in study through consent and willing to
             undergo study specific required procedures with expectancy of geographically stable
             for follow up duration.

          3. Subjects who are at least 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has an existing or prior pacemaker, ICD or CRT device implant.

          2. Subject has unstable angina pectoris or has had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
             in the 30 days prior to eligibility assessment.

          3. Subjects with current implantation of neurostimulator or any other chronically
             implanted device which uses current in the body. Note that a temporary pacing wire is
             allowed.

          4. Subjects with a mechanical tricuspid valve, implanted vena cava filter, or left
             ventricular assist device (LVAD).

          5. Subjects who are morbidly obese and physician believes telemetry communication of â‰¤5
             inches (12.5 cm) could not be obtained with programmer head.

          6. Subjects whose femoral venous anatomy is unable to accommodate a 23 French introducer
             sheath or implant on the right side of the heart (for example, due to obstructions or
             severe tortuosity) in the opinion of the implanter.

          7. Subjects who are considered as unable to tolerate an urgent sternotomy.

          8. Subjects with a known intolerance to Nickel-Titanium (Nitinol) Alloy.

          9. Subjects for whom a single dose of 1.0mg dexamethasone acetate may be contraindicated.

         10. Subjects with a life expectancy of less than 12-months.

         11. Subjects who are currently enrolled or planning to participate in a potentially
             confounding drug or device trial during the course of this study. Co-enrollment in
             concurrent trials is only allowed when document pre-approval is obtained from the
             Medtronic study manager.

         12. Pregnant women or breastfeeding women, or women of child bearing potential and who are
             not on a reliable form of birth regulation method or abstinence.

         13. Subjects with exclusion criteria required by local law (age or other).

         14. Subjects with medical condition which precludes patient from participation in the
             opinion of the Investigator.
