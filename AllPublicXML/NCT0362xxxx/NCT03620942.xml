  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal hypotension during spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery may bring various
      adverse effects. It is therefore important to closely monitor hypotension during spinal
      anaesthesia, however current technology does not allow the blood pressure monitoring to
      respond in timely manner should there be any occurrence of hypotension. The investigators
      developed an advanced double-intravenous vasopressor automated system (ADIVA) so as to tackle
      this issue via novel algorithm to control blood pressure more rigorously with more stable
      haemodynamic profiles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of maternal hypotension during spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery is
      reported to be as high as 70-90%. The potential adverse effects resulting from maternal
      hypotension are nausea, vomiting, cardiac dysfunction, foetal acidosis and hypoxia.

      Hypotension during spinal anaesthesia is currently detected using an intermittent blood
      pressure (BP) monitor cycling and reactive administration of vasopressors upon detection. The
      use of conventional non-invasive BP monitoring is limited by the time required to inflate and
      to deflate the cuffs commonly applied to the arm, which subsequently leads to a failure to
      react in a timely manner to BP changes when they occur.

      The DIVA system (double-intravenous vasopressor automated system) previously developed helped
      tackle the limitations associated with the conventional management of hypotension in
      Caesarean sections under spinal anaesthesia. In a recent randomized controlled trial the DIVA
      system achieved less incidence of maternal hypotension compared to conventional management,
      however the side effects in mother and baby were still not fully eliminated.

      In this proposed study a new algorithm for an advanced DIVA (ADIVA) system will be developed
      to control BP more rigorously by detecting BP with more stable haemodynamic profiles and
      thereby improve patient outcomes. The clinical trial will investigate the use of ADIVA in
      comparison to the existing DIVA system in patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for
      Caesarean section. Demographic data, vital signs, amount of vasopressors, pain data, neonatal
      and maternal outcomes will be collected.
