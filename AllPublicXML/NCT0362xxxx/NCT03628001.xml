    <textblock>
      Background and rationale Placement of biliary self expanding metal stent (SEMS) is indicated
      when malignant common bile duct obstruction is encountered.

      Currently, there is still controversy regarding the use of endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST)
      before the placement of biliary stents. EST may facilitate insertion of self expandable metal
      stent (SEMS) and also help avert the development of pancreatitis from stent-related occlusion
      of the pancreatic duct. On the other hand, ES is also independently associated with
      pancreatitis, bleeding, and perforation.

      Latest European guidelines indicate that EST is not necessary for inserting single plastic or
      metal biliary stents, nevertheless a more recent meta analysis showed that ES may decrease
      the rate of PEP.

      Population and patient selection criteria All the patient referred for endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to malignant bile duct obstruction.

      Study design and study duration Prospective randomized, multicenter study. 18 months.

      Description of study treatment/product/intervention All the patients will be randomly
      assigned to undergo ERCP with (Group A) or without (Group B) ES before biliary SEMS
      placement.

      All the endoscopic procedures will be performed by experienced endoscopist in the endoscopy
      suite.

      All the procedure will be conducted under deep sedation. SEMS placed will be fully covered.

      Objectives To assess the need for EST before SEMS placement in patients with malignant bile
      duct obstruction.

      To evaluate immediate (periprocedural) and delayed (30 days) post ERCP complications
      including pancreatitis, SEMS migration, bleeding and perforation.

      Statistical methods, data analysis A sample size analysis to detect superiority at 5%
      significance level and a power of 80% showed that 500 patients had to be enrolled in each
      group.

      Continuous variables such age will be reported in terms of their mean and range, and t-test
      will be done to test their main difference.

      X square test or Fisher exact test will be carried out for statistical analysis to compare
      rates of total complications between the two groups and rates of pancreatitis, bleeding,
      stent migration and perforation.

      Wilcoxon Mann-Withney test will be used for comparison of means between 2 continuous
      variables. A single-tailed P value of less than 0,05 is considered significant.
