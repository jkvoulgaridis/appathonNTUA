    <measure>Change from baseline EQ-5D score at every visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a tool developed for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment, and is widely used in the health care sector. Scores range from -1, 'health worse than death' to 1, 'perfect health'. EQ-5D-5L has 5 dimensions covering current health status and functionality: mobility (M), self care (SC), usual activities (UA), pain/discomfort (PD), and anxiety/depression (AD), to be rated out of 5 grades (1, no problem; 2, slight problem; 3, some/moderate problem; 4, severe problem; 5, extreme problem).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Numeric rating scale score at every visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>In pain measurement using NRS, patients are asked to rate their pain by selecting a number from 0 to 10 that best represents their pain severity between the anchors of 0 which indicates 'no pain', and 10 which indicates 'worst pain possible'.</description>

    <measure>Difference between the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) at each timepoint and baseline, respectively</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-VAS uses a vertical 10cm line labeled at each end with scale anchors. EQ-VAS is used to indicate the patient's health state and patients are asked to mark a point that represents their health state between the anchors of 'worst health state' and 'best health state imaginable'. Scores are recorded in millimeters with a total range of 0-100 millimeters.</description>
