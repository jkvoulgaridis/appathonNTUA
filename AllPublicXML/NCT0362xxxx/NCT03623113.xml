  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate two different dietitian-led self-management approaches in
      carbohydrate counting compared to routine dietary care (control) on glycaemic control in
      adult patients with type 1 diabetes:

        1. The basic carbohydrate counting concept aims at improving carbohydrate counting accuracy
           and day-to-day consistency of carbohydrate intake (the BCC intervention)

        2. The advanced carbohydrate counting concept aims at improving prandial insulin dose
           accuracy using an automated bolus calculator (the ABC-ACC intervention)

      The main hypothesis is that structured training and education in either the BCC concept or
      the ABC-ACC concept will reduce HbA1c or the average glucose variability more than routine
      dietary education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design. A total of
      231 patients will be enrolled in the trial. Participants will be randomized to one of three
      arms: 1) Basic carbohydrate counting (BCC), 2) Advanced carbohydrate counting with an
      automated bolus calculator (ABC-ACC), or 3) Standard dietary care.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the six months effects of education in the BCC concept
      and the ABC-ACC concept compared to standard dietary care on glycaemic control as assessed by
      HbA1c or MAGE (mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions).
