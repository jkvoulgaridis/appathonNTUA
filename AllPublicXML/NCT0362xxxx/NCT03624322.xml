  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of INP105, which is an investigational drug-device combination product
      comprised of the drug component OLZ administered by a Precision Olfactory Delivery (POD®)
      nasal spray device (I231 POD® Device). The proposed indication for INP105 is the treatment of
      acute agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, ascending-dose, 2-way, 2-
      period, incomplete block, crossover, Phase 1 trial to compare the safety, tolerability, PK
      and PD of 3 single doses of INP105 with the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of 1 dose of
      Zyprexa IM (5 mg) and 1 dose of oral Zyprexa Zydis (10 mg). Randomization for Periods 1 and 2
      will occur for each subject on Day 1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male (N=at least 9) and female (N=at least 9) 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive)

             clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination at Screening or before
             first dose of IP.

          2. Subjects must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2 inclusive.

          3. Negative urine drug screen/alcohol breath test at Screening and Day -1. Repeat tests
             may be performed if false positive results are suspected.

          4. Subjects must have the ability and willingness to attend the necessary visits at the
             study centre.

          5. Written informed consent signed prior to entry into the study.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential, and male subjects and their partners, must
             agree to use adequate contraception, defined as complete abstinence, documented
             evidence of surgical sterilization or condom plus approved contraceptive method

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to Zyprexa IM, Zyprexa Zydis or any of the ingredients in them
             or in INP105 or the placebo.

          2. Recently (within 3 months) or currently taking Zyprexa (any formulation).

          3. Subjects taking medications known to inhibit or induce CYP1A2 at any time during the
             study period, and any subjects taking prescription medications, over the counter
             medications or supplements that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may impact the
             subject's response to INP105 or impact the subject's participation in the study. Oral
             contraceptives are permitted.

          4. Subjects with medical history of hypotension or currently taking anti-hypertensives at
             Screening or throughout the study.

          5. Current or recent smokers (&lt;3 months since quitting); inadvertent one-off smokers and
             social smokers will also be excluded.

          6. Females who are pregnant or lactating.

          7. Subjects with any underlying physical or psychological medical condition that, in the

             the study.

          8. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results.

          9. History or presence of alcohol or drug abuse within the 2 years prior to the first IP
             administration.

         10. Blood donation or significant blood loss within 60 days prior to the first IP
             administration.

         12. Administration of IP in another trial within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first IP administration.

         13. Significant surgery within the past 3 months prior to the first IP administration
             determined by the Investigator to be clinically relevant.

         14. Failure to satisfy the Investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason.

         15. Acute illness within 30 days prior to Day 1. Subjects with minor viral illnesses (for
             example, upper respiratory tract infection) within 30 days prior to Day 1 may be
             randomized if all symptoms are resolved by admission and at the discretion of the
             Investigator.

         16. Any nasal congestion, deviated septum, or physical blockage in either nostril.
