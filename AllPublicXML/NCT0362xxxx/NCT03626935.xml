      This study applies 3D-printed customized guide plate in assisting the accurate drilling of
      Kirschner wire in ankle arthrodesis. This technique can shorten the operation time, reduce
      the intra-operative radiation, and do not affect the surgical outcome.

    <textblock>
      Ankle arthrodesis is the standard procedure for treating end-stage joint diseases. In order
      to improve the surgical outcome and reduce the operation time, 3D-printed customized guide
      plates are fabricated using patients' ankle DICM data of ankle via CT examinations. Two 2mm
      Kirschner wires are drilled with the help of the guides; the C-arm fluoroscopy is used to
      confirm the position of the wires before applying the cannulated screws for effective
      fixation.

      In the past when there were no customized guides, the surgeons would drill the Kirschner wire
      according to his/her previous experience and then use C-arm fluoroscopy to confirm whether
      the position of the wire is satisfactory; if not, repeated procedure will be performed. This
      would lead to an increase in the duration of surgery and intra-operative radiation, which is
      detrimental to both the surgeon and the patient. This problem is well solved by applying the
      3D-printed customized guides.

      The application procedure for the customized guide plates: the model of the ankle joint is
      established according to the patient's CT scan data to prepare the customized guide plate,
      then sterilize them for future use. Apply routine surgical treatment to the ankle joint
      surface, reset the fusion joint to the functional position, and drill two 2mm Kirschner wires
      with the guidance of the guide plate. If the locations of the fusion joint and the Kirschner
      wires are satisfactory under the C-arm fluoroscopy, drill the cannulated screws for final
      fixation.
