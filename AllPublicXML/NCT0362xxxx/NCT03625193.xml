      1. Do different arm placements (including arms on armrests/devices, arms on knees, arms
           free, and arm crossed over chest) influence outcomes of sit-to-stand test (STST) in
           ambulatory individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI)?

        2. What are the factors associated with ability to perform STST in ambulatory individuals
           with SCI?

        3. Are the single-time sit-to-stand test (STSST) and five-time sit-to-stand test (FTSST)
           reliable, valid and responsive to determine functional alteration in ambulatory
           individuals with SCI?

      -  To cross-sectionally compare characteristics (duration and amount of lower limb loading)
           of STS movements among 4 arm placement conditions (arms on armrests/devices, arms on
           knees, arms free, and arm crossed over chest) in ambulatory patients with SCI.

        -  To investigate reliability (inter-rater, intra-rater, and test-retest), standard error
           of measurement and minimal detectable changes of the STSST and FTSST in ambulatory
           patients with SCI.

        -  To investigate concurrent validity and factors associated with ability of the STSST and
           FTSST in ambulatory patients with SCI.

        -  To investigate the ability of the STSST and FTSST to predict the risk of falls over 1, 3
           and 6 months in ambulatory patients with SCI.

        -  To investigate internal and external responsiveness of the STSST and FTSST to detect
           changes on walking ability over 1, 3 and 6 months in ambulatory patients with SCI.

        -  To estimate the minimal clinically important difference or clinical significance of the
           FTSST in ambulatory patients with SCI.
