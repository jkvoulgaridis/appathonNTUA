  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 17% of US children have obesity resulting in significant childhood
      co-morbidities and increased lifetime risk of adult obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease
      and cancer. Guidelines recommend intensive lifestyle programs as first-line treatment, yet
      few pediatric practices are equipped to provide this. Clinical-community partnerships are
      well-positioned to address this care gap. This proposal aims to assess whether a
      community-delivered lifestyle program offered in adjunct to primary care obesity management
      is feasible, acceptable, effective, and easily implemented in a rural care setting. In this
      study, approximately 40 children aged 7-13 years old and their caregiver pairs will be
      recruited from a primary care pediatric clinic. Child-adult dyads will participate in a
      24-week program that includes 2 phases, a 12-week usual care phase and a 12-week intervention
      phase. The intervention phase will include bi-weekly meetings of a community intensive
      lifestyle program which focuses on healthy diet, daily physical activity, self-esteem and
      support for individual and family behavior change. A mixed-methods approach using qualitative
      interviews and study questionnaires, combined with objective measures of adiposity and
      fitness will assess study outcomes.
