  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled post-market clinical
      follow-up study. The primary objective of this study is to confirm the safety and performance
      of the A.L.P.S. Proximal Humerus Plating System applied in proximal humerus fracture
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The A.L.P.S. Proximal Humerus Plating System was developed to provide another surgical option
      for proximal humerus fracture fixation. The aim of the A.L.P.S. Proximal Humerus Plating
      System is to provide increased fracture stability while simultaneously increasing range of
      motion and decreasing the likelihood of screw perforation.

      A minimum of 7 and maximum of 10 sites globally will be involved in this study. This number
      of clinical sites will allow for a better generalization of study data as well as allow for
      consistency to be developed across multiple regions. 135 implants will be included into the
      study. Each site will be allowed to enroll 27 humeri. Enrollment is competitive. All
      potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent process.
