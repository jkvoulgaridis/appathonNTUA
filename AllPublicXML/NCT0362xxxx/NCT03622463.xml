      This is a multi-centers, phase IIa, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
      Antroquinonol in patients with atopic dermatitis.Duration of treatment is 12 week in total.
      Study visits will occur every 4 weeks. AEs/SAEs, changes to concomitant medications will be
      noted, vital signs will be taken, and efficacy evaluations will be performed as well. The
      last estimation of variable scores will occur for all subjects.

      This is a multi-centers, phase IIa, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
      Antroquinonol in patients with atopic dermatitis.Duration of treatment is 12 week in total.
      Study visits will occur every 4 weeks. During these visits study drug will be administered at
      the site, new AEs/SAEs as well as follow-up for AEs and SAEs that have not been resolved will
      be recorded, changes to concomitant medications will be noted, vital signs will be taken, and
      efficacy evaluations will be performed as well. The study includes collection of cytokines
      samples. The end-of-treatment visit and the last estimation of variable scores will occur at
      week 13 (visit 5) for all subjects. The final visit will be at week 15 (visit 6). Subjects
      will be encouraged to complete all planned visits regardless of their adherence to study drug
      administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients between the ages of 20 and 65 years who had moderate-to-severe atopic
             dermatitis (using the Hanifin and Rajka Diagnostic Criteria)

          -  Patients with body weight ≥ 25 kg and ≤ 120 kg, singing informed consent

          -  To be eligible to participate, patients were required to havea.

                  from 0 (no itch) to 100 mm (worst itch imaginable);

               3. a score of at least 2 on the static Investigator's Global Assessment (sIGA),
