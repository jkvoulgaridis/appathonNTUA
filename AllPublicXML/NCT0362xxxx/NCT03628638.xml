  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish a control population to assess
      performance of an investigational diagnostic test targeting lung neoplasms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be participating in a lung cancer screening program at enrollment. Subjects
      will have a blood sample collected within 60 days of a low-dose CT scan (LDCT). Subjects with
      nodules present on the LDCT or subjects with a clean LDCT scheduled for a 12-month follow-up
      may have another blood draw at 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female, 50 years of age or older.

          2. Subject meets one of two lung cancer screening criteria below.

               1. Subject is a candidate for LDCT lung cancer screening and is scheduled for a
                  baseline LDCT scan. There may be circumstances when a patient cannot have an LDCT
                  scan (e.g., due to insurance issues). In these cases, it is allowable for a
                  patient to have a CT scan in order to meet the inclusion criteria. OR

               2. Subject has had previous LDCT scan(s) for lung cancer screening and the most
                  recent LDCT scan prior to enrollment is negative for pulmonary nodules (Lung-RADS
                  category 1, no nodules).

          3. Subject understands the study procedures and is able to provide informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with pulmonary nodules on the most recent LDCT scan prior to enrollment
             (Lung-RADS category 1 nodules with specific calcifications such as complete, central,
             popcorn, concentric rings and fat containing nodules are excluded).

          2. Prior history of cancer within the past 5 years except for non-melanoma skin cancer.

          3. Prior removal of the lung, excluding percutaneous lung biopsy.

          4. Individual has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his or her
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk.
