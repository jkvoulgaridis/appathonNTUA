  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine symptomatology, quantitative sensory test (QST)
      parameters, muscle tenderness and muscle hardness in migraine patients interictally and
      compare with healthy controls
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine patients exhibit different symptomatology and responses to treatment. For example do
      many migraine patients have neck symptoms, despite they apparently do not have any neck
      disorders.Furthermore the response to treatment differs between patients. Differences in
      symptomatology, QST parameters and muscle stiffness can be used to subdivide and phenotype
      migraine patients.

      The investigators are examining migraine patients with:

      A semistructured interview, Quantitative sensory testing (cold pain threshold, heat pain
      threshold and Pin Prick), Muscle tenderness (total tenderness score, local tenderness score
      and stimulus response curve), and muscle hardness with ultrasound elastography. All tests are
      performed the same day

    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>We would like to examine the relationship between the variable variable: Neck stiffness during migraine attack (Yes/No) and the Independent variables: Total Tenderness Score (summed score from 8 points bilateral, each point can score 0-3), Migraine localisation (occipital: Yes/No), Tension Type Headache, Allodynia (yes/No), Stimulus response curve (Pressure and Pain).
The result shows how much of the variability in neck stiffness that can be explained by the independent variables.</description>
