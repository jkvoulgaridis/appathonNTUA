  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, parallel-arm, randomized (1:1) multicenter trial to demonstrate that
      application of autologous skin cell suspension (RES) prepared using the RECELL® device can be
      safely and effectively used to reduce the incidence of conventional autografting and healing
      time of partial-thickness burns when compared with a standardized, conventional wound
      dressing.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged 1 through 16 years (inclusive) with a partial-thickness
             thermal burn injury.

          2. TBSA (exclusive of superficial areas) of 5 to 30% (inclusive) where ≤ 10% of the burn
             injury is full-thickness.

          3. In the opinion of the investigator, the patient and/or guardian must be able to:

               1. Understand the full nature and purpose of the study, including possible risks and
                  adverse events, and

               2. Provide informed consent/assent as appropriate for study participation.

          4. The patient and/or guardian agrees to abstain from any other treatment of the wound(s)
             for the duration of the study unless medically necessary and comply with all
             compulsory study procedures and visit schedule

          5. The patient and/or guardian agrees to abstain from enrollment in any other
             interventional clinical trial for the duration of the study.

          6. The patient and/or guardian can read and understand instructions and give informed,
             voluntary, written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Not able to read or understand English or Spanish

          2. Burns caused by chemicals, electricity or radiation

          3. Patients presenting with ONLY 3rd degree / full-thickness wounds which require
             immediate autografting

          4. Patients for whom use of sedation/general anesthesia is not medically appropriate.

          5. Superficial / trivial burns or burns that in the investigator's opinion appear to be
             healing sufficiently such that care under this protocol would be inappropriate.

          6. Conditions, e.g., previous burn injury to study area, poor nutritional status, poorly
             controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c&gt;9%), that in the investigator's opinion may
             compromise subject safety or trial objectives.

          7. Current use of medications, e.g., immunosuppressive agents (excluding inhaled
             corticosteroids), that in the investigator's opinion may compromise subject safety or
             trial objectives.

          8. Inhalation injury.

          9. Active infection, cellulitis or need for immediate grafting at the planned treatment
             areas.

         10. Skin characteristics in areas to be photographed that could be used to identify the
             subject (tattoos, scars, birthmarks, etc.).

         11. Concerns for parent/guardian's ability to provide appropriate follow-up care.

         12. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or compound sodium lactate for
             irrigation solution.

         13. In post-pubescent girls, pregnant or breast-feeding (pregnancy test should be
             performed in accordance with local institutional requirements).

         14. Patient participating in a trial of another investigational product where this is a
             potential for study activities to interfere with the endpoints of this study.

         15. Immediate life-threatening condition or life expectancy less than one year.

         16. Previous randomization within this investigation.

        Additional Intra-operative Eligibility Criteria:

        Inclusion:

          1. At the time of initial debridement, the Index Burn Area must be no less than 160 cm2
             clean partial-thickness burn injury between 2-20% BSA (inclusive) and may not cover
             the face, hand, foot or the perineum/genitalia (Note: a patient with these wounds may
             be enrolled but the Index Burn Area may not include these areas).

          2. Patient randomized (and treated) within 72 hours from the time of the burn injury.

        Exclusion:

          1. Incidental finding of any pre-operative exclusion criteria.

          2. Patient requires staged procedures for treatment of partial-thickness burns.
