  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral compression fractures in osteoporotic patients is a major healthcare problem.
      Percutaneous vertebroplasty is commonly used to restore stability of the vertebra and to
      alleviate pain. However, the anesthetic techniques commonly used during these procedures such
      general anesthesia or a combination of local anesthesia and sedation are not satisfying as
      they are associated either with side effects or insufficient pain reduction.

      This study compares the standard procedure of local anesthesia to a new technique of
      fluoroscopy-guided epidural anesthesia carried out by the radiologist.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that fluoroscopy-guided epidural anesthesia

        -  provides better pain relief during the injection of high viscosity cement

        -  and thus, reduces the need of additional intravenous analgesia by remifentanil (morphine
           analogue)

        -  minimizes remifentanil potential adverse effects such as respiratory depression,
           hypoxemia, pruritus and nausea

        -  improves working conditions and satisfaction of the radiologist

        -  improves the global satisfaction of the patient

      It is a monocentric, prospective, comparative and randomized study.
