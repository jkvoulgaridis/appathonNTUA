  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect whole blood samples from women with viable
      pregnancies of at least 10 weeks gestation (at any risk for fetal chromosomal anomaly) for
      future testing with an investigational noninvasive prenatal test(s) (NIPTs), and to establish
      clinical truth compared to a clinical reference standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center specimen collection study; each subject's treatment,
      management, or medical care will not be determined by the study protocol.

      Women 18 years of age or older with a viable pregnancy of at least 10 weeks gestation will be
      enrolled. A whole blood sample will be collected from each subject.

      Subjects will be followed until data or specimens used to establish the clinical reference
      standard are collected, and pregnancy outcome and birth information is collected (if
      applicable). If cytogenetic test results from standard-of-care procedures are not available
      and pregnancies end in live births, a neonatal buccal swab specimen will be collected.

      Maternal specimens will be processed to plasma and stored for future testing with an
      investigational NIPT(s). There will be no investigational NIPT results nor centralized CMA
      LDT results generated under this protocol.

      Cytogenetic results from standard-of-care procedures and microarray results will be used to
      classify the clinical status of subjects according to the clinical reference standard.
