    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate two different modalities of functional electrical
      stimulation (FES) leg exercise in sub-acute patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). The
      primary outcomes being compared are 1. FES-induced leg aerobic fitness, and 2. FES-induced
      leg strength. There will be two FES-leg training groups, and sub-acute patients with SCI will
      be randomised between the groups - high-short [HI-SHORT] and low-long [LO-LONG]. Both groups
      (n=10 per group) will exercise on the Hasomed RehaStim™ exercise ergometer for 6-8 weeks,
      three-four times per week (24 therapy sessions). [HI-SHORT] will perform 10 x 2-min of
      high-intensity interval training with a recovery of 1-2 min between exercise bouts. [LO-LONG]
      will perform 20+ min of continuous exercise at a low-moderate exercise intensity. Exercise
      intensity for [HI-SHORT] and [LO-LONG] will be titrated by neuromuscular stimulation
      characteristics. The primary outcomes will be assessed before training commences and after
      6-8 weeks of training has been completed.

    <description>Both interventions are different modalities of FES-evoked leg exercise, three-four times per week for 6-8 weeks (24 therapy sessions). The comparator intervention ([LO-LONG]) uses 20-40 min (patient state of fitness dependent) of continuous leg exercise of lower intensity.</description>
