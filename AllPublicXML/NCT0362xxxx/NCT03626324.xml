  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and essential performance of the C2P
      System in males with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD), both in an acute
      clinical setting and an extended period of home use.

    <textblock>
      Spinal Singularity had developed C2P system to address several drawbacks of current
      standard-of-care urinary catheters. The C2P is fully internal, urethral indwelling urinary
      prosthesis designed for improved bladder management in males with urinary retention disorders
      requiring catheterization, including NLUTD. The C2P is a sterile, single-extended use device
      that resides fully internally to the male lower urinary tract for an intended service life of
      up to 29 days per catheter

    <description>The C2P is a fully internal, urethral indwelling urinary prosthesis designed for improved bladder management in males with urinary retention disorders requiring catheterization, including neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD - e.g. due to spinal cord injury). The C2P is a sterile, single-extended-use device that resides fully internally to the male lower urinary tract (urethra + bladder neck) for an intended service life of up to 29 days per Catheter.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males age â‰¥ 18 with clinical diagnosis of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction
             (NLUTD)

          2. Must be clinically suitable and capable of safely managing bladder using an
             intermittent voiding or indwelling strategy

               -  Must have stable urinary management history: no significant changes in bladder
                  management regimen within past 12 months

             OR:

               -  Must have urodynamic profile suitable for C2P, as assessed via urodynamics study
                  within past 12 months (including bladder capacity &gt; 200mL without uninhibited
                  bladder contractions)

          3. Subject's lower urinary tract anatomy must fall within the ranges serviceable by the
             C2P device, as specified in the investigational device instructions for use (IFU).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active symptomatic urinary tract infection, as defined in this protocol (subjects may
             receive the device after Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) has been treated)

          2. Significant risk profile or recent history of urethral stricture (e.g. stricture
             within past 90 days)

          3. Significant risk profile or recent history of clinically significant autonomic
             dysreflexia (AD) (e.g. History of hospitalization due to AD within past 12 months)

          4. Significant intermittent urinary incontinence (between catheterizations)

          5. Uninhibited bladder contractions and/or vesico-ureteral reflux that is not reliably
             controlled with medication or alternate therapy (e.g. Botox injections)

          6. Pre-existing urinary pathologies and/or morphological abnormalities of the lower
             urinary tract or bladder (assessed during in-depth medical screening, including
             cystoscopy and urine analysis)

          7. Urinary tract inflammation or neoplasm

          8. Urinary fistula

          9. Bladder diverticulum (outpouching) &gt; 5cm in size

         10. Chronic pyelonephritis (secondary to upper urinary tract infection(s) within past 6
             months)

         11. Impaired kidney function or renal failure

         12. Active gross hematuria

         13. Active urethritis

         14. Bladder stones

         15. Dependence on an electro-magnetic medical implant (e.g. cardiac pacemaker or implanted
             drug pump) or external device

         16. Any unsuitable comorbidities as determined by the investigator or complications
             related to use of certain medications

         17. Any physical or cognitive impairments that diminish the subject's ability to follow
             directions or otherwise safely use the C2P System
