    <textblock>
      Crohn disease is defined as an inflammatory chronic disease of the bowel characterize by
      intermittent flare-ups and remission periods.

      Crohn disease is due to genetic and environmental factors such as stress. Stress is an
      important aggravation factor of the disease symptoms which can stop a remission period and
      induce a relapse into a flare-up period.

      Hypnosis is a non-medicinal technic which already show efficacy in the treatment of
      functional digestive troubles. These diseases are bio/psycho/social models such as Crohn
      disease.

      Hypnosis can reduce visceral pain sensibility, reduce stress and reduce pro-inflammatory
      cytokines liberation into intestinal mucosa.

      Though, only few data are available on hypnosis interest in the treatment of Crohn disease
      and inflammatory bowel diseases as it is often isolated clinical case report.

      One study on patients with rectocolitis in remission period has been done recently and show
      that hypnosis increased the duration of the remission period.

      The principal objective of this study is to evaluate hypnosis efficacy in term of quality of
      life for patients with Crohn disease during remission.
