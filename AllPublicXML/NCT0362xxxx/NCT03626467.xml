      Phase IV, open, multicenter and single-arm clinical trial designed to evaluate the
      immunogenicity of the HPV9v vaccine in men with HIV infection (HIV +) who have sex with men
      (MSM)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators estimate that 166 participants will need to be included in the study to
      evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccine against human papillomavirus in men with HIV infection
      who have sex with men, by evaluating in two age groups and the seroconversion rate for each
      of the HPV genotypes included in the vaccine from baseline to month 7 and 24.
