  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this non-interventional study in confirmed moderate to severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease patients aged 40 years and above, is to assess real-life
      effectiveness and safety of Trimbow® in clinical practice, and to bridge the gap with the
      existing clinical data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study assesses the real-life effectiveness and safety of the fixed
      triple therapy Trimbow® compared to free triple therapy, considering patient individual data,
      in clinical practice at second and thirdline centres in patients with confirmed moderate to
      severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

      This is an hypothesis generating study. No formal primary endpoint is defined; parameters are
      evaluated in an exploratory or descriptive manner.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Inhalation technique score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Inhalation Technique Score, measured as percentage of correct steps on the Inhalation Checklist (itemized instructions of inhaler correct use per respective Summaries of Product Characteristics) at each routine follow-up visit up to 6 months versus baseline.
This is an hypothesis generating study. No formal primary endpoint is defined; parameters are evaluated in an exploratory or descriptive manner.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Degree of treatment adherence measured via the mean score on the Test of Adherence to Inhalers (TAI) questionnaire, including 5 questions completed by the patient (each item scored from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) with a range from 10 to 50) and 2 items completed by the physician (each item scored 1 (bad) or 2 (good) with a range from 2 to 4) at baseline and each routine follow-up visit up to 6 months versus baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of inhaled doses recorded by dose counter since previous visit</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of inhaled doses recorded by dose counter of the inhaler since previous visit, at the first and second routine follow-up visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's treatment satisfaction score using visual analogue scale (0-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's treatment satisfaction score measured on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 10 (best), at baseline and each routine follow-up visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of rescue medication used within 7 days prior to each visit</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of rescue medication used within 7 days prior to each visit, recorded at baseline and each routine follow-up visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's lung function as measured by spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pre and post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are measured at baseline and each routine follow-up visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms score by the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Assessment Test (CAT) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients complete the 8-item CAT questionnaire at baseline and each follow-up visit. Total scores range from 0 to 40 and higher scores indicate a worse health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of moderate and severe exacerbations at baseline (12 months prior to start) and last follow-up visit</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of moderate and severe exacerbations that occurred within the previous year is collected at the baseline visit and the number of moderate and severe exacerbations occurring during the study is collected at the final visit. Moderate exacerbations are defined as exacerbations that require oral corticosteroid and/or antibiotic treatment. Severe exacerbations are defined as exacerbations that require oral corticosteroid and/or antibiotic treatment plus hospital admission.</description>
