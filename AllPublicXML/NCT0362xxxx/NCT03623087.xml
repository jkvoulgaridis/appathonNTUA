  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NK malignancies consist of two different clinical entities, extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma and
      aggressive NK leukaemia. Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) had started to use PIGLETS chemotherapy
      for treatment of NK malignancies since 2013, with promising results. The study in QMH had
      ended because of successful recruitment in the planned number of subjects.

      When PIGLETS was used in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, patients with stage I/II lymphoma
      have an overall response rate of nearly 90%, while patients with stage III/IV disease have an
      overall response rate of around 60%. The figures are comparable to the SMILE chemotherapy
      previously used. However, PIGLETS regimen carries much lower risk of nephrotoxicity when
      compared with SMILE. It has since become a standard protocol in management of NK malignancies
      in our institution.

      PIGLETS chemotherapy carries two major problems:

        1. the name PIGLETS may appear offensive to some religious populations. (e.g. Muslim)

        2. significant nausea/vomiting was seen in previous studies, and these could at least be
           partially alleviated with substance P antagonist aprepitant

      Thus the investigators decided to start a study, renaming the original PIGLETS regimen into
      SIMPLE chemotherapy, adding aprepitant as antiemetics and to recruit more patients for
      evaluation of clinical efficacy. The results of SIMPLE chemotherapy will be compared to SMILE
      in a non-inferiority trial setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Natural killer (NK)/T-cell malignancies comprise two related entities, extranodal NK/T cell
      lymphoma and aggressive NK leukaemia. The disease occurs world-wide but Asian and South
      American populations are particularly affected, NK/T cell malignancies carry poor prognosis,
      the response rate is low with conventional CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine
      and prednisolone) or CHOP-like regimen even for newly diagnosed disease. These regimens are
      typically ineffective for relapsed disease.

      In the last 10 years the investigators have employed two different regimen sequentially. The
      former SMILE regimen (Dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase and etoposide)
      harness the combination of P-gp independent chemotherapy in management of NK/T cell
      malignancies with great success. However, nephrotoxicity remained a major concern with the
      use of this regimen. The SMILE regimen was later modified as PIGLETS regimen (cisplatin,
      ifosfamide, gemcitabine, L-asparaginase, etoposide, dexamethasone) to reduce the risk of
      nephrotoxicity while preserving the treatment efficacy. The study with the use of PIGLETS was
      approved by IRB. The preliminary results of phase II clinical trial with PIGLETS at Queen
      Mary Hospital resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 80% in newly diagnosed disease.

      The recruitment was completed with previous PIGLETS phase II trial. The problems with the
      PIGLETS regimen are:

        1. The term 'PIGLETS' may appear to be offensive in some of the ethnicities/religions.

        2. Significant nausea and vomiting, which may be delayed after completion of chemotherapy.

      In addition, there is a need of further subject recruitment for comparison with SMILE therapy
      for non-inferiority. In the current study, the regimen was renamed as 'SIMPLE' and aprepitant
      (a substance P antagonist) was added in the regimen to reduce the incidence of nausea and
      vomiting. The current study aims to compare SIMPLE to SMILE in a 'non-inferiority' design.
