  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators established the Faroese Alzheimer's Cohort with the aim to unravel genetic
      and environmental factors that influence the risk and/or susceptibility of Alzheimers disease
      (AD). It is believed the Faroese population represents a unique opportunity due to its
      characteristics as a geographic, environmental and genetic isolate with a homogeneous genetic
      background and founder effects. It has an 'engaged' population with superbly detailed
      genealogy going 400 years back, unfettered patient access to health care, traditionally high
      participation rates in research and low probability of losing subjects to follow-up, and
      presents a unique opportunity to more readily identify genetic and environmental factors
      involved in AD.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. Enrolment of patients with AD, incl.1st degree family members of selected familial
           patients and age and gender matched control subjects.

        2. Detailed genealogical investigation of patients with Alzheimer's disease

        3. Identify genes influencing risk and/or susceptibility of AD in the Faroese population

      The aim of the study is to unravel genetic and environmental factors that influence the risk
      and/or susceptibility of AD. Thus, subjects with AD and family members when there is a strong
      history of AD are being recruited. Data collection includes a blood sample, clinical
      phenotype data from hospital records, standardized assessment scales (e.g. Geriatric
      Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Functional
      Activities Questionnaire (FAQ-IADL), tests of mental function (Mini Mental State Examination
      (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE)) and family and lifestyle/environmental
      questionnaire. Furthermore are control subjects being recruited where data includes a blood
      sample, MMSE and a lifestyle/environmental questionnaire.

      Initial genetic analyses will focus on known genetic risk factors for AD by looking at the
      most highly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in loci harboring e.g. apolipoprotein
      E (APOE)/Translocase Of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 40 (TOMM40), MAPT, Phosphatidylinositol
      Binding Clathrin Assembly Protein (PICALM). Subsequent analyses will focus on genome-wide
      array genotyping of ~ 1.8 million markers, e.g. to accommodate the population structure.
      Finally, patients with a family history of AD who cannot be explained by the before mentioned
      analysis will be subject to exome sequencing. Exposure analyses will focus on persistant
      organic pollutants, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), perfluorinated alkylated
      substances (PFAS) and also mercury.

      The investigators believe the Faroese population presents a unique opportunity to more
      readily identify genetic and environmental factors involved in AD due to its characteristics
      as a geographic, environmental and genetic isolate with a homogeneous genetic background.

        This is a population based study conducted in the Faroe Islands, a small island population
        with approximately 50.000 inhabitants. Individuals diagnosed with dementia are being
        recruited from the only Dementia Clinic on the islands. Family members are also recruited.
        Control subjects are randomly selected from the Faroese Population Registry, matched by sex
        and age to the cases. Te
