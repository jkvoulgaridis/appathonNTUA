  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major handicap in daily life and is often treated by behavioral activation
      (CA), including the Brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD).The CA
      principle is to set up activities, in keeping with the values of the individual. Other tools
      associated with the CA deserve to be explored as virtual reality (VR), which offers scenarios
      and sensations similar to real life and a sense of life. in a safe and controlled
      environment, with the support of the therapist.The main objective is to compare the
      effectiveness of the program &quot;BATD with RV&quot; versus &quot;BATD without RV&quot; on the intensity of the
      depressive symptomatology and CA in everyday life.

      Methodology: This is a randomized, blinded study. Inclusion criteria are: 18 to 59 years old;
      unipolar depression diagnosis; Showing a score of â‰¥ 17 on the BDI-II. 70 subjects will be
      recruited over 24 months and randomized into 2 groups: 1) intervention group program BATD in
      VR; 2) BATD program intervention group without RV, lasting 45 minutes.

      Judgment Criteria: The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by the BDI-II
      scale and the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS).

      Outcomes: A new management of depression (AC with RV) to improve the quality of life of the
      patient; proof of its effectiveness; a generalization of this care; and recognition of its
      effectiveness in the scientific community.
