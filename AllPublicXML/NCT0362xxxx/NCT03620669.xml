  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to assess efficacy and safety of the treatment with durvalumab in PS
      2 patients with treatment-na√Øve, locally advanced or metastatic, PD-L1 positive NSCLC who are
      considered unsuitable for combination platinum-containing therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. An estimated 30 to 40% of patients
      diagnosed with NSCLC have a poor Performance status (PS) defined as a score of 2 or higher on
      the ECOG scale. PS 2 patients are often underrepresented in clinical trials despite
      representing a very frequent and important subgroup.

      Platinum-based (preferably carboplatin) doublets should be considered as standard of care in
      eligible PS 2 patients. However the toxicity profile of platinum-based doublets remains a
      concern. Single-agent chemotherapy represents an alternative treatment option for the PS 2
      patients considered unsuitable for platinum doublet chemotherapy but its efficacy is limited
      and the outcome poor.

      Given the superiority of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab versus standard chemotherapy as
      first line therapy in a PD-L1 positive NSCLC population, it now became the standard
      treatment. The PS of patients enrolled in these trials were PS 0 or 1, making the benefit of
      PD-L1 antibodies in PS 2 patients unclear. A retrospective real-life data analysis of
      nivolumab in metastatic NSCLC revealed similar treatment-related AE between patients with a
      PS of 0 or 1 with those having a PS of 2, confirming good treatment tolerability in poor PS
      patients.

      The overall favorable toxicity profile of durvalumab and the absence of robust efficacy data
      of checkpoint inhibitors in first line treatment of patients with PD-L1 positive NSCLC with a
      PS of 2, encourage to investigate its activity in this cohort of patients when considered
      unsuitable for platinum doublet chemotherapy.

      Finally, this trial aims to prolong overall survival by treating this cohort of frail
      patients with durvalumab, compared to historical controls, treated with single agent
      chemotherapy.
