  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the active involvement of
      Community Pharmacists in improving adherence to medical prescriptions in patients with acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI), reducing the rate of adverse events and / or re-admissions due
      to cardiovascular disease and reducing overall health costs. The Hospital and Community
      Pharmacists will collaborate with each other, the patients, heart specialists and primary
      care physicians, throughout 12 months from the hospital discharge.

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in medication adherence as measured by the calculation of Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) in the two arms. The value of PDC will be compared with the results of the pill counts performed by the community pharmacist. The endpoint concerns all medications recommended by the European Society of Cardiology for the treatment of AMI. The composite PDC will be an average of the individual PDC for each drug class</description>

    <description>Rates of hospital re-admission in the two arms: any re-admission identified by the heart specialist and due to cardiovascular events will be categorized based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 classification. The rate will be measured as the per cent ratio of the re-admissions in the interventional arm and the re-admissions in the control arm</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in medication adherence as assessed by the Morisky medication adherence scale (MMAS) in the interventional arm. The MMAS is an international validated scale to assess the patient's medication adherence in chronic diseases. Each patient will answer the 8 multiple choice questions of the MMAS by completing the self-questionnaire every 3 months</description>

    <description>At the discharge, the hospital pharmacist will complete the medication reconciliation and assess the patient's medications. All patients enrolled will undergo three interventions in order to improve medication adherence: counseling, pill counts and self-questionnaire. The adherence plan concerns 6 classes of drugs recommended by the European Society of Cardiology in acute myocardial infarction. The adherence plan is performed by the community pharmacists. The hospital pharmacist will complete the discharge care form for the community pharmacist who has in charge the patient. Each patient will be scheduled for the first meeting with his community pharmacist within one month from the hospital discharge; afterward the adherence plan will be submitted every 3 months.</description>

These patients have been discharged with the current standard therapy and without any adherence plan performed by the community pharmacists. The investigators will collect the data from the administrative pharmaceutical databases throughout 12 months from the hospital discharge.</description>
