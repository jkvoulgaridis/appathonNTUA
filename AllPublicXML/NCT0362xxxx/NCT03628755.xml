    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of digital manipulation of thyroid
      cartilage for the management of stuttering in adult.There were three groups,Group A received
      Digital Manipulation of Thyroid cartilage (DMT),Group B received Fluency shaping
      Therapy(FST),Group C received combination of DMT,FST.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of speech therapy is to stop progression of stuttering while teaching the method
      to client how to cope efficiently his or her stuttering disorder.

      The goal of fluency shaping therapy to eliminate the severity of stuttering by adopting the
      specific pattern of speech production and also reduce negative reaction to stuttering by
      default).

      Digital manipulation of thyroid cartilage decreases tension in vocal fold and reduces
      severity of stuttering and improves production of speech. DMT reduces unnecessary amount of
      tension in vocal tract and participant speaks with relax respiration,phonation, articulation
      and facilitate more fluent.in DMT subject speaks in natural way rather than in specific
      method in every situation.

    <description>This 24-item scale distinguishes the extent to which a stuttering person's communication attitude deviates from normed attitudes. Statement require a true or false answer. Individual with mean score of 19.22 and range of 9-24 is consider as stutter. Individual with mean score of 9.4 and range of 1-21 is consider as non-stutter. The higher the score, the poorer the communication attitude.</description>
