      The present study is aimed to evaluation of shade for clinical color change of discolored
      teeth treated by bleaching vs laminate veneers.

      Dental aesthetics, including tooth color, is of great importance for majority of the people
      and any discoloration or staining can affect their quality of life negatively1,2. In the UK
      it has been reported that 28% of grownups are dissatisfied with the appearance of their teeth
      and in the USA that 34% of grownups population are dissatisfied with their current tooth
      color. Moreover, in a survey of 3215 subjects from the UK 50% have admitted that they had
      some kind of tooth discoloration3,4.

      Tooth bleaching has become one of the most popular aesthetic dental treatments. Because tooth
      bleaching is an effective, non-invasive procedure for the change of tooth discoloration, it
      is the best of treatment options for improving teeth color 5.

      Ceramic restorations with excellent biocompatibility are widely used to achieve highly
      aesthetic characteristics in ﬁxed prosthodontics6. Porcelain laminate veneers have become a
      popular method of treated tooth discoloration. But are expensive, brittle and difficult to
      repair7.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Single blinded (outcome assessor). Assessors supervisor and co-supervisor will be blinded to the assigned material. However the operator and patient can't be blinded due to the difference in preparation and shade of the ceramic materials and bleaching agent.
The assessors will assess all outcomes blinded to the material assigned for each patient.
Three spectrophotometer measurements will be recorded each time, with the active point of the instrument focused on the cervical third of each tooth, then mean color from three measurements will be calculated.
Digital photograph measures the color of teeth based on the Adobe Photoshop software. (Version 5.5).</masking_description>

    <description>Opalescence Boost 40% is a 40% hydrogen peroxide, medical power bleaching gel. The jet mix syringe ensures freshness for each application and precise dosing of the activator. One barrel contains a unique chemical activation with sodium fluoride and potassium nitrate, which have been demonstrated to reduce caries susceptibility, lower sensitivity, and improve enamel micro-hardness. The other barrel contains the concentrated hydrogen peroxide. When mixed, Opalescence Boost results in a 1.1% fluoride and 3% potassium nitrate concentration.</description>

    <description>A lithium-silicate glass ceramic is newly introduced to the market. After crystallization, it demonstrates an ideal combination of strength, aesthetics and translucency that mirrors the vitality of natural teeth for fabrication of full anatomic anterior and posterior crowns. It differentiated from other ceramics by its high chipping resistance, due to their monolithic composition and average flexural strength of 385 MPa. Also Milling Block has good wear resistance due to the high content of ultra-fine nano-meter size crystalline structure. Lithium-silicates ceramic blocks are available in the commonly used VITA Classical and Chromascop Bleach shades.</description>
