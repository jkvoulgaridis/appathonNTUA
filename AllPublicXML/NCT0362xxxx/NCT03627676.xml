  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate for the first time prospectively the efficacy on the
      symptoms and the tolerance of percutaneous cryoablation performed under radiological guidance
      of endometriosis of the abdominal wall in alternative to surgery after validation in
      multidisciplinary meeting.

      Design of the study :

      Non-comparative, non-randomized monocentric phase II trial designed as a two-staged Simon
      minimax plan.

      Inclusions will be suspended at the end of the first stage. Statistical stopping rules are
      detailed in the justification of the number of patients required.

      Inclusion: Patients will be included after validation in multidisciplinary consultation by
      the interventional radiologist in charge of the patient.

      Follow-up: Only the cryoablation procedure is performed as an alternative to surgery, the
      usual follow-up of these patients will be maintained (1 consultation / 3 months, 1 MRI every
      6 months). Additional consultations on D7 and M1 will be conducted by phone (symptoms and
      pain history only).

      Device(s) under investigation The Endocare® Cryocare® Systems consist of a compact,
      easy-to-operate console and associated accessories that include Endocare® cryoprobes to
      deliver cold temperatures to the therapeutic tissue and Endocare® TempProbe® devices to
      monitor temperatures in the surrounding tissue. The Cryocare® Systems are intended for use in
      open, minimally invasive procedures in the areas in general surgery, urology, gynecology,
      oncology, neurology, dermatology, proctology, pulmonary surgery and thoracic surgery.

      The systems are designed to freeze/ablate tissue by the application of extreme cold
      temperatures including prostate and kidney tissue, liver metastases, tumors, skin lesions,
      and warts.

      CE Mark; Classe IIa

      Expected benefits for the participants and for society This study has a direct individual
      benefit because of the proposed curative treatment by cryoablation as an alternative to other
      therapeutic modalities. For the society, the minimally invasive cryoablation may reduce the
      hospitalization stay and the complication's rate compare to the reference standard (surgery).

    <description>Two percutaneous cryoprobes would be used for all patients. The 17-Gauge cryoprobes is introduced into the masses under US guidance. Mean distance to the skin has to be 5mm at least. Although US guidance is used, a non-enhanced CT scan may be used to assess the position of the cryoprobes before ablation, and to obtain a baseline examination in order to avoid thermal injuries to adjacent tissues such as the bowel during the ice growth. No ice extension to the skin has to be observed during cycles assessed by real-time US monitoring. Each cryoablation procedure involves 3 successive cycles: 10 minutes freeze with Argon gas, followed by 9 minutes passive and 1 minute active thawing with Helium gas, followed by a second 7 minutes freeze. The ice covered the entire targeted lesion on the short axes is visualize by US or CT-scan performed at the end of the three cycles or after repositioning. At the end of the cryoablation procedures, the probes are removed through active thawing.</description>
