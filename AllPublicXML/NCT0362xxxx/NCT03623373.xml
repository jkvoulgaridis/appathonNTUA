  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib plus bendamustine
      and rituximab followed by acalabrutinib plus cytarabine and rituximab in subjects with
      treatment naïve mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), as a preparation for a larger cooperative group
      trial with the goal of achieving a standard induction regimen for MCL in transplant eligible
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of acalabrutinib to BR/CR regimen
      will prove safe and increase the complete response (CR) rate as well as minimal residual
      disease (MRD) negativity pre-transplant, thus improving clinical outcomes.

             serum pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.
