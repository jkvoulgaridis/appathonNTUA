  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this protocol is to pilot test a clinician training intervention that
      uses standardized patients (trained actors playing patient roles) as instructors who impart
      communication skills to primary care clinicians. This project will conduct a pilot clinical
      trial of the intervention developed by the primary investigator in order to evaluate
      intervention feasibility and generate data to plan a subsequent fully-powered, multisite
      trial. Primary care clinicians will be randomized to receive either the intervention or
      control; 48 patients (2 per clinician) will then be recorded during clinic visits with study
      clinicians and will provide data on post-visit perceptions and health outcomes. Study
      hypotheses are that visits with clinicians who receive the intervention (versus control) will
      be associated with more frequent use of targeted communication skills, lower probability of
      high-risk opioid prescribing, higher patient-reported agreement with treatment plan, and
      lower pain interference 2 months later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The only intervention in the randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be clinician education.
      This RCT will not directly manipulate or influence patient care. Therefore, this study is
      minimal risk. The only foreseeable patient risks relate to data confidentiality and privacy.

      The investigators will recruit approximately 48 primary care clinicians for the pilot RCT.
      The study goal is to enroll 24 residents and 48 patients (2 patient visits per resident).
      However, based on previous experience with similar recruitment methods in these clinics, only
      about 50% of enrolled clinicians will ultimately have visits with study patients. Thus, it
      will be necessary to over-enroll clinicians because the investigators expect a large
      proportion of residents will have to be dropped from study due to not seeing any study
      patients. After enrollment, clinicians will complete a brief questionnaire including
      demographics and self efficacy regarding communicating with patients about chronic pain and
      opioids.

      Randomization assignment will take place after all clinicians have provided informed consent
      and enrolled, to prevent randomization status from influencing enrollment decisions.
      Randomization assignment will be done by study personnel after all clinicians have been
      recruited. Randomization is at the clinician level. Because of the nature of the
      intervention, it is not possible to blind subjects or investigators to randomization
      assignment. However, patients will be unaware of clinicians' randomization assignment.

      Intervention clinicians will complete 2 standardized patient visits during regular clinic
      time. The first visit will include viewing an 8-10 minute video summarizing the key
      communication skills, a 10-12 minute roll-play session to practice using these skills, and
      8-10 minutes of constructive feedback. The second video will have only roll-play and
      feedback. Control clinicians will receive a written summary of the 2016 Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) opioid prescribing guidelines which include recommendations for
      best practices for use of opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain. To the extent possible,
      the investigators will use CDC-produced materials for the control group. CDC guidelines will
      serve as an attention control. Intervention clinicians will complete a brief questionnaire
      evaluating the intervention. Some time later, enrolled clinicians will see 2 patients who've
      been screened and enrolled by the research team and who've agreed to allow a previously
      scheduled visit with pcp to be audio recorded. Data will include the audio recording
      transcripts, a pre-visit and post-visit patient questionnaire and a clinician post-visit
      questionnaire.

      2 months after each patient's visit, a research assistant will call patients and obtain
      2-month follow up data (e.g. Brief Pain Inventory).

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Pain Interference subscale consists of 7 categories relating to how pain interferes with patients lives. Patients are asked to rate their pain on a zero (Does Not Interfere) to 10 (Completely Interferes) scale. The 7 categories are: 1. General Activity, 2. Mood, 3. Walking Ability, 4. Work, 5. Relationships, 6. Sleep, 7. Enjoyment of life. Results are averaged to give an overall interference rating</description>

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form -- Pain Severity subscale has 4 survey questions / categories, asking patients to rate the severity of their pain on a 0-10 scale (with 0 being No Pain and 10 being Worst Possible Pain). The 4 Categories are, A. At it's worst in the last 24 hours, B. At it's best in the last 24 hours, C. Pain on average, D. Pain right now. Results are averaged to give an overall score.</description>

Patient experience will be a &quot;standardized average&quot; of 3 different scales:
Patient assessment of physician communication skills is a subscale of the CAHPS (Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Survey) Adult Visit Survey. Range is 0-12, with higher indicating better communication skills.
Patient agreement with treatment plan scale. Range is 3-21, with higher being greater agreement).

    <description>Change in physician self efficacy for communication skills for Intervention vs Control physicians. These questions ask about physicians' confidence related to managing chronic non-cancer pain in primary care. Physicians will be asked to rate how strongly they agree or disagree with each statement. Higher values indicate greater self efficacy.
