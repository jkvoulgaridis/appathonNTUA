    <textblock>
      The PROMPT Pilot Study is a feasibility mixed methods prospective cohort study following
      principles of community-based participatory action research. The study recruited 80 people
      who use drugs and followed them for 6 months while providing access to counselling, nicotine
      replacement therapy and peer-support in a community setting. A notable reduction in average
      cigarette use per day (20.5 to 9.3) and illicit substance use (18.8%) was observed at
      study-end. PROMPT's patient engagement model is an effective harm-reduction strategy for the
      growing opioid use crisis and can improve the health outcomes of marginalised at-risk
      populations worldwide.

      Objective To determine the feasibility of a Community-Based Participatory Tobacco Dependence
      Strategy (PROMPT) in the inner city population of Ottawa (Canada).

      Design A feasibility mixed methods prospective cohort study following principles of
      community-based participatory action research.

      Intervention Recruited 80 people who use drugs, followed them for 6 months while providing
      access to counseling, nicotine replacement therapy and peer-support in a community setting.

      services and street-based drug consumption.

      Primary outcome Retention rate at 6-month follow-up.

      Secondary outcome Biochemically validated 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 26
