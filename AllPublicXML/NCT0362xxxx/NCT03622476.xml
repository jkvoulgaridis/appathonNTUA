    <textblock>
      The study start on June 30, 2018. The Severe(F Ⅷ&lt;1%) hemophilia A children without F Ⅷ
      inhibitor combining were recruited to Test the concentration of the drug in the blood to
      provide better treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through the integration of two technologies, pharmacokinetics and comprehensive evaluation
      system, we can improve the individualized prevention and treatment of hemophilia in Chinese
      children and achieve precise customization of treatment plans. Rational use of medical
      resources, but also fully achieve the prevention and treatment goals.

    <description>Interventional studies were performed in the 1-7 year old subgroup, and the children received a comprehensive assessment and PK test every 3 months. After the 72-hour washout period, 50 IU/kg of concentrated FVIII was administered in a single dose, and blood was taken within half an hour before the infusion and 1 h, 9 h, 24 h, and 48 h after the infusion, and the samples were centrifuged. If the assessment considers that the treatment is inadequate, then the valley concentration target is upgraded.</description>
