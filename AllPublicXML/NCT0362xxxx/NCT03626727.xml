  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates whether the use of Sodium Oxybate (Xyrem®) in TBI patients will be
      effective in reducing symptoms of post traumatic narcolepsy and post traumatic hypersomnia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic narcolepsy and post-traumatic hypersomnia are under-recognized clinical
      conditions in post-TBI patients.

      Considering the high prevalence of hypersomnia, treatment difficulty, and sparse clinical
      studies for treatment of sleep problems in TBI patients, additional clinical trials need to
      be performed to provide more therapeutic options for patients and physicians. Sodium oxybate
      (Xyrem®) could be potentially one such option given its high efficacy in idiopathic
      narcolepsy patients.

      From the results of animal research, as well as from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and autopsy
      findings from TBI patients, hypothalamic injury and hypocretin pathology seem to play a role
      in the pathogenesis of post-traumatic narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Despite lack of clear
      understanding of the exact mechanism of action of sodium oxybate in patients with idiopathic
      narcolepsy, the shared pathophysiology of the hypocretin system in post-traumatic hypersomnia
      and narcolepsy would suggest the possible efficacy of sodium oxybate (Xyrem®) on excessive
      daytime sleepiness (EDS) and prolonged sleep in patients with TBI.

      In this Pilot Clinical Trial, we will test whether sodium oxybate (Xyrem®, approved for the
      treatment of improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with
      narcolepsy) is effective in improving the sleep-wake symptoms, global functioning and quality
      of life of post-TBI patients with hypersomnia and narcolepsy.

    <description>Change in clinical condition as assessed by Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment. CGI assesses a clinician's view of a patient's global functioning before and after initiating medication. It is broken up into CGI-S (Severity) and CGI-I (Improvement). CGI-S is one question assesses how clinically ill a patient is at time of assessment. it is on a 1-7 scale with 1 being normal and 7 being among the most extremely ill patients. CGI-I looks at improvement in patients functioning once medication starts. it is also on a 1-7 scale with 1 being very much improved since initiation of treatment and 7 being very much worse.</description>
