  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor all patients exposed to an existing AUTO CAR T cell
      therapy, as well as the Sponsor's future autologous T cell products for up to 15 years
      following their first AUTO CAR T cell therapy infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled following completion or early discontinuation from an AUTO CAR T
      cell therapy treatment study and will be followed for up to 15 years (or death, whichever
      happens first) after the first AUTO CAR T cell therapy infusion. Patients will be monitored
      for safety following the first AUTO CAR T cell therapy infusion.
