      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct a pragmatic effectiveness trial comparing
      digital mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) plus usual care to usual care (UC) only
      among euthymic pregnant women with recurrent depression treated with antidepressants.

      In the supplemental arms we will investigate the prevalence, severity, longitudinal course,
      correlates, and predictors of suicidal ideation and behavior among women during pregnancy and
      the postpartum period.

      This study will address a significant gap in the evidence regarding effective approaches to
      prevent depressive relapse among women with recurrent depression who maintain euthymia using
      antidepressants and who wish to conceive or who are pregnant. Relapse rates of depression
      following antidepressant discontinuation among such women has been established, and the
      efficacy of MBCT in mitigating relapse risk in pregnant women with recurrent depression
      compared to UC also has been demonstrated. But the effectiveness of MBCT has not been tested
      in a definitive trial; the question of whether MBCT can mitigate risk for depressive relapse
      among pregnant women on antidepressants, including among those who discontinue
      antidepressants proximate to or during pregnancy, also has not been addressed.

      Reproductive age women with recurrent depression and their healthcare providers need to know,
      first, if a scalable digital non-pharmacologic prevention approach is superior to UC in
      community settings, and second, whether MBCT can attenuate risk for depressive relapse among
      those who elect to discontinue maintenance antidepressant treatment proximate to or during
      pregnancy. Lastly, the capacity to identify which women are most likely to benefit from a
      non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic approach personalizes the risk benefit decision making
      process for reproductive age women on antidepressants planning to conceive or who are
      pregnant.

      Investigators will test the relative risk for depressive relapse and reduction of symptom
      burden between women randomized to digital MBCT or UC, explore the specific benefit of MBCT
      relative to antidepressant discontinuation, and determine whether a treatment selection
      algorithm can predict whether MBCT or UC will work best for a specific participant.
