  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, single arm, multi-center registry to evaluate the
      Cordella™ Heart Failure System (CHFS) in up to 250 NYHA Class III HF patients .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects in this registry will participate in the Screening Visit, and Follow-Up Visits.
      After the Screening Visit, eligible subjects will be trained on at-home use of the CHFS to
      measure BP, HR, SpO2, weight and optional ECG.

      They will be instructed to perform daily measurements of the parameters which will all be
      wirelessly transmitted to a secure website for review using the myCordella™ Patient
      Management Portal (PMP). Clinicians will be able to view Blood Pressure (BP), Heart Rate
      (HR), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), weight and Electrocardiogram (ECG)
      (optional) data through the myCordella™ PMP.

      Subjects will return for follow up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment or until
      study termination.

      At Month 6, the primary endpoint will be assessed through evaluation of the subjects Quality
      of Life using the completed KCCQ Questions.

      Assessment of secondary endpoints will be performed throughout the study duration, including
      evaluation of adverse events, and heart failure-related hospitalizations and medication
      changes. Additionally, Health Economics will be assessed per subject and per site via a
      detailed site questionnaire.

    <description>The KCCQ is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. An overall summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. For each domain, the validity, reproducibility, responsiveness and interpretability have been independently established. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status. For brevity, only the performance characteristics of the overall summary score are presented in this discussion.The answers patients give to the KCCQ's questions are used to calculate scores in ten scales: Physical Limitation, Symptom Stability, Symptom Frequency, Symptom Burden, Total Symptom, Social Limitation, Self-Efficacy, Quality of Life, Clinical Summary, Overall Summary</description>
