    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research project is to implement and evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a Blended Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (bCBT) in
      routine practice, comparing it with Treatment as Usual (TAU). This research project includes
      a pilot study and a randomized clinical trial (RCT).

      The pilot study main objective is to adapt the bCBT based on Moodbuster, an internet-based
      treatment platform developed by the ICT4Depression Consortium (INESC-TEC, Vrije Universiteit
      and University of Limerick), to the Portuguese population. More specifically, this pilot
      study intends: (1) to detect problems and refine procedures, establishing a definitive
      Portuguese version of the blended treatment; (2) to assess clinical effectiveness
      (non-controlled), estimating effect sizes at the end of the treatment and follow-up; (3) to
      assess patients' satisfaction and personal views concerning their process of change; (4) to
      develop dynamic models of the individual trajectories during treatment based on Ecological
      Momentary Assessments. The pilot study will involve the participation of psychologists
      trained in bCBT and 20 participants diagnosed with Major Depression and willing to use the
      Moodbuster system.

      The RCT is composed by two arms (an experimental condition and a control condition) and it
      will be implemented in routine practice. In the experimental condition, the patients
      diagnosed with Major Depression will receive a treatment that integrates face-to-face
      cognitive-behavioral sessions with online sessions available through Moodbuster system
      (bCBT). In the control condition, patients diagnosed with Major Depression will receive TAU
      that consists in routine care that patients receive in primary care. The RCT will involve the
      participation of family doctors and psychologists working in routine practice. One-hundred
      patients will be recruited and randomized in the two conditions: 50 patients for bCBT
      condition and 50 patients for TAU condition. The main objectives are: (1) to assess the
      clinical effectiveness of bCBT and compare it with TAU in routine practice; (2) to estimate
      and compare cost-effectiveness of both treatments; (3) to assess patients' and clinicians'
      satisfaction with the bCBT and TAU; (4) to refine the previous models of individual
      trajectories and to assess differential effects on different patient clusters; (5) to
      establish guidelines for using bCBT within Portuguese routine practice services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Internet-based interventions in depression have emerged over the last decades to improve the
      access to effective treatments. Despite the increasing relevance of these treatments,
      empirical evidence is still needed to demonstrate their clinical and cost-effectiveness in
      different healthcare contexts. The present study represents an extension to the Portuguese
      context of the original trial developed by the ECOMPARED consortium. The overall project
      involves a pilot study and a randomized clinical trial (RCT).

      The pilot study main objective is to adapt the bCBT based on Moodbuster, an internet-based
      treatment platform developed by the ICT4Depression Consortium (INESC-TEC, Vrije Universiteit
      and University of Limerick), to the Portuguese population. More specifically, this pilot
      study intends: (1) to detect problems and refine procedures, establishing a definitive
      Portuguese version of the blended treatment; (2) to assess clinical effectiveness
      (non-controlled), estimating effect sizes at the end of the treatment and follow-up; (3) to
      assess patients' satisfaction and personal views concerning their process of change; (4) to
      develop dynamic models of the individual trajectories during treatment based on Ecological
      Momentary Assessments (EMA). The pilot study will involve the participation of psychologists
      trained in bCBT and 20 participants diagnosed with Major Depression and willing to use the
      Moodbuster system. The assessment protocol will be implemented at the baseline, during
      therapeutic sessions, 16 weeks and 26 weeks after baseline and it is composed by several
      measures that evaluate depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, distress, quality of life,
      working alliance, treatment credibility and expectancy, treatment satisfaction and system
      usability. Moreover, the EMA concerning mood, sleep quality, anxiety and other emotional
      states will be collected in a daily basis before, during and after the treatment. The
      intervention protocol includes ten face-to-face cognitive-behavioral sessions combined with
      nine online sessions based on the self-help treatment modules of the Moodbuster
      (psychoeducation, exercise therapy, behavioral activation, problem solving, cognitive
      restructuring and relapse prevention) delivered over a period of 16 weeks.

      The RCT is composed by two arms (an experimental condition and a control condition) and it
      will be implemented in routine practice. In the experimental condition, the patients
      diagnosed with Major Depression will receive a treatment that integrates face-to-face

      trajectories and to assess differential effects on different patient clusters; (5) to
      establish guidelines for using bCBT within Portuguese routine practice services. The
      assessment protocol will be implemented at the baseline, during therapeutic sessions, 16
      weeks, 26 and 52 weeks after baseline and it is composed by several measures that evaluate
      depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, distress, quality of life, working alliance, treatment
      credibility and expectancy, treatment satisfaction, system usability and cost-effectiveness.
      Moreover, the EMA concerning mood, sleep quality, anxiety and other emotional states will be

    <intervention_model_description>The RCT is composed by an experimental condition and a control condition. In the experimental condition, patients will receive a treatment that integrates face-to-face cognitive-behavioral sessions with online sessions delivered through Moodbuster system (bCBT). In the control condition, patients will receive TAU that consists in routine care that they usually receive in primary care. We will not interfere with treatments delivered in TAU, but the intervention will be tracked, as well as medicine intake. One-hundred patients will be recruited and randomized in two conditions: 50 for bCBT condition and 50 for TAU condition. New cases of Major Depression signaled by GPs or other healthprofessionals will be invited to participate in the RCT. Once obtained the signed informed consent, the patients will be randomized at an individual level. The allocation will be performed by an independent researcher not involved in data collection using an automated computer-based random intergenerator.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001). The PHQ-9 is composed by nine items that assess the severity of the depressive symptoms in a Likert scale of four points (0 = Not at all; 3 = Nearly every day). The total score of this questionnaire can range from 0 to 27 points. A total score between 0 and 4 indicates subclinical symptoms of depression; a total score between 5 and 9 indicates mild depression; a total score between 10 and 14 indicates moderate depression; a total score between 15 and 19 indicates moderately severe depression; and a total score between 20 and 27 indicates severe depression.</description>

    <description>Clinical Outcome Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM; Evans, Mellor-Clark, Barkham, &amp; Mothersole, 2006). The CORE-OM is a self-report questionnaire composed by 34 items that assess global distress and specific dimensions, namely subjective well-being, problems/symptoms, life functioning and risk/harm. Each item is assessed through a Likert scale of five points (0 = not at all; 4 = most or all the time). The total score of this questionnaire can range from 0 to 136 (this score is obtained by adding the response values of each item). The total mean score is calculated by dividing the total score by the number of completed responses. The mean scores for each dimension are calculated by dividing the total scores by the number of completed item responses for each dimension. Higher scores indicate worse results in terms of global distress, but also for the specific dimensions of the questionnaire.</description>

    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Lowe, 2006). The GAD-7 is composed by seven items that assess the symptoms of generalized anxiety in a Likert scale of four points (0 = Not at all; 3 = Nearly every day). The total score ranges from 0 to 21. A total score between 0 and 4 indicates subclinical symptoms of anxiety; a total score between 5 and 9 indicates mild anxiety; a total score between 10 and 14 indicates moderate anxiety; and a total score between 15 and 21 indicates severe anxiety.</description>

    <description>Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR; Tracey &amp; Kokotovic, 1989). This questionnaire is composed by 12 items, each one scored in a Likert scale of 5 points (1 = rarely or never; 5 = always). This questionnaire measures three dimensions of the therapeutic alliance, namely: (a) agreement between patient and therapist on the goals of the treatment; (b) agreement between patient and therapist about the tasks to achieve these goals; and (c) the quality of the bond between the patient and therapist. In each dimension the total score can range between 5 and 20, and higher scores indicate better therapeutic alliance.</description>

    <description>Client Satisfaction Scale (CSQ-8; Larsen, Attkisson, Hargreaves, &amp; Nguyen, 1979). This scale evaluate patients' level of satisfaction with treatment. It is composed of eight items, each one evaluated in a Likert scale of four points (1 = low satisfaction; 4 = high satisfaction). The CSQ-8 is scored by summing the individual item scores. The total score can range from 8 to 32, and high scores indicate greater satisfaction with treatment.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L (Brooks &amp; Euroqol Group, 1996). The EQ-5D-5L is a self-report measure that assesses health-related quality of life taking into account five dimensions: (1) mobility, (2) personal care, (3) usual activities, (4) pain/discomfort, and (5) anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated in 5 levels: (1) no problems, (2) slight problems, (3) moderate problems, (4) severe problems, and (5) extreme problems. A total of 3125 possible health states can be defined by this scale. This health state may be converted into a single index value. Also, it is possible to obtain, through this measure, a quantitative measure of health. The patient can rate their health in a scale ranging between &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot;.</description>
