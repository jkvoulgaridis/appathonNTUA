  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will test the feasibility and effectiveness of a &quot;Magic Camp&quot; in children
      with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). A single group pretest-posttest design (n=10)
      will be used to investigate the immediate (2 weeks) and longer-term effect (3 months) of a
      &quot;Magic Camp&quot; on improving upper limb motor function and health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) in children with hemiplegic CP.

    <textblock>
      This project will employ a single group pretest-posttest design to investigate the impact of
      a &quot;Magic Camp&quot; on the improvement in upper limb motor function, health-related quality of
      life, and emotional stress among children with spastic hemiplegic CP. After the baseline
      evaluation, eligible participants will complete one-on-one &quot;magic trick&quot; training 3-hours per
      day for 2 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome measures will be unimanual function as
      measured by the Jebsen Taylor Test of Hand Function, bimanual coordination as measured by
      kinematic parameters using motion analysis, and spontaneous use of the more affected limb in
      real-life activities that demand the use of both hands as measured by the Children's Hand
      Experience Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures will include HRQoL as measured by the
      Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire, in-depth dyad qualitative interviews of the
      caregivers and children, and emotional stress as measured by the fingernail cortisol levels.

    <measure>Unimanual skill as measured by the Jebsen Taylor Test of Hand Function</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Jebsen Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTTHF) is a standardized timed test administered by occupational therapy (OT) students to assess the efficiency of unimanual grasp and release of items with six tasks. Higher scores (i.e., longer duration the participant takes to complete the task) represent poorer unimanual skills</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bimanual coordination as measured by 3-D kinematic motion analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to perform the task with their preferred hand choice at a self-selected pace following by an auditory go-signal. Each trial ends when the button is pressed. Five trials will be collected after 2 practice trials, and outcome measures will be averaged over the 5 trials. Longer time duration it takes for the participant to complete the task represents poorer bimanual coordination.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Extent of the more affected hand use in daily bimanual activities as measured by the Children's Hand Experience Questionnaire (CHEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>CHEQ is a 29-item (parent and child report) questionnaire that evaluates the experience of children in using the more affected hand in activities where usually two hands are required. Percentage use of the more affected hand will be expressed as percentage of independent activities performed bimanually in which the more affected hand is used to stabilize or grip items. Higher percentage (ranging from 0% to 100%) represents higher extent of using the more affected hand.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life as measured by the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life (CPQOL) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>CPQOL evaluates the well-being of children with CP across several broad domains such as social well-being and acceptance, and emotional well-being. Items are rated on a 9-point scale, and recoded and transformed into scaled scores (transformed to a scale of 1-100) for each domain. An average of the scale scores from all domains (family &amp; friends, school, communication, health, special equipment, pain and bother, and access to services) is conducted. Higher scores represent better health-related quality of life.</description>
