    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to characterize the performance of the DiamondTemp Ablation
      System for its intended use.

    <textblock>
      -  The DiamondTemp Ablation System is indicated for use in patients requiring cardiac
           electrophysiological mapping (stimulation and recording) and, when used in conjunction
           with a radiofrequency generator and irrigation pump, for cardiac ablation with
           monitoring of tissue temperature during ablation.

        -  In this study, the DiamondTemp Ablation System will be evaluated for the treatment of
           patients with atrial fibrillation.
