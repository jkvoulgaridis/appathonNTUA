  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-national, open-label clinical study which is conducted to asses the
      safety, feasibility and performance of the TRVD™ System in hospital-admitted patients with
      Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) and evidence of reduced left ventricular ejection
      fraction.

      The study will include patients who present with significant venous congestion, as evidenced
      by clinical, laboratory and imaging signs of fluid retention.

      Study participation, for each enrolled subject, will last approximately 3 months post index
      procedure.

      Patients will be evaluated from enrollment until hospital discharge, then at 30, 60, and 90
      days post procedure.

    <description>A catheter-mounted expandable flow pump is to be deployed in a transfemoral venous catheterization procedure. Once in place, renal venous pressure is reduced to a pre-selected physiologic target pressure and kept there for up to 24 hours. After termination of TRVD therapy, the device is removed.</description>
