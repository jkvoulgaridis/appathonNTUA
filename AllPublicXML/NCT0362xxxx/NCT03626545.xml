  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III study is designed to evaluate the role of IL-1β inhibition in combination with
      docetaxel in subjects with advanced NSCLC previously treated with PD-(L)1 inhibitors and
      platinum-based chemotherapy. The randomized III part will be preceded by a safety run-in part
      in which the recommended dose of the combination of canakinumab and docetaxel will be
      confirmed.
