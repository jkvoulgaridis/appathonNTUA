      To pilot test the feasibility, usability, and preliminary efficacy of the D-SCAN mobile
      application in cancer patients and caregivers at Duke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      D-SCAN, a digital patient navigator service in the form of a mobile application (&quot;app&quot;), has
      been designed at Duke, with feedback from Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) patients, caregivers
      and clinicians (screenshots in Appendix A).3 Its purpose is to facilitate awareness of
      available Cancer Patient Support Program (CPSP) services at Duke, and to also help patients
      recognize their unmet symptom management needs by answering questions from the Edmonton
      Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). This novel electronic system helps to connect patients and
      their loved ones with existing resources tailored to their unique situations, ensuring that
      no supportive care needs go unaddressed, thus improving patients' lives and their cancer
      care.

      This protocol aims to assess the feasibility, usability, and preliminary efficacy of the
      D-SCAN mobile application. The app data, along with quantitative and qualitative feedback
      obtained during the pilot, will inform future development and design of a subsequent efficacy
      trial.

Subjects receiving the D-SCAN mobile app will also complete a survey every week within the app. The first 15 patients and 5 caregivers randomized into the intervention arm (those receiving the app) will also be asked to participate in a qualitative interview assessment at week 12, +/- 3 weeks</description>
