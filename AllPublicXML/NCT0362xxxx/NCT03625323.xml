      Up to 120 patients will be recruited in the TACTI-002 (Two ACTive Immunotherapies) Phase II
      study which will take place across approximately 15 study centres in the U.S., Europe and
      Australia. It will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of eftilagimod alpha
      with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma or
      head and neck carcinoma. It will be a Simon's two-stage, non-comparative, open-label,
      single-arm, multicentre clinical study. Patients participating in the trial will be given the
      combination treatment for 12 months using a 30 mg s.c. eftilagimod alpha dosing every 2 or 3
      weeks.

             pembrolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, etc.) alone, or in combination with any other
             immunotherapeutic or chemotherapy given as part of first-line treatment.

             of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the
             last dose of the previous investigational agent.

          5. Known active central nervous system metastasis and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
             Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are
             radiologically stable: i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by
             repeat imaging, clinically stable and without requirement for steroid treatment for at
             least 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1.

          6. Receives continuous systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 7 days prior to
             cycle 1 day 1. Inhaled or topical steroids and physiological replacement doses of up
             to 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
