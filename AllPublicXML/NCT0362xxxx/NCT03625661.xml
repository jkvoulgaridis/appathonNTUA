  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In oncology, anemia is a frequent symptom, leading to complication of patient management for,
      more or less, a long term but often poorly evaluated by medical teams.

      In oncology, anemia is induced by multiple causes. Iron deficiency appears to be a leading
      cause of anemia, especially in people with solid cancer. Iron deficiency is characterized by
      a low level of iron . Iron is a trace element required for life. It is a major component of
      hemoglobin allowing the transport of oxygen in red blood cells. There are in fact 2 types of
      iron deficiency: an absolute iron deficiency with a deficiency of true iron and a functional
      iron deficiency. Since end of January 2014, intravenous iron-based injections have been
      reclassified for cancer patients at ICO Paul Papin. The monitoring of iron deficiency with or
      without anemia is currently done in our institute, the ICO-Paul Papin. There is a procedure
      for the management of anemia with or without iron deficiency but there is still no
      traceability of treatments performed, their compliance or even their impact on the rate
      hemoglobin and the quality of life of patients during their treatment. This observatory also
      makes it possible to evaluate the impact of this treatment on the quality of life of the
      patients and thus allows them a personalized care of the tiredness during their treatment

      The study is for patients with iron deficiency and / or anemia during treatment for cancer
      These patients will receive ferinject. Patients will perform functional assessments and
      complete quality of life questionnaires, when the ferinject will be injected, then at 1 month
      and 6 months.

      Patients will be followed for 6 months in the study
