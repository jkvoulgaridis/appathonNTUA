  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of 3 treatments for fatigue in Multiple
      Sclerosis: 1) a commonly used behavioral treatment strategy (telephone-based cognitive
      behavioral therapy), 2) a commonly used medication (modafinil), and 3) a combination of both
      therapies. Each participant will receive one of these 3 treatments for a total of 12 weeks.
      Hypotheses are that, at 12 weeks, treatment with combination therapy will overall lead to
      greater reductions in fatigue impact, fatigue severity, and fatigability compared to
      monotherapy, and that comorbid depression, sleep disturbances, and baseline disability level
      will be important effect modifiers that influence treatment effect and adherence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale is a self-report survey that contains 21 items. Each item is rated 0-4. Higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a person's activities. The primary outcome measure will be the mean within-subject difference between baseline and 12-week Modified Fatigue Impact Scale values (delta-MFIS), compared between the 3 treatment groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fatigue intensity as assessed by self-reported Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue intensity will be assessed using a wearable monitor, the PRO-Diary (CamNtech) - a wrist-worn accelerometer-based activity monitor which also contains a self-report user interface.
Using a 0-10 numerical rating scale, participants will rate their fatigue intensity, and enter the score into the user-interface on the PRO-Diary four times each day, for 7 days, at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 12 weeks post-intervention. All scores over the 7 days will be averaged to produce an aggregate fatigue intensity score. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue intensity. Change in fatigue intensity between baseline and 12 weeks will be compared between the 3 treatment groups.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Fatigability as assessed by the self-reported fatigue intensity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score and physical activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigability will be assessed using a wearable monitor, the PRO-Diary (CamNtech) - a wrist-worn accelerometer-based activity monitor which also contains a self-report user interface.
The fatigability score will be calculated as the ratio of the self-reported fatigue intensity rating (using a 0-10 numerical rating score) divided by the participant's concurrent physical activity level (measured as the average number of activity counts per minute). All fatigability scores will be averaged over the 7 days to create an aggregate fatigability score. Higher scores indicate greater fatigability. Change in fatigability between baseline and 12 weeks will be compared between the 3 treatment groups.</description>

    <description>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a behavioral-based treatment that promotes effective self-management skills, including adaptive thought processes and behaviors (i.e. &quot;coping skills&quot;). CBT also commonly teaches goal-setting and behavioral activation strategies for engaging in physical, social, and other valued activities in the context of fatigue.</description>

    <description>Modafinil is a safe, well-tolerated and effective wake-promoting agent (oral medication) that is FDA-approved for the treatment of fatigue related to sleep disorders. Modafinil is also one of the most commonly used medications for multiple sclerosis related fatigue in clinical practice, with doses ranging from 50 - 400 mg per day, in divided doses (once to twice daily).</description>
