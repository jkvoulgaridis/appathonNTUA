      This study is a phase II, multicenter, open-label study that has been designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and the safety of definitive Radiotherapy (RT) (70 Gy) delivered in combination
      with the anti-PD-L1 Durvalumab immunotherapy in patients with Human Papilloma Virus
      (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

      In this phase II trial, patients will be assigned in one of the two treatment arms:

        -  Arm A (standard arm): Chemoradiotherapy arm

        -  Arm B (Experimental arm): Immunotherapy + Radiotherapy arm

      Total duration of treatment will be 6 months (at maximum in the experimental arm).

      Patients will be followed for a maximum of 2 years following the date of randomization.
