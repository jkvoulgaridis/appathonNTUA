    <textblock>
      This study will be evaluating the safety and efficacy of propagermanium for the treatment of
      participants with DKD who are already taking irbesartan by:

        -  monitoring symptoms that participants may experience while on the study,

        -  measuring levels of protein in participant's urine and kidney function during the course
           of the study,

        -  measuring the levels of propagermanium and irbesartan that enters into participant's
           urine and blood, and

        -  comparing the propagermanium outcomes to participants' pre-study and placebo outcomes.

      Eligible participants will randomly be assigned to one of two arms to receive both the
      propagermanium and placebo in different orders as follows, either:

      Treatment Period 1 taking a propagermanium capsule twice a day for 12 weeks, followed by a
      six week washout period followed by Treatment Period 2 taking a placebo capsule twice a day
      for 12 weeks.

      OR Treatment Period 1 taking a placebo capsule twice a day for 12 weeks, followed by a six
      week washout period followed by Treatment Period 2 taking a propagermanium capsule twice a
      day for 12 weeks.

          6. Patients can be on stable doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,
             aldosterone inhibitors, and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors. However,
             the dose and regimen must be stable for 3 months prior to screening and must have no
             plan to change treatment regime throughout the study;

          7. Mean of two albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) values (screening and baseline) of more

                  used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception
                  or hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of
                  amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);
