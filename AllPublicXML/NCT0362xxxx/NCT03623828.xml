  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Patients who survive severe brain injury may develop chronic disorders of consciousness.
      Treating these patients to improve recovery is extremely challenging because of scarce and
      inefficient therapeutical options.

      Among pharmacological treatments, apomorphine, a potent direct dopamine agonist, has
      exhibited promising behavioral effects, but its true efficacy and its mechanism remains
      unknown. This pilot study aims to verify the effects of apomorphine subcutaneous infusion in
      patients with disorders of consciousness, investigate the neural networks targeted by this
      treatment and evaluate the feasibility of a larger double-blind randomized placebo-controlled
      trial.

      Methods/design:

      This study is a prospective open-label pilot clinical trial. Six patients diagnosed with
      disorders of consciousness will be included to receive a 4-weeks regimen of daily
      subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine hydrochloride. Patients will be monitored for four
      weeks before the initiation of the therapy, closely during treatment and they will undergo a
      4-weeks inpatient follow-up after washout, as well as a two-year long-term remote follow-up.
      Shortly before and after the treatment regimen, the subjects will receive a multimodal
      assessment battery including neuroimaging exams.

      Primary outcome will be determined as behavioral response to treatment as measured by changes
      of diagnosis using the Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R), while secondary outcome
      measures will include the Nociception Coma Scale - Revised (NCS-R, circadian rhythm
      modifications using actimetry, core body temperature recording and night
      electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), resting-state high-density
      EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended
      (GOS-E) and a phone-adapted version of the CRS-R will be used for long-term follow-up.

      Statistical analyses will focus on the detection of changes induced by apomorphine treatment
      at the individual level (comparing data before and after treatment) and at the group level
      (comparing responders with non-responders). Response to treatment will be measured at four
      different levels: 1. behavioral response (CRS-R, NCS-E, GOS-E), 2. brain metabolism (PET), 3.
      network connectivity (resting-state fMRI and high-density EEG) and 4. Circadian rhythm
      changes (actimetry, body temperature, night EEG).

      Discussion:

      Apomorphine is a promising and safe candidate for the treatment of disorders of consciousness
      but its efficacy, the profile of the responding population and its underlying mechanism
      remain to be determined. This pilot study will provide unprecedented data that will allow to
      investigate the response to apomorphine using multimodal methods and shed new light on the
      brain networks targeted by this drug in terms of metabolism, functional connectivity and
      behavioral response. The investigators aim to better define the phenotype of potential
      responders to identify them more easily and develop personalized patient management. This
      preliminary study will lay ground for a subsequent larger-scale placebo-controlled
      double-blind trial which will provide quantitative data on effect size controlled for
      spontaneous recovery.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 90 days (10x before treatment, 6x during treatment and 5x after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CRS-R is a standardized validated neurobehavioral scale designed to assess patients with disorders of consciousness. It is divided in 6 subscales: Auditory Function (0-4 points), Visual Function (0-5 points), Motor Function (0-6 points), Oromotor/Verbal Function (0-3 points), Communication (0-2 points), Arousal (0-3 points). The subscores are summed to calculate a total score ranging from 0 to 23 points. Higher scores indicate better functions. More importantly, it provides the patient's diagnosis (coma, UWS, MCS-, MCS+, EMCS) based on the presence of specific items in different subscales (regardless of total score). Analyses will look for changes of diagnosis, changes of total score and changes of each subscore before, during and after apomorphine treatment.</description>

    <description>The NCS-R is a standardized validated scale designed to assess the perception of pain in patients with disorders of consciousness unable to functionally communicate. It is divided in 3 subscales: Motor Response (0-3 points), Verbal Response (0-3 points) and Facial Expression (0-3 points). The subscores are summed to calculate a total score ranging from 0 to 9 points. Higher scores indicate a higher perception of pain. Analyses will look for changes of total score and changes of each subscore before, during and after apomorphine treatment.</description>

    <description>The GOS-E is a standardized validated scale designed to assess the the functional outcome of patients with disorders of consciousness. It is a single score ranging from 1 (dead) to 8 (upper good recovery). Higher scores indicate a higher functional recovery. It will be performed remotely by telephone contact with the patient or their relatives.
Analyses will look at differences in GOS-E score between responders and non-responders to apomorphine treatment, as well as differences in time within individual patients.</description>

    <time_frame>from 6 months post-treatment up to 24 months post-treatment (1x at 6 months, 1x at 12 months, 1x at 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The phone-adapted CRS-R is a scale designed to assess remotely patients with disorders of consciousness. Unlike the CRS-R, it does not comprise subcores or a total score, but provides the clinical diagnosis of the patient (coma, UWS, MCS-, MCS+, EMCS) using the same diagnostic items as the CRS-R.
Analyses will look at differences in Phone-adapted CRS-R diagnosis between responders and non-responders to apomorphine treatment, as well as differences in time within individual patients.</description>
