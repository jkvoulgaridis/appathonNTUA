  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study included 53 patients admitted to the intensive care unit
      (ICU), with an average age of 69 years, without neurologic disorder before initiation of a
      continuous piperacillin infusion at the standard dose and who underwent piperacillin serum
      concentration monitoring. Among them, 23 developed a neurologic disorder for which the
      piperacillin causality was chronologically and semiologically suggestive. A concentration
      threshold of 157.2 mg/liter independently predicted neurotoxicity with 96.7% specificity and
      52.2% sensitivity and may constitute a limitation when targeting less susceptible pathogens.

      This retrospective cohort study included 53 patients admitted to the intensive care unit
      (ICU), with an average age of 69 years, without neurologic disorder before initiation of a
      continuous piperacillin infusion at the standard dose and who underwent piperacillin serum
      concentration monitoring. The patients included consisted of adults who received continuous
      intravenous (i.v.) infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam at the standard dose adjusted to the
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease
      (MDRD) formula (12 or 16 g/24 h for an estimated GFR [eGFR] of &gt; 40 ml/liter/min/1.73 m2, 12
      g/24 h for an eGFR of &gt; 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 8 g/24h for an eGFR of &lt;20 ml/min/1.73 m2) and
      who underwent monitoring of the piperacillin serum concentration over a 22-month period. The
      total serum concentration of piperacillin was measured after at least 48 h of treatment by a
      validated method combining high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array
      detection.

      Among them, 23 developed a neurologic disorder for which the piperacillin causality was
      chronologically and semiologically suggestive. A concentration threshold of 157.2 mg/liter
      independently predicted neurotoxicity with 96.7% specificity and 52.2% sensitivity and may
      constitute a limitation when targeting less susceptible pathogens.

    <description>The main objective of the study is to measure the incidence of neurological problems attributable to the use of 7 beta-lactams commonly used in intensive care: amoxicillin, piperacillin, cloxacillin, cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and to determine for the molecules studied the serum concentration value as being statistically associated with an increase in neurotoxic risk.</description>
