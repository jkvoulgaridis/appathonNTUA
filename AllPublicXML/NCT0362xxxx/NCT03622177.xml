  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin33 organize local immune reactions, especially at epithelial barriers.

      ST2 is the IL33 receptor. The sST2 rate is higher for patient living with HIV and is an
      independent predictable factor of mortality. Interleukin33 induce tissue Treg ST2+
      lymphocytes proliferation and amphireguline production. Amphireguline is member of epithelial
      growth factors family, which contributes to tissue repair, and fibrose. Amphireguline also
      helps immunosuppressives functions. Targetting amphiregulin for people living with HIV who
      has poor restauration of LTCD4+ could be a future therapy.
