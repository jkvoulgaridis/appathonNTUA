  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a mealtime intervention in respite care
      centers for people with dementia and their caregivers. Mealtimes become more challenging as
      dementia progresses causing nutritional and behavioral issues in the affected individuals.
      Using a train-the-trainer program built on the Partners at Meals model, volunteers in respite
      centers partner with caregivers and develop a mealtime plan that builds on the strengths of
      the person with dementia, and develop a supportive environment for change. A tele-health
      component is involved in the communication between the respite center volunteers/staff and
      families. Recruitment is limited to people attending the particular respite centers.

      The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a mealtime intervention (Partners at Meals)
      in respite care centers (RCCs) that provide a social model of care for people with dementia
      living in the community and support for their caregivers. Largely staffed by long-time
      volunteers, these centers support caregivers' ability to maintain their loved one in the
      home. Traditionally, support for social activities and mealtime offered by the RCCs cannot be
      extended to home. In this project, we will use a telehealth interface to provide consultation
      to family caregivers in the context of home where problems arise.

      Outcomes include improvements in: a) quality of life (QOL) and nutritional outcomes for
      people with dementia (PWD) and QOL outcomes for family caregivers (CGs); b) self-efficacy
      training outcomes for assessing and managing meals for the CGs and the RCC volunteers; and c)
      sustainability outcomes as determined by directors of the RCCs. Two large RCCs with a total
      of 5 sites of care in suburban and rural areas of SC will be the sites of this project.

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized cluster-design trial will be conducted in two large respite care centers (RCCs) with five sites that serve primarily white and African American persons with dementia. RCCs will be randomized to the intervention condition (Partners at Meals; 3 sites) or ['enhanced usual care' (EUC)] (2 sites). The primary unit of analysis is the person with dementia (PWD) and caregiver (CG): 60 PWDs, 60 CGs will be enrolled; it is estimated that up to 60 volunteers/staff/managers may be enrolled. The caregivers and RCC volunteer is another dyad for analysis, as is the RCC volunteer and the PWD. Additionally, RCC Managers at both PaM and EUC sites will be interviewed regarding barriers to implementation, ways to enhance the project, and possible causes of discharge of PWD from the study related to nutritional problems.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>People with dementia (PWD) often lose weight and suffer subsequent health issues: the goal of this intervention is to improve or maintain weight of a PWD, and to improve or maintain food intake. A train-the-trainer intervention is used with volunteers in Respite Care Centers who partner with family caregivers of PWD. Designed to be personalized to the PWD and focusing on his/her existing strengths and compensating for his/her deficits in mealtime management, sessions occur initially (1 hr) and every month (~30 mins) to reinforce key areas of behavioral or environmental change. Samsung tablets are used initially and then monthly (x5) to record mealtimes in the home, and are reviewed by the volunteer with the family member at the monthly session to discuss areas where changes could be made.</description>

    <description>In the non-treatment respite care centers, an Enhanced Usual Condition will be delivered to caregivers of People with Dementia (PWD). This program consists of enhanced training in caregiving using components from a module of the evidence-based Savvy Caregiver program (K. Hepburn) given in a group setting with opportunity for a question and answer period; the program is given for new enrollees and every 6 months. The PI (EJA), the nutritionist (KM) or the Program Manager (MCP) will lead these groups. Weight of the PWD is measured initially and monthly (x5); amount of food consumed will be measured using the Samsung tablets, also initially and monthly (x5).</description>

    <description>The focus of the intervention is to facilitate meals using knowledge of the person with dementia's past history and lifelong preferences as well as their stage of disease, altering the behavior of the caregiver at meals to ameliorate dysfunctional behaviors, and altering the environment to make it more focused on the process of meals.</description>

    <description>Enhanced Usual Condition (EUC) Staff and volunteers at the EUC sites will receive training in communication between family and friends of the person with dementia. Following the general model of the Savvy Caregiver (Hepburn), communication training will occur every six months in these two sites. Families will be trained by project staff to record three meals including behavior at home each month. The Project Manager will attend the monthly support group for family members about communication. The administrator of the EUC RCC will be interviewed every 6 months the project is in place.</description>
