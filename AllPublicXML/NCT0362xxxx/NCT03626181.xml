    <textblock>
      This study investigates the brain-based biomarkers of treatment response to accelerated theta
      burst stimulation (aTBS) in patients with Major Depressive Disorder resistant to
      pharmacological treatment(MDD) in an open label design.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a newer form of rTMS which requires less stimulation time
      and produces longer lasting post-stimulation effects in the cerebral cortex (4). It has been
      shown to be effective in inducing synaptic plasticity and has similar or better efficacy in
      treating depression compared to rTMS (4).Newer accelerated TBS (aTBS) protocols that condense
      stimulation sessions down to several days rather than weeks have shown similar response rates
      when compared to prolonged TBS protocols, also with similar tolerability and safety. In order
      to develop aTBS as an effective treatment for MDD, future research should focus on
      identification of reliable predictors for better outcome to TBS. The main objectives were: 1)
      To directly compare multiple different brain-based measures (neuroimaging and
      electrophysiology) to identify which has the most power in accurately predicting response to
      TBS compared to sham. 2) To track both short and long-term longitudinal electrophysiological
      (EEG) changes related to the therapeutic effects of TBS.

    <description>Participants will receive bilateral TBS, 5 times daily (15 minutes between), over 5 consecutive days (25 sessions total). In each session they will receive intermittent TBS (iTBS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), followed by continuous TBS (cTBS) over right DLPFC. Stimulation sites will be targeted with the Localite neuronavigation system and Visor2 software, and according to Talairach coordinates in relation to individual MRIs. Intensity will be standardized at 120% of RMT.
The MagPro stimulator will deliver iTBS over left DLPFC with 1620 pulses in 54 triplet bursts (5Hz) with train duration of 2 seconds, and intertrain interval of 8 seconds. cTBS over right DLPFC will consist of 1620 pulses in 54 triplet bursts, train duration of 2 seconds, with no intertrain interval.</description>
