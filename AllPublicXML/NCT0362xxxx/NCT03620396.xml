    <textblock>
      This study is intended to measure serum trefoil factor 3 at baseline and 3 months after,
      following nonsurgical periodontal therapy in patients with Gingivitis and Chronic
      Periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A goal of periodontal diagnostic procedure is to provide useful information to the clinician
      regarding the present periodontal disease type and severity. Advances in diagnostic research
      are moving towards methods where periodontal risk can be identified and quantified by
      objective measures such as Biomarkers.

      Trefoil factors (TFFs) are one such secreted molecules derived from mucin producing
      epithelial cells of the gastro intestinal tracts and other tissues such as Salivary glands,
      Parotid ducts and oral mucosa. Among three Trefoil factors reported, Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3)
      is the modifying factor for signalling pathway involved in cell survival, cell proliferation
      and cell migration of oral keratinocytes. Hence assessing the marker levels would achieve
      beneficial effects on diagnosing the disease severity.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be equally divided into two test groups.Group A consists of Gingivitis patients and Group B consists of Periodontitis patients. Both the group patients have been evaluated for Serum Trefoil factor 3 at baseline and treated with non surgical periodontal therapy. After three months both the group patients were again assessed for serum trefoil factor 3.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected by venepuncture of anti-cubital vein. 2ml of blood was collected in each test tube. 10 minutes after collection, the test tube containing 2ml blood was subjected to centrifugation at 3000rpm for 10 min. The supernatant straw colored fluid (serum) was separated into storage vials (Eppendorf tubes) for serum Trefoil Factor 3.</description>

    <description>The severity of gingivitis is scored on all surfaces of selected teeth using Williams Periodontal probe.
Index teeth- 16, 12, 24, 36, 32, 44. Score around each tooth is totalled and divided by 4-score of tooth. 0.1-1.0: Mild gingivitis. 1.1-2.0:Moderate gingivitis 2.1-3.0:Severe gingivitis</description>
