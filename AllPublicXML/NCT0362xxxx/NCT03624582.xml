  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to quantify the decision-making process and underlying
      biases around leisure activity behaviors using the Activity Preference Assessment (APA), a
      novel psychological task. The investigators plan to validate the APA against objectively
      measured sedentary and physical activity time, and examine its potential to predict
      health-related outcomes in children and adolescents. The Shape Up Kids Fitness Ancillary
      protocol will add exercise testing, cognitive and behavioral measures, accelerometry, and
      questionnaires to the existing Shape Up Kids primary study dataset.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will enroll 60 boys and girls (50% female) between the ages of 8-17 years
      into this pilot and feasibility ancillary study. The aims of this study are to validate and
      test the reliability of the Activity Preference Assessment (APA), as described below.

      Aim 1: To examine the convergent validity of the APA against habitual physical and sedentary
      activity time measured objectively by seven days of accelerometry, as well as leisure
      activity choices during a 30-minute free-choice play period.

      Aim 2: To examine the criterion validity of the APA against concurrent measures of body
      composition, cardiometabolic health indicators, aerobic fitness, and physical strength.

      Aim 3: To measure the test-retest reliability of APA outcomes through repeated measures
      separated by approximately one week.

      Exploratory Aim: To investigate patterns or clusters of activity preferences through
      exploratory factor analysis of activity liking VAS scores.
