  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized assessor-blind controlled trial. A total of 1,100 women with PCOS
      will be recruited from 28 hospitals and randomly allocated into four groups: personalized
      acupuncture, fixed acupuncture, letrozole or placebo letrozole. Patients will receive
      treatment for 16 weeks and the primary outcome is live birth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) usually involves syndrome and disease differentiation, and
      for acupuncture selection of appropriate points and skillful needling techniques. Many
      clinical trials on acupuncture used fixed acupuncture protocols without accounting for
      individual differences. We here design a multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      whether personalized or fixed acupuncture increases the likelihood of live births for
      infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with letrozole or placebo
      letrozole. We hypothesis that letrozole is more effective than personalized acupuncture and
      that personalized acupuncture is more effective than standardized acupuncture, which is more
      effective than placebo letrozole.

               5. Patients with known heart disease that is likely to be exacerbated by pregnancy.

               6. Patients with a history of, or suspected cervical carcinoma, endometrial

                  drinks/week or binge drinking.

               8. Patients enrolled into other investigative studies that require medications,
                  prescribe the study medications, limit intercourse, or otherwise prevent
                  compliance with the protocol.

              11. Couples with previous sterilization procedures (vasectomy, tubal ligation), which
                  have been reversed. The prior procedure may affect study outcomes, and patients
                  with both a reversed sterilization procedure and PCOS are rare enough that
                  exclusion should not adversely affect recruitment.

              12. Subjects who have undergone a bariatric surgery procedure in the recent past (&lt;
                  12 months) and are in a period of acute weight loss or have been advised against
