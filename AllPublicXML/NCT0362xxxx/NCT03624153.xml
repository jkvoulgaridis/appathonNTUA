    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the EMG-driven exoskeleton hand
      robotic training device on upper extremity motor and physiological function, daily functions,
      quality of life and self-efficacy in brain injury patients.

    <textblock>
      In the Robot-assisted group, participants receive training including passive movement, active
      movement, and game practices.

      Let's see the operation of the robot system by video. First, the passive movement. Patients
      could perform a movement of full hand, or thumb/second/middle finger together.

      Second, the active movement. There were three types of active movement, including full hand
      grasp/ release/ or grasp and release together.

      The researcher chose two out of three of the movements. Third, the game mode. There were
      several games to practice the active movement, including only distal part/ or distal plus
      proximal part together.

      In the Conventional group, participants receive conventional occupational therapy.

      The intervention was conducted 1.5 hour a day, 3 days a week for consecutive 4 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Fugl-Myer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The UE-FMA subscale will be used to assess the sensorimotor impairment level of UE in patients after stroke. The UE-FMA contains 33 movements with a score range from 0 to 66. A higher UE-FMA score indicates less impairment of the paretic limb. The validity and reliability of FMA is good to excellent.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly administered psychometric screening assessment of cognitive functioning. The MMSE is used to screen patients for cognitive impairment, track changes in cognitive functioning over time, and often to assess the effects of therapeutic agents on cognitive function. The total score of MMSE ranged from 0 to 30. Higher values represent a better cognitive functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Jamar hand dynamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Jamar hand dynamometer is the most widely cited in the literature and accepted as the gold standard by which other dynamometers are evaluated. Excellent concurrent validity of the Jamar hand dynamometer is reported. The Jamar hand dynamometer measure the grip-strength. The norm of healthy male aged 18 to 75 years is from 64.8 lb to 121.8 lb, while the norm of healthy female aged 18 to 75 years is from 41.5 lb to 78.7 lb. Higher value represent a greater grip-strength.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS is a 6-point ordinal scale that measures muscle spasticity in patients with brain lesions. Higher score indicates higher muscle tone. Investigators will assess the MAS scores of UE muscles, including biceps, triceps, wrist flexors and extensors, and finger flexors and extensors. The validity and reliability of MAS for patients with stroke were established to be adequate to good.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of stroke self-efficacy questionnaire (SSEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>the Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SSEQ) , a questionnaire developed to measure the most relevant self-efficacy and self-management domains specific to the stroke population. It contains 13 items that are rated on a 0 - 10 scale, with higher scores indicating greater levels of self-efficacy. Questionnaire includes a range of relevant functional tasks such as walking, getting comfortable in bed, as well as some self-management tasks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT is a reliable method to evaluate the UE motor ability in patients after stroke. The WMFT contains 15 function-based tasks and 2 strength-based tasks. The time (WMFT-time) and the functional ability (WMFT-quality) for an individual to complete the tasks will be recorded. A shorter WMFT-time and a larger WMFT-quality score indicate a faster movement and better quality of movement, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Motor Activity Log (MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The MAL will be used to assess the amount of use (AOU) and quality of movement (QOM) of the paretic UE. The MAL is a semi-structured interview that tests object manipulation and gross motor activities of daily living. The psychometric properties of MAL have been well-established, and a higher MAL score indicates better movement quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) evaluates 19 tests of arm motor function, both distally and proximally. Each test is given an ordinal score of 0, 1, 2, or 3, with higher values indicating better arm motor status. The total ARAT score is the sum of the 19 tests, and thus the maximum score is 57.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 4 weeks immediately after the completion of intervention, and change from 4 weeks up immediately after the completion of intervention up to 1 months after the completion of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a ﬁve-dimensional health state classiﬁcation. The ﬁve dimensions are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. These ﬁve dimensions are each assessed by a single question on a three point ordinal scale (no problems, some problems, extreme problems).</description>
