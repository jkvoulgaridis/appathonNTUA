  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sporty performance exhibited by an athlete faces physiological, biomechanical and
      psychological activity of the athlete. It depends on both the psychological state and the
      elevation of the musculoskeletal system to a certain level so that the athlete can perform
      optimally and excellently. For this reason, we aimed to evaluate the musculoskeletal system
      pain of amateur and professional athletes in different disciplines and the psychosocial
      states such as sports confidence, depression and quality of life.

      This study consists of 80 amateur and 80 professional sportsmen who are participating in
      sports by doing sports in soccer, basketball, volleyball, athletics, table tennis, field
      tennis, folk dances, kickboxing and archery branches between the ages of 15 and 36. The
      Expanded Scandinavian Muscle Skeleton Questionnaire (NMQ) and Visible Analogue Scale (VAS)
      will be used to identify and assess the symptoms of musculoskeletal discomfort as 'pain'. The
      participant will be evaluated with the algometer, the sporty trust will be questioned with
      the Sporty Trust Continuous Inventory, and the Quality of Life will be assessed with the
      World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Short Form and Depression will be evaluated
      with Beck Depression Inventory.
