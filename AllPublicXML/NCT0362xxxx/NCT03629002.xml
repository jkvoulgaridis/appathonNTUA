  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to propose a comprehensive analysis of the biological properties of
      the stromal vascular fraction evaluated in the SCLERADEC 2 clinical trial (n = 15 available)
      and preserved in the biological collection, compared to healthy donors (n = 10). This
      characterization will focus on the exploration of the phenotypic and functional
      characteristics of the main cellular subpopulations present in the stromal vascular fraction
      of scleroderma patients likely to be associated with a better regenerative vascular or
      anti-fibrotic activity of the cell therapy product.

      The main objective will be to validate whether the supposed mechanism of action of this
      innovative therapy, in relation to the representativity of the endothelial progenitors,
      carrying the vascular regeneration activity, is preserved in the sclerodermic context.

      A total of 30 subjects (20 systemic Scleroderma patients and 10 healthy donors) will be
      included.
