  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Arterial Hypertension (SAH) is a disease with a high prevalence in Mexico and
      worldwide. SAH is associated with an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,
      causing cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure (HF), as well as chronic kidney disease
      (CKD). Several of the physiopathological mechanisms observed are: the increase in cardiac
      output, central aortic pressure (CAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and peripheral vascular
      resistance (PVR), which leads to the generation of damage to the target organ. The
      identification not only of the peripheral arterial pressure, but also of these hemodynamic
      parameters and arterial stiffness would allow a better cardiovascular characterization of the
      patients. However, the measurements of hemodynamic parameters and arterial stiffness can vary
      during the 24 hours from individual to individual by all known mechanisms involved in the
      regulation of blood pressure such as cortisol, central nervous system, the peripheral nervous
      system, along with the renin angiotensin and aldosterone system, which are usually only
      measured in a single moment. Generally, the choice of drug in a patient with SAH is based
      only on the values of peripheral blood pressure at the time of the measurement. The use of
      oscillometric equipment such as the Mobil-O-Graph 24 allows to the investigators to know the
      hemodynamic and arterial stiffness behavior during 24 hours; therefore, this could favor the
      choice of the most appropriate antihypertensive drug, dose and administration time. The use
      of angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA II) At1 blockers such as losartan and calcium
      channel blockers (CCB) for instance amlodipine have shown a reduction in CAP and peripheral
      blood pressure respectively in patients with SAH. The most prescribed drugs in health units
      worldwide are enalapril, amlodipine, losartan and atenolol, of which the most used
      combination is losartan with amlodipine. There are no studies to date that allow
      investigators to identify the effect of the administration of losartan / amlodipine in a
      fixed combination form on the hemodynamic parameters and arterial stiffness of patients with
      SAH. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of this fixed
      combination versus losartan on hemodynamic and arterial stiffness parameters based on the
      behavior of these for 24 hours.

      In the present investigation the investigators expect to know the effect of the
      administration of losartan / amlodipine in fixed combination versus losartan on hemodynamic
      parameters and arterial stiffness in patients with arterial hypertension grade 1 and 2. For
      this purpose the investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized trial, each group will
      be compose by 14 male and female patients, 40-65 years old, with hypertension, neither with
      diabetes nor being under triple pharmacological therapy. Randomization will determine who
      will receive the intervention during an 8- week trial (losartan/amlodipine in fixed
      combination capsule, 100mg/5mg 1 time daily or losartan capsule 100mg 1 time daily). The
      clinical findings and laboratory tests include a metabolic profile and biosafety, which will
      be at baseline and by the 8th week . Body weight, body fat, body mass index (BMI) and blood
      pressure will be determined during the initial and final visit, in addition to hemodynamics
      parameters of arterial stiffness like cardiac output, central aortic pressure (CAP), pulse
      wave velocity (PWV) and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) by an oscillometric monitoring
      system via Mobil-O -Graph® 24. Adverse events and adherence to treatment will be documented.
      Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon exact test. It is considered with
      significance at p&lt;0.05.
