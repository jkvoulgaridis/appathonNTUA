  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the hidden blood loss in patients who
      undergo laparoendoscopic single-site radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and
      identity its risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The electronic medical data of 105 patients who undergo laparoendoscopic single-site radical
      hysterectomy in the following year to treat cervical cancer will be analyzed retrospectively
      in this study. The amount of hidden blood loss will be calculated according to Gross's
      formula. And multiple linear regression analysis will be employed to identify its risk
      factors.

        The planned sample size was based on data from a previous study, in which the standard
        deviation was 5. We assumed an one-tailed Î± error of 0.05 and a sampling error of 1.0. we
        propose to enroll 105 participants and allow for a dropout rate of 10% for an effective
        sample size of 100.
