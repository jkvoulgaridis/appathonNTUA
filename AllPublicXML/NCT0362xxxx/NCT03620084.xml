  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) is associated with the development of
      swallowing difficulties, or dysphagia. Dysphagia has profound negative effects on the health,
      nutritional status, and quality of life of HNC survivors. It also puts them at risk of
      developing life-threatening aspiration pneumonia. Radiation-associated dysphagia can be
      intractable and not responsive to conventional dysphagia therapy. HNC survivors with chronic
      severe dysphagia may be dependent on long-term tube feeding.

      Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) is a low-cost, device-driven therapy. It has been
      studied as an approach to simultaneously improve cough and swallowing functions. During EMST,
      patients forcefully expire into a one-way spring-loaded valve to strengthen expiratory and
      submental musculature. The EMST-150 device is available for clinical use in Singapore. In
      other research studies, it has been shown to improve cough and swallowing in several
      populations of people with chronic dysphagia, most recently in people with chronic
      radiation-associated dysphagia.

      The investigators propose to study the effect of EMST using the EMST-150 device on cough,
      airway protection, and swallowing functions of HNC survivors with radiation-associated
      dysphagia.

      The investigators will recruit 40 participants to undergo an 8-week EMST programme, with
      weekly follow-up to calibrate their EMST device. It is hypothesised that EMST will improve
      participants' respiratory and swallowing functions. Respiratory function improvement will be
      shown by increased maximum expiratory pressure and improved cough airflow measures.
      Swallowing function improvement will be evidenced by reduced aspiration or improved ability
      to clear aspirated material during videofluoroscopic swallow studies. The investigators also
      hypothesize carryover effects on other aspects of swallowing, such as improved hyoid and
      laryngeal excursions, and improved laryngeal vestibule closure.

      With the results of this study, the investigators aim to develop better evidence-based
      rehabilitation programmes for HNC survivors, and those living with chronic dysphagia.

    <description>Participants will be taught how to use the EMST-150 device. The device has a one-way spring-loaded valve calibrated at different resistances that the user can select. The valve will open when expiratory pressure exceeds the threshold set by the user on the device. This threshold is set at 75% of the individual's maximum expiratory pressure for the session.</description>

        Patients who have &quot;perforated tympanic membrane&quot;, &quot;history of spontaneous pneumothorax&quot; and
        &quot;history of collapsed lung&quot;, will be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on the
