  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out in 88 children with severe early childhood caries (dmfs≥age +1) who
      were referred to the investigators' clinic. Patients who completed dental treatment under
      general anesthesia in a single session, were included to the study.

      Patients were divided randomly into 4 groups and after dental treatment one of the fluoride
      varnish listed below was applied to each child. The groups were as follows;

        1. Duraphat varnish containing 5% Sodium Fluoride (Colgate) (n = 22),

        2. Clinpro ™ White Varnish containing 5% of Sodium Fluoride tricalcium phosphate (3M ESPE)
           (n = 22),

        3. Embrace ™ Varnish containing 5% Sodium Fluoride with CXP ™ (Pulpdent) (n = 22),

        4. MI Varnish containing 5% Sodium Fluoride casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium
           phosphate varnish (GC) (n = 22).

      Saliva Mutans streptococci (MS) and Lactobacilli (LB) levels, were evaluated by taking saliva
      samples before general anaesthesia; one month after treatment and three months after
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duraphat (Colgate), which we used as a positive control group in our study, contains only 5%
      sodium fluoride. It has been reported in studies that Duraphat is effective in
      remineralization.

      Clinpro ™ White Varnish, another topical varnish in this study,was reported to be effective
      for caries prevention in pre-school children.

      One of the varnishes we evaluate in the study, Embrace™ Varnish, contains 5% sodium fluoride
      with xylitol-coated calcium and phosphate. According to the manufacturer, the xylitol coating
      prevents the calcium and phosphate salts from reacting until they come in contact with
      saliva. Saliva dissolves the xylitol and releases the calcium and phosphate ions, which react
      with the fluoride ions in saliva to form protective fluorapatite on the teeth19 MI Varnish,
      in the fourth group containing 5% sodium fluoride with casein phosphopeptide amorphous
      calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) had a high release of calcium and fluoride ions.
