  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the present RCT, the investigators aimed at finding an optimal protocol for the
      neurorehabilitation of chronic post-stroke aphasia by combining two promising methods, ILAT
      (Intensive language action therapy) and 1-Hz rTMS to the right-hemispheric homologue of the
      anterior language area of Broca (pars triangularis), thus taking advantage of recent research
      in speech and language sciences, neurorehabilitation and brain research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New neuromodulation technologies, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), are
      promising tools for neurorehabilitation, aphasia therapy included. Combined with behavioral
      techniques, Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT), TMS could substantially amplify the
      beneficial effect of such behavioral therapy alone.

      In this randomized study of 17 subjects with post-stroke aphasia in the chronic stage will be
      studied the combined effect of ILAT and 1-Hz placebo-controlled navigated repetitive TMS
      (rTMS) to the right-hemispheric inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis). Participant will
      be randomized to groups A and B. Participants in group A will receive a 2-week period of rTMS
      during naming training where they name pictures every ten second displayed on the screen,
      followed by 2-weeks of rTMS and naming combined with ILAT. Those in group B will receive the
      same behavioral therapy but TMS is replaced by sham stimulation.

      Language performance will be measured before, during and after the interventions for 3
      months.

    <description>ILAT includes communicative language games played in an interactive small-group setting. Three persons with aphasia and one therapist sit around a table and have picture cards in front of them. The card sets include two items of each object or action picture. All participants take turns in making verbal requests. There will be 5 daily sessions (3 hours per session) for two weeks.</description>
