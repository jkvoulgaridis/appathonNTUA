  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled clinical trial will test a combined group contact plus mobile
      CBT-informed skills training intervention targeting defeatist attitudes in consumers with
      schizophrenia in comparison to a supportive contact control group in order to change
      motivational negative symptoms linked to defeatist attitudes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this project is to determine if mCBTn at the optimal dose from the R61
      produces greater reduction in severity of defeatist attitudes than a supportive contact
      control group in consumers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with persistent
      moderate-to-severe experiential negative symptoms. A second aim is to determine whether
      reduction in defeatist attitudes mediates improvement in experiential negative symptoms and
      psychosocial functioning in mCBTn. The third aim is to determine whether mCBTn increases
      pupil dilation and whether changes in pupil dilation (an objective psychophysiological
      biomarker of effort) are associated with changes in defeatist attitudes and negative
      symptoms. The final aim is to explore predictors of response to mCBTn, including device use
      and group session adherence, demographics, neurocognitive impairment, and negative and other
      symptom severity at baseline.

    <measure>Defeatist performance beliefs (target mechanism) using the Defeatist Performance Attitude Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline in defeatist performance beliefs at weeks 9, 18, and 42.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure changes in defeatist performance beliefs severity using the Defeatist Performance Attitude Scale (DPAS). The DPAS is a 5-minute, 15-item self-report subscale derived from factor analysis of the commonly-used 40-item Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, which measures the tendency to overgeneralize from past failure experiences and form defeatist beliefs about the ability to perform future goal-directed tasks. Items are rated on a 1-7 Likert scale. A total score is reported with a range of 7 - 105 with higher total scores indicating more severe defeatist performance attitudes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline in negative symptoms at weeks 9, 18, and 42.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure changes in motivational negative symptoms on the CAINS. The CAINS is a 13-item interview-based assessment of negative symptoms, and each item is rated from 0 (no impairment) to 4 (severe deficit) measuring the two negative symptom factors recommended in consensus reports: Expression and Motivation and Pleasure (MAP) across social, vocational and recreational domains. Total scores for each factor are computed. The range for the MAP is 0 - 36, and the range for the Expression factor is 0 - 16. Higher scores indicate more severe negative symptoms for both factors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Birchwood Social Functioning Scale (SFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline in functioning at weeks 9, 18, and 42.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure changes in functioning on the SFS. The SFS is a self-report assessment of functioning with 7 subscales, and each item is rated from 0 to 3 with the exception of the Occupation/Employment subscale if a participant is in regular employment (scores range from 7-10 based upon type of work). The subscales and score ranges are: Social Engagement Withdrawal (0-15), Interpersonal Communication/Relationships (0-30), Prosocial Activities (0-66), Recreation (0-48), Independence-Performance (0-39), Independence-Competence (0-39), and Occupation/Employment (0-10). Higher scores indicate better functioning for all subscales.</description>

    <description>The SC intervention will provide the same amount of group and mobile device contact as the mCBTn condition. Participants will be carrying a phone but will not have access to the CBT-informed app. Group contact sessions will be semi-structured and consist of trouble-shooting device use and check-in about symptoms and potential crisis management, followed by a flexible discussion involving psychoeducation, instructions for accessing community crisis lines and related community resources, empathy, and non-directive reinforcement of health, coping, and symptom management behaviors that grow out of group discussions, with only minimal group leader guidance.</description>
