    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is the most common valvulopathy in Western countries. Cardiac EchoDoppler is
      the reference method for assessment of aortic stenosis and provides prognostic elements.
      However, it is imperfect with many inconsistencies between measures. On the other hand, the
      prognosis of patients with low flow and low gradient aortic retraction is discussed.

      The main objective of this work is to study the prognosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic
      aortic retraction.

      Aortic stenosis is an attack most often acquired from the aortic valve corresponding to a
      defect of opening of this valve. Its prevalence increases with age and approaches 2% at age
      65 and 25% at age 85 . It is in the majority of cases degenerative due to the development of
      calcifications on the aortic sigmoid valves by a process close to atherosclerosis (Otto CM,
      Circulation, 1994). It is associated with cardiovascular risk factors (age, male sex,
      smoking, high blood pressure and associated high LDL cholesterol). Aortic stenosis may also
      frequently be the consequence of aortic bicuspid (congenital) or more rarely rheumatic fever.

      Aortic stenosis is responsible for an obstacle to ejection of the left ventricle with
      increased afterload and thus left ventricular work. After a long asymptomatic period when the
      obstacle to ejection is compensated by the induction of an adaptive left ventricular
      hypertrophy, symptoms appear initially of effort (dyspnea, angina, lipothymia see syncope)
      then clinical signs of insufficiency heart. The occurrence of symptoms should cause aortic
      valve replacement because at this stage the prognosis becomes unfavorable with a risk of
      death by cardiac decompensation or sudden death.

      The two pillars of the diagnosis of severity are the evaluation of functional aortic valve
      area and the average transvalvular gradient. The tight aortic stenosis is defined for a
      functional aortic area &lt;1cm² or 0.6cm² / m² and a mean tranvular gradient&gt; 40 mmHg.

      Patient survival data and / or a possible complication or indication for surgery will be
      evaluated periodically either during a standard follow-up consultation if patients are
      followed in the referral center or by telephone contact with the attending physician or
      cardiologist. . In case of death, the cause and date will be collected.

    <description>Aortic valve stenosis (Rao) is the most common valvulopathy in Western countries. Cardiac EchoDoppler represents the reference method of evaluation of Rao and provides prognostic elements. However, it is imperfect with many inconsistencies between measures. On the other hand, the prognosis of patients with low-gradient and low-gradient Rao is discussed.) The main objective of this work is to study the prognosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. To Look for predictors of prognosis and To Evaluate the impact of comorbidities on the prognosis of RAo Evaluate operative indications and specify the short and long term outcome after surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Retrospectively, all patients examined from January 1, 2000 to November 2014 will be
             included in the echocardiography laboratory whose objective examination is a narrowing
             of the aortic valve (maximum transaortic velocity ≥2.5 m / s).

          -  Aortic stenosis may be known in the past.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal of the patient to participate in the study.

          -  Patients who have previously had aortic valve surgery before being examined in the
             echocardiography laboratory.

          -  Patients who can not be contacted or who do not respond will not be included in the
             database.
