  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial looking to determine the role of
      prophylactic treatment with topical corticosteroids in preventing recurrences in patients
      with a history of infectious epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis,endotheliitis, or
      iridocyclitis. Patients will be enrolled to one of two treatment arms: Control arm: oral
      acyclovir 400 mg BID OR valacyclovir 500 mg daily or Study arm: oral acyclovir 400 mg BID OR
      valacyclovir 500 mg qdaily + topical corticosteroid eye drops.

    <description>Topical steroid medications to be used in this study include Prednisolone acetate 1.0% or Prednisolone sodium phosphate 1%. The choice of formulation will be dependent on physician preference and medication availability. Formulations of other potencies such as Difluprednate emulsion will not be used in this study. Patients in the study arm will be started on topical corticosteroid 1 drop once a day in the affected eye.</description>
