  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effectiveness of an online Spanish
      cognitive intervention program in Latino/Hispanic Spanish-speaking subarachnoid hemorrhage
      patients. In particular, the researchers will examine whether cognitive impairments
      associated with a subarachnoid hemorrhagic event improve after completing the online
      cognitive intervention program. Secondary outcomes of the research study include examining
      whether there is an improvement in research participants' quality of life and psychological
      functioning as a result of the online Spanish cognitive intervention program.

      40 Spanish-speaking research participants who have sustained a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
      last 6 months will participate in the current research study. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: 1) Cognitive intervention group (n = 20) or 2) Control group
      (n = 20).

    <measure>Spanish Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test</measure>
    <time_frame>16 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a commonly used comprehensive verbal learning and memory test. The test consists of a 15-item word list that is presented five times. Participants are then asked to recall as many words following a brief delay and 20 minutes later. Raw scores from the following scales will be utilized: Total Recall, Short-Delayed Free Recall, Long-Delayed Free Recall, and Recognition Hits. Score values range from 0-to-15. These are considered participants' raw scores. Raw scores will then be converted to scaled scores based on available published normative data. All converted scores will be presented as scaled scores with a mean of ten and standard deviation of three in order to ensure that all scores are on a uniform scale. Scores falling at 1.5 standard deviations below the mean (scaled score ≤ 5) will be considered impaired. Scores that are above the 1.5 cut-off (scaled score ≥ 6) will be considered to be intact. Intact scores will be indicative of better memory outcomes.</description>
