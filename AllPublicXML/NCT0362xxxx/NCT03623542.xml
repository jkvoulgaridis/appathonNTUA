      Objective: To identify risk factors for the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based
      on geriatric evaluation.

      Design: Longitudinal prospective study from May 2010 to November 2011. Setting: Dedicated
      acute geriatric care unit specializing in the management of patients with dementia at the
      University Hospital of Reims, France.

      Measurements: Sociodemographic variables and comprehensive geriatric assessment were
      recorded. Occurrence of ADRs was noted. Risk factors for ADR were identified by multivariate
      logistic regression.

      Introduction: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are frequent among older subjects, and are
      actually avoidable in up to 60% of cases. There are few studies identifying the risk factors
      for ADRs based on comprehensive geriatric assessment in older subjects with dementia,
      although better identification of patients at risk could help to target patients at risk for
      increased morbidity and mortality due to ADRs with a view to taking appropriate preventive
      measures.

      Objective: To identify risk factors for the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based
      on geriatric evaluation.

      Design: Longitudinal prospective study from May 2010 to November 2011. Setting: Dedicated
      acute geriatric care unit specializing in the management of patients with dementia syndrome
      (Alzheimer disease or related syndromes) at the University Hospital of Reims, France.

      Participants: Older patients with dementia syndrome (Alzheimer disease or related syndromes).

      Measurements: Sociodemographic variables and comprehensive geriatric assessment were
      recorded. Occurrence of ADRs was noted. Risk factors for ADR were identified by multivariate
      logistic regression.
