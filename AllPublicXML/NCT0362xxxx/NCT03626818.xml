  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases (BM), occurring in 10-30% of adult cancer patients, are an important cause
      of morbidity and mortality.The prognosis of patients with BM is generally poor, with a median
      survival time of 2-6 months. Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been advocated as the
      primary treatment for metastatic brain cancer. WBRT injures small cerebral vasculature and
      neuropil,effects linked to imaging-defined white matter changes. However, information on the
      neurocognitive function(NCF) impact of WBRT in BM patients is also limited.This study aims to
      explore and evaluate the impact of NCF in patients with multiple brain metastases receiving
      WBRT.

    <description>The patients have received 10 daily fractions of 3 Gy WBRT. Following WBRT treatment, subjects were assessed at each visit for NCT according to the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised(HVLT-R),Mini-Mental Status Examination(MMSE) and Quality Of Life measurements(QOL,Questionnaire-QLQC30).These tests was administered by trained and certified nurses or clinical research associates at baseline,6th week, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th month, and every 6 months until PS&gt; 2 or intracranial tumor progression.</description>
