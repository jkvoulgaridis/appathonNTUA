      Proactive Health Support is a randomized controlled trial of telephone-based self-management

      quality of life in patients with a high risk of hospital admission.

      Participants are identified through an algorithm, that assigns each patient with a risk score
      of 0-100%. Patients with the highest risk in each of the five regions of Denmark are invited
      to participate.
