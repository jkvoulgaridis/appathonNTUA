  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancer typically undergo a surgical procedure to remove the lymph
      nodes that could contain disease on both sides of the neck. After surgery, radiotherapy is
      given (with or without chemotherapy) to the area that underwent surgery and both sides of the
      neck, even if disease was only found on one side. Giving radiotherapy to both sides of the
      neck commonly results in high rates of side effects, which in turn affects patient quality of
      life.

      There is growing evidence from some other studies that support the safety of omitting
      radiotherapy after surgery in the side of the neck with no disease. With this study, the
      investigators are hoping to justify its routine use and, if successful, the standard of care
      could be to receive radiation on only one side of the neck instead of both sides. This could
      alleviate the extent of some side effects and improve patient quality of life.

      Participants will be randomized into one of the following groups to receive radiotherapy as
      follows:

      Arm 1 (Non-experimental intervention): standard intervention: Radiotherapy to both sides of
      the neck. Treatment will begin a maximum of 8 weeks from the surgery date.

      Arm 2 (Experimental intervention): Radiotherapy to one side of the neck. Treatment will begin
      a maximum of 8 weeks from the surgery date.

    <description>The University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) modification, is a health related quality of life tool for use in head and neck cancer patients receiving RT.
The UW-QOL RTOG modification consists of 15 items with response options ranging from 10 to 50, in multiples of 10. That is, the lowest symptom burden is rated as 10, whereas the highest symptom burden is rated as 50. The individual item scores are totaled and then averaged to obtain the final score. This scoring results in a lower score indicating greater HR-QOL; and conversely, higher scores indicating lower HRQOL.</description>
