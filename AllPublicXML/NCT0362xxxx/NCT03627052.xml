             endoscopic, and histopathological evidence.

          -  Have a 3-component Mayo score of 4 to 9, which includes a modified Mayo Endoscopy
             Score (mMES) of ≥ 2 as determined by a central reader, a rectal bleeding score of ≥ 1,
             and a stool frequency score of ≥ 1.

          -  Must have failed or be intolerant to (discontinued the medication due to an adverse
             event as determined by the investigator) at least 1 of the following treatments for
             UC: Oral corticosteroids, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, biologic therapy (eg,
             infliximab, vedolizumab or adalimumab).

          -  Participants currently receiving the following treatment(s) for UC are eligible,
             provided they have been receiving acceptable and stable dose(s): oral 5-ASA or oral

             timeframes before the baseline visit or during the study: Natalizumab; anti-TNF
             therapy; Vedolizumab or any investigational anti-adhesion molecule therapy;
             Ustekinumab or any on or off label biologic therapy; interferon therapy; cyclosporine,
             mycophenolate, or tacrolimus; daily dose of oral corticosteroids ≥ 25 mg prednisone or
             equivalent; intravenous corticosteroids; rectally administered formulation of
             corticosteroids or 5-aminosalicylic acid; and AZA, 6-MP, or methotrexate.

          -  Enema treatments within 2 weeks of the baseline visit, with the exception of enema
             bowel preparations for clinical assessments.

          -  Positive stool examinations for enteric pathogens, pathogenic ova or parasites, or
             Clostridium difficile toxin at the screening visit.

          -  Other immunocompromised states and history of opportunistic infections.

             and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and adequately treated carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix.

          -  Current or recent history (within 30 days before randomization) of a clinically
             meaningful viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or mycobacterial infection.

          -  Previously received either lymphocyte apheresis or selective monocyte granulocyte
             apheresis (eg, Cellsorba) within 1 year of baseline.

          -  History of unstable ischemic heart disease or uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Positive serology test results for HIV, for hepatitis B surface antigen or core
             antibody, or for HCV antibody with detectable RNA at screening.
