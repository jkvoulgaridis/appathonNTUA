  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homelessness is associated with a multitude of negative consequences including an increased
      risk for mental health problems. Once homeless, these individuals face significant barriers
      to mental health care and are therefore less likely to receive the treatment they need.
      Mobile technology may offer a novel platform for increasing access to mental health care in
      this population. Thus, the primary goals of this pilot study are to (1) establish the
      feasibility and acceptability of delivering a brief cognitive-behavioral intervention to
      homeless youth via smartphone technology, (2) examine the extent to which brief
      cognitive-behavioral interventions delivered via mobile technology improve mental health and
      trauma-related psychological symptoms in homeless youth, and (3) establish smartphone usage
      patterns among homeless youth to inform future interventions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) to Endpoint (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be assessed based on number of coaching sessions attended over the course of the 1 month treatment period (range of 0 to 3).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment endpoint (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to report the extent to which they were satisfied with the study, the extent to which they thought the study was helpful, and whether they would recommend the study to someone else. These responses are recorded on 5-point likert type scales with higher ratings indicating higher satisfaction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) to Endpoint (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression symptoms will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The range is from 0-27. Higher values represent worse depression symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) to Endpoint (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms will be assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). The range is from 0-80. Higher values represent worse PTSD symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) to Endpoint (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Ability to regulate emotion will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Range is from 36 to 180. Higher scores suggest greater problems with emotion regulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) to Endpoint (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Current symptoms of anxiety will be assessed using the State Anxiety scale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Scores range from 20 to 80. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Risky sexual behavior and substance use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) to Endpoint (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Risky sexual behaviors and substance use will be assessed using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Survey (2011).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of treatment components</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the treatment period, participants will rate the extent to which they liked each of the different treatment components (coaching sessions, text messages, apps, tips). Participants will also be asked to report the extent to which they used the skills that they learned in the coaching sessions.</description>
