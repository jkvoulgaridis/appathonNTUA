  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of low dose of ticagrelor therapy for Chinese
      unstable angina patients treated with non-urgent coronary stent implantation, to examine
      whether lower dose ticagrelor (45 mg twice-daily) is not inferior to standard dose (90 mg
      twice-daily) for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events,
      as well as will reduce the incidence of bleeding during long-term treatment.

      This is a prospective, single center, randomized, parallel-group trial designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of low dose ticagrelor on a background of aspirin for patients
      treated with non-urgent coronary stent implantation. 2036 subjects will be enrolled. All
      patients will receive treatment with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor for 3 months after the
      index procedure. At 3 months, eligible patients were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive a standard dose ticagrelor 90 mg bid or a lower dose ticagrelor 45 mg bid in addition
      to aspirin 100mg. The primary efficacy end points are the event rate of the composite of
      cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, coronary
      revascularization and stroke at 24 months. The primary safety end point is the incidence of
      PLATO major bleeding at 24 months.
