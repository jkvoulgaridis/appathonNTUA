  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ESSURE device is a method of permanent contraception, marketed in France since 2005.
      Multiple side effects have been reported by patients since 2015 and the marketing was stopped
      in 2017. For several months it was observed an increase in requests for withdrawal of these
      devices. The principal objective of this study is to evaluate clinical improvement and
      quality of life after ESSURE removal.

      This is a multicenter retrospective descriptive study involving the gynecology department of
      the Croix Rousse Hospital and the gynecology department of the Lyon Sud Hospital over a
      period of 1 year (1 January 2017-31 December 2017).

    <description>This evaluation will be carried out thanks to a questionnaire. The 4th question retrospectively identifies the symptoms presented by patients. The proposed list of symptoms was established by reviewing the symptoms most often found in the medical records of the patients included.
Question 11 evaluates the variation of each symptom after removal of ESSURE devices through an ordinal scale (total disappearance, significant improvement, poor improvement, no improvement, worsening).</description>
