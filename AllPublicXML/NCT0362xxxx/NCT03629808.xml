  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study, which subjects were obese patients requiring LSG surgery.
      LSG with different gastric resection starting points (2-4cm/4-6 cm from pylorus) as
      intervention method. The main observation is the incidence and extent of upper
      gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, retching, reflux, difficulty swallowing,
      etc.).In addition, secondary observations include the excess weight loss (%EWL) and
      postoperative complications. Aim to investigate the effects of LSG surgery in different
      starting points of gastric resection on postoperative upper gastrointestinal symptoms.

    <description>We use three scales to evaluate the incidence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms,include the Chinese translation of R-INVR(the Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching)、EAT-10(Validity and Reliability of the Eating Assessment Tool) and GIS(GERD impact serve).These three scales describe postoperative upper gastrointestinal symptoms,which include vomiting, dysphagia,and acid reflux,heartburn.We focus on the incidence rate of the above symptoms in one year after surgery during 1 year.
