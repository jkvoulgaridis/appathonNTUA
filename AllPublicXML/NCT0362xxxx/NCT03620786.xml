  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sonablate HIFU device was approved by the U.S.FDA for prostate tissue ablation in
      October, 2015. The purpose of this observational research study is to investigate the
      localized treatment of prostate cancer using HIFU through clinical data and health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will serve to collect data from medical record review and
      questionnaires before and after High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) for focal ablation
      of prostate tissue. The subject will have already undergone or opted to receive the HIFU
      procedure as part of standard of care in order to participate in this study.

    <description>The following definitions will be used for evaluation of oncological response:
Complete response: Ablation of prostate tissue in targeted biopsy cores at 6 months and 18 months post-procedure biopsy and resolution of initial mp-MRI abnormality.
Incomplete radiographic response: Residual mp-MRI abnormality at 6 months compared to baseline
Local failure: Failure to ablate prostate tissue</description>

    <description>Subjects who have biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate, who have met all study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and have elected to receive or have already received the HIFU procedure as part of their routine prostate cancer treatment, will be invited to participate in this observational registry study. The HIFU device currently used in this standard-of-care procedure at UCLA is the Sonablate 450 HIFU System.</description>

    <description>In this study, we will be using the Sonablate 450 HIFU System. The Sonablate HIFU device was approved by the U.S. FDA for prostate tissue ablation in October, 2015. HIFU is an example of focal therapy, where the intervention involves targeting diseased areas of prostate tissue, while preserving healthy prostate tissue and minimizing damage to surrounding structures.</description>
