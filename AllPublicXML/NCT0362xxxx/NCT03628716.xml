      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, multi-institutional clinical trial designed to study the
      combination of CV301 with atezolizumab in the first-line treatment of UC not eligible for
      cisplatin-containing chemotherapy (Cohort 1) and in the second-line treatment of UC
      previously treated with standard first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Cohort 2).

      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, multi-institutional clinical trial designed to study the
      combination of CV301 with atezolizumab in the first-line treatment of UC not eligible for
      cisplatin-containing chemotherapy (Cohort 1) and in the second-line treatment of UC
      previously treated with standard first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Cohort 2). The
      trial will be performed using an optimal two-stage design within each cohort.

      Stage 1, Cohort 1: Enroll 14 subjects. If objective response is not achieved in at least four
      patients, the cohort will be stopped for futility. If objective response is achieved in at
      least four subjects, the cohort will proceed to stage 2. If any patient is not evaluable for
      the primary endpoint, the patient may be replaced.

      Stage 1, Cohort 2: Enroll 13 subjects. If objective response is not achieved in at least
      three patients, the cohort will be stopped for futility. If objective response is achieved in
      at least three subjects, the cohort will proceed to stage 2. If any patient is not evaluable
      for the primary endpoint, the patient may be replaced.

      Stage 2, Cohort 1: Enroll an additional 19 subjects. If any patient is not evaluable for the
      primary endpoint, the patient may be replaced until a total of 33 patients are evaluable for
      the primary endpoint.

      Stage 2, Cohort 2: Enroll an additional 22 subjects. If any patient is not evaluable for the
      primary endpoint, the patient may be replaced until a total of 35 patients are evaluable for
      the primary endpoint.
