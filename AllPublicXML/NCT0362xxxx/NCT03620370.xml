    <textblock>
      NBO is a nonpharmacological measure of neuroprotection. The purpose of our study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficiency of NBO（Normobaric hyperoxia) in the acute ischemic stroke
      patients who received endovascular treatment. Looking for more clinical evidence for the
      ischemic stroke patients who will be treated with NBO in the future.

    <description>Normobaric oxygen therapy is the delivery of high-flow oxygen (10L/min) via oxygen storage facemask. This therapy should start in the pre-hospital or emergency room as soon as possible (within 1 hours) after diagnosis of ischemic stroke and last for 4 hours. All participant will receive mechanical thrombectomy and a standard clinical therapy.</description>
