  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if nerve glide exercises in patients with cubital
      tunnel syndrome can improve pain, paraesthesias and reduce the need for future surgery.
      Cubital tunnel syndrome is a common form of peripheral neuropathy caused by compression of
      the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Surgical intervention is typically reserved for those with
      severe symptoms, but many cases can be treated with non-operative measures. This study will
      look at the efficacy of nerve glide exercises in the management of cubital tunnel syndrome.
      70 subjects with cubital tunnel syndrome will be enrolled and randomized into groups
      receiving either standard conservative measures or standard measures in addition to nerve
      glide exercises. Outcomes will be measured 6 months after initiation of treatment with
      questionnaires on clinical symptoms and function to see if there is a difference between the
      two groups.
