  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to gain information on the best and most comfortable
      way to treat the periodontal disease. The main objective is to compare the efficacy of
      conventional scaling and root planning compared to laser scaling for the non-surgical
      treatment of periodontal disease. Both therapies have shown to be effective and are regularly
      used in the dental clinic.

      The study has been designed as a single blinded split-mouth randomized controlled clinical
      trial. Patients will be randomized prior to treatment, to which the examiner will be blinded.
      Clinical parameters will be recorded at baseline and 3 months after treatment has been
      completed. At the time of recruitment, inclusion/exclusion criteria checklist, informed
      consent and baseline measurements will be obtained and recorded. Medical history will be
      updated and radiographs will be reviewed or taken. During the second appointment,
      conventional scaling and root planing will be performed in the corresponding quadrant; during
      the third appointment, laser therapy will be conducted, 1 month after, during the forth
      appointment, a follow up (no measurements) will be scheduled with provider, and 3 months
      after scaling completion, measurements will be taken and periodontal maintenance performed.
      Patient will receive home care instructions at every visit and will fill out a visual
      analogue scale at baseline, 1 month and 3 month visit.

    <description>This laser is intended to be used for dental surgery. The Er:YAG Laser emits an infrared beam which is readily absorbed by water contained by both hard and soft tissues of the human body. As a result, energy of the laser beam instantly vaporizes the water molecules in soft and hard tissues of the tooth and surrounding tissues causing the tissues to crumble away or resection of the soft tissues of gingival.</description>
