    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of mebendazole (ReposMBZ) in patient with
      advanced gastrointestinal cancer or cancer of unknown origin. All patients will be given
      ReposMBZ for 16 weeks continuous treatment, individually dosed based on the serum
      concentration of mebendazole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mebendazole has been used extensively during long time for local gut helminthic infections at
      low dose but also at considerably higher doses during months to years against invasive
      echinococcus infections. Recent research has now clearly indicated that mebendazole has
      anticancer effect. Given these observations and the experience of excellent tolerance to
      mebendazole the current clinical trial protocol is based on the repositioning strategy to
      more extensively investigate whether mebendazole could be developed into a useful anticancer
      drug.
