  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrocardiogram (EEG) change before, during, and after anesthesia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 hours. Specific time points are dependent on patient clinical events.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient subjective level of consciousness during and after anesthesia administration will be assessed using response to verbal stimuli, response via button press, reported subjective level of consciousness, and/or response to memory tests (i.e. demonstration of explicit memory recall). Around loss and recovery of consciousness time points (e.g. induction or emergence from anesthesia or when patient falls asleep or wakes up during 24 hour postoperative time points) level of consciousness will be assessed in brief intervals (seconds) until patient no longer responds or begins to respond. Data collected before, after, and during seizure activity if a patient loses consciousness or has diminished consciousness may also be compared.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrocardiogram (EEG) change during any changes in conciousness.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 hours. Specific time points are dependent on patient clinical events.</time_frame>
    <description>Scalp and cortical electrical activity collected using EEG and ECOG arrays respectively will be analyzed using standard frequency-derived measures (e.g. spectrograms, Fourier analysis), nonlinear dynamical analyses (e.g. correlation dimension, entropy), network dynamics (e.g. connectivity matrices, path length), and/or machine learning. These measures will include all of the data collected from the start of the implant procedure until 24 hours after the implant procedure has ended. Data collected before, after, and during seizure activity if a patient loses consciousness or has diminished consciousness may also be compared. Reports will included characterization of electrophysiological activity before, during, and after variations in behavioral and subjectively reported consciousness.</description>

          -  Male or Female subjects 18 years of age or older.

          -  English or Spanish Speaking

          -  Subjects who have been previously diagnosed with intractable epilepsy and require

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with skin abnormalities at the planned application sites that would interfere
             with sensor or electrode applications.

          -  Patients with pre-existing conditions and/or co-morbidities that would prohibit them
             from participating in the study due to unacceptable risks to their health and
             well-being, as determined by the Principal Investigator (PI).

          -  Patients who the PI deems ineligible at the PI's discretion
