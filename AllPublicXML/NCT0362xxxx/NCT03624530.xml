  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in early first complete
      remission improves the long-term outcomes for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Relapse remains a major cause of treatment failure even
      after allo-HSCT. The prevention of relapse is essential for improving the outcome of Ph+ ALL.
      Our previous clinical trial (ID: NCT01883219) demonstrated that pre-emptive tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKIs) administration based on minimal residual disease (MRD) and BCR-ABL mutation
      after allo-HSCT might reduce the incidence of relapses and improve survival for patients with
      Ph+ ALL. Moreover, our result suggested that Ph+ ALL with MRD positive pre-transplants had
      the higher rate of molecular biology relapse. In this study, we will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of prophylactic TKI therapy post-transplants on Ph+ ALL undergoing allo-HSCT with
      MRD positive pre-transplants.

      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in early first complete
      remission improves the long-term outcomes for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Relapse remains a major cause of treatment failure even
      after allo-HSCT. Overall, patients experiencing relapse have a dismal prognosis despite
      salvage treatment with TKIs. The prevention of relapse is essential for improving the outcome
      of Ph+ ALL. Strategies to prevent relapse include tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) use, donor
      lymphocyte infusions (DLI), CAR-T and so on. At present, the utility of TKIs administration
      post-transplants is controversial. Our previous clinical trial (ID: NCT01883219) demonstrated
      that pre-emptive TKI administration based on minimal residual disease (MRD) and BCR-ABL
      mutation after allo-HSCT might reduce the incidence of relapses and improve survival for
      patients with Ph+ ALL. Moreover, we found that 58% Ph+ ALL with MRD positive pre-transplants
      would MRD positive post-transplants, whereas only 11.4% Ph+ ALL with MRD negative
      pre-transplants would MRD positive post-transplants, suggesting that Ph+ ALL with MRD
      positive pre-transplants had the higher rate of molecular biology relapse. In this study, we
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic TKI therapy post-transplants on Ph+ ALL
      undergoing allo-HSCT with MRD positive pre-transplants.
