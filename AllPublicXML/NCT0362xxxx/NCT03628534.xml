  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate safety and feasibility of the Thermedical Ablation
      System and Durablate needle catheter in subjects with recurrent, monomorphic ventricular
      tachycardia (VT) who have failed conventional treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of a new
      ablation catheter called the Durablate™ Saline Enhanced Radiofrequency (SERF) catheter. This
      catheter is being studied to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients who have already
      been treated with medicine, have an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) and had an
      ablation procedure to treat their VT but continue to experience VT despite these treatments.
      A VT ablation procedure is done by finding the abnormal heart tissue that's causing the VT
      and applying energy with the tip of an ablation catheter to the area to create a scar or
      destroy the tissue that causes the VT. The SERF catheter being used in this study uses a
      needle to deliver heated saline (salt water) and radiofrequency energy deeper into the heart
      tissue that is causing the VT than a standard ablation catheter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has sustained, monomorphic VT

          2. Subject has recurrent, symptomatic VT

          3. Subject has drug refractory or drug intolerant sustained VT following use of at least
             one Class III antiarrhythmic as demonstrated by a recurrent arrhythmia and is not a
             suitable candidate per the investigator's expert opinion for ongoing or alternative
             drug therapy

          4. ECG and/or ICD evidence of a spontaneous VT recurrence within the prior 6 months that
             is suspected to be the same VT as initially targeted in a prior ablation

          5. Subject has minimum 3-month ICD interrogation history available for evaluation

          6. Subject has LVEF &gt; 20%, confirmed by echo or comparable technique during baseline
             evaluation

          7. Subject is at least 18 years old

          8. Subject has signed the informed consent, and is willing and able to participate in all
             study procedures and follow up requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with VT of idiopathic origin

          2. Subjects with VT with ECG or MRI/CT findings suggestive of right ventricular free wall
             origin

          3. Subjects with VTs of septal origin require special care to minimize the risk of heart
             block, particularly within 2 cm of the AV node/proximal conduction system; Subjects
             requiring ablation at such locations should only be included when the arrhythmia
             itself is life‐threatening or otherwise sufficiently severe to justify the risk

          4. Subject with myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina within previous 60 days

          5. Subject with cardiac surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within
             previous 60 days

          6. Subject with class IV (NYHA) heart failure

          7. Subject with prosthetic cardiac valve(s), severe aortic stenosis or flail mitral valve

          8. Subject with left ventricular assist device planned or required for the procedure

          9. Subjects with co‐morbidities such that they have less than 1-year life expectancy

         10. Subject with significant intracardiac and/or laminated thrombus evident by
             transesophageal echo (TEE) or transthoracic echo (TTE) (with contrast) prior to
             ablation procedure

         11. Subject with thrombocytopenia or other coagulopathy

         12. Women who are or may potentially be pregnant (must be post‐menopausal or have a
             negative pregnancy test)

         13. Subject with other acute illness or active systemic infection (unrelated to VT or its
             origin)

         14. Significant congenital heart disease or cardiac anomaly

         15. Allergy or contraindications to the medications/agents used during a standard
             ablation/EP intervention.

         16. Subject concurrently enrolled in any other investigational drug or device study
