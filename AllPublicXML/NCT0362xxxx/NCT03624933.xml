  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the changes in symptoms and cognition that occur
      after a 28-day abstinence period in patients with comorbid Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) and
      Major Depression (MDD). This study employs a 28-day abstinence paradigm a total of 8 visits
      to the CAMH Russell site (screening, training, baseline, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4,
      follow-up). Participants should be between the ages of 18-55, meet criteria for moderate
      depression and CUD, be non-treatment seeking, and be on a stable dose of antidepressant
      medication. The study visits will take up a total of approximately 22.5 hours with
      compensation for time provided. These visits will involve multiple clinical, substance use,
      and cognitive assessments. Abstinence will be maintained by weekly behavioural coaching
      sessions and contingency reinforcement.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open label intervention of contingent reinforcement and behavioral support to try to enhance cannabis abstinence for 28 days with people with Major Depressive Disorder. We will analyze data post hoc from this study as a function of subjects who attain abstinence versus those who do not.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effects of 28 day cannabis abstinence on change in depressive symptoms in cannabis-dependent patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly (Day 0, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28) and at 8 weeks (Follow-up Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical assessment will be administered weekly during the abstinence period and conducted by study personnel. The HRDS is used to evaluate depression on a 17-item scale with higher values indicating worse depressive symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effects of 28 day cannabis abstinence on change in cognitive function in cannabis dependent patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as assessed by a cognitive battery administered at Baseline, Week 2, Endpoint and Follow-Up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Bi-Weekly (Day 0, Day 14, Day 28) and at 8 Weeks (Follow-up Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive battery will include the primary outcome of verbal memory (assessed by Hopkins Verbal Learning Test) and will be compared to baseline (Day 1) performance. Cortical inhibition will also be assessed and compared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effects of 28 day cannabis abstinence on change in co-occurring anxiety in cannabis dependent patients with MDD as assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) administered weekly.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly (Day 0, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28) and at 8 weeks (Follow-up Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical assessment will be administered at Baseline, weekly during the abstinence period and Follow-up and will be conducted by study personnel. The BAI is a 21-item scale used to evaluate the severity of anxiety symptoms with higher values indicating worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>The study will assess the changes that occur after a 28-day abstinence period in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and comorbid Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD). Patients will be instructed to initiate abstinence 12 hours prior to the baseline session and will come in for weekly visits involving a series of clinical, cognitive, and substance use assessments.</description>

    <description>The participants will be provided with a 20-minute individual behavioral support session weekly for 4 weeks (28 days of abstinence), designed to provide them with tools and techniques to manage the craving and withdrawal symptoms that occur with cessation.</description>

    <description>If the participant's weekly abstinence is successful as determined by the urine results on day 28, the participant will receive an additional $300.00 cash bonus on top of their hourly $10 compensation for attending all visits. We predict that this cash bonus is enough incentive to allow for the behavioural change of abstinence in this patient population.</description>
