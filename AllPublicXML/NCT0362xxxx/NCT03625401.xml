      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,placebo-controlled study to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability, efficacy, and PK of 60 mg AD-35 administered QD during 6 months
      of double-blind treatment followed by a second 6 months of open-label treatment to subjects
      with mild to moderate AD.

      Approximately 55 subjects are planned to be enrolled for the entire study. Subjects will be
      randomized on Day 1 via a centralized interactive response technology (IRT) in a 1:2 ratio to
      receive placebo or 60 mg AD-35. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety
      information after the first 30 subjects have completed the Day 30 Visit and make any
      necessary recommendations regarding changes to the conduct of the study.

      After the first 6 months of double-blind treatment, subjects initially on placebo will
      transition to active study drug, and all subjects will receive 60 mg AD-35 for an additional
      6 months of open-label treatment.

          2. Subjects must have a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥15 and ≤26 at
             screening and baseline.

          3. Subjects must have a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that is consistent
             with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD.

          4. Subjects should not have received Aβ-based or tau-based treatment for AD.

          5. Subjects who were previously treated with Acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) or

             anxiolytics, soporifics, centrally acting anticholinergic antihistamines, centrally
             acting anticholinergic antispasmodics):

               -  Treatment must be at a stable dose for ≥1 month prior to randomization and
                  throughout the duration of the study.

               -  Treatment given intermittently and on a short-term basis must not be administered

             screening.

          8. Female subjects must be post-menopausal for at least 2 consecutive years or surgically

         10. Subjects must have a reliable caregiver with contact at least 3 times per week
             (combination of face to face visits and telephone contact acceptable). The caregiver
             must be able to oversee the subject's compliance with study drug and participate in
             the subject's clinical assessment, to provide meaningful input into the NPI, ADCS-ADL,

             stimulators; metallic splinters in the eye; other magnetic, electronic, or mechanical
             implants; or any other clinical history or examination finding that, in the judgment

             brain damage) central nervous system trauma (eg, cerebral contusion).

          7. History or presence of intracranial tumor (eg, meningioma, glioma).

          8. Presence of infections that affect the brain function or history of infections that

             prevent completion of study procedures, including but not limited to clinically
             significant major psychiatric disorder according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V (DSM-V) (eg, major depression, schizophrenia,

         14. Evidence of malignancies, acute infections, renal failure that requires dialysis, or
             other unstable medical disease not related to AD that in the Investigator's opinion
             would preclude subject participation.

             • This does not include any cancer (except adequately treated basal or squamous cell
             skin cancer) that is not being actively treated with anti-cancer drugs or radiotherapy
             as well as cancers that are considered to have low probability of recurrence (with
             supporting documentation of this from the treating oncologist, if possible).

         15. History or presence of atrial fibrillation that poses a risk for future stroke in the

             prolonged or shortened heart rate, clinical significant arrhythmias, corrected QT
             interval [QTcF] &gt;450 ms) in the Investigator's judgement. ECG abnormalities should be
             confirmed by Investigator based on the central read results provided by the ECG core
             laboratory (Medpace Cardiovascular Core Laboratory [MCCL]).

         18. Subjects must not have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2,
             at screening.

         19. Impaired hepatic function, as indicated by transaminases &gt;2 times the upper limit of

             clinically significant.

         20. Evidence of poorly-controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin &gt;8.0%).

             screening, whichever is longer, or any subject who has been in an Alzheimer Aβ or tau
