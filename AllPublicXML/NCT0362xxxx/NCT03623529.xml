  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of LJPC-501 infusion on mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) as assessed by standard of care vasopressor dose reduction in pediatric
      patients with catecholamine-resistant hypotension (CRH). In addition, this study will
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of LJPC-501 in pediatric patients, evaluate changes in
      catecholamine and other vasopressor doses over time, evaluate the change in MAP over time,
      and the change in Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2) scores.
