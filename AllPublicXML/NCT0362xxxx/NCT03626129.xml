  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After performing a radial angiography/percutaneous coronary intervention (CAG/PCI), the
      sheath is removed and a compression device is used to achieve hemostasis. Recent studies have
      indicated that rapid deflation techniques resulting in early removal of the compression
      device is associated with a low incidence of radial artery occlusion (RAO).

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate whether an even faster removal of the
      compression device can be achieved if using oximetry guided rapid deflation compared to
      traditional rapid deflation, and whether this is associated with a lower incidence of RAO.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3600 patients are randomized 1:1 to a traditional rapid deflation technique (Group A) versus
      an oximetry guided rapid deflation technique (Group B).

      Before randomisation between the two deflation techniques French size of the sheath is
      chosen. If the operator has a preference for the size of the sheath then this size is used
      (5F/6F, estimated N=1200). If the operator has no preference for the size of the sheath then
      patients are randomized between 5 and 6 French sheath (N=2400).

      Randomization between traditional rapid deflation technique (Group A) versus oximetry guided
      rapid deflation technique (Group B) is then stratified according to French size of the sheath
      used (5 French, 6 French). Terumo Glidesheath Slender is routinely used in both arms.

      Assuming that the incidence of RAO (Barbeau type D, see below) can be reduced from 1.5% to
      0.5% a total of 1547 patients are needed in each group if using an alfa=0.05 and beta 0.80.
      Assuming that the incidence of RAO or subocclusion (Barbeau type C or D, see below) can be
      reduced from 4% to 2% a total of 1141 patients are needed in each group to document this
      difference if using an alfa=0.05 and beta 0.80. The investigators plan to randomize 1800 in
      each group comparing oximetry guided rapid deflation with traditional rapid deflation.
      Assuming that the time from sheath removal to transradial-band (TR-band) removal (hemostasis)
      is 125 minutes with the traditional rapid deflation technique, and 110 minutes with the
      oximetry guided deflation technique, and the standard deviation is 60 minutes, then a total
      number of 253 patients are needed in each group to document a possible difference.

      Data are analyzed by the intention-to-treat principle.

      4-5 centres are expected to include patients.

      Oral and written informed consent is collected at the ward or in the Cath.lab. The informed
      consent is signed before intervention.

      Included patient can withdraw their assignment from the study at any time without consequence

    <description>Group A: At time of sheath removal 15 ml. air is inflated in the TR-band. The sheath is removed. Air is deflated until bleeding, and 1-2 ml. air is then re-inflated to achieve hemostasis, and the volume air inflated is registered (&quot;Initial inflated air volume&quot;). Every 20 minutes 1/3 of the initial inflated air volume is deflated. If bleeding occurs then air is re-inflated until hemostasis and then additional 1-2 ml. air is inflated. This routine is repeated until hemostasis is achieved (TR-band fully deflated without bleeding).</description>

    <intervention_name>Oximetry guided deflation</intervention_name>
    <description>At the cath.lab. (Step 1) a hemostasis test is performed: oxymetry device on the thumb, compress a.ulnaris, evaluate if curve on device (=&quot;Patent hemostasis&quot;). If patent no further action. If not patent, air is deflated until a.radialis is patent (curve on device and no bleeding). If bleeding occurs before patency then re-inflate 1-2 ml. air until hemostasis (=&quot;no patent hemostasis&quot;). In patients with &quot;Patent hemostasis&quot; no action is taken in sixty minutes whereafter the TR-band is fully deflated (Step 2), and if bleeding then air is re-inflated until hemostasis and step 2 is repeated every 20 minutes until the TR-band is fully deflated with hemostasis. If &quot;no patent hemostasis&quot; at cath.lab. a hemostasis test is performed after 20 min. If &quot;patent hemostasis&quot; is achieved no action is taken in sixy minutes (as above). If still &quot;not patent&quot; then further action as in group A.</description>
