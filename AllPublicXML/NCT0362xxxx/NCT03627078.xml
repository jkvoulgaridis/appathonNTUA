  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of motor interference therapy (TIM) to reduce
      the intensity of discomfort (distress) generated by a traumatic memory compared to a
      relaxation control maneuver, immediately after the intervention, a week, a month and six
      months after intervention.

      The investigators treated 10 patients with autobiographical traumatic memories using finger
      tapping tasks, (Motor Interference Therapy &lt;TIM&gt;)in a pilot study with amazing results and a
      solid size effect. The investigators decided to challenge the intervention using a control
      task (Jacobson´s progressive relaxation exercises) The hypothesis consists in achieving a 30%
      reduction of the distress, (measured with Visual Analogue Scale) by using TIM compared with
      the control task. Patients with traumatic memories will be enrolled in to one of two
      treatment modalities. The first group will receIve motor interference therapy and the second
      group will receive a control task (relaxation exercises). Both groups will be assessed using
      the Spanish version of the PTSD Symptom Severity Scale-Revised (EGS-R), the visual analogue
      scale (EQ-VAS) from EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), and a simple visual-analogue scale (VAS) immediately
      after, a week after, a month after and six months after the treatment for follow up.

    <description>Initial interview applying the Spanish version of the PTSD Symptom Severity Scale-Revised (EGS-R), the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) from EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), and a simple visual-analogue scale (VAS). After that, patients will listen to an audio track twice and follow the instructions. The first four minutes of the audio track instruct the subjects to tap their fingers in response to specific sounds. During the remaining ten minutes, the patients will be asked to recall a traumatic memory while simultaneously are tapping their fingers. Patients must complete at least 80% of the motor task in order to be included. We will reassess a week, a month and six months after the intervention, using all three scales.</description>

After that, patients will listen to an audio track twice and follow the instructions. The first four minutes of the audio track instruct the subjects in how to do the exercises. During the remaining 10 minutes will hear commands for performing progressive muscle tension-relaxation exercises while the patient evoked the traumatic memory. Patients must complete at least 80% of the motor task in order to be included. We will reassess a week, a month and six months after the intervention, using all three scales.</description>
