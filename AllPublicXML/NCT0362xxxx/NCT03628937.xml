  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 6-10 years old obese girls will be recruited to test the preventive effect of
      decaffeinated green tea polyphenols on the risk of precocious puberty by the random,
      placebo-control and single blind design. The intervention group will be given decaffeinated
      green tea polyphenols capsule (400mg/d) and the control group will be given placebo. The oral
      treatment will be lasted for 12 weeks.Then all the subjects will be followed up every 3
      months until three months after menstruation. At the baseline and after the 12 week
      intervention, the clinical manifestations of secondary sexual characters, the serum levels of
      sex hormones will be determined as the outcome variables. After controlling confounding
      factors, the preventive effect of the green tea polyphenols on precocious puberty or early
      puberty among obese girls will be analyzed.

    <textblock>
      Simple obese girls are prone to premature or early puberty. The topic proposed based on
      previous studies, recruiting of 80 simple overweight or obesity girls, aged 6 to 10 years
      old. After the informed consent, they will be randomly divided into intervention group and
      control group, intervention group will be given tea polyphenol capsule (400 mg,
      epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) accounted for 50%), the control group given placebo capsule.
      Participants need take it once a day after breakfast. All of them will receive similar health
      advice on proper diet and exercise. The intervention will last 12 weeks, followed by
      telephone every 3 months until 3 months after menarche. The researchers will measure children
      obesity index (using artificial detection), youth development index (secondary sex
      characteristic clinical manifestations, serum sex hormone, B ultrasonic examination uterus
      ovarian and breast volume, etc.) in three stages: at the baseline, after 12 weeks
      intervention and the end of three months after menstruation. The liver and kidney function,
      blood and urine routine and serum trace elements will be detected before and after the
      three-month intervention. Through the above detection of the indicators related to obesity
      and sexual precocious puberty, it is explored whether the decaffeinated tea polyphenol has
      preventive effects on precocious puberty.

    <description>Female precocious puberty is defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 or menarche before the age of 10. In our study, after intervention, for girls under 8 years of age, we recorded their rate of secondary sexual characteristics at 8 years of age; and for girls under 10 years of age, we recorded their rate of menarche at 10 years of age. The difference in the incidence of precocious puberty between the two groups is the primary outcome.</description>
