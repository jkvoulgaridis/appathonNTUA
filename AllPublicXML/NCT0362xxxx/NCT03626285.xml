    <textblock>
      This expanded access protocol studies bone marrow transplantation using CD34-selected stem
      cells from related or unrelated donors in treating participants with cancer or other
      disorders. Stem cells collected from the donor will be processed using a new device called
      CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System which marks the blood cells collected from the donor with a
      special protein called &quot;antibody&quot; that tags only the donor stem cells, sorting out other
      cells of the blood and immune system. This is done to remove, at least partially, some of the
      T cells. T cells are the cells in the blood that work as scavengers of the immune system
      deciding what belongs and what does not. These cells can sometimes cause rejection of the
      donor graft or a condition called graft-versus host disease (GVHD), where the donor cells can
      attack the body of the recipient. A bone marrow transplantation using CD34-selected stem
      cells may reduce the risk of these unwanted side effects of transplant as much as possible.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide a source of CD34-selected stem cells for patients with malignant and
      nonmalignant disorders undergoing bone marrow transplantation from haploidentical (human
      leukocyte antigen [HLA]-mismatched) related donors or HLA-compatible unrelated donors

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Monitoring the safety of the CD34-selected stem cells for the recipient, as measured by
      adverse events related to stem cell infusion, incidence of engraftment of neutrophils and
      platelets, incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, and one year overall survival, disease-free
      survival, and primary disease recurrence.

      OUTLINE:

      Donor stem cells undergo CD34 selection ex vivo using the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System using
      standard operating procedures (SOPs) from the manufacturer. Recipients undergo standard of
      care preparative regimen, bone marrow transplantation with CD34-selected peripheral blood
      stem cells via infusion over 1 to 2 hours on day 0, and then receive standard of care GVHD
      prophylaxis.

      After completion of study treatment, recipients are followed up at least once weekly while
      inpatient until transplant day 100, every 1-3 months for the first year and yearly
      thereafter.
