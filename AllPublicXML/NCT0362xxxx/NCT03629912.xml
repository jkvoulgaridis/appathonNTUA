  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of using a new mobile application (BingocizeÂ®) to improve
      older adults' (a) adherence to an engaging exercise program, and (b) aspects of functional
      performance, health knowledge, dietary habits, and cognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health-promoting interventions designed to improve physical and mental fitness can help
      reduce health care costs; they can also help maintain, or even improve, older adults' quality
      of life. However, getting older adults to adhere to health-promoting exercise interventions
      remains difficult because such programs are often perceived as being time-consuming, painful,
      or unenjoyable. The present study's objective is to investigate the effectiveness of a novel
      technological exercise intervention program for older adults (Bingocize); in doing so, the
      program has the potential to improve older adults' independence and quality of life. Older
      adults will participate in a pre/post-intervention design with random assignment to either
      the experimental or one of three comparison/control groups; each group will play Bingocize in
      a social setting with other older adults. Participants in the experimental group will use the
      app to engage in twice-weekly Bingocize sessions for twelve weeks (i.e.,
      Bingo+Exercise+Health Education); control groups will also use the app for twelve weeks but
      for either health education-only, exercise-only, or bingo-only.
