  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to obtain post-market clinical outcome data for the Algovita
      SCS System when used on-label, according to the applicable directions for use, using high
      fidelity tonic stimulation at either ultra-high pulse width or traditional pulse width for
      the treatment of persistent or recurrent back and/or leg pain following spinal surgery.

    <masking_description>Subjects who receive a permanent implant will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two sequences of treatment. Randomization schedules for each site will be prepared by the contract research organization (CRO) statistician and uploaded into a role-limited module of the study database. In order to avoid any potential bias, each site will designate an unblinded coordinator (UC). The UC, Nuvectra field personnel (FP) and the CRO will be unblinded to the treatment group. The participant and other site staff will be blinded to the treatment group.</masking_description>

          -  Has an existing drug pump, SCS System, or other active implantable device.
