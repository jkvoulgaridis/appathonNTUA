  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human gut microbiota is the complex community of bacteria that reside within the human
      gastrointestinal tract. This community plays an important role in supporting normal immune
      function and digestion. Disruption of the microbial communities within the gastrointestinal
      tract, sometimes termed &quot;dysbiosis&quot; is linked to a wide range of human diseases, including
      obesity, metabolic syndrome, malnutrition, and cancer. Stability of the microbiome is thought
      to be important for human health, however the factors that drive microbiome community
      stability are poorly understood.

      Within the gastrointestinal tract, the microbiota is constantly exposed to complex mixtures
      of foods and the products of digestion. Importantly, changes in diet have been shown to
      rapidly induce shifts in microbial community composition. These compositional shifts can also
      affect microbial production of bioactive metabolites, which may be one mechanism to explain
      how the microbiome impacts host physiology and disease.

      Fiber is often considered to be one of the largest contributors to microbial compositional
      shifts that follow dietary interventions. Fiber resists digestion and persists through the
      gastrointestinal tract to reach the large intestine where it can be metabolized by bacteria.
      The end products of this metabolism are the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate and
      butyrate, which are often associated with beneficial health outcomes. Fibrous foods are also
      a source of polyphenols and other phenolic compounds that may be used by microbes in the
      production of secondary metabolites or freed from the food matrix by microbial enzymes.

      The purpose of this study is to: 1) to investigate the impact of high fiber, whole grain and
      bran cereal on microbiome stability, and 2) to explore the microbial contribution to
      polyphenol metabolism from whole grain in healthy individuals.
