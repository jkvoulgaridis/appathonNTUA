  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to begin to develop a device to stabilize the head during
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). SRS is a therapy for brain disorders and cancers that uses a
      precise dose of radiation to treat a disease, and is different from whole brain radiation.
      This study aims to stabilize patient head motions during radiation therapy through the use of
      a special experimental head holder. The investigators would like to first see how the
      experimental device works in whole brain radiation.

    <description>Patients will be receiving standard brain radiation. The experimental head holder device (called the Wiersma Head Stabilizer) will be attached to treatment table and will make small movements to adjust the position of the head in response to movement by the patient. In addition, the AlignRT system (an FDA approved medical device that automatically turns off the radiation beam if the patient's head moves beyond a set distance) will be used to track real-time motions of the head. This system is used with radiation therapy as standard of care.</description>
