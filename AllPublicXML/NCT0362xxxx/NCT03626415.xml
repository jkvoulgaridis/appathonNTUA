  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 non randomized, open label, single dose, parallel cohort study to
      investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK, safety and tolerability of PF
      04965842.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of 24 subjects with normal, mild or moderate hepatic function will be enrolled into
      the study, with approximately 8 subjects in each cohort. The Child Pugh classification score
      will be utilized to assess entry criteria and to assign subjects into the appropriate hepatic
      impairment group. For individual subjects, the total maximum duration of study participation
      from the Screening visit to the end of clinical research unit (CRU) stay is approximately 31
      days and approximately 63 days from the Screening visit to the Follow up contact.
