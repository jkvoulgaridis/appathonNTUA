  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the efficacy of a new approach to the subscapularis
      muscle under US guidance for the injection of botulinum toxin in patients that underwent a
      stroke suffering from hemiplegic shoulder pain.

      Pain and spastic shoulder are common findings in hemiplegic patients following a stroke.

      The pain interferes with rehabilitation prolonging hospitalization and is related with
      decreased quality of life.

      There is a close relationship between spasticity of the subscapularis muscle and pain The
      patients show a clinical picture of adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder, elbow
      and wrist and fingers flexion with a limited external rotation of the shoulder.

      The investigators suggest that paralyzing the subscapularis muscle with botulinum toxin may
      alleviate pain in the hemiplegic shoulder. Best produced when injected in a specific area of
      the muscle where a higher concentration of motor points exists.

      Treatment using injection of botulinum toxin to the subscapularis spastic muscle has been
      described in the literature and is a common practice in hemiplegic shoulder. The Injection
      technic in this pathology is described by using anatomical landmarks of the shoulder region
      without using medical imaging.

      On the other hand, injections to the subscapularis muscle has also been described using
      ultrasound guidance but not for this specific pathology.

      There are no evidence-based guidelines describing us guided spastic subscapularis muscle
      injection. Injecting this muscle while in its spastic state requires a modulated approach
      Harrison et.al described cadaveric dissections of the subscapularis muscle and proposed a
      technique to reach the motor point zone of this muscle In our study the investigators follow
      the injection description published by Dong Wook Rha on cadavers based on Harrison's lateral
      approach description. The Ultrasound enables a correct identification of the target muscle
      avoiding possible complication of vessel or pulmonary puncture In our study the investigators
      will try to prove the efficacy of the lateral approach to the subscapularis muscle using
      ultrasound and nerve stimulator

    <description>measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity.
0: No increase in muscle tone
1: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension
1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
2: More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
3: Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>

    <description>a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment. Scoring is based on direct observation of performance. Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale where 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully. The total possible scale score is 226.</description>

    <description>a measurement instrument that tries to measure the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain (0-10). The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations.</description>

    <description>a 9 item self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. The patient is asked to rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity, list current treatments and their perceived effectiveness, and rate the degree that pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a 10 point scale.</description>

    <description>Patient will be positioned lying on side with the hemiplegic side up. The shoulder will be placed in a flexion and external rotation/abduction position, as possible by the patient, to give the ultrasound probe access to the posterior axillary fold.
As previously described in the literature, a line of best fit was calculated by bisection of hypothetical line connecting the inferior spine and the acromial tip, an 18-gauge, 10-cm needle will be inserted under direct ultrasound guidance and by a nerve stimulation . After placing the needle tip in the target point's 100 units of botulinum toxin will be injected.</description>
