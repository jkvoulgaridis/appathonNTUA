  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of abnormal excessive sweating. Primary hyperhidrosis (armpits,
      hands, and feet) affects approximately 4.8% of the US population and is believed to be caused
      by an overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands. Current therapies have limited
      effectiveness, significant side effects, and can be invasive and costly. Sofpironium bromide
      (BBI-4000) is a novel soft-drug in development for the topical treatment of hyperhidrosis.
      This Phase 3 study will assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      sofpironium bromide gel applied topically to subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 long-term study designed to evaluate the safety,
      local tolerability and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel when applied topically to the
      axillae.

      Subjects will apply the gel once daily at bedtime, to both axillae.

      A maximum of 300 subjects, will be randomized to receive one of two sofpironium bromide gel
      concentrations.

      Adverse events, vital signs, and local tolerability assessments will be collected at each
      visit. Urine pregnancy tests will be taken throughout the course of the study for women of
      child bearing potential. Blood and urine samples will be collected and analyzed for routine
      hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters at specified visits. Patient-reported
      outcome assessments will be recorded during the study at predefined time points.

      The study will be comprised of a total of 17 scheduled visits to take place over a 52 week
      period.

             of any of these medications and has not had a recent change in hyperhidrosis frequency
             or severity for 3 months prior to the Baseline Visit; they may be included. Doses of
             these agents should not be altered during the course of the study. (d) Any topical
             treatment for hyperhidrosis, requiring a prescription, within 15 days of Baseline

             inhibitors (OCT2/MATE1/MATE2) 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 2). The use
             of topical antifungal medications is permitted if not applied in the treatment area.

          -  Any oral or topical homeopathic or herbal treatment (i.e., alternative therapies such

          -  Use of any cholinergic drug (e.g., bethanechol) within 15 days of the Baseline Visit
             (Visit 2).

          -  Use of any anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant, amphetamine product or drugs with
             known anticholinergic side effects is prohibited with the following exceptions: (a) If
             a subject has been on a stable dose of an anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant drug and
             has not had a recent change in hyperhidrosis frequency or severity for 3 months; they
             may be included. (b) An amphetamine product may be allowed if the dose has been stable
             for greater than or equal to 6 months without change in hyperhidrosis frequency or
             severity. (c) Drugs with known anticholinergic side effects (taken within the last 28
             days), including dry mouth, blurred vision, may be allowed based on the Principal
             Investigator's assessment.

        NOTE: If anticholinergic side effect(s) are experienced on these medications prior to
        starting study medication; document the side effect(s) and severities in the source
        document and the eCRF. The doses of these agents should not be altered during the course of
        the study.

          -  Known causes of hyperhidrosis or known history of a condition that may cause
             hyperhidrosis (i.e., hyperhidrosis secondary to any known cause such hyperthyroidism,

          -  Any other condition, including psychiatric illness (depression and/or anxiety) that
             would interfere with study participation and/or evaluation of study endpoints or
             laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject
             at unacceptable risk for participation in the study or may interfere with the
             assessments included in the study.
