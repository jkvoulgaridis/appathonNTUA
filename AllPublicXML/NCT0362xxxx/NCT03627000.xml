  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study concerns patients having had an infection on their prosthesis (hip, knee,..) and
      for whom a 2-step exchange of prosthesis has been done.

      A 2-step exchange consists in explantation of the prosthesis and implementation of a spacer
      at the first stage, and reimplantation of a new prosthesis in a second stage. Patients with
      late prosthetic joint infection are at risk for superinfection at the time of reimplantation.

      The aim is to determine the microbiological epidemiology in patients experiencing failure
      following reimplantation to establish, based on the drug susceptibilities, which cement could
      be the most active.
