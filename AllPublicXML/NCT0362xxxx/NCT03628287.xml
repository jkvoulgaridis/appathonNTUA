  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In New York, the achievement of 90-90-90 goals is jeopardized not by limited access to
      affordable care and treatment, but by persistent disparities in HIV viral suppression (VS).
      Complex behavioral and structural barriers to achieving and maintaining VS require
      coordinated, combination approaches to meet medical and social service needs. In 2009, at 28
      Ryan White Part A (RWPA)-funded agencies, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and
      Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) launched a multi-component HIV Care Coordination Program (CCP)
      directed toward the most vulnerable persons living with HIV (PLWH) in NYC. A systematic CCP
      effectiveness study began in 2013 (R01 MH101028; PIs: Irvine, Nash). Findings to date suggest
      that the CCP is superior to usual care for vulnerable subgroups of PLWH, but there remains
      substantial room for improvement in short- and long-term VS. In an immediate
      evidence-to-practice feedback loop, the DOHMH is implementing a refined CCP model in 2018.
      Greater focusing, tailoring and cues for delivery of key components are expected to increase
      CCP engagement, reach, fidelity, scalability, effectiveness and impact. The aim of the
      proposed study is to estimate the effect of the revised (vs. original) CCP on timely VS
      (within 4 months of enrollment), using experimental methods.

      Stepped-wedge design. The 17 veteran CCP implementers re-awarded to provide RWPA Care
      Coordination services in 2018 will be randomized to immediate or delayed implementation of
      the revised CCP model, with delayed implementers continuing to provide services under the
      original model until their assigned start date 9 months later, so that we can rigorously and
      contemporaneously compare effects of the original and revised CCP for the outcome of timely
      VS. The outcome measure will be derived from the New York City HIV surveillance registry, a
      population-based data source of longitudinal laboratory (VL, CD4) testing records on all
      diagnosed NYC PLWH, regardless of medical provider within NYC, and for periods extending
      before and after program enrollment or discontinuation.

    <description>The revised model includes the original intervention components without program track assignments or the three-month induction period of weekly visits. Program additions include a set of tools for assessment and counseling around client HIV self-management capacity; allowance of video chat for delivery of some services; and optional iART (&quot;immediate&quot; ART: ensuring the client has a filled prescription within 4 days of enrollment or diagnosis). Other changes include greater guidance on recruiting individuals with unsuppressed VL and a switch from per-member-per-day reimbursement to fee-for-service reimbursement that accounts for resource demands, such as staff travel to clients' homes, and offers higher rates for meeting performance standards.</description>

             are eligible for local Ryan White Part A services (based on residence in the NYC grant
             area and a household income &lt;435% of federal poverty level) and are 1) newly
             HIV-diagnosed; 2) out of care &gt;9 months or never in care; 3) missing visits or
             irregularly in care; 4) exhibiting high VL, VL rebound, or ART resistance; 5) new to
             ART; 6) incompletely adherent to ART; or 7) facing a potential barrier to adherence

          -  The revised CCP permits enrollment of HIV-infected adults or emancipated minors who
             are eligible for local Ryan White Part A services (based on residence in the NYC grant
