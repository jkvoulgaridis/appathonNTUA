  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) is a novel, safe, convenient, and reliable way
      for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and the whole-colon enema treatment. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the methodology, efficiency, feasibility and safety of using
      transparent cap-assisted endoscopy for colon TET implantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous article has reported the method of colon TET. However, the investigators found
      that it was difficult to find the cavity because of the concentration of intestinal folds
      caused by the tube pulling after insertion of TET. It is well known that transparent
      cap-assisted colonoscopy is easier to flatten the semilunar folds and improve mucosal
      exposure. Here the investigators test the hypothesis that using transparent cap-assisted
      colonoscopy significantly decreases the second cecal intubation time which not only improve
      work efficiency, but also saves patients' anesthesia time and cost. Thus, the investigators
      design a prospective multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the methodology, efficiency, feasibility and safety of using transparent
      cap-assisted endoscopy for colon TET implantation.

    <description>The procedure colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing is as follows:The TET tube was inserted into the ileocecal junction through the endoscopy channel at the first time of the cecal intubation after examination and evaluation of the whole colon. Then, the colonoscope was removed from the colon while the TET tube was maintained at the ileocecal junction. Then the endoscopy was inserted into the ileocecum again for affixing the TET tube to cecum with titanium clips.</description>
