  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth is increasing in prevalence in parallel with the obesity
      epidemic. In the US, almost half of patients with renal failure have DKD, and ≥80% have T2D.
      Compared to adult-onset T2D, youth with T2D have a more aggressive phenotype with greater
      insulin resistance (IR), more rapid β-cell decline and higher prevalence of diabetic kidney
      disease (DKD), arguing for separate and dedicated studies in youth-onset T2D. Early DKD is
      characterized by changes in intrarenal hemodynamic function, including increased renal plasma
      flow (RPF) and glomerular pressure with resultant hyperfiltration, is common in Y-T2D, and
      predicts progressive DKD.

      Studies evaluating the two currently approved medications for treating T2D in youth
      (metformin and insulin) have shown these medications are not able to improve β-cell function
      over time in the youth. However, recent evidence suggests that bariatric surgery in adults is
      associated with improvements in diabetes outcomes, and even T2D remission in many patients.
      Limited data in youth also supports the benefits of bariatric surgery, regarding weight loss,
      glycemic control in T2D, and cardio-renal health. While weight loss is important, the acute
      effect of bariatric surgery on factors such as insulin resistance likely includes weight
      loss-independent mechanisms. A better understanding of the effects of bariatric surgery on
      pancreatic function, intrarenal hemodynamics, renal O2 and cardiovascular function is
      critical to help define mechanisms of surgical benefits, to help identify potential novel
      future non-surgical approaches to prevent pancreatic failure, DKD and cardiovascular disease.

      The investigators' overarching hypotheses are that: 1) Y-T2D is associated with IR,
      pancreatic dysfunction, intrarenal hemodynamic dysfunction, elevated renal O2 consumption and
      cardiovascular dysfunction which improve with bariatric surgery, 2) The early effect of
      bariatric surgery on intrarenal hemodynamics is mediated by improvement in IR and weight
      loss. To address these hypotheses, the investigators will measure GFR, RPF, glomerular
      pressure and renal O2, in addition to aortic stiffness, β-cell function and insulin
      sensitivity in youth ages 12-21 with T2D (n=30) before and after vertical sleeve gastrectomy
      (VSG). To further investigate the mechanisms of renal damage in youth with T2D, two optional
      procedures are included in the study prior to vertical sleeve gastrectomy: 1) kidney biopsy
      procedure and 2) induction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to assess morphometrics
      and genetic expression of renal tissue.
