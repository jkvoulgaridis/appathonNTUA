  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore safety and therapeutic efficacy of anlotinib combined
      with erlotinib/chemotherapy/IBI308 as first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients. The
      primary endpoints of the study are safety and objective response rate (ORR);the secondary
      endpoints are disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS).
