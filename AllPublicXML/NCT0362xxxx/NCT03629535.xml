  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present investigation is to determine the accuracy of a
      non-invasive non-oscillometric blood pressure wristband device when compared to invasive
      intra-arterial blood pressure monitors. In an intensive care unit patients who already have
      an intra-arterial blood pressure monitor in place, this wristband device will be applied and
      blood pressure readings compared for approximately 15 minutes. Blood pressure readings will
      be gathered and compared.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit who are already fitted with an
             invasive Arterial Line (A- Line) are eligible for the trial, and no volunteers
             candidates for an A Line are requested.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Within the candidate group of individuals whose procedure in the hospital requires an
             A-Line, the wristband may not, for various reasons, produce a clean signal. This is
             immediately determined after wearing the band (and may be related to the size of the
             wrist of the subject, among other things). Such candidates will be excluded from
             admission to the study.

          -  All data from a subject shall be excluded if the invasive reference systolic blood
             range is greater than 20 mmHg (2, 67 kPa) or if the invasive reference diastolic range
             is more than 12 mmHg (1, 6 kPa) in any single determination.
