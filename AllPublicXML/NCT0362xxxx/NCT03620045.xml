  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children in rural communities experience significant obesity-related health disparities; they
      are 26%-55% more likely to be obese and less likely to have health insurance and access to
      weight management specialists than are their urban peers. Geographic-specific disparities in
      obesity may be due, in part, to variations in eating behaviors. Children in rural communities
      describe purchasing and consuming significantly more energy-dense, low-nutrient food items
      relative to their urban peers. Existing behavioral strategies for improving children's EI
      patterns have largely been ineffective in reducing risk for excess weight gain. The primary
      aim of the proposed study is to test the effects of a brief, novel strategy for improving
      rural children's eating behaviors. Specifically, the study aims to harness the
      well-documented benefits of an acute bout (20 min) of moderate physical exercise on
      children's executive functioning, and to see if these cognitive changes lead to better
      self-regulation of eating. If 20 min of moderate physical exercise is associated with
      observed improvements in preadolescent children's eating secondary to increases in executive
      functioning, these data may offer explicit targets for an obesity prevention trial in rural
      Oregon elementary schools.
