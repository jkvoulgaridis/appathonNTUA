        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The healthy male or female sensory panelist is between 25 and 80 years of age
             (inclusive) who volunteers for study participation and is able to read, understand,
             and sign and date a written informed consent form (ICF) before study participation.

          2. The panelist is male, or is a non-pregnant, non-lactating female who agrees to comply
             with any applicable contraceptive requirements of the protocol, or is a female of
             non-childbearing potential.

          3. The sensory panelist is qualified based on training and experience.

          4. The panelist is able to perform the required procedures according to the specified
             methodology

          5. The panelist has provided full written consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The sensory panelist has a history of any illness that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in
             administering study drug(s) to the sensory panelist.

          2. The sensory panelist has a known sensitivity to medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) or
             any of the excipients used in study formulations.

          3. The sensory panelist has a known history of kidney disease, inflammatory bowel
             disease, or Bradycardia. .

          4. If female, the sensory panelist is pregnant, nursing, planning to become pregnant
             during the study.

          5. Panelist must not have any planned hospitalizations or in-patient surgical procedures
             that are scheduled to take place during the study.
