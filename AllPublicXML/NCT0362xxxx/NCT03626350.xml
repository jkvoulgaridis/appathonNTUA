  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the idea that submucosal endoscopy is effective and safe for endoscopic myotomy,
      endoscopic submucosal dissection, and access for tissue acquisition and resection. Submucosal
      endoscopy is a recent innovative addition to gastrointestinal endoscopy. This involves
      endoscopic maneuvers in the gut wall, by dissection of the submucosal layer of GI tract,
      thereby allowing endoscopic myotomy (incision of the muscle), endoscopic access for tissue
      acquisition and therapy, and resection of precancerous and cancerous gastrointestinal tissue.
      This approach has been a dramatic game-changer for minimally invasive management of various
      gastrointestinal conditions such as Zenker's diverticulum, Achalasia, Spastic Esophageal
      Disorders, Gastroparesis, esophageal obstruction, Hirschsprung's Disease, and
      Gastrointestinal neoplasia.

      The aim of the proposed study is to prospectively assess technical success, clinical success,
      and adverse events after submucosal endoscopy. Technical success will be defined as ability
      to successfully complete the submucosal endoscopic procedure. Clinical success will be
      defined as symptom relief and objective evaluation which will be assessed with radiologic
      imaging, repeat endoscopy, gastrointestinal motility studies, and pathology results routinely
      performed post-procedure for clinical care, as indicated. Adverse events will be recorded per
      published ASGE criteria.

      A database/ registry of patients undergoing submucosal endoscopic procedures will be created
      to demonstrate this.

        A prospective database/registry of patients undergoing submucosal endoscopic procedures
        will be formed. Women and minorities will be included as they are frequently found to have
        indications for which submucosal endoscopic procedures may be indicated.
