    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase Ib clinical study. Patients who give
      informed consent will be screened for the study, including genotyping of the tumour and
      baseline characteristics. Eligible patients will receive a single pre-treatment of low dose
      of intravenous cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 (Day -3). Patients will commence daily oral therapy
      with the EGFR TKI afatinib as soon as possible, preferably on the same day as low dose
      cyclophosphamide. Afatinib will be prescribed according to the Summary of Product
      Characteristics (SmPC) of the product, and will continue in nominal 21-day cycles for as long
      as clinically indicated. The first day of dosing with EGF-PTI will be designated Day 1.

      Immunisation with EGF-PTI will commence 3 days after low dose cyclophosphamide and
      commencement of EGFR TKI, and will be repeated on Day 14, Day 28, Day 43, and Day 92. After
      the 5 th vaccination, patients will be followed up every 6 weeks for basic safety data and
      every 3 months for complete efficacy data, safety data, and maintenance (reduced) doses of
      EGF-PTI. Patients will continue in the study until disease progression, death, safety
      concerns (in the opinion of the investigator), non-compliance with the protocol, the patient
      withdraws from the study, 1 year after randomisation of the last patient, or the study is
      stopped the sponsor, whichever occurs sooner

             including HIV or heart disease) that is incompatible with the study (in the opinion of
             the investigator), history of bleeding diathesis or anticoagulant therapy (the use of
             low molecular weight heparin is permitted provided that it is used for prophylaxis).

         20. Treatment with any of the prohibited concomitant medications that cannot be stopped
             for the duration of trial participation.
