  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental
      disorders of childhood. It affects approximately 8% of school aged children and is
      characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Typical
      ADHD assessments primarily involve interviewing the parents and gathering rating scales from
      parents and teachers. Feedback regarding diagnosis, clinical conceptualization, and treatment
      recommendations is usually provided by the clinical staff to the child's parents in the
      absence of the child. Hence, the ADHD diagnosis and repercussions of that diagnosis are often
      left unexplained to the child. Research has shown that bibliotherapy is an effective
      educational tool that can be used to help parents discuss ADHD diagnosis and treatment with
      their child. The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized trial in which tools for
      parents who are getting their elementary-aged (7 to 10-year-old) children evaluated for ADHD
      are explored. The evaluations (N=60) will be conducted at the Center for ADHD at Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) in Cincinnati, OH. Half of the families (n=30)
      will be randomly assigned to the intervention group, where they will be provided with the
      child-focused &quot;ADH-Me!&quot; book during the feedback session, and the remaining half will not
      receive it. All participants will receive a booklet with general information about ADHD and a
      list of recommendations from the clinicians. Approximately 3 months after their feedback
      sessions, follow-up surveys will be conducted via telephone to question the parents and
      children about their ADHD knowledge, as well as about whether they had followed up on the
      clinicians' recommendations. It is hypothesized that providing families with the ADH-Me! book
      will increase families' knowledge about ADHD and facilitate the family following up on
      treatment recommendations.

    <description>The knowledge portion of the AKOS-R, which consists of 15 true/false items, was modified by the research team for the 7 to 10-year-old children that will participate in this study. The overall readability of the survey was reduced from a 6th grade to a 4th grade level.</description>

    <description>Families in both conditions will be told that they are receiving additional reading materials to help them and their child better understand the ADHD condition and the available options for treating ADHD. Families in both groups will receive the &quot;Understanding ADHD: Information for Parents About ADHD&quot; brochure. Families assigned to this condition will also receive the ADH-Me! book. Written by a pediatrician and health literacy expert, ADH-Me! is an accessible, rhyming narrative that describes an empathetic journey from the perspective of a child learning to live and succeed with ADHD. The book is intended to help families know what to expect from diagnosis through all stages of treatment, while attempting to foster love and support.</description>
