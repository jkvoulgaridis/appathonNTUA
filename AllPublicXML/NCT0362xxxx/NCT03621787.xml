  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have created a device designed to make it easier to insert pharmaceutical
      implants under the skin. The device uses a blood pressure cuff to hold the skin on a person's
      arm in place while a mechanical guide places implants underneath the skin. This device may
      prevent implants from being embedded too deeply.

      The investigators are performing this study to determine the safety and efficacy of the
      device for use in adult women. The study will determine if the implants are placed accurately
      under the skin (in the sub-dermal layer). It will also assess if the device causes any
      discomfort or last pain from use.

      Subcutaneous contraceptive implants are one of the preferred methods of long-term
      contraception by the World health Organization and ministries of health in low- and
      middle-income countries. These implants offer between three and five years of protection
      (allowing women to safely space pregnancies and thereby reduce maternal and infant
      mortality), are 99.95% efficacious, allow women to return to fertility quickly when removed,
      requires no daily/monthly effort on the part of the woman, and cause minimal side effects in
      comparison to other methods. However, availability of contraceptive implants in rural areas
      is limited due to the skill necessary to administer them safely and accurately.

      The investigators have created a device designed to make it easier to insert pharmaceutical
      implants under the skin. The device uses a blood pressure cuff to hold the skin on a person's
      arm in place while a mechanical guide places implants underneath the skin. This device is
      designed to prevent implants from being embedded too deeply.

      In this trial, the investigators will use the implant insertion device with a placebo
      sub-cutaneous implant. Implants will be inserted with the device and the accuracy of the
      placement will be assessed through palpation and ultrasound depth measurements. This data
      will allow the investigators to assess whether the device ensures accurate insertions of
      sub-cutaneous implants.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants in trial will be within a single study arm. All participants will have a placebo subcutaneous implant inserted with the device being studied. The implant accuracy will be assess through palpation and ultrasound depth measurements. The implant will then be removed. Safety will be assessed by measuring bruising, bleeding, and pain to participant. A follow-up questionnaire will assess pain, bruising, and infection risk. A final visit will assess pain, bruising, and infection risk by a physician.</intervention_model_description>
