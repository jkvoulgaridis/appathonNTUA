  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the gut microbiota and clinical outcomes of
      oral FMT during antibiotic treatment, immediately following antibiotic treatment, and
      placebo. The second objective is to assess the safety and feasibility of daily oral Fecal
      Microbiome Transplant (FMT) as a treatment option.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile is the most frequent bacterial cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
      Those with a previous C. difficile infection (CDI) are at high risk of recurrent infection.
      Recurrent CDI often occurs when the normal gut microbiota are disrupted. Dysbiosis of the gut
      microbiota predisposes to CDI which, despite treatment can recur in 30% of patients. A novel
      way to prevent CDI recurrence is by instilling feces from a healthy individual into the
      intestine of the CDI patient, thereby restoring balance in the gut microbiota. However, it is
      unknown whether or not fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an efficacious choice for
      CDI recurrence prevention when used concurrently with antibiotics. We propose a pilot
      randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial comparing oral FMT with placebo in patients
      with a history of CDI, currently undergoing antibiotic treatment. We will collect fecal
      samples from subjects prior to, during, and after FMT and collect metagenomics and
      microbiologic data on microbiota composition and function, and CDI recurrence. The trial's
      primary outcome is gut microbial composition and function. Secondary outcomes are feasibility
      and safety, and recurrent CDI during the trial period. In this 3 group study, FMT will be
      administered daily via oral capsules containing frozen fecal microbiota from universal donors
      in group 1, administered at the end of antibiotic treatment for group 2, and group 3 will
      receive daily placebo. The results of this study will provide the necessary pilot data to
      examine whether or not concurrent FMT in antibiotic treated patients who are at high risk for
      recurrent CDI can maintain a diverse healthy GI microbiota.
