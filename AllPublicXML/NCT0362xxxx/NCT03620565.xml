      This study aims to investigate the incidence and distribution of complications after
      different pelvic reconstruction surgeries using mesh/native tissue in multi-centers using the
      IUGA/ICS complication classification system(the Category-Time-Site(CTS) coding).

      Patients who undergo different pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries for the cure of pelvic
      organ prolapse(POP)and/or stress urinary incontinence(SUI) between June 2018 and June 2023
      from 27 tertiary hospitals are prospectively collected.Our study aims to follow-up and report
      the incidences of postoperative complications according to the International Urogynecological
      Association-International Continence Society(IUGA-ICS) Complication Classification
      Coding(Category-Time-Site coding system).The aimed pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries
      involve anterior,apical, posterior or total pelvic reconstruction with trans-vaginal
      mesh,open/laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy(Y-tape/self-cut synthesized mesh),repair using native
      tissue(sacrospinous ligament fixation, high uterosacral ligament suspension,ischial spinous
      fascia fixation, the Lefort operation and so on)and as well as anti-urinary incontinence
      surgeries(tension-free vaginal tape).

      Our follow-up process start after patients have completed the operation,thus our study do not
      affect patients' choice of surgical method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - 1. Patients who undergo pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries for pelvic organ prolapse
        and/or stress urinary incontinence. The aimed pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries involve
        anterior, apical, posterior or total pelvic reconstruction with trans-vaginal mesh,
        open/laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (Y-shape tape/self-cut synthesized mesh), repair using
        native tissue(sacrospinous ligament fixation, high uterosacral ligament suspension, ischial
        spinous fascia fixation, the Lefort operation and so on) and as well as anti-urinary
        incontinence surgeries(tension-free vaginal tape). The indications are respectively as
        follows:

          1. Total pelvic reconstruction with trans-vaginal mesh Indications: 1) Patients
             experienced recurrence of prolapse in the same compartment that has a history of
             pelvic floor repair surgery; 2) The choice for elder patients who will accept primary
             surgery for advanced POP (staging III or IV).

          2. Open/Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (Y-shape tape/self-cut synthesized mesh) Indications:
             1) Presenting with at least 3 prolapse of the uterus, with or without concomitant
             cystocele and rectocele; 2) Symptomatic stage 2 or greater prolapse of the vaginal
             vault or apical recurrence.

          3. Repair using native tissue(sacrospinous ligament fixation, high uterosacral ligament
             suspension, ischial spinous fascia fixation, Lefort) Indications:1)Presenting
             symptomatic stage 2 or greater prolapse of the uterus, with or without concomitant
             cystocele and rectocele. The procedure(sacrospinous ligament fixation, high
             uterosacral ligament suspension, ischial spinous fascia fixation) usually is performed
             after hysterectomy or when the uterus is preserved. 2)If postmenopausal women present
             with advanced uterus or vaginal apex prolapse, and have no desire of sexual life, the
             Lefort operation would be performed.

          4. Anti-urinary incontinence surgeries: tension-free vaginal tape. Indications: Stress
             urinary incontinence(SUI) patients who have 1）hyperactivity of urethra, or 2）internal
             urethral sphincter disorder; Or 3）mainly presenting SUI symptoms in patients with
             mixed urinary incontinence.

        2. The failure or recurrence of prolapse the same compartment that has been underwent
        repair using native tissue.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) the recurrence occurred on the same pelvic compartment with a prior history of
             prolapse repair surgery using mesh, an implant or a graft; (2) a prior history of
             anti-incontinence surgery using tape; however, patients who are inferred to accept
             procedures for POP this time are not included; (3) acute/chronic pelvic inflammation,
             genital tract infections；(4) any severe medical diseases that precluded the
             operations.
