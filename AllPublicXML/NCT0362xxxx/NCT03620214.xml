    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure some oral and maxillofacial physiological parameters,
      with a view to creating a modular prototype articulator from young children to adolescents by
      3D printing.

      In the dental field, the articulators present different interests during the diagnostic and
      treatments of the dental diseases. Thus they are used to perform dental prostheses,
      pre-orthodontic analysis or in the context of dysfunction of the manducatory apparatus.

      Many children affecting with genetic disease need prosthetic rehabilitation. However, none
      commercial articulators are adaptable to children. Consequently little dental prosthetic are
      taken before adolescence, or even adulthood.

      The aim of this study is to measure some oral and maxillofacial physiological parameters,
      with a view to creating a modular prototype articulator from young children to adolescents by
      3D printing.

      On average, 30 children per week visit the dental department of Reims CHU for dental
      screening or orthodontic diagnosis. From this cohort, an epidemiological study will be
      carried out. It will concern different physiological parameters of the face and the oral
      cavity necessary to make a prototype articulator.

      Ideally, the creation of a modular articulator to monitor the growth of a child would remove
      a number of diagnostic locks, therapeutic and technical.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        First 30 children in each age group ([3; 6 [; [6; 9 [; [9; 12]) presenting to the
        Odontology Division as part of a first dental care or orthodontic consultation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any child consulting to the Odontology Department in emergencies.

          -  Any child coming out of the weight-of- height growth curve. For example, a child below
             is considered to have hypo-development. Conversely, a child located above the growth
             curve is considered to be hyper-developed.

          -  Any child with absence of at least 2 teeth per quadrant whether it is a genetic
             etiology (agenesis), infectious (avulsion) or traumatic (expulsion).

          -  Any child with a maxillofacial malformation generating disorders of the face
             development (ex: child with a cleft palate ...)

          -  Any child presenting a Class III of Angle. Indeed the intermaxillary ratios being
             reversed, a hypo-development of the maxillary is often observed.

          -  Any child with a cognitive impairment that limits the understanding of the examination
             undertaken.

          -  Any non-cooperating child
