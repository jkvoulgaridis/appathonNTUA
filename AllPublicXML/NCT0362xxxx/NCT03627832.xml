      This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of insomnia treatment in improving insomnia
      symptoms and alcohol-related problems among heavy-drinking young adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heavy alcohol use is prevalent among young adults and results in significant physical and
      psychological burden. Despite wide implementation of alcohol risk reduction efforts on
      college campuses, rates of heavy alcohol consumption remain high, with 35% of students
      reporting consumption of 5+ drinks on the same occasion in the past 2 weeks. Thus, additional
      strategies are needed to reduce the burden of heavy alcohol use among college students. More
      than half of heavy-drinking college students report symptoms of insomnia. In turn, insomnia
      symptoms have been associated with increased risk of alcohol-related problems. The proposed
      project aims to reduce the burden of heavy alcohol use on college campuses by examining the
      efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in reducing alcohol use and
      related problems among heavy-drinking college students. Twenty seven young adults who
      indicate risk for problem drinking and meet DSM-5 criteria for Insomnia Disorder will
      participate in a 5-week pilot trial. Participants will complete five individual sessions of
      CBT-I. Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the active intervention period (6 weeks) and 1
      month post-intervention. Outcomes of interest include insomnia severity, total wake time,
      sleep quality, drinking quantity, and alcohol-related consequences. The proposed research
      aims to reduce the harms associated with heavy alcohol use among young adults by improving
      the availability of efficacious treatment. It will impact understanding of the benefits of
      CBT-I, and it is innovative because it evaluates improvement in insomnia as a mechanism for
      improvements in alcohol use disorder (AUD). This research is consistent with the National
      Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's initiative to evaluate and promote interventions
      that prevent the progression of AUD in diverse populations. It will enhance the stature of
      the university by improving our ability to compete successfully for federal funding to
      conduct high-quality research.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 8) to 1 month follow-up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index. Scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating higher insomnia severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 8) to 1 month follow-up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using daily sleep diaries and actigraphy -- sleep efficiency is the proportion of time spent in bed (from lights out until out of bed in the morning) that is actually spent sleeping (subtracting how long it took to fall asleep and how much time was spent awake in the middle of the night).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 8) to 1 month follow-up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using a single question on the daily sleep diary. Sleep quality score ranges from 0-4, where 0=very poor sleep quality and 4=very good sleep quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Drinking Quantity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 8) to 1 month follow-up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Daily Drinking Questionnaire. Participants estimate how many alcoholic drinks they typically consume on each day of the week, averaged over the past 3 months.Responses for drinking quantity range from 0 to infinity, where higher numbers indicate more standard drinks consumed per day. Reports from each day are summed to create a &quot;Drinks Per Week&quot; score. Participants also report the amount of time they typically spend drinking during each day of the week. Responses range from 0-24 hours per day, where higher numbers indicate more hours drinking.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol-related Consequences</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 8) to 1 month follow-up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire. Scores range from 0-24, with higher scores indicating more alcohol-related consequences.</description>

    <measure>Delay Discounting</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 8) to 1 month follow-up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Monetary Choice Questionnaire. Responses will be used to calculate discount rate (k), consistency of the discount rate (the inferred k), and the proportion of immediate reward choices (immediate choice ratios).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 8) to 1 month follow-up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Participants respond to words that describe negative feelings/emotions and report the extent (1-5) that they feel each emotion presently or during the past week. Higher scores indicate higher negative affect.</description>

            <description>Individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) delivered once a week.
Participants will attend 1-hour individual sessions of CBT-I once a week for five weeks. Consistent with clinical guidelines (Schutte-Rodin, Broch, Buysse, Dorsey, &amp; Sateia, 2008), treatment will include stimulus control (e.g., limit use of bed to sleep or sexual activity, get out of bed if lying awake for more than 20 minutes), sleep restriction (limit time in bed to amount of time spent sleeping on a typical night), sleep hygiene (e.g., avoid exercise within 2 hours of bedtime, create cool and dark sleep environment), relaxation training, and cognitive restructuring.
Participants will also receive a one-page handout on sleep hygiene that is consistent with what may be expected as standard care in a doctor’s visit with a primary care physician.</description>
