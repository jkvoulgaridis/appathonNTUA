  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirst is defined as the desire for water seeking and consumption, and is a prevalent symptom
      in the immediate postoperative period in all age groups. The elderly surgical patient,
      despite presenting reduced physiological responses to thirst and satiety, in clinical
      practice, it is observed that they have high thirst intensity. There is evidence that
      strategies using cold temperatures are effective in quenching thirst of the surgical patient,
      for this reason, the present study is justified, in order to find strategies that help to
      reduce thirst in this specific population that is the elderly surgical patient.

      The present study aims to: compare the intensity and discomfort of thirst in the use of the
      menthol popsicle and usual care in elderly patients in the immediate postoperative period.
      This is a randomized clinical trial, to be performed in a public tertiary hospital. The
      sample size calculation will be performed after the pilot test is conducted. Two groups will
      be formed through randomization. The tested intervention consists of the menthol popsicle
      (experimental group). Thirst intensity (primary outcome) will be measured by means of the
      Visual Numerical Scale and the discomfort of thirst (secondary outcome) through the
      Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale, in two moments: at the end of the first assesment of
      the patient and 20 minutes after the intervention. With the results of this study the intend
      is to offer to the scientific society subsidies on thirst presented by the elderly patients,
      generating evidence for the improvement of clinical practice. In addition to contributing to
      the preparation of health professionals in the assertive care of the elderly population, it
      is estimated to deepen the knowledge about appropriate and innovative interventions to manage
      the postoperative thirst of the elderly, considered to be this, a representative and growing
      part of the world population.

    <description>The Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale (PTDS) was used to assess thirst discomfort. This scale is composed of 7 attributes that evaluate the signs of discomfort of perioperative thirst, as follows: dry mouth, dry lips, thick tongue, thick saliva, bad taste in the mouth, and desire to drink water. Each attribute varies between 0 (not uncomfortable), 1 (a little uncomfortable), and 2 (very uncomfortable). The final sum of the PTDS can range from 0 to 14 points, and 14 corresponds to the most intense thirst discomfort reported by the patient.</description>

    <description>Allocation concealment was performed through the use of individual opaque envelopes numbered externally in sequence, containing the randomly defined group information.This was performed by a researcher who did not participate in the data collection. The intensity of the initial thirst was measured by Visual Numerical Scale (VNS), which ranged from 0 (no thirst) to 10 (very intense thirst) and the discomfort of the initial thirst was measured through the Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale (PTDS), which is composed of 7 attributes and ranges from 0 to 14. After 20 minutes of the intervention (menthol popsicle), the final intensity and discomfort were measured using the same scales.</description>

    <description>When allocated in the control group, the intensity of the initial thirst was measured by Visual Numerical Scale (VNS), which ranged from 0 (no thirst) to 10 (very intense thirst) and the discomfort of the initial thirst was measured through the Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale (PTDS), which is composed of 7 attributes and ranges from 0 to 14. After maintaining the usual care, that is, reaffirming the need for absolute fasting of food and drinks for 20 minutes, the final intensity and discomfort were measured using the same scales.</description>
