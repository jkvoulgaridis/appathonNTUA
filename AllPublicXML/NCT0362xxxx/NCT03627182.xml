      The purpose of this study is to prove that the group treated with CKD-501 in combination
      added that the reduction of glycated hemoglobin superior to placebo treated group added in
      combination.

      The aim of this phase III study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional
      combined CKD-501 administration for 24 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes who were not
      adequately controlled for blood glucose by the combination of D150 and D745 25mg .

      Furthermore, the extension study for additional 28 weeks is designed to confirm long term
      safety of actual drug as an oral hypoglycemic agent.
