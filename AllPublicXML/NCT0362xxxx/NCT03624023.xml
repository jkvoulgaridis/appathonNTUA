        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults at least 20 years of age.

          2. With diagnosed diabetic mellitus (DM), e.g. currently under DM medication treatment,
             or with HbA1c ≧6.5% but &lt; 12%, or with fasting plasma glucose ≧126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L),
             or with plasma glucose ≧ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) in the two-hour 75-gram oral glucose
             tolerance test (OGTT).

          3. With at least one cutaneous ulcer on the foot or the lower legs, and not healing for
             at least 4 weeks (the ≧2-week standard of care period can be counted as part of the
             4-week ulcer history).

          4. With ankle brachial index (ABI) ≥ 0.4 on the limb with the study ulcer. For subjects
             with 0.6＞ABI ≧0.4, the investigator will arrange for providing proper treatment to the
             subject, such as improving circulation by medication or surgical procedures, etc.

          5. The study wound is not prone to infection.

          6. The wound should allow complete sealing of the wound by TegadermTM film.

          7. The study wound size is between 1~33 cm2. The depth of wound may reach ligament, joint
             capsule, fascia, or tendon. There should be no sign of osteomyelitis. The wound does
             not exceed Wagner Grade 27.

          8. Under the standard care of Investigator for at least 2 weeks, the study wound has not
             shown significant healing. Significant healing is defined as the following: The area
             of healed tissue reaches at least 30% of the area of initially presented wound.

          9. When the subject has more than one wound which met the inclusion criteria, only one
             wound is selected as the study wound. The other wounds will be treated by standard
             cares.

         10. Co-morbidities are under control and non-life threatening as determined by the
             Investigator based on medical history, physical examination, vital signs, or clinical
             laboratory tests, etc.

         11. A negative pregnancy test at Screening. This applies to any female subject with
             childbearing potential.

         12. Agrees to use acceptable contraceptive methods while on study (from signing informed
             consent form to the end of the study). This applies to any female subject with
             childbearing potential and any male subject whose female partner has childbearing
             potential.

             Acceptable contraceptive methods include:

               1. Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception

               2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps)

         13. Able to follow the Investigator's instruction on wound care.

         14. With signed informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Being pregnant or nursing.

          2. With autoimmune disease other than diabetes, e.g. lupus erythematosus, multiple
             sclerosis.

          3. With current malignancy or hypo-immunity.

          4. With history of recurrent cancer, metastatic cancer, cancer which has high probability
             of metastasis, or cancer on the limb where the study wound is located.

          5. With serum chemistry abnormalities below

               1. AST or ALT &gt; 5 × ULN,

               2. Serum albumin &lt; 2.0 g/dL,

          6. With history of HIV infection

          7. With history of alcoholism or drug abuse.

          8. Received any cell-based product at the study wound.

          9. Received an investigational drug, device or biological/bioactive treatment within 30
             days prior to Screening Visit.

         10. With any clinical condition or significant concurrent disease judged by the
             investigator to complicate the evaluation of the trial treatment.

         11. With history of sensitivity to materials of bovine, porcine origin, or human serum
             albumin.

         12. With active infection or active osteomyelitis in the study wound.
