  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are commonly prescribed for surgical patients to treat moderate to severe pain after
      surgery. However, opioids can be associated with serious complications such as respiratory
      depression and death. Currently, it is not routine practice to educate surgical patients
      about the risks of opioids and how to safely use opioids after surgery. The investigators
      have developed an educational pamphlet specifically for surgical patients to educate them
      about the safe use of opioids. The objective of this pilot study is to determine the
      usability and readability of an educational pamphlet about the safe use, proper storage and
      disposal of opioids. The educational pamphlet will be modified based on the feedback from the
      pilot study and subsequently used for a randomized controlled trial.

      Twenty participants presenting to the preoperative clinic will be recruited for the pilot
      study. After informed consent is obtained, patients will be given an opioid knowledge
      questionnaire to complete before the education. They will then be given an educational
      pamphlet to review. After they have reviewed the educational pamphlet, they will complete the
      same opioid knowledge questionnaire. They will also complete a questionnaire evaluating the
      patient educational pamphlet. The pamphlet will be modified based on the feedback from the
      patients in the pilot study.
