  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the satiating effects of different gummies with
      encapsulated flavour on overweight subjects (BMI ≥25 and &lt;30 kg / m2). Some studies have
      shown that the contribution of different flavours could reduce food intake. This have made
      grown the interest of food industry in incorporate these compounds in food and to being able
      to develop new functional foods into the control of body weight, as well as variables of
      glucose metabolism and lipid profile, which can contribute to te prevention of cardiovascular
      diseases.

      A randomized, cross-over and double-blind pilot study with 3 study arms is being performed to
      evaluate the satiating properties of the encapsulated flavours in different gummies in a
      group of healthy overweight subjects.

      The investigators included 12 participants (6 men and 6 women) between 18 and 55 years (BMI
      ≥25 and &lt;30 kg / m2). All volunteers will be randomized into 3 study groups, and participants
      will receive the 3 different study products in order during the 3 experimental phases.

    <time_frame>Day 1, 8, 15</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). 100mm horizontal line anchored at each end with the extremes of the subjective feeling to be quantified. Subjects are instructed to rate the sensation being experienced according to how they define the line. e.g., &quot;not at all hungry&quot; (0mm) and &quot;as hungry as I have ever felt&quot; (100mm). Multiple measures are taken at repeated time intervals described below.</description>
