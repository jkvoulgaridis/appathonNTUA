  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of ginger on the incidence of postoperative nausea and
      vomiting in patients undergoing gynaecological surgery. Half the patients were given an oral
      dose of ginger preoperatively and half received placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) commonly complicate surgery and may lead to a
      prolonged length of stay in hospital, increased complication rates and decreased patient
      satisfaction. Gynaecological surgery is considered high risk for PONV.

      Ginger is a cheap, widely available and safe natural product in Jamaica and has been found to
      reduce the incidence of Nausea and vomiting in other clinical situations, such as in
      pregnancy. It is believed to act via the inhibition of serotonergic receptors.
