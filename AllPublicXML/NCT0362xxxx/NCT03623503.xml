  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS) diagnosis is difficult due to lack of sensivity and
      specificity markers. The investigators conduced a restrospectif study to all term born
      infants born between 1 january and 31 December 2013 and hospitalized for suspect EOS. The
      presence of neonatal symptoms at birth appears to be a useful clinical marker of probable
      neonatal EOS.

      neonatal early onset spesis (EOS) remains animportant etiology of neonatal morbidity and
      mortality. Neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS) diagnosis is difficult due to lack of sensivity
      and specificity markers. Diagnosis is difficults due to lack of sensivity and specificity
      markers. The investigators conduced a restrospectif study to all term born infants born
      between 1 january and 31 December 2013 and hospitalized for suspect EOS.The objective of the
      study was to identify early clinical signs in newborn infants with suspected neonatal sepsis
      to differentiate a likely infection with pathogen bacteria in the gastric suction culture.The
      presence of neonatal symptoms at birth appears to be a useful clinical marker of probable
      neonatal EOS.

    <description>The objective of the study was to determine early clinical signs in newborn infants with suspected neonatal sepsis to differentiate a likely infection with pathogen bacteria in gastric suction culture.The investigators conduced a retrospective study and all term newborn infant born between 1 january and 31 december 2013 and hospitalized for suspected EOS were included.From the computerized medical file, which is filled in exhaustively, the data were given in the form of continuous values or in the form of a category: maternal age, gestationality, delivery period, delivery method, childbirth administration of maternal antibiotherapy. the parameters at birth were recorded in the same way: sex of the newborn, measurements of birth (birth weight, height, cranial perimeter).</description>
