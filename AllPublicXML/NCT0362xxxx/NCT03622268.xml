  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although predicted REE calculated using the Penn state 1988 method agreed (ICC 0.61,
      p=0.00014) with the measured REE, all three predictive equations had a fixed bias and
      appeared to be inaccurate for predicting REE for liver transplant recipients.

      Therefore, precise measurements using indirect calorimetry may be helpful when treating
      critically ill patients to avoid underestimating or overestimating their metabolic needs.

      Rationale: The aim of this study was to compare predictive equations with indirect
      calorimetry and identify the appropriate energy expenditure requirement of liver
      transplant(LT) recipients in South Korea.

      Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in a surgical ICU in an academic
      tertiary hospital over three months. Thirty mechanically ventilated patients who had received
      liver transplants and were expected to stay in the ICU more than 2 days were studied. Resting
      energy expenditure(REE) was measured 48 hours after ICU admission using open-circuit indirect
      calorimetry. Theoretical REE was estimated using three predictive equations: Harris-Benedict
      methods, lreton-Jones ventilated, and Penn state 1988. The REEs derived from each predictive
      equation were compared with the measured REE using an intraclass correlation coefficient
      (ICC) and a Bland-Altman plot.
