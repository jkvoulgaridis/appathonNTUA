  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this unfunded, investigator-initiated prospective, observational, explorative,
      single-arm and diagnostic single-centre study the investigators aim to evaluate medication
      adherence in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to investigate drug adherence in cirrhotic patients and to
      gain a better understanding of the causes of deficient adherence including evaluation for
      medication beliefs, satisfaction, depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life. A
      number of long-term medications have been approved for this group of patients in various
      indications and / or recommended by guidelines. However, adherence has not been adequately
      investigated yet. The investigators aim to focus on the following groups of ingredients /
      classes:

        -  Primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. Norfloxacin)

        -  Non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. Carvedilol and Propranolol)

        -  diuretics (Spirolactones [e.g. Spironolacton], loop diuretics) Methodically, this is
           will be investigated in particular by taking into account the patients history,
           standardized questionnaires and validated interviews.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence with BAASIS</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be investigated by using the BAASIS interview ((Basel Assessment of Adherence with Immunosuppressive Medication Scale)) The investigators use a validated German version of this instruments. Adherence is classified by means of a reliable rating system. For the BAASIS: Any YES on any of the questions 1a, 1B, 2 or 3 indicates an issue with implementation.&quot;YES&quot; on item 4 indicates non‐persistence of medication use. For the BAASIS the Overall can be quantified with both ways: as a dichtomus variable or as a continuous variable. The dichotomous variable of the BAASIS will use the scores on the questions assessing implementation and persistence (Questions 1a, 1b, 2, 3 and 4). The continuous variable will use a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) assessing overall medication adherence over the last 4 weeks with higher scores represent higher perceived overall adherence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence with MARS</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be investigated by using the MARS (&quot;Medication Adherence Report Scale&quot; ) questionnaire (self-report). The investigators use a validated German version of this instruments. Adherence is classified by means of a reliable rating system. This 5-items scale asks respondents to rate the frequency with which they engage in each of 5 aspects of non-adherent behaviour Eg deciding to miss a dose, forgetting to take a dose), rated on a five point scale (where 5=never, 4 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 2 = often and 1= very often). Scores for each of the 5 items were summed to give a scale score ranging from 5 to 25, where higher scores indicate higher levels of reported adherence.
Adherence can be expressed as a continuous scale, or by separating into 'high' and 'low' adherence groups on the basis of scale scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>Medication satisfactions is evaluated by using a self-report validated 19-item questionnaire ; the SIMS-D (&quot;Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale&quot;). Mediaction satisfaction is classified by means of a reliable rating system.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication belief</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the &quot;Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire&quot; (BMQ) as reliable survey tool for recording drug-related beliefs and perceptions of their benefits and / or harms. For this projects the investigators will use most recent German version authored by Nestoriuc et al. The BMQ is divided into a general and a drug-specific section. Medication belief is classified by means of a reliable rating system.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be evaluated by another self-reported instrument, the &quot;Patient Health Questionnaire&quot; (PHQ 9), which is a screening tool for depression disorders with a sufficient reliability. Depression is classified by means of a reliable rating system.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use GAD 7 (&quot;Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screeners&quot;), another questionnaire, to screen for general anxiety disorders. This refers to the last 2 weeks and covers the most important clinical criteria according to DSM-IV. Anxiety is classified by means of a reliable rating system.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>In addition, the investigators will use the CLDQ &quot;Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire&quot; to examine the health-related quality of life in patients with hepatopathy regardless of severity or aetiology with high reliability. HRQoL is classified by means of a reliable rating system. The scale values of the subject are obtained by assigning 1 (always), 2 (mostly), 3 (common), 4 (repeated), 5 (sometimes), 6 (rare) and 7 (never)points. The values of the subscales of the original version are obtained by adding the items of the respective scale on the CLDQ-D evaluation sheet. The range of possible values per scale is between 1 and 7. Normative values of a representative population sample are not available. For comparison, the results of clinical trials can be used. Low values mean a reduced, high values a good health-related quality of life</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>At last, the investigators will evaluate the participant knowledge about their medication by using a self-constructed questionnaire. For this purpose we constructed an own Rating System.</description>

    <measure>Sociodemographic data</measure>
    <time_frame>One-point first visit, cross-section-designed study during the 24 month study period</time_frame>
    <description>Sociodemographic data (e.g. age, education, income) will be collected with another self-constructed questionnaire in addition to already collected data of patients history from the disease record</description>
