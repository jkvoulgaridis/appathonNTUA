  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of Neurodevelopmental Treatment
      (NDT)-based upper limb rehabilitation and video-game based therapy (VGBT) with Nintendo® Wii
      and LMC games on upper extremity functions in patients with Cerebral Palsy (CP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that VGBT using the Nintendo® Wii and LMC would be a usable
      tool to train manual dexterity in patients with CP as comprehensive and holistic therapy.

      The NDT program for both groups will be routinely applied according to each child's
      individual needs and included tonus regulation, support of sensation, perception and motor
      development for gross motor function.

      The two different patient-centered rehabilitation programs will be conducted with an average
      of one hour sessions three times a week for 8 weeks in both groups. The two different
      patient-centered programs will be as VGBT with Nintendo® Wii and LMC games (Group I) and
      NDT-based upper limb rehabilitation (Group II).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Minnesota Hand Dexterity Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks, follow up at two months</time_frame>
    <description>Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT): is a short version of the Minnesota Dexterity Tests and consists of two timed sub-tests (&quot;placing&quot; and &quot;turning tests&quot;) to assess the required manual dexterity to turn and/or place 60 short, round blocks with one or both hands . In this study, the placing sub-test will be used to assess the ability to handle objects, measured by the time required to complete the task.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks, follow up at two months</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) measures the muscle spasticity rate (score, 0-5). Spasticity of wrist flexors, elbow flexors and forearm pronators will be assessed due to MAS in this study. Participants sat with their forearm fully supported and will be instructed to relax. The measurer moves the wrist into extension as fast as possible and then rated the quality of the muscle reaction to stretch on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 representing no spasticity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand and pinch grips</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks, follow up at two months</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength was measured using a standard adjustable handle Jamar® Plus+Hand Dynamometer (Irvington NY, USA) in the sitting position with the shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated and the elbow flexed at 90. Pinch strengths (tip, key and palmar pinch) will be measured by a hydraulic pinch gauge (Irvington NY, USA) in the sitting position with the shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated and the elbow flexed at 90. Pinch positions will be defined using the American Society for Hand Therapists guideline. Each of grip and pinch strength tests will be performed thrice with a 30-sec interval between tests, and the mean value will be recorded.</description>

    <description>VGBT with Nintendo® Wii and LMC games:
In order to improve the elbow and shoulder functions, Tennis and boxing, the games of Nintendo Wii® Fit WiiSports package that includes shoulder and elbow movements will be used for VGBT with Nintendo® Wii and Leap Motion Controller (LMC) games. In both of the games, the activities are carried out by providing feedback in the context of remote control and sound and vibration notifications.</description>

    <description>NDT-based upper limb rehabilitation:
NDT-based upper limb rehabilitation aims to facilitate normal movement for upper extremity activities such as getting dressed and eating etc by using real materials (clothes, spoons, pencils, buttons, rope, etc.). The target activities were practised with the materials such as velcro cylinders, skill cubes, exercise bands, screw sets, therapeutic putty, and tripled coordination tools.</description>
