  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to investigate the incidence of caries in pits and fissures
      sealed with a bioactive sealant compared to a fluoride releasing resin based pits and
      fissures sealant in preventive treatment procedures in adult population over a six months
      period.

      The study will be conducted in Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo
      University, The operator in charge will be: Mohamed Tarek Heiba. The researcher will bear
      ultimate responsibility for all activities associated with the conduct of a research project
      including recruitment of patients, explaining and performing the procedures to them,A total
      of 40 volunteer patients with at least 2 non-cavitated molar teeth will be assigned in this
      study. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups according to type of sealant (S)
      where in group S1, pits and fissures will be sealed with bioactive pits-and-fissure sealant;
      while group S2, pits and fissures will be sealed with fluoride releasing resin based pits and
      fissures sealant. Each restoration will be assessed after three, six months,The tooth will be
      illuminated with a violet light approximately 405 nm thus stimulating both prophyrins to emit
      red light that contains less energy. the denser the bacteria colonization on tooth's surface,
      the more intense the red fluorescent signal; in contrast sound enamel sent out a green
      fluorescent signal. These light signals are recorded by the highly developed optics and
      analyzed by the device's software. The software filters and quantifies the fluorescence
      emitted by the dental tissue and converts the relationship between green and red.
