  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is to undergo chemotherapy to slow the
      spread of the disease and relieve some symptoms of cancer. Patients will have already had at
      least one chemotherapy treatment for their disease at this stage.

      CFI-400945 is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests show that it works by
      blocking a specific protein called Polo-like Kinase 4 (PLK4) that is involved in cancer cell
      growth. CFI-400945 may slow down the growth of cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die.
      This drug has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in some patients
      and appears well tolerated with little side effects. CFI-400945 seems promising but it is not
      clear if it can offer better results than standard therapy.

          -  Patients may not receive concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy (other
             than bone-targeted therapy, if already taking and stable) or investigational agents
             while on protocol therapy.

          -  Patients who have received growth factors within 28 days prior to initiation of dosing
             of CFI-400945 or who will require treatment with growth factors throughout the

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Patients being treated with drugs listed in Appendix V Table 1 are excluded. Patients
             being treated with drugs listed in Appendix V Table 2 may be enrolled, but should be
             monitored carefully for toxicities resulting from potential interactions between
             CFI-400945m and these drugs. In addition, patients must avoid consumption of the fruit
             or juice of Seville oranges (e.g. marmalade), grapefruit, pomelos and star fruit from
             7 days before the first dose of study drug and during the entire study due to
             potential CYP3A4 interaction with the study drug. Regular orange juice is allowed.

          -  Patients with history of central nervous system metastases or spinal cord compression
             unless they have received definitive treatment, are clinically stable and do not
             require corticosteroids.

             agents including significant bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease or
             uncontrolled nausea or vomiting.

             thrombosis or pulmonary embolus who are being treated with therapeutic doses of low
