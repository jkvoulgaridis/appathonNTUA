  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is a parallel longitudinal protocol where half patients receive a experimental protocol and
      the other half receive orientation to maintain your daily live routine as usually. The
      experimental protocol include Ballet sessions. The hypothesis is interventional group will
      improve the balance control more than control group.

    <description>The classic ballet classes will respect biological limits of children. The sessions will be 75 minutes long, twice a week during 8 weeks. The class sequence will be: warm-up, follow by exercises about upper and lower limbs ballet positions and sequences of ballet jumps, and at the end a cool-down.</description>
