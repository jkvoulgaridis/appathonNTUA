      Two-part study consisting of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study at two
      target dose levels (Part 1) and an open-label, non-randomized study (Part 2) to determine the
      efficacy of ABX-1431 in treating adult patients with Tourette syndrome or Chronic Motor Tic
      Disorder as measured by the change from baseline in Total Tic Score of the Yale Global Tic
      Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS) compared with placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ABX-1431 is a potent and selective, orally available, irreversible inhibitor of
      monoacylglycerol lipase, a metabolic enzyme that regulates the activity of the endogenous
      cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system. It is being developed as a potential first-in-class
      compound for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome.

      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and effect on tics ABX-1431 in adults with
      Tourette Syndrome or chronic motor tic disorder in an 8-week study. It is a two-part study.
      Part 1 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of ABX-1431 at two target dose
      levels. Part 2 is an optional, open-label, non-randomized study of ABX-1431.

      Patients will participate in the main study (Part 1) for approximately 10 to 14 weeks (up to
      30-day screening period; 56-day treatment period; 14-day follow-up period). For patients who
      choose to participate in Part 2, there is a period of up to 4 weeks between the last study
      visit in Part 1 and first study visit in Part 2. Patients who choose to enter Part 2 will be
      treated with open-label ABX-1431 for an additional 6 weeks (28-day treatment period; 14-day
      follow-up period).

    <time_frame>Day 56 (40 mg ABX-1431 per day) and Day 28 (20 mg ABX-1431 per day)</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale Global Tourette Severity Scale (YGTSS) is a clinician-completed rating scale to capture TS symptom severity. The number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of both motor and vocal tics are rated on an ordinal scale between 0 and 5, with higher scores indicating greater severity. Motor and vocal tics subscales are reported (0 - 25) and then summed for a total tic score (TTS) (0 - 50). The TTS has been used as the registration endpoint for pharmacological therapies. The YGTSS has an Impairment subscale (0 - 50) which is then added for a total global score of 0 - 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Part 1: days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56; Part 2: days 0, 14, 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Adult Tic Questionnaire (ATQ) is a tic self-rating scale. The ATQ records the occurrence, frequency and intensity for any of 27 endorsed common motor and vocal tics. The occurrence is being indicated as 1 for a present tic or 0 if no tic has been experienced. Frequency is measured on a scale from 1 (weekly frequency or less) to 4 (constant tics, almost all the time during the day). Intensity is being rated on a scale of 1 - 4 with 1 representing mild tics and 4 strong tics. The ATQ will principally be analyzed by summing the product of the intensity (1-4) and frequency (1-4) to determine the severity (2-8) across all endorsed tics. For clarity, the number of each endorsed tic and the total of intensity and frequency across all tics may be separately analyzed by mixed-model repeated-measures. The clinical relevance of changes in the ATQ may also be presented by the change in the average intensity and frequency score.</description>

    <time_frame>Part 1: days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56; Part 2: days 0, 14, 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS) is a patient self-assessment of the intensity of agreement of several statements describing the unpleasant qualities of premonitory feelings preceding tics. Each statement is being rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The total score is being calculated by summing the single scores. The range of the total score is between 9, corresponding to a minimal intensity of premonitory urges for tics and 36, an extremely high intensity with probable severe impairment.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) is a 7-point ordinal, clinician-rated scale used to assess patients' overall improvement in disease status relative to their condition at baseline. A rating of 1 indicates a very much improved condition, compared to the subject's prior condition, while a rating of 7 means a very much worse condition respectively.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is a male or female ≥ 18 to 64 years of age at the Screening Visit.

          2. Patient has a diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome or Chronic Motor Tic Disorder as defined
             by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
             criteria.

          3. Patient's YGTSS-TTS results must be ≥ 22 (range 0-50) at the Baseline/Randomization
             Visit.

          4. At the Baseline/Randomization Visit patients must be taking a stable drug regimen for
             tics and comorbidities for 30 days and must be expected to remain on a stable drug
             regimen during this study. Patients receiving no medication for TS may participate.
             Patients who have recently discontinued medication for tics must have discontinued
             them for at least 30 days. For neuroleptic drugs (e.g., risperidone, aripiprazole),
             the minimum discontinuation period is 30 days prior to the Baseline/Randomization
             Visit. For injectable depot neuroleptic drugs the minimum discontinuation period is
             one dosage cycle plus 14 days. (See Inclusion 'f' for discontinuation period of
             cannabinoid medication in patients using these products for tics.)

          5. Patient is legally competent, has been informed of the nature and scope of relevance
             for the study, voluntarily agrees to participation, agrees to the study restrictions,
             and has signed the informed consent form (ICF) approved by the Ethics Review Committee
             (ERC).

          6. Patients using cannabinoid medications for their tics must discontinue their use at
             least 14 days prior to the Baseline/Randomization Visit. The investigator and patient
             must be confident that these patients will not require these medications for the
             duration of the study until 14 days after the last dose of study medication. Examples
             of cannabinoids include cannabis in any form, nabilone or Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
             (THC)-containing medications such as nabiximols (Sativex®) or dronabinol. The use of
             recreational cannabinoids during this study is not permitted.

          7. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test [serum
             or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)] at the Screening Visit and other
             indicated visits. They must practice a highly effective, reliable, and medically
             approved contraceptive regimen during the study (e.g., theoretical failure rate less
             than 1% per year as described in the 2014 Heads of Medicines Agencies: Clinical Trials
             Facilitation Group report on contraception in clinical trials, which include oral or
             parenteral or implanted hormonal contraception, vaginal ring releasing hormonal
             contraception (e.g., Nuvaring, intrauterine device, or intrauterine system).
             Post-menopausal women may enter this study. Post-menopausal women are defined as those
             without menses in the past 12 months, and with a serum follicle stimulating hormone
             (FSH) in the post-menopausal range. Women who are surgically sterile may enter this
             study with written documentation of the surgical procedure.

          8. Male patients must be willing to use a condom with sexual partners during this study
             until 14 days after the last dose of study medication. Male patients must be willing
             to abstain from sperm donation for 3 months after the completion of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is taking strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5 or
             CYP2C9. Examples of strong CYP3A4/5 inducers include carbamazepine, efavirenz,
             nevirapine, barbiturates, pioglitazone, modafinil, enzalutamide, oxcarbazepine,
             rifampicin, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), and phenytoin. Examples of potent
             CYP3A4/5 inhibitors include atazanavir, boceprevir, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice,
             indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, suboxone, nelfinavir, posaconazole,
             ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole. Examples of CYP2C9 strong
             inducers/inhibitors include carbamazepine, enzalutamide, fluconazole, valproic acid,
             phenobarbital, nevirapine, rifampicin, and St. John's Wort.

          2. Patient has evidence of alcohol abuse or dependence, as defined by the DSM-5 criteria,
             with two or more of the 11 criteria at the Screening Visit or within 1 year before the
             Screening Visit.

          3. Patient has evidence of drug or chemical abuse (except nicotine), as defined by the
             DSM-5 criteria, at the Screening Visit or within 1 year before the Screening Visit.
             Patient has evidence of marijuana or cannabis dependency or has been treated for
             cannabis dependency, as defined by DSM-5 criteria, at the Screening Visit or within 1
             year before the Screening Visit. (Patients who are prescribed stimulants should not be
             assessed for Stimulant Use Disorder. Patients who use cannabinoid-based medicine
             (e.g., cannabis in any form, nabilone, or THC-containing medications) for treatment of
             Tourette Syndrome with the investigator's knowledge should not be assessed for
             Cannabis Use Disorder, but these patients must comply with abstinence requirements for
             this study (See Inclusion 'f')). Patients who have a positive urine drug screen at the
             Screening Visit for drugs other than those allowed, as indicated in this criterion,
             are excluded.

          4. Patient is unwilling to comply with study restrictions including abstinence from
             cannabis and alcohol from the Baseline/Randomization Visit until the follow-up
             telephone call 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

          5. Patients receiving ongoing psychological therapy for tics such as Habit Reversal
             Training or Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics are excluded. Patients who
             have completed behavioral therapy for tics at least 30 days before the
             Baseline/Randomization Visit may participate.

          6. Patient is a lactating or pregnant female, or a female who intends to become pregnant
             within 90 days following the last dose of study medication.

          7. Patient has one or more of the following laboratory results at the Screening Visit:

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt; 3 x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome)

          8. Patient has an estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute at the Screening
             Visit. Creatinine clearance (Clcr) is estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) equation
             from a spot serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the following formula:

             CLcr (mL/min) = [140 − age (years)] × weight (kg) / 72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)] ×
             [0.85 for female patients]

          9. Patient has a serum albumin level below the laboratory normal range at the Screening
             Visit, and the physician cannot rule out hepatic insufficiency based on consideration
             of clinical symptoms, clinical signs, and other laboratory tests. (The physician may
             decide that a low value of a serum albumin is clinically insignificant or the test may
             be repeated.)

         10. Patient has symptomatic chronic Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus infection.
             Asymptomatic seropositive individuals without clinical or clinical laboratory
             manifestations of hepatitis may be enrolled.

         11. Patient has a clinically significant abnormality on the ECG at the Screening Visit.

         12. Patients with a history of cancer will be excluded, with two exceptions: Patients with
             a history of squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin treated with documented
             success of curative therapy &gt; 3 months may be enrolled. Patients with cancer and in
             remission with no treatment for at least 2 years prior to the Screening Visit may be
             enrolled.

         13. Patient has Tourette Syndrome or Chronic Motor Tic Disorder and also has mental
             retardation, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), dystonia, or post-traumatic stress
             disorder (PTSD). Mental retardation may be defined by medical history. (If the
             patient's available medical history is unclear, the investigator may use any validated
             screening test such as the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II); an
             intelligence quotient &lt; 80 (well below average) is an exclusion). ASD and PTSD may be
             determined by medical history. (If the patient's available medical history is unclear,
             the investigator may use the diagnostic criteria for ASD and PTSD, as defined by the
             DSM-5.)

         14. Patient has confounding medical conditions such as active infection, primary or
             acquired immunodeficiency (HIV testing is not mandated), uncontrolled diabetes (i.e.,
             known Type 1 or 2 diabetes with most recent HbA1c level &gt; 9.0% or has not had an HbA1c
             measurement within past 12 months), clinically significant cardiac disease (i.e.,
             significant cardiac conduction abnormalities, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmia or unstable angina &lt; 6 months to enrollment, New York
             Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac
             arrhythmia requiring medication, Grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease, and
             history of cerebrovascular accident within 6 months), clinically significant renal
             disease (e.g., acute kidney injury (e.g., hematuria, oligouria, or an acute rise in
             serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg / dL (≥ 44 umol/L)) or chronic kidney disease defined by
             estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml / min or oligouria), or any suspected
             hepatic insufficiency. (See Exclusions 'g' 'h' and 'i' for laboratory test exclusion
             limits.) Physicians should rely on the medical history, physical examination, and
             protocol specified laboratory tests to exclude individuals with these conditions.

         15. Patient has a diagnosis of any psychiatric comorbidity such obsessive compulsive
             disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, and/or
             depression and has undergone a change in therapy in the 30 days before the
             Baseline/Randomization Visit or is in need of a change in treatment. Patients with
             stable obsessive compulsive disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or
             depression requiring no alteration in therapy may be enrolled. Patients with a past
             history of psychosis or schizophrenia at any time are excluded.

         16. Patient has a history of suicidal ideation with intent to act or a plan to act, or a
             suicide attempt in the last 3 years preceding the Baseline/Randomization Visit.

         17. Patient has participated in an investigational study for medications with the last
             visit within 1 month for a non-biologic agent and 90 days for a biologic agent of the
             Baseline/Randomization Visit. The total volume of blood donated in the past 56 days
             may not exceed 450 mL.

         18. Patient is an employee of the investigative site or sponsor or a close relative of an
             employee of the investigative site.

         19. Patient has intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product,
             ABX-1431 or the excipients. The excipients used in the capsule formulation are
             microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate (vegetable
             origin), and gelatin capsule shells. The capsule shells are comprised of gelatin, red
             iron oxide, and titanium dioxide.
