    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify determinants of long-term patient
      satisfaction after hand reconstruction using silicone metacarpophalangeal arthroplasty
      (SMPA). The investigators hypothesize that appearance of the hand, ulnar drift, range of
      motion, pain, hand function and intake of the newer antirheumatic drugs (i.e. biologicals)
      influence patient satisfaction.

      This is an ambidirectional, monocenter research project consisting of a retrospective chart
      review and a prospective cohort project.

      Participants fulfilling all of the following inclusion criteria are eligible for the project:

        -  Patients with rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) / Psoriasisarthritis / Lupus erythomatodes who
           had a SMPA between Jan 2007 and one year before the project examination

        -  Informed Consent as documented by signature

      The presence of any one of the following exclusion criteria will lead to exclusion of the
      participant:

        -  Major surgery at another joint at the hand (e.g. proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint
           arthroplasty, thumb trapeziectomy) less than 6 months ago

        -  Legal incompetence

        -  German language barrier to complete the questionnaires

    <description>The primary outcome is the satisfaction with the treatment result at least one year after surgery and its determinants.
It will be quantified using this question: How satisfied are you with the overall result of the SMPA surgery? The response options are: Very satisfied (score 1), somewhat satisfied (score 2), neither satisfied nor unsatisfied (score 3), somewhat unsatisfied (score 4), very unsatisfied (score 5).
For further analyses, this question can be dichotomized into the categories of &quot;satisfied patients&quot; (very satisfied / satisfied) and &quot;unsatisfied patients&quot; (neither satisfied nor dissatisfied or worse).</description>
