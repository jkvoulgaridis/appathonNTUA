      İn this study Study; Between August 2018 and August 2019, the Ministry of Health, Medeniyet
      University, Göztepe Training and Research Hospital, Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic Will be
      Included for Routine Control Purposes, Single Pregnancies Between 16-24 Weeks and no Known
      Risk Factors for Preterm Delivery . Each Participant Will be Given Written and Verbal
      Information About the Work and Will be Informed. Uterocervical Angle Measurement;
      Dorsolithotomy, Using a Sterilized Vaginal Ultrasonic Probe. It Will be Seen That the
      Distance Between the Internal Cervical os and the External Cervical os is Inclusive of the
      Cervical Isthmus That Can be Seen With the Anterior Uterine Wall. The First Line Will be
      Drawn Between the Internal Cervical os and the External Cervical os. The Second Line Will be
      Drawn as Passing Through the Internal Cervical Ostia, Parallel to the Anterior Uterine Wall.
      The Angle Between the Two Lines on the Internal Cervical Vertebra Will be Measured. Patients
      Will be Followed up Until the End of the 37th Gestational Week. The Gestation Week They Are
      Giving Birth Will be Recorded. Patients Were Then Classified as Before and After 37
      Gestational Weeks and Uterocervical Angle Measurements Between 16-24 Gestational Weeks Were
      Compared.
