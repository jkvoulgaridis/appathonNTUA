    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Bexsero
      (meningococcal group B vaccine-rMenB+OMV NZ) in North American infants 6 weeks through 12
      months of age, when administered concomitantly with Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13)
      and other recommended routine infant vaccines(RIV).

      This study will be divided into 3 timepoints:

        -  Epoch 1- Primary- From day 1 to day 301

        -  Epoch 2-Secondary-From day 301 to day 331

        -  Epoch 3-Safety follow up -From day 331 to study end (day 661) In addition to receiving
           the study vaccines, infants will also receive non-study vaccines such as Diphtheria,
           tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed vaccine (DTPa, Infanrix) and
           Haemophilus influenzae type b Conjugate Vaccine (Hib, Hiberix), to ease the disruption
           to the standard infant vaccine schedule caused by participating in this study.

    <masking_description>Observer-blind study Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. By observer blind, it is meant that during the course of the study, the subject/parent/caregiver, site and sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the subjects are blinded while other study personnel are aware of the treatment assignment. To do so, vaccine preparation and administration will be done by authorized medical personnel who will not participate in any of the study clinical evaluation assays or procedures.
The serological data, which would lead to the unblinding of the study groups, will not be available during the course of the study to any investigator or any person involved in the clinical conduct of the study. The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing will be blinded to the treatment, subject and visit number, and codes will be used to link the subject, visit and study to each sample.</masking_description>

    <description>Seroresponse is defined as post-vaccination anti-rubella virus antibody concentration ≥10 IU/mL (ELISA) in subjects seronegative (antibody concentration &lt;4 IU/mL) before vaccination.
For the analysis of the immune responses to the Routine Infant Vaccine (RIV) antigens, subjects in each of the 2 study groups are randomly assigned to different immunogenicity subsets. The assignment of the immunogenicity subsets are performed by a second randomization, whereas the first randomization is performed at the enrolment to assign subjects to Group MenB+PCV or Group Placebo+PCV.</description>
