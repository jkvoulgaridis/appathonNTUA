  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure therapy (PT) and silicone therapy are recommended as first-line non-invasive
      treatments HS, yet the effectiveness of the combination of these two treatments through an
      RCT trial has not been established yet. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the
      combination of adequate pressure therapy and silicone gel sheeting implemented by Smart Scar
      Care Pad (SSCP) + Smart Pressure Monitored Suit (SPMS) versus conventional Pressure Garment
      (PG in the management of severe HS in adult. It is hypothesized that the combination of
      adequate pressure therapy and silicone gel sheeting will demonstrate its superiority in
      improving scar parameters than conventional pressure garment therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) will be used to screen candidates for the study.10
             Isolated scars with a total score of 4 or higher and the score of each item equal to
             or greater than 1 will be included.

          -  The scar size should also reach 2*2 cm2 or above to allow adequate area for assessment
             tool attachement.

          -  Consenting adult's age between 19 to 60 years old who is able to provide written
             consent, cooperative, and good compliance with treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  the HS area have an open wound or infection;

          -  the HS have been treated with steroid injections or other intervention (such as
             traditional Chinese medicine or laser therapy) prior to the study;

          -  the patients have a medical condition that might affect wound healing (e.g., diabetes
             mellitus or another serious medical problem);

          -  the patients with comorbidities that might affect their compliance to treatment: such
             as severe scar contracture at adjacent area that might be scheduled for reconstructive
             surgery.
