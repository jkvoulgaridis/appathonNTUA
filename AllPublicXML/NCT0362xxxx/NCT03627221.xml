      Several factors may cause sleep disturbance among nursing students. Sleep and its several
      influencing factors are both continuous dynamic process. However, research related to sleep
      and related issue in nursing students in a longitudinal manner is limited worldwide. Thus,
      the investigators intend to conduct a 3-year research divided into three phases to explore
      the issue. The first phase will adopt longitudinal panel study design. Nursing students from
      two schools will be invited to participate in the first year study, which will be about 800
      people. The second phase is to classify music appreciated by the students into different
      music quadrants that may be effective and can be used at the third phase. The third phase is
      designed to explore the longitudinal effects of a 3-month social network combined with music
      care program on sleep quality, sleep knowledge, sleep hygiene and daytime sleepiness and
      fatigue. Students will be randomized into 2 groups: intervention and control groups.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive a 12-week intervention program. The
      control group will be no intervention. Growth curve modeling will be employed in this study
      for longitudinal analyses to identify the sleep predicted by the students' characteristics.
      This study will enable us to advance knowledge and research about nursing students'
      longitudinal patterns of sleep and the longitudinal effects of the intervention program on
      their sleep.

      Background: Poor sleep quality affect students' learning achievement. Several factors may
      cause sleep disturbance among nursing students. Sleep and its several influencing factors are
      both continuous dynamic process. However, changes in students' sleep patterns and related
      characteristics over time remain unclear. Therefore, understanding the issue and examining an
      effective program is important to ameliorate sleep and improve learning. Integrated care
      program has proved to be a nursing students' health promotion intervention. However, research
      related to sleep and related issue in nursing students in a longitudinal manner is limited
      worldwide. Thus, the investigators intend to conduct a 3-year research divided into three
      phases to explore the issue. Objectives: The first phase will adopt longitudinal panel study
      design. Nursing students from two schools will be invited to participate in the first year
      study, which will be about 800 people.The data will be obtained from 4 waves (the interval of
      each wave will be 2 months) of the longitudinal survey of sleep quality of the nursing
      students and how the students' characteristics influence sleep. Distinct patterns of sleep
      over time will help to identify what characteristics of students to target for the
      researchers and to make evidence-based intervention for them. The second phase is to classify
      music appreciated by the students that may be effective and can be used at the third phase.
      The third phase is designed to explore the longitudinal effects of a 3-month social network
      combined with music care program on sleep quality, sleep knowledge, sleep hygiene and daytime
      sleepiness and fatigue. 100 students will be randomized into 2 groups: intervention and
      control groups. Participants in the intervention group will receive a 12-week intervention
      program. The control group will be no intervention. Data will be collected from both groups
      at pretests, and at different time points depending on variables after intervention
      completed. Statistical analysis: Growth curve modeling will be employed in this study for
      longitudinal analyses to identify the trajectory of sleep predicted by the students'
      characteristics. Descriptive analyses will be conducted using SPSS 18. Anticipated results
      and implications: This study will enable us to advance knowledge and research about nursing
      students' longitudinal patterns of sleep and the longitudinal effects of the intervention
      program on their sleep. If the longitudinal effects of the intervention program on their
      sleep are confirmed, the findings will provide evidence for educators and policy makers using
      evidence-based intervention to ameliorate sleep in nursing students.

    <time_frame>18 months (intervention will last for 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>participants' subjective sleep quality will be measured by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI has 19 items, most with a 4-point, Likert-type response scale. The total score of the 19 items is ranged between 0-21. The higher scores (greater than 5) indicate the participants have poorer sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>sleep knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months (intervention will last for 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators developed questionnaire of sleep knowledge is a 10-15 questions regarding sleep-related knowledge. Each item oï¬€ered three response options: yes, no, or unsure. One point was assigned for a correct response, and zero was assigned for incorrect or &quot;unsure&quot; responses. The maximum score was 10-15 points. The total score was treated as a global indicator of the levels of the participants' sleep knowledge. A higher score indicated that they were more knowledgeable about sleep.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>sleep hygiene</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months (intervention will last for 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) will be used to measure participants' practice of sleep hygiene behaviors. The SHI is a 13-item self-report rated on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Total scores range from 0 to 52, with a higher score representing poorer sleep hygiene.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>daytime fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months (intervention will last for 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Daytime fatigue will be measured by using a 7-item scale, Flinders Fatigue Scale.
Six items are presented in Likert format, with responses ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Item 5 measures the time of day when fatigue is experienced and uses a multiple-item checklist. Total fatigue is calculated as the sum of all individual items. Total fatigue scores range from 0 to 31, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>18 months (intervention will last for 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a self-report 8-item questionnaire will be used to measure daytime sleepiness. The ESS is a four-point rating scale. Response categories range from &quot;0 = would never doze,&quot; &quot;1 = slight chance of dozing,&quot; &quot;2 = moderate chance of dozing,&quot; &quot;3 = high chance of dozing.&quot; Ratings are added over the eight items for a total score. The range of possible scores is from 0 to 24 points.</description>
