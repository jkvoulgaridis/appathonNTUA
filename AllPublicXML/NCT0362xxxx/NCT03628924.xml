    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant's quality of life. It is a 10-item Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire related to skin that evaluate over last Week: 1) how painful or itchy skin, 2) embarrassed or self conscious, 3) skin interfered during shopping or looking home or yard, 4) influenced the clothes, 5) during social or leisure activities, 6) during sports, 7) working or studying, 8) problem due to skin with partners or friends 9) sexual difficulties and 10) skin treatment to assess overall quality of life that can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 30. A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HSSD is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling, odor, and itchiness. The participants are asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HSSD Total Symptom Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HSSD is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling, odor, and itchiness. The participants are asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience. All 5 symptoms have a recall period of the past 7 days, except for 2 additional questions on pain which evaluate current pain and pain in the past 24 hours. Each individual symptom scale score, ranging from 0-10 will be summarized. A total symptom score, which will also range from 0-10, will be derived by averaging the 5 individual scale scores that utilize the past 7-day recall period with higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <description>The HS-IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participant's HS at a given timepoint. The anatomic region with the most severe HS activity at the baseline will be evaluated for erythema, drainage, and pain and/or tenderness to palpation for each participant. The participant's HS is assessed as inactive (0), almost inactive (1), mild activity (2), moderate activity (3), or severe activity (4). A higher score indicates more severe disease. Percentage of participants with HS-IGA score of inactive (0), almost inactive (1), or mild activity (2) and with at least 2-grade improvement relative to baseline at Week 16 will be determined.</description>

    <description>The HS-IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participant's HS at a given timepoint. The anatomic region with the most severe HS activity at the baseline will be evaluated for erythema, drainage, and pain and/or tenderness to palpation for each participant. Among Participants With Score of Moderate activity (3) or Severe activity (4) at Baseline, the same anatomic site selected for evaluation at the baseline will be re-evaluated at Week 16. The participant's HS is assessed as inactive (0), almost inactive (1), mild activity (2), moderate activity (3), or severe activity (4). A higher score indicates more severe disease. Percentage of participants with HS-IGA score of inactive (0), almost inactive (1) at Week 16 among participants with HS-IGA score of moderate activity (3) or severe activity (4) at baseline will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Total Scores at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS has been developed to identify symptoms of anxiety and depression in hospitalized participants and in outpatients. It comprises 14 items, seven to assess anxiety (HADS-A), namely items 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13; and seven to assess depression (HADS-D), namely items 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. Each item receives a score from 0 to 3 on a Likert Scale. The total score for each scale is obtained by adding the individual scores for each item, with the maximum score 21. The presence or absence of depression and anxiety will be defined, for each respective scale, based on the following cutoff values: HADS (anxiety): 0-8 equal to (=) no anxiety; greater than (&gt;) 9 = anxiety; HADS (depression): 0-8 = no depression; &gt;9 = depression.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC of HS Severity is a questionnaire that measures participants' perceived change (improvement or deterioration) in severity of their HS. Participants will rate how his/her HS has changed since the beginning of the study using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 which indicates &quot;a lot better now&quot; to 7 which indicates &quot;a lot worse now&quot; with a neutral center point 4 which indicates (&quot;neither better nor worse&quot;). Participants PGIC of HS Severity at Week 16 will be determined.</description>
