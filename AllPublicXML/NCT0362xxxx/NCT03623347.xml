  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New approaches are needed for patients newly diagnosed with bulky glioblastoma (GB) and/or
      with severe neurological impairment that cannot benefit from first line temozolomide
      (TMZ)-basedn chemoradiotherapy. Bevacizumab (BEV), an antiangiogenic anti-VEGF-R monoclonal
      antibody, has a rapid impact on tumor-related brain edema in recurrent GB. The present study
      reports the feasibility and efficacy of an induction treatment with TMZ and BEV to alleviate
      the initial neurological impairment and/or to reduce the tumor volume before a delayed
      chemoradiotherapy.

      New approaches are needed for patients newly diagnosed with bulky glioblastoma (GB) and/or
      with severe neurological impairment that cannot benefit from first line temozolomide
      (TMZ)-based chemoradiotherapy. Bevacizumab (BEV), an antiangiogenic anti-VEGF-R monoclonal
      antibody, has a rapid impact on tumor-related brain edema in recurrent GB. The present study
      reports the feasibility and efficacy of an induction treatment with TMZ and BEV to alleviate
      the initial neurological impairment and/or to reduce the tumor volume before a delayed
      chemoradiotherapy.

      The investigators retrospectively analyzed tumor and target volumes and clinical neurological
      status in 39 patients with bulky GB and/or with severe neurological impairment after an
      induction treatment combining TMZ and BEV. Neurological and radiological responses were
      assessed according to RANO criteria.

      Calculating gross tumor and clinical target volumes (GTV and CTV) was done at diagnosis and
      before radiotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were
      determined by Kaplan Meier methods. Safety was reported according to NCTCAE.

    <description>The investigators reported here a series of patients in whom radiotherapy was considered as not feasible in first intention but most of which could be treated by optimal chemoradiotherapy after upfront TMZ and BEV treatment. The investigators analyzed the impact of this induction strategy on tumor and target volumes, neurological status and survival.</description>

        The investigators retrospectively collected clinical and radiological data from medical
        files. Patients were over 18 years old. Most had histologically proven unresectable primary
        GB. in some cases, GB diagnosis was only done by multimodal MRI with confirmation by a
        collegial agreement including an expert in neuroradiology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical criteria:- - age&gt; to 18 years

               -  GBM de novo

               -  Histological evidence is essential. A minimum interval of 7 days is required
                  between biopsy and neo-adjuvant therapy. A minimum interval of 15 days is
                  required for open skull surgery and neo-adjuvant therapy.

               -  The insertion of patients is a WHO score 3 and 4 in relation to the neurological
                  deficit is possible by definition

          -  Biological criteria

             - Polynuclear neutrophils&gt; 1500 / mm3

               -  pads&gt; 100,000 / mm3

               -  SGOT &lt;5 at the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine &lt;1.5 ULN

               -  proteinuria &lt;2 g / 24 hours

          -  Forensic criteria

               -  Patient with health insurance

               -  consent signed by the patient if it is lucid, or by default by the person of
                  trust.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients without neurological deficit (SN 0) or with moderate deficit (SN 1 or SN
             2).

             2. In case of initial neurological deficit SN 3-4, the interest of a decompression
             surgery must be discussed. If the surgery is unsuccessful, a corticosteroid test, at
             least 4 days, with at least 1.5 mg / kg / day of prednisone equivalent, must be
             performed. If surgery and / or corticosteroids allow to return to an SN 0-2
             neurological score with return to an RPA III, IV or V class, the patient is not
             included and must be treated according to a conventional chemoradiotherapy regimen
             with temozolomide (Stupp schema).

             3. Multifocal tumor or whose excessive volume does not allow to consider curative
             radiation therapy at a dose of 60 Gy.

             3. History of chemotherapy, (including Gliadel) and / or radiotherapy. 4. Cerebral or
             intratumoral haemorrhage on diagnostic MRI. However, microhemorrhages, haemosiderin
             deposits or haemorrhages secondary to biopsy or surgery are not contraindications.

             5. Concomitant serious uncontrolled pathology, including another evolving cancer 6.
             Uncontrolled infection 7. Uncontrolled Hypertension (PAS&gt; 160 mm Hg) Despite Optimized
             Treatment 8. Coronary artery disease or unstable arterial disease. Evolutionary
             aneurysm. Myocardial infarction less than 6 months old.

             9. Stroke or peripheral arterial disease less than 6 months old. 10. Heart Failure&gt;
             NYHA Grade II 11. Haemorrhagiparous disease (hemophilia, Willebrandt ...) 12. History
             of hemoptysis less than 1 month old. 13. Pulmonary embolism less than 1 month old. 14.
             Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy in progress. If possible, these treatments
             should be stopped before inclusion after consultation with a cardiologist or
             angiologist. However, these treatments may be continued if their discontinuation is
             considered harmful and that the participation in the trial is considered beneficial
             for the patient with regard to the haemorrhagic risk incurred.

             15. Surgical procedure (other than craniotomy or stereotactic biopsy) less than one
             month old or foreseeable surgery.

             16. History of digestive fistula or intestinal perforation whose resolution is less
             than 6 months old.
