  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious disease with high mortality. In
      patients who survive ARDS, respiratory, neurological and motor sequelae are frequent,
      negatively impacting on the patient's quality of life, and engendering substantial healthcare
      costs (rehabilitation, long-term care, delayed return to work). There may also be
      repercussions on the patient's family and entourage. The severity of ARDS and the burden it
      represents have underpinned intensive research to identify treatment strategies that could
      improve mortality. However, it is important to ensure that any improvement in mortality does
      not come at the price of an excess of sequelae and disability in survivors.

      The oxygenation strategy used to treat ARDS may have an impact on mortality in these
      patients. The CLOSE study, in which our group participated, recently demonstrated the
      feasibility of two oxygenation strategies in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with ARDS. We
      have also initiated the LOCO-2 study (NCT02713451), whose aim is to show a reduction in
      mortality in ARDS using a &quot;conservative&quot; oxygenation strategy (PaO2 maintained between 55 and
      70 mmHg) as compared to a classical &quot;liberal&quot; oxygenation strategy (PaO2 between 90 and 105
      mmHg).

      The LTO-BLOXY study is a substudy of the on-going LOCO-2 study

  <detailed_description>

      The LTO-BLOXY study will compare respiratory, cognitive and exercise function outcomes in
      patients who underwent one of the two oxygenation strategies in the context of the on-going
      LOCO-2 study:

        -  Experimental group: oxygenation will be maintained at a level between 55 and 70 mmHg of
           PaO2 as measured by blood gas test (&quot;conservative&quot; oxygenation). Between blood gas
           measures, oxygenation will be optimized to achieve an SpO2 between 88% and 92%.

        -  Control group: oxygenation will be maintained at a level between 90 and 105 mmHg of PaO2
           as measured by blood gas test (&quot;liberal&quot; oxygenation). Between blood gas measures,
           oxygenation will be optimized to achieve an SpO2 &gt;96%.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate a lower level of impairment of respiratory function
      at 6 months in survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after a &quot;conservative&quot;
      oxygenation strategy, as compared to a &quot;liberal&quot; oxygenation strategy.

      Secondary objectives are numerous and will explore different areas such as evalution of
      disability, respiratory function, exercise function, cognitive function and quality of life.

      Participation in the LTO-BLOXY study will be proposed to all patients included in LOCO-2 at
      discharge from the ICU. A total of 259 patients from the overall total of 850 expected
      inclusions in LOCO-2, will participate in the LTO-BLOXY study. These patients will be
      followed up to 1 year after their initial inclusion in LOCO-2, with a view to evaluate
      respiratory function, exercise function and cognitive function, as well as QoL.

      The calendar of their study participation is as follows:

        -  Inclusion in LOCO-2 study and randomization LOCO-2

        -  Inclusion in LTO-BLOXY study at discharge from the ICU

        -  3 month visit ± 2 weeks (3 months after inclusion in LOCO-2 study)

        -  6 month visit ± 2 weeks (6 months after inclusion in LOCO-2 study)

        -  12 month visit ± 2 weeks (12 months after inclusion in LOCO-2 study)

      At each follow-up visit, the patient will attend a consultation in the Department of
      Physiology - Functional Explorations, where the study questionnaires will be given to the
      patient for completion. The neuropsychologist will perform the cognitive tests, the
      respiratory function and exercise tests will also be performed at the same visit.

    <description>In the two groups, if patient is not in the range of arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2), Inspired Fraction of Oxygen (FiO2) will be modified from 5 percent if difference between target is less than 5 mmHg and from 10 percent if difference from target is higher. A new arterial blood gases (ABG) will be performed 30 minutes later to check for the oxygen target range. When ABG are performed, pulsed oxymetry is compared with arterial saturation (SaO2) to adapt survey. Between each ABG, FiO2 is modified from 5 percent to 5 percent each five minutes until reaching good pulsed oxygen saturation (SpO2) target (that can be modified in function of the comparison of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 and SpO2 with ABG).
This management of FiO2 will be done until extubation of the patient.</description>
