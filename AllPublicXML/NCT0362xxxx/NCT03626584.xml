  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET scanning (positron emission tomography) is a well-established technique used to identify
      areas of interest within the body. It involves injecting a radioactive tracer which
      highlights abnormal areas. It has recently been combined with CT (computed tomography) and
      MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning to more accurately identify abnormalities within
      the heart. Cardiac amyloidosis, a condition which causes thickening of heart muscle due to
      abnormal protein deposits, is of particular interest. There are different forms of this
      condition and at present samples of tissue need to be taken and analysed in order to assess
      these accurately, which carries risks.

      The study makes use of hybrid PET/MR scanning using a designated scanner which enables PET
      scanning combined with MRI scanning. The investigators will use a PET tracer which is widely
      used in cardiac imaging as it is hoped this will enable characterisation of abnormal areas
      within the heart in this condition in a way which hasn't been done before.

      All participants will undergo PET scanning, where a radioactive tracer is injected into a
      vein before the scan. The radioactive substance only lasts for a short time and is safe,
      passed out of the body in urine. If successful, this imaging method will enable us to detect
      differences between different forms of cardiac amyloidosis in a non-invasive way, improving
      the diagnostic capabilities in this condition.
