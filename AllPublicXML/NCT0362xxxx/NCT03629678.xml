  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCD is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin that affects over 100,000 Americans, most of whom
      live in low-resourced neighborhoods. Acute SCD complications result in 230,000 emergency
      department visits and $1.5 billion annually in acute-care expenditures. Prior research
      indicates that increased disease-specific knowledge correlates with improved clinical
      outcomes in SCD. Thus, targeting strategies to improve disease-specific knowledge is a high
      priority in the care of individuals with SCD. Significant evidence describes how educational
      materials, including online educational programs, can be used to increase disease-specific
      knowledge. In this study, the investigators will evaluate a mobile phone technology
      intervention based on the prior evidence that technologies can improve SCD-specific
      knowledge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that affects over 100,000 Americans,
      an underserved population with low life expectancy and risk for significant and
      life-threatening medical complications (e.g., stroke). Adults with SCD are overwhelmingly
      members of socially disadvantaged groups, increasing their risk for disparities in care.
      Annual health expenditure for individuals with SCD in the United States is about $1.5
      billion, primarily from multiple emergency room visits (230,000 visits/year) for management
      of acute complications. Use of disease-specific knowledge has emerged as a powerful tool to
      decrease health care utilization. Significant evidence has described how to increase
      disease-specific knowledge using educational materials, including online educational programs
      in individuals managing chronic diseases, including SCD. Patient knowledge and use of
      disease-specific information like evidence-based clinical guidelines has the potential to
      decrease health care utilization. In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
      (NHLBI) published guidelines for evidence-based management of SCD for health care providers.
      However, to date, no national strategy has been developed to make these guidelines
      patient-centered, accessible, and actionable for adults with SCD. Federal Meaningful Use
      regulations have recommended using health-related technologies to improve patient access to
      their health information to promote patient engagement. Yet, many adults with SCD are not yet
      fully engaged in use of health technologies because they are unsure of the best format (e.g.,
      mobile or web-based), leading to a health care technology gap. Mobile health applications
      (apps) that include patient-centered care guidelines could engage and activate this
      population given the high use of mobile technologies, potentially closing this health
      technology gap and improving health outcomes.

      Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the refined iManage in a pilot study with
      adults with SCD. The investigators will recruit 50 adults from the population of 250 adults
      with SCD at the Vanderbilt Meharry Sickle Cell Disease Center of Excellence for a 6-month
      pilot study to evaluate usability, acceptance, and usage. At the end of the study, the
      investigators will conduct interviews with a subset of participants to gain an in-depth
      understanding of usage patterns and how to sustain engagement to promote ongoing app use.

      Evaluate the efficacy of the refined iManage app on SCD-specific knowledge. The investigators
      will test the hypothesis that the refined iManage will increase SCD-specific knowledge by
      measuring SCD-specific knowledge at the start and end of the 6-month pilot study. the
      investigators will conduct exploratory analyses of secondary outcomes including patient
      activation, adherence to guidelines, missed days of school/work, and self-efficacy.

    <description>Knowledge about SCD. This is a questionnaire that is multiple choice and asks questions about sickle cell disease with one correct answer and 3 incorrect answers. The investigators will sum up the number of correct answers to determine a score of the measure out of 100%.

    <measure>Usage and usability of the mHealth application</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>How often app and functionality was used. Usability will be measured by the widely used and validated System Usability Scale as described in Brooke J. SUS-A quick and dirty usability scale. Usability evaluation in industry. 1996;189(194):4-7. The mobile health application for the guidelines has built-in tracking of the number of times the application is launched, how many times each of the functions are used, and how many times each button has been pushed. To measure usage, the investigators will record the numbers of each of these events for each participant. In addition to total use, the investigators will measure usage over time including any use, initial use, periodic use, and sustained use.
SUS scale is 0-100, higher score is better. Scale has no subscales and measures usability of the app</description>

    <description>The user-driven technological tool will include an mHealth mobile phone application. Features of the application will be based on preliminary work from the investigators' sites. The mobile app will include fully searchable provider-facing and patient-facing interfaces with the SCD-specific guidelines. The provider-facing interface, designed to be used by providers, will be separated by patient's age to accommodate pediatric and adult providers. The patient-facing interface will display the guidelines that are age- and health literacy-appropriate. Through the mobile app, the investigators will reinforce important points of guideline content; motivate patient engagement through quizzes and text-message reminders; and facilitate peer support, for instance by forming teams to compete against each other to attain goals.</description>
