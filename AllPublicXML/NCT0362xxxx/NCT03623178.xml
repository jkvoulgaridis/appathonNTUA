  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization the population suffering from addiction problems
      is increasing. This population is characterized by multiple needs at the medico-psychosocial
      level. However, some of these patients, a particular subgroup that we are going to be
      interested in the so-called &quot;high need&quot; user group, find it difficult to access and stay in
      outpatient treatment programs. Persons with substance use disorder often present a chaotic
      use of the health system, including a high number of hospitalizations in times of crisis.
      These individuals also show very low utilization of health care services, accompanied by
      social marginalization. This can be related to relapses and poor social functioning. A high
      number of relapses occur particularly at the end of hospitalization. Community Interventions,
      such as Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) should increase the adherence of these patients
      to treatment by accompanying them in the community and helping them during sensitive and
      crisis periods. One of the objectives of the study is to evaluate the impact of ACT on the
      time until service disengagement, measuring treatment adherence. The secondary objectives of
      this study will be to see the effect of ACT on duration and type of hospitalizations, as well
      as the number of emergency room visits. The investigators will focus on the impact of ACT on
      the participant's medico-psycho-social network, substance use and other psychological
      variables. The investigators will also evaluate his or her psychiatric symptoms and global
      and social functioning. Life satisfaction and satisfaction with the care received will also
      be measured. The investigators will compare the population treated with ACT with sex, age and
      substance-matched controls which do not respond to ACT inclusion criteria chosen from new
      admissions of our addictology consultation. The study will investigate this through
      questionnaires at the beginning of care, at three months, six months and 12 months after the
      start of the ACT intervention.

    <description>The intervention program is a type of very flexible community treatment. This is facilitated by a small case load ratio per health care professional (1:10). The healthcare workers are specialized in SUD treatment. The time of the intervention differs, there is no prefixed limitation but the duration of the intervention depends on the goals agreed on with the patient. The main objective of this intervention is to ensure an adherence to an addiction treatment program and establish or consolidate a stable healthcare and social network for the patient. The intervention aims to prevent service disengagement. The healthcare workers will explore specific patient needs and ensure that health and social services are better coordinated to fit their needs.</description>

    <description>The treatment as usual is the intervention given in our outpatient addictology unit. It consists of an individual treatment program at our outpatient unit with regular appointments with psychiatrists and nurses. The patient can also take part in therapeutic groups and receive help from a psychologist for a targeted program or psychotherapy. The multidisciplinary team also comprises a social worker and an occupational therapist.</description>
