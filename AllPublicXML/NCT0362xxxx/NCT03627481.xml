  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease presents as a triad composed by asthma, eosinophilic
      rinosinusitis and intolerance to aspirin and NSAIDS. In subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis
      sleep alterations have been found, with important improvement after surgery, but those
      alterations and improvements have not been studied in patients diagnosed with AERD who, due
      to their comorbidities, may present more severe pre surgical symptoms and a more important
      post-surgical improvement. The investigators aim to study patients with AERD sleep, quality
      of life and symptoms before surgery, and one, three and six months post-surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total score in Pittsburgh sleep quality index, basal and after surgery. Total score in Pittsburgh sleep quality index, before and after surgery. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index has a global score in which a higher score indicates a worse sleep quality, with a global score higher than five differentiating those with good and bad sleep quality. In order to obtain the global score, individual questions are grouped in seven components, to which a 0 to 3 score is assigned and all components scores are added. The total range of the global score goes from 0 to 21.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective sleep quality assessed by actigraphy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal; 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency as measured by actigraphy (worn for one week), basal and after. Efficiency is calculated as the average of eficiency for each night.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life assessed by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal; 1, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated with the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, basal and after surgery. The questionnaire has 32 questions with four areas or dominions (activity limitations, asthma symptoms, emotional state and ambient exposition), each question is scored from 1 to 7, with 1 being maximum affectation and 7 no affectation. Final score for each area is obtained by averaging the score for the corresponding questions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nasal symptoms assessed by the SNOT - 22</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal; 1, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in nasal symptoms evaluated via the SNOT 22 questionnaire, basal and after surgery. The sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22). This questionnaire is composed by 22 questions that are answered from 0 to 5, with 0 defining no burden and 5 maximal burden, with a total score range from 0 to 110, with a higher score indicating worse symptoms. The total score is obtained by adding the individual question scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma symptoms assessed by the Asthma Control Test.</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal; 1, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes on symptoms as evaluated by the score on Asthma Control Test, basal and after surgery. The asthma control test (ACT) has five questions that are answered with scores from 1 to 5, with a total score (obtained by adding the individual question score) from 5 to 25. A higher score indicates worse asthma control. A total score of 19 is considered a cut point for uncontrolled patients.</description>
