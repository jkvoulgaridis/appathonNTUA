      decided.

      The eligibility criteria for this study are:

        -  The Visual Analogue Scale value is at least 5 per day when the dysmenorrhea symptoms are
           the most painful,

        -  To have the regular menstrual cycle (24-35 days),

        -  To be sedentary

        -  Acute musculoskeletal problems,

        -  People with neurological or cardiopulmonary disease

      This research will consist of exercise and control groups. An exercise protocol consisting of
      a combination of various exercises will be applied to the exercise group and no exercises
      will be done for the control group. women in the exercise group will perform two menstrual
      cycles, three times a week in the presence of a physiotherapist.

      Assessments will be made on the day that the symptoms are seen to be the most severe in order
      to determine the symptoms of the women in both groups. After baseline assements exercises
      will start at 3rd day of cycle. Assesments will repeat at second and third menstrual
      bleedings.

      Visual Analogue Scale, Menstrual symptom questionnarie and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      will be use.
