      In this study, the effect of dehydration by sauna exposure on the intestinal permeability in
      20 healthy subjects is investigated. Participants attend three visits: 1) Sauna visit (to
      achieve 3% dehydration), 2) Positive control visit (intake of indomethacin which is known to
      increase intestinal permeability), 3) Negative control visit. At all visits, saliva samples,
      blood samples, faecal samples, saliva samples are collected and the multi-sugar permeability
      test is performed. In this test, participants drink a sugar solution and then urine collect
      urine for 5 and 24 h. The ratio of the sugars detected in the urine by liquid
      chromatography/mass spectometry is a reflection of the intestinal permeability. Saliva
      samples are collected for assessment of cortisol, a stress marker. Blood and faecal samples
      are collected for assessment of markers of intestinal barrier function and inflammation.
