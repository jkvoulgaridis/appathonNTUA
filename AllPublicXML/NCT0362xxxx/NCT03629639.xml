  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis and metabolic disorders are well-known mutual comorbidities. The investigators
      hypothesized metformin can ameliorate both psoriasis and metabolic disorders mainly via gut
      microbiota modulation. The investigators design a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment of metformin for
      psoriasis combined with disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism and to explore the role of
      gut microbiota during the process.

    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving a Greater Than or Equal to 75 Percentage Improvement From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) Score at Week 12 [ Time Frame: Baseline and Week 12 ]</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants achieving greater than or equal to 75 percentage improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 12. PASI is the widely used tool for the measurement of severity of psoriasis. This is a test of how bad a person's psoriasis is. The combination of redness, scaling, and thickness, as well as overall body involvement determine the PASI score. The scale ranges from 0 (best) -72 (worst). Baseline visit refers to Week 0.</description>

    <measure>improvement of dermatology quality of life: Dermatology Life Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated by Dermatology Life Quality Index(DLQI). DLQI is the widely used tool for the measurement of skin-health-related quality of life. It is a simple 10-question validated questionnaire that has been used in over 40 different skin conditions in over 80 countries and is available in over 90 languages.This is a scale of how bad a person's skin disease affecting his/her life. The scale ranges from 0 (best) -10 (worst).</description>
