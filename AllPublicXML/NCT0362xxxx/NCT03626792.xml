  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to verify the chronic effect of Mat Pilates exercise on climacteric
      symptoms, ambulatory blood pressure responses, lipid and glucose profile and pro and
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant markers in postmenopausal normotensive and hypertensive
      women. All volunteers received the same intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pilates program was performed three times a week for 12 weeks. Initially a
      familiarization was made regarding the principles of the method. All volunteers underwent
      24-hour blood pressure assessment using ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) and
      venous blood samples were collected from fasting, saliva and questionnaires before and after
      the Pilates training period.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The climacteric symptoms will be evaluated by the following questionnaire Kupperman - Blatt Index. The questionnaire has scores that from 0 to 19 indicate mild symptoms, 20 to 35 moderate and greater than 35 symptoms of severe climacteric.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The climacteric symptoms will be evaluated by the following questionnaire Cervical Scale. The questionnaire does not have scales. Indicates only a high or low score regarding the presence of climacteric symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The climacteric symptoms will be evaluated by the following questionnaire Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). The scores from 0 to 4 of the questionnaire indicate absence of symptoms, as well as from 5 to 8 presence of mild symptoms, 9 to 15 moderate and greater than 16 symptoms of severe climacteric.</description>

    <description>The Mat Pilates session was held lasting 50 minutes of exercises with the first 5 minutes heating and in each exercise performing 10 repetitions with 45 seconds of rest between one exercise and another. For practice, are used only mats, and alternative devices such as the Swiss ball and the flexible ring, as well as body weight and the force of gravity as resistance factors and Borg's subjective perception of effort scale for intensity parameters. The 20 exercises were chosen through the classic exercises thus classified by the creator of the Joseph Pilates method.During the sessions, volunteers were instructed on correct breathing without performing the valsalva maneuver.</description>
