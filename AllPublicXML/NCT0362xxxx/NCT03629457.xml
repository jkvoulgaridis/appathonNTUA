  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to check whether a training program in mindfulness and self-pity based on a
      4-session intervention (abbreviated program) is as effective as the standard 8-session MBSR
      program in reducing work stress and burnout in tutors and residents of Medicine and Family
      and Community Nursing.

      It is a controlled clinical trial, randomized by cluster, of three parallel arms,
      multicentric. Six teaching units (ratio 1: 1: 1) will be randomized to one of the three study
      groups: 1) Experimental Group-8 (EG8); 2) Experimental Group-4 (EG4); 3) Control group (CG).

      At least 132 subjects will participate, 44 in the EG8, 44 in the EG4 and 44 in the CG.

      The interventions will be based on the MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction) program, to
      which some of the practices of the MSC (Mindful Self-Compassion) program will be added.

      The EG8 intervention will be carried out during 8 weekly sessions of 2.5 hours, while the EG4
      intervention will be of 4 sessions of 2.5 hours. The participants will have to practice at
      home for 30 minutes / day in the EG8 and 15 minutes / day in the EG4.

      In the 3 groups the questionnaires FFMQ (mindfulness), SCS (self-pity), ordinal scale (0-10)
      and questionnaire PSQ (perceived stress) and MBI (burnout) will be passed. Empathy will also
      be measured, through the EEMJ, anxiety and depression disorders (EADG) and self-perceived
      health status.

    <description>Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI). Spanish version of the MBI-HSS25. It consists of 22 scoring items from 0 to 6 that measure the three dimensions of the syndrome: emotional fatigue (CE), 9 items and a maximum score of 54 points; depersonalization (DP), 5 items and maximum score of 30 points; personal fulfillment (RP), 8 items and maximum score of 48 points. The cut points used were: emotional fatigue under &lt;19, moderate 19-26, high&gt; 26. Depersonalization under &lt;6, moderate 6-9, high&gt; 9. Personal performance under&gt; 39, moderate 39-34, high &lt;34 .</description>

    <description>Self-compassion questionnaire. The short scale of the Spanish version, validated by García-Campayo et al, will be used, with 12 items scored using a Likert scale (1 to 5) that measures how the subject usually acts towards himself in difficult moments. It consists of six subscales: self-friendliness, common humanity, mindfulness, and their opposites: self-judgment, isolation and over-identification. Higher total values indicate more self-pity.</description>

    <description>Jefferson Medical Empathy Scale (EEMJ), HP version. Defines empathy based on three factors: &quot;perspective taking&quot;, &quot;compassionate care&quot; and the ability to &quot;put yourself in the patient's shoes&quot;. It has a minimum score of 20, maximum of 140 and does not establish a cut-off point, it contains 20 Likert-type items on a 7-point scale. There are 10 items written in the positive sense and 10 in the negative sense.</description>

    <description>Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS, EADG in spanish versión). It consists of two sub-scales, one of anxiety and the other of depression. Each sub-scale has 9 items of dichotomous response (Yes / No) and are structured in 4 initial items of screening, to determine whether or not there is likely to be a mental disorder, and a second group of 5 items that are formulated if you get positive answers to the screening questions (2 or more for anxiety and more than 1 for depression), but in the investigation the full scale is usually applied, and that way it was used in the present study. an independent score for each scale, with a point for each affirmative answer. Goldberg et al have proposed cutoff points ≥ 4 for the anxiety scale, and ≥ 2 for depression.</description>
