      Proposed Study: Treatment protocol for the use of the topical Rapamycin/Sirolimus for
      Complicated Vascular Anomalies and other susceptible lesions

        1. Aim The aim of this treatment study is to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of
           topical sirolimus applied to cutaneous vascular anomalies in pediatric patients. The
           primary end point will be individually determined based on improvement in lesional
           clinical characteristics over baseline

        2. Rationale for topical sirolimus use in VA The rationale for the use of topical sirolimus
           is to minimize these potential side effects and risks. Data for the use of topical
           sirolimus for vascular anomalies at this time are anecdotal and case reports only. As
           such, this prospective protocol seeks to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of
           topical sirolimus on patients with vascular anomalies that have a cutaneous component.

        3. Experimental design This is an open-labeled efficacy trial with the aim to determine if
           topical sirolimus can be safe and efficacious in treating the cutaneous component of
           complicated vascular anomalies. Patients who meet eligibility criteria with a diagnosis
           of vascular anomaly (VA) with cutaneous component will be offered treatment with the
           investigational topical sirolimus. Patients will receive topical sirolimus therapy for a
           total of six months and will be monitored regularly at the research site for clinical
           response. Response will be based on pre-determined clinical criteria. Patients will be
           removed from study if there is no response at three months after initiation of therapy.

           Clinical response will be defined as improvement in measurable parameters defined at the
           time of initiation of therapy. These include

             1. Size of lesions, measured in two parallel longest diameters

             2. Flattening of lesion

             3. Number of vesicles

             4. Episodes of superinfection or bleeding

             5. Improvement in pain

        4. Drug Information The topical sirolimus formulation will be made at a concentration of 1%
           sirolimus ointment. Bulk sirolimus powder will be compounded in a liposomal base in a
           GMP level pharmaceutical company. This base will enhance drug penetration into the skin.
           It ensures adequate adhesion to the application area and a low degree of systemic
           absorption. Due to limited absorption only mild side effects are expected.

    <textblock>
      Patients with vascular anomalies (VA) have a spectrum of diseases that can be broadly
      classified into vascular tumors and malformations. Complicated vascular anomalies can cause
      disfigurement, chronic pain, and organ dysfunction with significant morbidity and mortality.
      Despite the severity of potential complications, we lack uniform guidelines for the treatment
      and response to treatment of children and young adults with these diseases. Pre-clinical and
      clinical data supporting the essential regulatory function of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in
      vascular growth and organization, and suggest a therapeutic target for patients with
      complicated vascular anomalies. Nemours Children's Hospital (NCH) and other groups have been
      successfully using the mTOR inhibitor siroli-mus in a selected group of patients with VA. NCH
      exclusively uses the systemic oral formulation of sirolimus. The potential toxicities of
      systemic sirolimus is well documented, and many patients do not tolerate systemic sirolimus.
      We hypothesize this study will advance our treatment options of vascular anomalies by
      offering topical sirolimus. This prospective open labeled study will allow us to determine
      the efficacy and tolerability of topical sirolimus in the treatment of complicated vascular
      anomalies. This will potentially generate data for the use of topical sirolimus as an
      alternative to systemic sirolimus for patients with complicated VA with a cutaneous
      component.
