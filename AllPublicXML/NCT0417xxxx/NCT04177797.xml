  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution, single arm trial of Toripalimab with neoadjuvant carboplatin
      and paclitaxel for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).The primary
      study hypothesis is that the patients who received Toripalimab combined with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel will increase complete pathologic response rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patinets will receive two cycles of Toripalimab(240 mg administered as an
      intravenous infusion over 30 minutes per 3 weeks), paclitaxel(135 mg/m2) and carboplatin(AUC
      5) administered as an intravenous infusion per 3 weeks. Giving the drugs on the first day of
      each cycle.
