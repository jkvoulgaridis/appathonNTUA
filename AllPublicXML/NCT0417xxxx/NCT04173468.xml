      This is a single blinded randomized controlled trial, will be conducted at Pakistan railway
      general hospital Rawalpindi. Both MWM and Mulligan knee taping Techniques are used in
      patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Sample size of 34 individuals was calculated
      through Open Epi tool version 3 with 95 % confidence interval (CI), and power 80%. 34
      individuals were screened out on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals
      of this selected population were randomly allocated as 17 individuals in MWM (straight leg
      raise with traction and tibial gliding) group and 17 individuals Mulligan knee taping group
      by sealed envelope method. And after this Both groups will receive conventional therapy.

      Assesment will be done at baseline, 2nd week and after 6 weeks Data will be analyzed on SPSS
      version 21.

    <measure>Active knee extension test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Active knee extension test (AKE), is used to assess hamstring length. It was performed while the participant was in supine lying and involved leg was in 90 degree hip flexion. Then participant was asked to extend the knee. For hamstring tightness cut off score AKE angle is 160°. Therefore normal individuals with angle &lt; 160° were considered as individuals with hamstring tightness. Its reliability is 0.94.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sit and reach test (SRT) is most commonly employed test to measure hamstring flexibility. This tool is used to measure range of hamstring muscle at knee joint.Each participant was instructed to sits on a couch in long sitting position. participants were seated with elongated legs, with hip flexed to 90 degrees and knees were fully extended and the ankles were in relaxed plantar flexion. A measuring ruler/tape was placed,between the feet with 38 cm score was marked tangent to the sole of the feet. Subjects were asked to reach forward with hands one above the other and palms of the hands facing down, while attempting to touch fingertips to toes or as far beyond on measuring tape while keeping the knees straight.</description>

    <description>patients with group 1 will receive two techniques pertaining to MWM intervention (straight leg raised with traction and tibial Gliding) Repeat it 10 times,3 sets and 1 mint interval. .For Tibial Gliding we will asks the patient to perform 10 repetitive active knee extensions. Practice will be performed by doing 10 reps for 3 sets with 1 min interval. After this home exercises will b guided stretching of hamstrings 8 to 10 reps 20 sec hold, strengthening of Quadriceps and VMO with 10 reps and 3 sets</description>
