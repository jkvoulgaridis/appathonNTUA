  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight bias in dietitians is prevalent and may affect patient care. The investigators
      conducted a randomized controlled trial to test if explicit and implicit bias could be
      influenced by a short, 20 minute educational video.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial studied the effect of three different videos on weight bias
      in a nationally representative sample of dietitians. The &quot;intervention&quot; group (I) watched a
      video about the etiology of obesity, reasons for weight regain, and how to talk to patients
      about weight. The first &quot;control&quot; group (C1) received information about the role of the
      environment and individual behavior in weight gain, and tools to help patients control their
      weight. The second control group (C2) received a weight neutral video about the role of
      dieticians in society. Bias measures were taken before and just after watching the video, and
      again one month later.

    <description>This arm was randomized to a 20 min video that emphasized information about factors other than individual behaviors that influence weight, weight loss and ability to maintain weight. It also indirectly addressed weight bias by explaining how to have conversation about weight and health with a patient with obesity that is free of biases.</description>
