  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with non-small cell lung cancer are at risk for nutritional deficiencies.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a nutritional product has on patient's
      response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy or combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.
      To do this, some of the participants will get the nutritional product and some will receive a
      placebo (a substance that looks like the study drug but does not have any active or medicinal
      ingredients). A placebo is used to make the results of the study more reliable.

      Participants will be randomized to any of the following treatment groups:

      - Group 1 (Experimental intervention): standard intervention of chemotherapy, immunotherapy
      or combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy plus the experimental intervention
      nutritional product.

      Group 2 (Non-experimental intervention): standard intervention of chemotherapy, immunotherapy
      or combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy plus the non-experimental intervention
      placebo product.

      Participants will take 4 capsules each day by mouth, starting on the first day of
      chemotherapy and stopping upon completion of chemotherapy treatment.

      Participants will complete a diary of their nutritional/ placebo product intake and will
      undergo the following assessments:

        -  Physical examination.

        -  Height and weight.

        -  ECOG status (the physician will record the impact on the cancer on daily living
           abilities).

        -  Concomitant medications recording.

        -  Adverse Event Assessment

        -  Computed tomography (CT) scan. A series of x-rays of the body from many angles that are
           turned into 3-dimensional pictures on a screen.

        -  Quality of life questionnaires.

        -  Blood collection
