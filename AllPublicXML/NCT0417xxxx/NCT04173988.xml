  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CD19-Directed
      Allogeneic Chimeric Antigen Receptor T- cell (alloCART-19)therapy in pediatric patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia（ALL）.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, single arm, dose escalation study to explore the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic profile of CD19-Directed Allogeneic
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor T- cell (alloCART-19) in pediatric patients with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The study will also assess the preliminary
      efficacy of CD19-Directed Allogeneic Chimeric Antigen Receptor T- cell (alloCART-19). For
      this exploratory clinical trial, approximately 3-6 patients will be enrolled. During dose
      escalation, at least one evaluable patient will be enrolled at each dose level. Once DLT is
      reached, 1 to 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the dose level below DLT, which has
      been tested and determined to be safe in the trial, to evaluate the optimal safe and
      therapeutic dose to be approved by the investigator and sponsor.
