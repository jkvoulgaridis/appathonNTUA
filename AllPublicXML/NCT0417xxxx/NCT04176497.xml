  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility and toxicity of using
      prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) and
      multi-parametric magnetic resonance imagining (mpMRI) with PET-MR technology to define
      radiotherapy targets, while meeting all the current planning criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PSMA-PET is highly sensitive and specific for detecting prostate cancer. PSMA-PET and mpMRI
      can potentially help guide target volumes for patients with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer
      receiving radiation by designing a radiation treatment plan so that the entire prostate
      receives the prescribed dose of radiation in addition to the visible tumor in the prostate as
      detected by mpMRI and/or PSMA-PET receiving any inevitable intrinsic plan &quot;hot spots&quot; or
      areas of dose above the prescription.
