  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is two stage design, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized trial evaluating the PK of
      a single, subcutaneous dose of 10 mg glepaglutide in subjects with varying degrees of renal
      function. The renal function will be calculated by the estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.

               7. Subject has a stable disease, including disease(s) associated with renal
                  impairment, under medical control (ie, no changes in medication within 30 days
                  prior to study drug administration). Stable renal impairment, defined as no
                  clinically significant change in disease status within 3 months before screening.

             reaction (PCR) test, at Screening

         13. Positive urine screen of drugs of abuse (if not due to concomitant medication) or
             alcohol breath test at Screening and/or Day -1
