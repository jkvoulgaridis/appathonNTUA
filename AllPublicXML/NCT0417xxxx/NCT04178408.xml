  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to establish a prospective registry of patients diagnosed with
      inflammatory bowel disease at Parirenyatwa hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. The study will
      periodically collect data on disease phenotype, disease course, and clinical management, and
      will biobank stool specimens and germline DNA. One relative, and an individual from the same
      neighbourhood will be also be recruited for a nested case-control study into risk factors of
      inflammatory bowel disease in this population.

  <detailed_description>

      A prospective observational registry with a nested case-control study will be established at
      a gastrointestinal outpatient's clinic at a tertiary care hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. The
      registry will recruit confirmed cases of inflammatory bowel disease from the clinic, other
      hospitals within and outside Harare, and from private practitioners. Two controls, a sibling
      or cousin, and an individual living in the same neighbourhood will also be recruited for each
      case. Demographic and clinical data will be obtained for all cases at baseline, after 6
      months and annually thereafter. A questionnaire adapted from the International Organisation
      of IBD for risk factors of inflammatory bowel disease, and a food frequency questionnaire
      will be administered to all participants. Stool specimens, and germline DNA from peripheral
      blood will be biobanked in the Department of Medicine at the University of Zimbabwe.
      Preliminary data analysis will be carried out after at least 100 patients have been
      recruited. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise data on demographic and
      phenotypic characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease, and incidence will be estimated for
      Harare. Risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease will be analysed using conditional
      logistic regression.
