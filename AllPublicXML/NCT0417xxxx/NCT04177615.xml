    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open lable studies conducted in 115 hospital to compare between
      thromboectomy and Recombinant Tisue Plasminogen Activator only to evaluate the eficacy and
      safety of endovascular treatment in basilar artery occlusion stroke patients

    <textblock>
      Acute basilar artery thrombosis is associated with a poor prognosis. Prevalence of basilar
      artery occlusion are not known. Although basilar artery occlusion has been reported in 2 per
      1000 autopsy cases, basilar artery thrombosis may, in stroke registries, explain as many as
      27% of ischemic strokes occurring in the posterior circulation.Various treatments were tried
      in groups of patients with vertebrobasilar territory infarction but evidence based was not
      cleared previous studies. Therefore, we conduct this study to evaluate the eficacy and safety
      of endovascular treatment in basilar artery occlusion stroke patients
