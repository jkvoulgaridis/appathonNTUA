    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The usability of CT-P17 Auto Injector is measured by participant using PRE- and POST-Self-injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) modules. The PRE-SIAQ module is a 7-item questionnaire and the POST-SIAQ module is a 27-item questionnaire that assesses feelings about injections, self-image, self-confidence (regarding self-administration), pain and skin reactions before after injection. Participants rated each item of the SIAQ on a 5-point (or 6-point) semantic Likert-type scal. (each item graded on a 5-point scale). [Scores were transformed to Rate between 0 (worst) to 10 (best)]</description>
