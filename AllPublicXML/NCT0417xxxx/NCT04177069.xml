  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which patients affected by dry or wet AMD will be enrolled,
      after signing the Informed Consent, according to eligibility criteria.

      Patients, after signing the Informed Consent, will enter into a screening phase during which
      the concomitant medication, clinical history, physical examination (including smoking habits)
      will be checked and the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed.

      Then, at the time of Baseline visit (V0) the eligible patients will be given Visucomplex Plus
      as monotherapy, 1 capsule daily after food, or for dry or wet AMD patients under treatment
      with a stable dose of an anti-VEGF drug, Visucomplex Plus, 1 capsule daily after food, upon
      physical decision.

      Screening phase and the baseline visit (V0) could coincide.
