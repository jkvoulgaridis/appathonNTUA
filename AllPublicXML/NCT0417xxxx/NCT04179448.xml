  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two incision designs to allow for coronal gingival/mucosal flap
      advancement and tissue augmentation with acellular dermal matrix (ADM) graft around teeth
      with gingival recession and a lack of adequate keratinized gingiva.

      The SAMRI technique described is a novel technique involving a simplified incision and
      suturing technique and to the investigators' knowledge, this is the first study that seeks to
      compare this technique to other techniques for differences in clinical outcomes (percentage
      root coverage, resultant tissue thickness, and width of keratinized tissue) and
      patient-centered outcomes (post-operative pain, swelling, changes in daily activities, and
      patient-assessed esthetics) in a controlled study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research data and daily clinical observations reveal that teeth with gingival recession and a
      lack of adequate keratinized tissue (KT) are more prone to persistent gingival inflammation,
      dentinal sensitivity, radicular (root) caries (tooth decay), faster periodontal attachment
      loss, and compromised plaque control. Soft tissue grating (by various techniques) aims at
      changing the quality, quantity and placement of the soft tissue around teeth by covering
      exposed root surfaces and creating or increasing the zone of keratinized mucosa (KM)
      surrounding the affected teeth. Both techniques tested have shown good clinical outcomes with
      regard to root coverage, but clinical reports suggest that decreased intrasurgical time and
      the simplified protocol of the SAMRI technique may result in improved clinical outcomes
      and/or a decrease in postoperative morbidity and complications as assessed by patients.

      Specific aims for this project include the evaluation of:

        -  Percentage of root coverage at 6 and 12 months following grafting with SAMRI and
           sulcular tunnel access with ADM

        -  KT width at 6 and 12 month following grafting with SAMRI and sulcular tunnel access with
           ADM

        -  Change in tissue thickness of the grafted sites at 6 and 12 months

        -  Practitioner-assessed esthetic outcomes using a standardized pink esthetic scale (PES)
           at 6 and 12 months postoperatively

        -  Patient-assessed esthetic outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-operatively

        -  Patient centered outcomes including pain, bleeding, swelling, change in daily activities
           at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively
