  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors and patients refer to all areas of skin changes from burn injury as burn scars.
      However, different areas of scars from burns can be treated differently. The burn scars that
      come from skin grafting surgery might be improved with laser treatment. The purpose of this
      study is to see if treating burn skin graft scars with a laser could make it better.

      Fractional Ablative Laser has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but
      it has not been approved for use in the early stages of scar maturation and is considered
      investigational for this study.

      This pilot study is being conducted to establish safety, however the study team will make
      multiple measures to measure for efficacy as well. The study team hypothesizes that human
      split-thickness skin grafts will safely respond similar to the porcine model when treated
      with the Fractional Carbon Dioxide (FxCO2) laser and have significantly less secondary
      contracture than control sites. The great majority of laser studies have addressed treatment
      of established scars. Ideally, treatment modalities could be moved into the acute period of
      injury, to shorten the recovery time of thermal burns by decreasing the time to maximum
      recovery, and mitigate scar formation. The current study will address the impact on treatment
      of skin graft applied in the treatment of acute burn wounds. Preliminary work completed by
      our team has confirmed that the red Duroc porcine model is a good model of hypertrophic scar
      formation in humans, and early use of the FxCO2 on split-thickness skin grafts decreased
      secondary contracture. Further, the study team has identified a period of 19 weeks between
      the time custom-made compression garments are ordered and actually applied with benefit to
      the patient. The study team has identified a &quot;therapeutic donut hole&quot; in which they have no
      efficacious alternative to offer until about 19 weeks. In these patients who had larger burn
      returning to the OR for additional procedures, the study team was able to offer FxCO2
      treatment as a &quot;salvage&quot; therapy. With this, the study team has demonstrated safety for the
      skin graft and anecdotal efficacy. The study team proposes a pilot study to prospectively
      demonstrate safety in a controlled study and attempt to establish efficacy of early (post
      grafting day 7-10) FxCO2 laser treatment of split-thickness skin graft applied in the
      treatment of burn injuries.
