  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, prospective, multi-center, open-label, sequential dose escalation study to
      explore the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a single intracoronary infusion of
      BNP116.sc-CMV.I1c in patients with NYHA Class III heart failure. Patients with symptomatic
      congestive heart failure will be enrolled until up to 12 subjects have received infusions of
      investigational product. All patients will be followed until 12 months post treatment
      intervention, and then undergo long-term follow-up via semi-structured telephone
      questionnaires every 6 months for an additional 24 months (+/- 30 days).

      The primary endpoint for this study is safety as measured by the following which will be
      assessed over the 12 month follow-up period as indicated in the Data Collection Table:

        -  Adverse Events

        -  All-cause Mortality

        -  Heart failure (HF) Hospitalization

      Secondary Endpoints

      The secondary safety endpoints assessed will include the following:

        -  Echocardiographic assessments at 4 weeks +/- 3 days post-administration of
           BNP116.sc-CMV.I1c including

        -  Echocardiographic assessments of LVEF, LVEVD, LVEDVI, VLESV, LVEVI, SpI and GLSand
           degree of mitral regurgitation o

      The secondary efficacy endpoints will explore efficacy. Functional endpoints will be assessed
      as changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months following investigational product administration
      as indicated. These endpoints include:

      Functional Status &amp; Hospitalizations

        -  Peak VO2 assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing

        -  6-minute walk test

        -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification

        -  Total number of days alive out-of-hospital (as well as total days out-of-hospital as a %
           of total days alive post study intervention)

      Physiologic Assessments at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline

        -  Echocardiographic assessments of LVEF, LVEVD, LVEDVI, VLESV, LVEVI, SpI and GLSand
           degree of mitral regurgitation

        -  NT-proBNP level

      Quality of Life at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline

      o Health related quality of life as assessed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
      Questionnaire (MLWHFQ)

      The following endpoints will also be measured over the 12 month follow-up period and
      long-term follow-up period (until month 36 post-intervention):

        -  Survival

        -  Cardiac transplantation

        -  Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation
