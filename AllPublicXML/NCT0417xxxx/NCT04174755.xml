  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is rising worldwide, both in low- and high-income countries,
      including people with HIV (PWH). Semaglutide's efficacy in achieving weight loss in obese PWH
      is still unexplored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      semaglutide in achieving greater weight loss compared to diet and excercise alone in obese
      PWH and to explore the effect of semaglutide on the immune function, markers of immune
      activation, viral reservoir, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism and gut microbiome.

      A randomised, controlled, parallel-group, open-label study comparing treatment with the GLP-1
      analogue semaglutide in combination with lifestyle interventions to lifestyle interventions
      alone in obese PWH.

      The study will enroll HIV-1 infected patients ≥ 18 years with BMI ≥30kg/m2 or BMI ≥27kg/m2
      and hypertension, dyslipidaemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Primary objective: To assess the efficacy of semaglutide as an adjunct to diet and exercise
      in achieving greater weight loss in obese PWH as compared to diet and exercise alone.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To explore the effect of semaglutide on markers of immune function and HIV viral
           reservoirs in obese PWH.

        -  To explore the effect of semaglutide on markers of glucose and lipid metabolism in obese
           PWH.

        -  To explore the effect of semaglutide on markers of inflammation and gut microbial
           translocation in obese PWH.

        -  To assess the safety of semaglutide in obese PWH on stable ART.
