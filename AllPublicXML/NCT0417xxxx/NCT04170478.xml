    <textblock>
      Rationale: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second cause of cancer-related deaths for men. The
      standard surgical treatment for localised prostate cancer is radical prostatectomy. Possible
      side effects of this treatment are incontinence and erectile dysfunction and this is related
      to the whole-gland resection. A focal treatment with fewer side effects is desired for
      patients with only a small focus of PCa. For this purpose, focal laser ablation is feasible.
      Current focal laser ablation techniques use a single fibre setup with the need for fibre
      replacement revisualisation of the tumour side accordingly. This leads to a long treatment
      duration.

      The Echolaser® system is a laser ablation system with four simultaneously operating laser
      sources. This provides a potential larger treatment area, without the need for fibre
      replacement.

      This makes the system advantageous for focal laser ablation of prostate cancer, especially
      since it can be applied under local anaesthesia.

      This pilot study aims to evaluate histological ablative efficacy on radical prostatectomy
      specimens following TPLA, feasibility and safety using a (multi)fibre setup in men with
      localized prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that TPLA will show adequate
      histological ablative efficacy and will be feasible and safe.

    <description>Safety is assessed by device and procedural adverse events using the CTCAE v5.0 until radical prostatectomy. TPLA is definitely safe when ≤10% of patients experience major adverse events, defined as grade 3 or higher. Technical feasibility is determined by procedural success of the TPLA treatment.
TPLA is definitely feasible when ≥90% of procedures is performed successfully without any problems regarding needle placement, fibre introduction or device malfunctioning.</description>
