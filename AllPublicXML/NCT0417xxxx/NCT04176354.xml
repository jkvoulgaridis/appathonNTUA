      A retrospective observational analysis of de-identified Flatiron Health Analytic Database to

    <textblock>
      Utilizing de-identified data derived from the Flatiron Health Analytic Database, the
      retrospective observational study is to describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns
      and effectiveness of Palbociclib + AI as first-line therapy in HR+/HER2-MBC in the US
      real-world clinical practice setting. Patients will be evaluated retrospectively from index
      therapy date to death, or last visit in the database, whichever comes first. Descriptive and
      multivariate statistical analyses will be performed.
