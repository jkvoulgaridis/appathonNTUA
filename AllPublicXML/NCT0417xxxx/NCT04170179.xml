  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Systemic chemotherapy of
      oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus lenvatinib and toripalimab in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma with extrahepatic metastasis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin was effective and safe
      for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall
      survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and programmed cell death protein-1
      (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma. No study has evaluated systemic chemotherapyplus lenvatinib and toripalimab. Thus,
      the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to find out it.
