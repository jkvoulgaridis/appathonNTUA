    <textblock>
      The aim of the planned study was to evaluate the effect of repeated cryostimulation
      treatments on immunological, morphological, and biochemical indicators of the peripheral
      blood of healthy, young Men

      A group of 18 healthy men aged 19-26 participated in the study. The group included a group of
      ten students with high physical activity and a group of eight students with moderate physical
      activity.

      Whole-body cryotherapy was performed in a cryochamber located in the Malopolska Cryotherapy
      Centre in Krakow (Poland) in the spring of 2013 and in the winter and spring of 2014.

      The temperature inside the vestibule during the procedure was about -60 ºC and in the actual
      chamber about -120 ºC. The concentration of oxygen in the air of the cryochamber was kept
      constant at 21-22% and continuously controlled by two independent oxygen probes.

      The participants of the study were subjected to 24 whole-body cryotherapy treatments (one
      treatment three times a week for two months). Before the procedure, they were informed about
      how to move and breathe in the cryochamber. Each entrance to the cryochamber was preceded by
      a 30-second adaptation period in the vestibule at a temperature of -60 ºC. Then the subjects
      entered the cryochamber for three minutes. During the treatment, the men wore short trousers,
      woollen socks and gloves, hats or headbands to protect against freezing and clogs. Moreover,
      the mouths and noses of the participants were covered with surgical masks, secured with a
      strip of gauze. During the procedure, the subjects were in permanent eye contact with the
      doctor and the staff.

Blood was collected from each participant (with an empty stomach) at a laboratory located at the Academy of Physical Education in Krakow, where after a ten-minute rest in a sitting position at room temperature (about 19 °C), blood was collected from the vein in the crook of the elbow by a laboratory diagnostician in accordance with applicable standards. Blood was collected 13 times.</description>
