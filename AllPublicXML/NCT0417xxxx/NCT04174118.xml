  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test an experimental study drug (DCR-A1AT). This drug is being
      tested to see if it helps people with a rare condition known as Alpha-1 Antitrypsin
      Deficiency, or A1ATD. Prior to initiation of this study DCR-A1AT has not yet been tested in
      humans. This study will have 2 parts: Group A and Group B. Group A is for people who do not
      have A1ATD. Group B is for people who have been diagnosed with A1ATD. All study participants
      will be randomly assigned to either receive the study drug or a placebo. This will allow for
      the sponsor to compare the effects of the study drug with that of placebo. A placebo looks
      like the study drug but does not contain any of the study drug.

      Group A: The main purpose of the first part of the study is to evaluate the safety profile of
      the study drug in people who do not have A1ATD. This part of the study will also help find
      the dose of the study drug that has an acceptable safety profile for testing.

      Group B: This is the second part of the study. This part of the study is for people who have
      been diagnosed with A1ATD, so the people in the first part of the study cannot participate in
      the second part of the study. The main purpose of this part of the study is different because
      the drug will now be given to people who have A1ATD. This part of the study will also help
      find the dose of the study drug that is safest and works the best, but with people who have
      A1ATD. This way, this part of the study will show if the drug is potentially safe for and
      could potentially be effective against A1ATD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A1ATD- associated liver disease is a progressive Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Deficiency Associated
      Liver Disease condition resulting in liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
      The lack of function A1AT in individuals with PiZZ genotype, in conjunction with other
      precipitating factors, can lead to unchecked activity in neutrophil elastases in the alveoli;
      causing emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This loss-of-function
      mechanism can be addressed with intravenous augmentation therapy, which aims to substitute
      the missing A1AT by infusing alpha1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI), purified from pooled human
      plasma.

      While augmentation therapy can address the loss of A1AT in the lung, no treatment exists for
      the associated liver disease.

      Given the severity of the disease, with approximately 10% of affected patients developing
      liver cirrhosis and a subgroup of those patients in need of liver transplantation, and lack
      of an effective treatment that addresses the toxic hepatic &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mechanism,
      there is an urgent unmet medical need to develop a therapy that can help in this particular
      patient population.
