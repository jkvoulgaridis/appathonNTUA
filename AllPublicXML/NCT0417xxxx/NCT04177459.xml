  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adolescents living
      with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME) is low if compared with healthy adolescents and
      adolescents living with other chronic diseases. Effective strategies to improve HRQoL in this
      group are still lacking. Recently we have observed HRQoL in a group of Norwegian adolescents
      with CFS/ME (not yet published), which is the background for a new study where we have
      planned an intervention with health promoting dialogues between patient and nurse, as a
      strategy to improve HRQoL. In this study we have also opened to include adolescents with
      other chronic fatigue diagnosis with similar challenges in follow-up as in CFS/ME.

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a 5 dimension and 5 level Questionnaire from the Euro Qol Group (supported by the Euro QolGroup Association and Euro Qol Research Foundation). Health states which is defined by EQ-5D-5L-answers, is assigned a score between 0 and 1 by applying preference weights. In Norway it has been common to use preference weights obtained from a sample of the general population in the UK. Norwegian preference weights will be available in near future. EQ-5D is the name of the instrument and is not an acronym. EQ-5D is the correct term to use in print or verbally.</description>
