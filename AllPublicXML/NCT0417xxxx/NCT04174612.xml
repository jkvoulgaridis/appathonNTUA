  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with de novo AML, untreated, newly diagnosed, according to WHO 2016 criteria

          2. Presence of a mutation of FLT3 gene, either ITD and/or TKD

          3. Adequate availability of diagnostic biologic material for full cytological,
             cytogenetic, genetic and immunophenotypic disease characterization according to ELN
             criteria.

          4. Presence of morphologically identifiable blasts on peripheral blood at diagnosis

          5. Presence of a Leukemia-associated aberrant immune-phenotype (LAIP) as assessed by MFC
             (multiparametric flow cytometry) at diagnosis

          6. Age between 18 and 65 years, included

          7. ECOG performance status 0-2 or disease-related reversible ECOG 3 score following
             adequate supportive care.

          8. Signed written informed consent according to ICH/EU/GCP and national local laws

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia

          2. Diagnosis of AML with t(8;21)(q22:q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and t(16;16)(p13:q22) or
             inversion of chromosome 16 (16)(p13q22)/CBFB-MYH11; in case of suspicion of
             CBF-related AML due to morphological and/or immunophenotypic features, specific FISH
             or molecular testing is strongly recommended in accordance with WHO criteria3,157

          3. Patients with LVEF less than 45% (by echocardiogram or MUGA)

          4. Pre-existing, uncontrolled pathology such as heart failure (congestive/ischaemic,
             acute myocardial infarction within the post 3 months, untreatable arrhythmias, NYHA
             classes III and IV), sever liver disease with total bilirubin ≥2,5 x ULN and/or ALT&gt;3
             ULN (unless attributable to AML), acute or chronic pancreatitis, kidney function
             impairment with serum creatinine ≥2,5 (unless attributable to AML) and severe
             neuropsychiatric disorder that impairs the patient's ability to understand and sign
             the informed consent or to cope with the intended treatment plan. For altered liver,
             pancreas and kidney function tests, eligibility criteria can be reassessed at 24-96
             hours, following the institution of adequate supportive measures.

          5. Uncontrolled bacterial or fungal infections

          6. QTc &gt;470 msec on screening ECG (Fridericia's formula)

          7. A history of cancer that is not in remission phase following surgery and/or
             chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with life expectancy &lt; 1 year.

          8. Pregnancy declared by the patient herself. A pregnancy test is performed at diagnosis
             and, if applicable, before allogeneic HSCT . Female and male patients who are fertile
             must agree to use an effective form of contraception with their sexual partners from
             enrollment through 4 months after the end of treatment.
