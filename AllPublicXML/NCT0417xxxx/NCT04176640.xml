      Lay Summary:

      To evaluate a novel early diagnostic tool for hospitalized children with traumatic brain
      injury.

      The Problem: Children who present with decreased level of consciousness after injury require
      urgent medical attention determined by the type and the severity of injury. Unfortunately,
      history and physical findings are often unreliable in the first hours after hospitalization,
      the period in which urgent management decisions must be made for their treatment.

      The Solution: A promising tool developed for measuring detectable evidence of traumatic brain
      injury on routine brain scans. The tool combines features invisible to the human eye but
      detectable by computer software with expert knowledge.This study will evaluate how well the
      tool can perform in a real health care setting. It is believed that it will greatly improve
      the efficacy and quality of care provided to children after traumatic brain injury.

    <description>GOSE for Pediatrics score is the reference standard for measuring traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcome. GOSE-P is a NINDS Common Data Element for functional outcome that rates patient status into one of eight categories: Dead, Vegetative State, Lower severe disability, Upper severe Disability, Lower moderate disability, Upper moderate Disability, Lower good recovery or Upper good Recovery. Minimum score = 1, Maximum score = 8
Level 1 = Dead Level 2 = Vegetative State Level 3 = Low Severe Disability Level 4 = Upper Severe Disability Level 5 = Lower Moderate Disability Level 6 = Upper Moderate Disability Level 7 = Low Good Recovery Level 8 = Upper Good Recovery</description>

    <description>Clinical outcomes were defined as intracranial hypertension and/or, need for neurosurgical intervention and/or early mortality.</description>

    <measure>To determine if QBIct tool predicts recovery endpoints.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Endpoints were defined by global functional outcomes, mechanical ventilation days, and intensive care days, hospital days and/or home from school days.
Global functional outcomes will be measured using Vineland-II. Vineland-II is a standardized psychological tool used to measure 4 major aspects of adaptive functioning: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization and Motor Skills. It measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. Because adaptive behavior refers to an individual's typical performance of the day-to-day activities required for personal and social sufficiency, these scales assess what a person actually does, rather than what he or she is able to do.
In order to determine the level of an individual's adaptive behavior, someone who is familiar with that individual, such as a parent or caregiver, is asked to describe his activities. Those activities are then compared to those of ot</description>
