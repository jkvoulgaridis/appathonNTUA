      Purpose: To test the effectiveness of an exercise intervention that combines group walking,
      activity tracking, and heart rate monitoring (i.e. Physical Activity can Enhance Life,
      PACE-Life) on the physical and mental health for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum
      disorder.

      Participants: 56 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

      Procedures (methods): During the baseline assessment, all participants will be provided with
      a Fitbit wristband and instructed how to use it. During the first group session, participants
      will be taught how to use their heart rate (on the Fitbit) to determine how fast participants
      should walk (to achieve the appropriate exercise dosage). Information on proper care, usage,
      and how to determine the appropriate heart from the watch, which will be used to guide the
      intensity of the walk will be provided to participants and reviewed at each group session.
      Participants randomly assigned to PACE Life clinic based group sessions will arrive at the
      STEP clinic to meet the entire group and leaders and be reminded of the heart rate (HR) that
      corresponds with the intensity of that group session. Next, the group will go outside and
      walk for 30 minutes. At the completion of 30 minutes, everyone will go back into the clinic
      for water and review of the walk. After the second group session of each week, participants
      will receive weekly progress reports of their steps and minutes spent walking the prior week
      (obtained from Fitbit devices). During this session, participants will also set individual
      goals for the upcoming week for both their &quot;intensity walks&quot; and total steps per day.

      Participants randomly assigned to Fitbit Alone will be given a Fitbit and shown how to use it
      by study staff. Participants will also be given information on current recommended physical
      activity guidelines (150 min/week of moderate intensity exercise) and will be told that study
      staff may be contacting them on a weekly basis (or shorter, if necessary) if it looks like
      participants are not wearing their Fitbit for a certain number of days (e.g. 3 consecutive
      days) or to troubleshoot any issues. If necessary, participants might be invited to come to
      the clinic to get assistance on any Fitibit or exercise related issues.

    <textblock>
      Overview of Procedures: The PACE-Life Group will be integrated into the Schizophrenia
      Treatment and Evaluation Program (STEP) outpatient clinics in Raleigh, NC and Carrboro, NC.
      The group walks will occur in the surrounding area around the clinics on sidewalks, bike
      trails, and residential streets. Goal setting groups and all assessments will take place in a
      conference room at the clinic. Goal-setting will include setting goals for the upcoming week
      in terms of number of steps as well as how many intensity walks that individuals plan to
      complete. Clinic-based group sessions will also include if-then plans and problem solving any
      issues that interfere with home-based walks.

      The Fitbit Alone participants will be given a Fitbit and instructed on how to use them as
      well as information on current recommended physical activity guidelines. Participants will be
      told that study staff may be contacting them on a weekly basis (or shorter, if necessary) if
      it looks like they are not wearing their Fitbit for a certain number of days or to
      troubleshoot any issues. If necessary participants may be invited to come to the clinic to
      receive assistance on any Fitibit or exercise related issues.

      Assessments/Measures: The exercise intervention, PACE-Life, will last for 16 weeks and
      includes both group walks and independent. Participants will be asked to complete assessments
      at screening, baseline, mid-point, post-test, and 1-month follow-up.

      At Screening the following measures will be examined: Demographics, the Wechsler Abbreviated
      Scale of Intelligence (WASI), a licensed physician will complete a medical history and
      physical exam, Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) and the -the
      Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)will be used to verify that participants
      have a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis before they are enrolled in the study.

      At Baseline, Mid-point, Post-test, and 1-Month Follow-up the following measures will be
      examined: Demographics, Minutes Spent Walking, the Short Form International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire (IPAQ), Steps/day, Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)- CRF will be measured using
      the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Self-determination Basic Needs, the Basic Psychological Need
      Scale-in General, the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale (BPNES), the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Resting Systolic/Diastolic Blood Pressure and resting heart
      rate (RHR), autonomous motivation will be measured with the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise
      Questionnaire-2 (BREQ-2), enjoyment of walking will be measured with the Physical Activity
      Enjoyment Scale (PACES), the UCLA Loneliness Scale, Weight, BMI, and Waist/hip Circumference.

      At the conclusion of the open trial, the investigators will administer a brief questionnaire
      to the participants regarding satisfaction and acceptability that will have both likert
      ratings and open-ended questions.

      Intervention- PACE-Life Groups will occur twice per week for 30 minutes for the entire
      intervention without changes in frequency and duration. The intensity, however, of both group
      walks and home-based walks will increase throughout this intervention in a stepwise fashion
      to create an exercise dose response to maximize impact on CRF.

      Fitbits: All participants will be provided a Fitbit that is labeled with a participant
      number. All Fitbits are paired to a Fitbit account. Data from Fitbit devices can be synced to
      the corresponding account and accessed through Fitbit.com. Participants will be provided
      information about their accounts should participants want to look at the data but will be
      asked not to change any of the settings as the investigators will be using data for tracking
      steps/day and minutes spent walking.

      Temporary Protocol Changes due to COVID-19 Pandemic:

      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, currently enrolled study participants have stopped
      participating in walking groups. Participants will have their Mid-Treatment and 1-month
      follow-up assessments scheduled sooner than originally planned starting in mid-April until
      further notice. Conducting the assessments will allow for collecting data immediately
      post-treatment, albeit on an accelerated time frame. Assessments will be completed remotely
      (online or over the telephone) with the exception to those that require an in-person visit
      i.e. the 6-minute walk test, weight, BMI, waist/hip circumference, blood pressure and heart
      rate.
