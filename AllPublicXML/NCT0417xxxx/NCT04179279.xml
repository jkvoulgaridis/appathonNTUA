  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pivotal study in patients admitted/visiting the cardiology ward and/or
      outpatient clinics for various indications.

      The study will be conducted in two stages. The first stage will comprise a pilot study with
      10 subjects, which will be completed and analyzed prior to initiation of the second stage.
      The two studies are independent and are included in the same protocol for logistical reasons.
      The second stage of the study, which will include 120 subjects, is pivotal and intended to
      validate the Gili BioSensor System.

      Testing procedure will include seating the subject in either a steady chair in front of a
      table, or in bed with the bedrest raised in front of a cardiac table (or similar). The
      subject will be seated for 5 minutes to reach a physiological steady state. During this time,
      the subject will be connected to the reference device according to the manufacturer's
      guidelines. The investigational device will be placed on a stable surface in front of the
      subject (table / cardiac table or similar) and will point to the left side of the subject's
      chest. Both the investigational and reference devices will be temporally synchronized to
      maintain coordinated recording. Following the 5-minute resting period, both investigational
      and reference devices will be activated for a comparative recording session to acquire at
      least 180 seconds (3 minutes) of evaluable data. Each 60-sec interval will be used separately
      for comparative analyses.

    <description>Heart rate will be compared to a reference:

    <measure>Safety evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>During the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Gili BioSensor System functions without physical contact with the inspected subject, and is compared in this study to a reference device routinely used as standard of care (SOC). Consequently, we do not expect any safety issues. At the same time, any adverse events (AE) observed during the procedure and/or during the study and/or follow-up period will be recorded in the CRF.</description>
