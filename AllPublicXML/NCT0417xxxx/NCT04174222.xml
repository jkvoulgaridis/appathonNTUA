  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, and parallel design study. A total 58
      patients were randomized to receive a deep block or a moderate block scheduled for elective
      robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Intraoperative peak inspiratory pressure
      and plateau pressure are assessed.

    <textblock>
      Patients &gt;18 years of age with an america society of anesthesiologist classification of I or
      II who are scheduled to undergo elective robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
      are included. The exclusion criteria are a history of neuromuscular, renal, or hepatic
      disease, known allergy to rocuronium or sugammadex. Patients are randomized to either the
      moderate or deep neuromuscular blockade group using Random Allocation Software (version 1.0).
      In the operating room, routine monitoring is performed, including electrocardiography,
      non-invasive arterial pressure measurements, and pulse oximetry. Additionally,
      acceleromyography are applied to monitor the response of the adductor pollicis muscle. After
      the induction of anesthesia with propofol and before rocuronium administration, the
      TOF-Watch-SX is calibrated and stabilised, and a series of train-of-four (TOF) measurements
      are documented every 1 min. Next, intravenous rocuronium at 0.6 mg/kg was administered, and
      tracheal intubation was performed after confirmation of relaxation. Anesthesia is maintained
      with desflurane and target-controlled infusion of remifentanil while monitoring the
      bispectral index. Intravenous rocuronium (5-10 mg) is used to maintain moderate (TOF count of
      1 or 2) or deep (post-tetanic count [PTC] of 1 or 2) neuromuscular blockade. Peak inspiratory
      pressure and plateau pressure are recorded until 1 hour after pneumoperitoneum. At the end of
      the operation, the surgeon rated the surgical condition on a 5-point scale. Patients are
      reversed with intravenous sugammadex at 2 or 4 mg/kg. Postoperative pulmonary complications
      (SpO2 &lt;100%, RR&lt;8, atelectasis) are assessed and recorded.
