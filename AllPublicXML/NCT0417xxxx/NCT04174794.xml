  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Switzerland 15% of discharged patients are readmitted within 30 days. Acute heart failure
      is the leading cause of hospital admission and one of the most frequent reasons for
      re-admission, mainly because of congestion-driven symptoms. Residual congestion is noted in
      10%-15% of patients at discharge and is associated with an increased risk of re-admission and
      mortality. Lung ultrasound outperforms both chest X‐ray and physical examination in detection
      of lung congestion. Several semiquantitative scanning protocols exist for quantifying
      congestion. The aim of this study is to compare for the first time two widely used lung
      ultrasound protocols, one exhaustive (28-points) and one simplified (8-points), in real-time
      settings. The focus is placed on reproducibility (expert-beginner interobserver concordance),
      feasibility (time consumption for images acquisition and interpretation) and performance
      (detection of B-lines clearing) of both scores. Semi-quantitative method is expected to have
      better feasibility with similar reproducibility and performance.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the amount of disagreement between beginner and expert echographers at admission lung ultrasound. In order to compare protocols using different grading systems, a common 4-levels interstitial syndrome (IS) severity scale is defined. For the 28-point protocol, rating of total number of B-lines will be classified according to literature in severe (&gt;30), moderate (16-30), mild (6-15) or no signs of IS (≤5 B-lines). For the 8-point protocol, IS is arbitrarily classified as follows: 'severe' (6-8), 'moderate' (4-5), mild (2-3) and 'no signs' (0-1 positive zones).</description>

    <description>The two different lung ultrasound protocols are performed initially within 48 hours of internal medicine ward admission by a pair of expert-beginner echographers. In case of admission during non-working days, the first scan can be done within 72 hours from admission. Follow-up scans are repeated 4 to 6 days later or on the day of discharge if it occurs before de fourth day. Experts and beginners execute the lund ultrasound protocols in sequence, reciprocally blinded, without accessing to clinical data files.</description>
