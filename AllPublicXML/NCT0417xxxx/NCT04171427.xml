      This study has as objectives:

      Primary objective :

      • Evaluate the percentage of repigmentation observed one month after the end of three months
      of treatment measured on an objective layer by image analysis;

      Secondary objectives:

      Evaluate:

        -  the percentage of repigmentation observed after one, two and three months of treatment
           measured on an objective layer by image analysis;

        -  the ability of the product to maintain the human body in good condition (cutaneous
           acceptability) by clinical examination by the dermatologist;

        -  Patient satisfaction using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10.

        -  The illustrative effect using standardized photographs;

        -  The quantity of product by weighing the tubes.

        -  The occurrence of possible adverse effects.

      Population:

        -  Sexe: female and male;

        -  Age: over 18 years old;

        -  Patients with stable non-segmental vitiligo lesions (defined as no new lesions or
           lesions that have been present for at least 3 months, lack of hypochromic margins in
           Wood's lumen and absence of confetti depigmentation);

        -  Patients with 2 to 6 symmetrical lesions (1 to 3 on each side). These lesions (macules)
           will be treated for a minimum surface of 2 cm² and a maximum surface of 100 cm².
