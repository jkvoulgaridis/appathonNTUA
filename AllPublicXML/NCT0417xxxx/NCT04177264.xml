    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the hypothesis that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) and
      non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) elicit
      anti-inflammatory actions through activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. In a
      cross-over design, research participants will be subjected to various combinations of OMT,
      taVNS, or sham interventions during four study sessions, that are at least one month apart.
      During each study session research participants will undergo OMT and/or taVNS for 3
      consecutive days. Blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded on all three
      study days to assess parasympathetic nervous system function. On the 3rd study day a blood
      sample will be taken to assess the effects of OMT and/or taVNS on inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biological anti-inflammatory drugs, such as TNF-Î± antagonists, have revolutionized treatment
      of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
      psoriasis, or other auto-immune disorders and have largely improved prognosis and quality of
      life of patients affected by these conditions. However, the high cost of these agents is
      prohibitive for a large number of patients and some patients are not eligible to such
      treatments because of co-morbidities that constitute contraindications. Thus, there is a need
      for cost-effective alternative treatment strategies. Activation of the cholinergic
      anti-inflammatory pathway, which operates through the parasympathetic nervous system, may
      constitute an alternative approach to treat chronic inflammatory diseases. This pathway has
      been demonstrated to shift the function of immune cells in reticular organs, such as the
      spleen from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state. Subsequently, these
      &quot;reprogrammed&quot; cells translocate to the systemic circulation and reach the site of
      inflammation. Clinical studies and the investigators' preliminary data suggest that
      non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) can augment
      parasympathetic tone and potentially activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.
      Another way of potentially activating this pathway is through osteopathic manipulative
      treatment (OMT) because some OMT techniques have been demonstrated to increase
      parasympathetic activity. However, it is not known if such OMT techniques also activate the
      cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Furthermore, it is not known if osteopathic lymphatic
      pump techniques augment these anti-inflammatory responses by facilitating translocation of
      &quot;reprogrammed&quot; immune cells from reticular organs to the systemic circulation. The
      investigators' long-term goal is to contribute to the development of cost-effective OMT
      approaches to treat chronic inflammatory diseases. The central hypothesis is that successive
      applications of different OMT techniques or the combination of taVNS with specific OMT
      techniques first activate and then augment the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway through
      stimulating parasympathetic tone and facilitating translocation of immune cells.
      Parasympathetic nervous system function will be assessed by heart rate variability analysis
      and other cardiovascular parameters that are under the influence of the parasympathetic
      nervous system. Immune function will be assessed by measuring plasma concentrations of
      inflammatory mediators (cytokines) and by in vitro cell culture experiments of immune cells.
      At the completion of these studies, the investigators anticipate to demonstrate that OMT
      techniques that activate the parasympathetic nervous system and taVNS elicit
      anti-inflammatory effects. Second, the investigators also anticipate to demonstrate that
      subsequently applied osteopathic lymphatic pump techniques augment the anti-inflammatory
      actions of OMT and taVNS by facilitating translocation of &quot;reprogrammed&quot; immune cells from
      the spleen to the systemic circulation. These outcomes are expected to have important
      positive impact, because they will potentially lay a mechanistic foundation for future
      clinical studies applying such combinations of taVNS and OMT techniques to chronic
      inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis,
      psoriasis, or other auto-immune disorders.

    <measure>Effect of the Interventions on Inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the interventions on inflammation is assessed by plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; activation or inactivation of immune cells in the blood; and release of cytokines from TLR-ligand-activated immune cell cultures. All of these inflammatory measures will be determined from blood samples collected on the third study day and therefore, reflect the cumulative effect of the three study days.</description>

    <intervention_name>Occipito-Atlantal Decompression (OA DC)</intervention_name>
    <description>The participant lies supine in a relaxed state while the investigator cradles the patient's head with their hands, middle finger pads along the inferior aspect of inion, reaching to the occipito-atlantal joint. The investigator then applies gentle posterior and cephalad traction to the occiput, while bringing the elbows together. This results in supination of the hands and separation of the middle fingers, creating a posterior-lateral force vector to either side of the foramen magnum. The pressure is maintained until softening of the underlying structures is felt. The procedure is applied for 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>A bipolar clip electrode is attached to the auricle at the location of the cymba conchae. Electrical stimulation (30 Hz stimulation frequency, 300 Î¼s pulse width) is applied for 10 min. The stimulation current is determined individually for each participant by slowly increasing the stimulation current until the participants feel a mild tingling sensation at the site of the electrode. Then the current is gradually reduced until the tingling sensation disappears. This current will then be used for taVNS. A TENS 7000 or EMS 7500 device (510(k): K080661) is used.</description>
