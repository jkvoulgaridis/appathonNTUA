    <textblock>
      This Veteran Affairs (VA) Quality Improvement project aims to understand which data-driven
      implementation strategies promote evidence based practices that improve high-quality care for
      Veterans with cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 120,000 Veterans in care have cirrhosis, or advanced liver disease, from alcohol,
      hepatitis C, fatty liver disease, or other causes, and this number is rapidly increasing.
      There are life-saving measures that providers can take to prevent harm from cirrhosis. The
      three most impactful of these measures include providing access to post-discharge follow-up
      and screening for liver cancer and esophageal varices (veins that can cause catastrophic
      bleeding). However, only about one-third of Veterans receive care aligned with these three
      evidence-based practices (EBPs). Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve access to
      high-quality care for Veterans with this common condition.

      By focusing on strategies that most successfully encourage implementation of evidence-based
      practices the investigators can address the urgent need to improve the quality and timeliness
      of care for Veterans with cirrhosis who receive care at VA hospitals. This quality
      improvement intervention seeks to understand which implementation strategies, or discrete
      activities that are conducted to promote EBP implementation, improve cirrhosis care. The aims
      of this evaluation are to: (1) empirically determine which combinations of implementation
      strategies ('data-driven strategies') are associated with the successful implementation of
      EBPs for Veterans with cirrhosis, (2) use Intervention Mapping to operationalize the
      'data-driven' implementation strategies developed in the first aim, and (3) evaluate whether
      applying data-driven implementation strategies increases the use of EBPs for cirrhosis, using
      a hybrid type III stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. The investigators will measure
      cirrhosis care at all VA sites and use the data from aims 1 and 2 to provide feedback to all
      sites. The investigators anticipate that more intensive implementation interventions will
      directly impact 12 of the lowest-performing sites.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will select twelve 'low-performing' sites to receive a bundle of strategies that have been empirically determined to be associated with evidence based practices for Veterans with cirrhosis. Using a hybrid type III stepped wedge cluster design, in which the investigators provide the bundle of strategies to four sites every six month period, then will evaluate whether applying these data-driven implementation strategies increases the use of evidence based practices and outcomes for cirrhosis compared to VA sites operating as usual.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Active patients, or those with outpatient or prescription activity within the last eighteen months, with a diagnosis of cirrhosis should have abdominal imaging every 6 months. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Post-transplant patients are not included. This measure is being assessed by comparing the patients that have had imaging for liver cancer screening in the last eight months to those that have not.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Screening for varices</measure>
    <time_frame>Those who have had a variceal screening done in the past 3.5 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with diagnosis of cirrhosis, who do not have an active Veterans Affairs (VA) or NON-VA prescription for a preferred non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) documented in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) (treatment), should have variceal screening completed within the last 3 years. This metric includes a 6-month grace period, so those completing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within 3.5 years will meet the metric. Post-transplant patients are excluded. The investigators will compare those who have met the metric to those who have a diagnosis of cirrhosis, platelet count &lt;150, and the investigators will look at data from 1999 to current.</description>
