  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK101, an anti-IL-12/23 p40 antibody, when administered
      subcutaneously, in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The study will consist
      of 3 periods: up to 4 weeks screening, 12 weeks double-blinded treatment and long-term
      follow-up period(up to 52 weeks).

    <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant's QoL. It is a 10-item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall Qol, can be used to assess six different aspects that mey affect QoL: 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment.</description>
