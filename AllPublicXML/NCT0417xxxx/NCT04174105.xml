  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 open-label, ascending dose, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of AT845 in adult (aged ≥ 18 years) subjects, ambulatory or
      nonambulatory, with Late Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study (FORTIS) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of an investigational gene
      replacement therapy, AT845, in adult subjects with LOPD. Subjects will receive a single dose
      of AT845 delivered via intravenous (IV) infusion.

      Up to 2 nominal dose levels of AT845 are planned to be evaluated in FORTIS. A single AT845
      administration via IV infusion is planned for each subject. The initial dosing cohort will
      receive a single dose at Dose 1 of AT845. The second dose cohort will receive a single dose
      at Dose 2 of AT845.

      The core observation period will be completed by Week 48 for each subject. Subjects will be
      followed for a total of 5 years after administration of AT845.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is aged ≥ 18 years (ambulatory or nonambulatory).

          -  Subject has a documented clinical diagnosis of Pompe disease by genetic testing.

          -  Subject has received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with rhGAA for the previous ≥ 2
             years.

          -  Subject has been on a stable standard dose (at least 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks) of ERT
             with rhGAA for at least the previous 6 months.

          -  Subject has upright FVC ≥ 30% of predicted normal value.

          -  Subject or legally authorized representative(s) (LAR) (if applicable) provides written
             informed consent.

          -  Subject must agree to use appropriate contraception following consent through 6 months
             post AT845 administration.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is currently participating in an interventional study or has received gene or
             cell therapy.

          -  Subject tests positive for AAV8 neutralizing antibodies with titers above protocol
             specified threshold.

          -  Subject has received immune-modulating agents within 90 days before dosing (use of
             inhaled corticosteroids is allowed).

          -  Subject tests positive for GAA total antibodies with titers above protocol specified
             threshold.

          -  Subject has a high risk for a severe allergic reaction to rhGAA (ie, previous moderate
             to severe anaphylactic reaction to alglucosidase alfa or and/or a history of sustained
             high immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibody titers to alglucosidase alfa that in the opinion
             of the Investigator suggests a high risk for an allergic reaction to ERT).

          -  Subject has an active viral infection based on clinical observation.

          -  Subject has a history of, or currently has, a clinically important cardiac condition,
             such as an echocardiogram (ECHO) with ejection fraction below 40%, or has symptoms or
             signs of cardiomyopathy that in the opinion of the Investigator precludes enrollment.

          -  Subject has a clinically significant underlying liver disease.

          -  Subject has a contraindication to study drug or ingredients or to corticosteroids.
