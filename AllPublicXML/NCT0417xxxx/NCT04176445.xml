  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized crossover clinical trial aims to evaluate the influence of different
      body postures on pulmonary aeration among mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.
      Patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving invasive mechanical ventilation &gt;24
      hours, and without contraindications to mobilization, will be randomly assigned to one of two
      sequences of interventions at a single day: arm 1: bedside sitting posture followed by
      orthostatic board at 45º and 60º; arm 2: orthostatic board at 45º, 60º and 80º followed by
      bedside sitting posture. Each postural protocol (bedside sitting posture protocol or
      orthostatic board posture protocol) will last 30 minutes. A washout window period between
      1,5h and 2,5h will be applied between the two postural interventions. The primary outcome is
      the lung aeration assessed using the Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS) performed by trained
      evaluators at the end of postural protocol. Secondary outcomes include ventilatory mechanics
      (static compliance, airway resistance and respiratory work), PaO2/FiO2 ratio, Level of
      consciousness according to the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), and adverse events
      (hypertension, hypotension, tachicardia, bradycardia, tachypnea, bradypnea, decreased level
      of consciousness, patient distress, fall to knees, invasive device traction or loss, filter
      hemodialysis clotting or disruption).
