  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma, a disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation and hyper -responsiveness, is
      a common disease that affects all age groups. Asthma may be manifested as irreversible
      airflow obstruction in some patients. Although the pathogenesis of asthma is not well
      understood, increased oxidative stress due to an imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants has
      been found to be associated with asthma. In asthma, inflammation-related oxidative stress is
      driven by exposure to a variety of triggers, including allergens and viruses, which activate
      components of both the innate and acquired immune responses. Protection by escaping from
      triggering factors or standardization of asthma medication is difficult and usually is not
      enough for effective treatment. On the other hand, correction of antioxidative systems may be
      more efficacious in the control of asthmatic inflammation and asthma symptoms.

      Little is known about the role of asymmetric dimethylarginine in the pathogenesis of
      asthmatic airway inflammation. The lung is a major source of asymmetric dimethylarginine that
      can promote oxidative stress by a reduction in nitric oxide synthesis which would result in
      higher levels of peroxynitrite, that causes oxidative cell damage, and exacerbate airway
      inflammation. asymmetric dimethylarginine can modify lung function, increase airway
      hyper-reactivity even in non-inflamed airways, and promote lung collagen production and
      deposition. Increased asymmetric dimethylarginine in serum has been found to be associated
      with the severity of symptoms of asthma in obese adults.

      Malondialdehyde is an oxidant marker of pulmonary oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation.
      Paraoxonase, an antioxidant enzyme may play a protective role in asthma. It hydrolyzes lipid
      peroxides and prevents low-density lipoprotein oxidation.
