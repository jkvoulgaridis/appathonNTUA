    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial was conducted to
      observe the improvement in the level of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease
      during the 12-week period of oral treatment with Tianqi Pingchan Granule Combined With
      Amantadine. To observe the differences of the safety and effectiveness between Tianqi
      Pingchan Granule combined with amantadine and placebo combined with amantadine.
