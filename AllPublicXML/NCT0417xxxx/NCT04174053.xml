  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Connected medicine &quot;2.0&quot; is a major challenge that will lead in the near future to profound
      changes in medical practices. Our study is part of this technological transformation, which
      is already taking the form of multiple devices available to practitioners: connected pill
      dispensers, integrated monitoring and surveillance systems (telemedicine), connected sensors,
      etc.

      However, a symptom as crucial and simple as body temperature has not been measured by
      real-time enteric capsule in a context of neutropenia. We therefore wish to study the
      concordance between the peripheral (tympanic) temperature and that measured by a capsule
      ingested in a cohort of patients hospitalized in the USIH. If the measurements are clinically
      reliable and truly allow anticipation of antimicrobial treatments, a medico-economic
      evaluation will be proposed between the two options in the context of USIH before its
      possible generalization.
