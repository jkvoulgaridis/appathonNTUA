  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cholangitis (AC) occurs when biliary stenosis, due to various benign causes (often
      gallstones) or the presence of a tumour, leads to cholestasis and biliary infection. AC is a
      life-threatening infection if not diagnosed and treated in time, its mortality ranges from
      1.4% to 5.2%. AC can be classified into different stages of severity depending on organ
      failure. A severity classification has been proposed by the Asian recommendations of Tokyo
      2013: Grade I (Benin), Grade II (Moderate) and Grade III (Severe).

      AC treatment includes endoscopic or percutaneous bile drainage in combination with systemic
      antibiotic treatment. It is currently recommended that patients with severe CA (Grade III)
      have biliary drainage within 24 hours, although it has not been shown to improve their
      survival. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant germs, which is a public health issue, calls
      for reasonable and considered use of antibiotics. Reducing the duration of antibiotic therapy
      is a fundamental measure of antimicrobial management and antibiotics sparing. 7 to 10 days of
      antibiotic treatment is common in the treatment of CA. A 14-day treatment is recommended in
      case of associated bacteremia. A recent study of 263 patients showed that reducing the
      duration of antibiotic therapy to less than 7 days in patients with CA associated with
      bacteremia with effective drainage does not increase the risk of recurrence or mortality at
      30 days. However, this study was monocentric retrospective and compared groups that were
      unbalanced in terms of CA severity. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in the
      treatment of CA in critically ill patients hospitalized in intensive care remains poorly
      known.

      The main purpose of this study is to compare short antibiotic therapy with long antibiotic
      therapy in terms of mortality in patients with AC admitted in intensive care unit (ICU).

      Using electronic patient data monitoring systems, the investigators reviewed all patients
      with a diagnosis of AC admitted to digestive liver disease unity or ICUs at the Nantes
      University Hospital, Rennes University Hospital from January 1, 2006, to december 31, 2018.
      For enrolled patients, general clinical characteristics were collected. Patients were
      categorized into two groups according to antibiotics duration, and the differences of these
      characteristics between two groups were evaluated.
