  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aim is to conduct an RCT to study the effect of adjunct metformin treatment to
      insulin monotherapy in patients with type 1 diabetes, targeting the intestinal incretin
      secretion. The patients will be randomly allocated to metformin or placebo treatment for 4
      months

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to the large armamentarium of antidiabetic agents for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      (T2DM), the insulinocentric therapeutic approach in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) has
      distracted the scientific perspective from the rise of novel therapies. Insulin monotherapy
      has long overshadowed the overall hormonal dysregulation that demarcates T1DM . In specific,
      the significance of the gut-derived incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP
      (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide), which are implicated with glucose metabolism via
      the gut-pancreatic axis, has been merely addressed.

      Investigators' goal in the current protocol is to delineate the glucoregulatory role of
      incretin hormones in T1DM and the therapeutic advantages of adjunct metformin treatment over
      insulin monotherapy. In the absence of such knowledge, the development of effective
      strategies to improve metabolic homeostasis and ameliorate complications in T1DM patients
      will remain problematic. The central hypothesis of the study is that metformin, as an
      incretin-secretagogue, will enhance postprandial incretin secretion in T1DM patients, which
      will be reflected in reduced glucagon secretion and improvement in glycemic volatility.
      Mechanistic insight will be provided through changes in specific amino acids and metabolites
      patterns, chronic inflammation and the microbiome composition.
