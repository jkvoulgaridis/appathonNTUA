  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydrocephalus is a potentially debilitating neurological condition that primarily affects
      babies under a year of age and has traditionally been treated by inserting a shunt between
      the brain and the abdomen. A newer endoscopic procedure offers hope of shunt- free treatment
      that may reduce complications over a child's life, but it is not clear if the endoscopic
      procedure results in similar intellectual outcome as shunt. Therefore, the investigators
      propose a randomized trial to compare intellectual outcome and brain structural integrity
      between these two treatments, to help families make the best treatment decision for their
      baby.

  <detailed_description>

      The ESTHI Trial is a multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing endoscopic
      third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization (ETV+CPC) and shunt in infants with
      hydrocephalus. The study will leverage the infrastructure of the Hydrocephalus Clinical
      Research Network (HCRN), a committed group of 14 leading North American pediatric
      neurosurgical centers with a long track-record of successful collaborative clinical research
      and RCTs in hydrocephalus. Optimal cognitive outcome is the primary concern of families and
      will, therefore, be the primary outcome. Assessment of dMRI, a validated, non-invasive method
      of measuring white matter microstructural integrity and structural connectivity in the
      developing brain, will provide further insight into the developmental consequences of these
      two treatments. The results of the RCT will help families determine the optimal treatment of
      hydrocephalus for their child.

    <intervention_name>Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy with Choroid Plexus Cauterization (ETV+CPC)</intervention_name>
    <description>Since the early 1990s, ETV has become the main alternative to shunting for hydrocephalus. This procedure involves placing an endoscopic camera into the ventricles of the brain and creating a hole in the floor of the third ventricle to act as an internal bypass for obstructed CSF. The cauterization of choroid plexus (CPC) involves the use of a device to burn or cauterize tissue from the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus of the brain exists in the lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth ventricle. Its main role is the production of CSF. The success of ETV alone is poor in infants, but when combined with CPC, improved results have been observed and ETV+CPC has become a safe viable option for these children.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt</intervention_name>
    <description>The most common treatment for hydrocephalus has been the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which has been in popular use for over 50 years. This consists of silastic tubing attached to a valve mechanism that runs subcutaneously from the head to the abdomen. It is one of the most common procedures performed by pediatric neurosurgeons.</description>

    <ipd_description>After subject enrollment and 5 year follow up have been completed, we will prepare a final study database for analysis. A releasable database will be produced and completely de-identified in accordance with the definitions provided in the Health insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Namely, all identifiers specified in HIPAA will be recoded in a manner that will make it impossible to deduce or impute the specific identity of any patient. The database will not contain any institutional identifiers. We will also prepare a data dictionary that provides a concise definition of every data element included in the database. If specific data elements have idiosyncrasies that might affect interpretation or analysis, this will be discussed in the dictionary document.
In accordance with policies determined by the investigators and funding sponsors, the releasable database will be provided to users in electronic form.</ipd_description>
