  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, observational study of the Catalys Precision Laser
      System in real-world clinical practice. The study will be conducted at one site at the Boao
      Super Hospital in Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone of Hainan province in
      China. The study is being conducted to evaluate the overall performance of the Catalys
      Precision Laser System. One or both eyes of each subject will be included in study.

      The Catalys system is used as part of cataract surgery to create LASER cuts as intended by
      the surgeon to aid in cataract surgery, without adversely impacting the risk to the
      patient.As such, the endpoints of surgeon rating of completeness of corneal incisions,
      anterior capsulotomy and phacofragmentation and any device related adverse events from the
      time of Catalys System use to 1-month postoperative follow-up should adequately cover the
      evaluation of the intended use of the Catalys System.

        This study will include subjects undergoing primary cataract extraction and IOL
        implantation and who meet all the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects treated
        during the period of November 2019 to March 2020 (that satisfy the protocol inclusion and
        exclusion criteria) may be included in the study, or a maximum of 163 subjects (not
        including the subjects for surgeon certification), whichever comes first. One or both eyes
        of each subject will be included in study.

        Note: Study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be per the Catalys system instructions
        for use. A few key criteria are listed below:

          -  Patients scheduled for cataract surgery, including treatment with the Catalys
             Precision Laser System for anterior capsulotomy, phacofragmentation and the creation
             of single plane and multi-plane arc cuts/incisions in the cornea.

          -  Signed informed consent and privacy protection authorization or equivalent
             documentation necessary to comply with applicable privacy laws pertaining to medical
             treatment and/or medical record in the governing countries

          -  At least 22 years of age at the time of consent.ion Criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All criteria apply to each study eye:

          -  Presence of corneal ring and/or inlay implant(s), Descemetocele with impending corneal
             rupture)

          -  Severe corneal opacities, corneal abnormalities, significant corneal edema, or
             diminished aqueous clarity that obscures OCT imaging of the anterior lens capsule.

          -  Any contraindications to cataract surgery
