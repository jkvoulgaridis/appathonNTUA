    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of single dose of GB223 in healthy subjects; the secondary
      objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of single dose
      of GB223 in healthy subjects.
