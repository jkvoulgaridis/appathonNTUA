             metastasis more than 1.5 cm in length. b). Patients with central nervous system
             metastasis had received treatment and achieved asymptomatic status (e.g. without
             neurological dysfunction, epilepsy or other typical central nervous system metastasis
             symptoms and signs)

         16. Patients with pleural effusion, pericardial effusion or ascites that could not be
