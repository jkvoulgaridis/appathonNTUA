  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well Optiflow THRIVE works in delivering oxygen to patients during
      total intravenous anesthesia while undergoing radiology procedures. The Optiflow THRIVE is an
      oxygen administration device that delivers high-flow and humidified oxygen through the nose.
      The Optiflow THRIVE device may improve oxygen delivery and reduce breathing complications.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the performance of Optiflow THRIVE relative to Standard Non-Rebreathers in
      patients with high risk of difficult airway management undergoing interventional radiology
      procedures for the planning of future clinical studies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To describe the episodes of hypoxia (defined by peripheral capillary oxygen saturation
      [SpO2] less than or equal to 92%) and the episodes of airway support which include: jaw
      thrust, chin lift or insertion of an airway supporting device, such as oral/nasal airway or
      supra airway device in order to recover the level of oxygenation above 92% associated with
      Optiflow THRIVE.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive 100% oxygen at a high flow rate via Optiflow THRIVE over 3 minutes
      prior to anesthetic induction and at a higher flow rate until the end of procedure.

      ARM II: Patients receive 100% oxygen at a lower flow rate via non-rebreather mask over 3
      minutes prior to anesthetic induction and maintain the same flow rate until the end of
      procedure.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 15 minutes.
