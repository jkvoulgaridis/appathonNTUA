      The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of change of an
      Internet-delivered Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy for adolescents (12-15 years) diagnosed
      with a principal anxiety or depressive disorder according to DSM-5 criteria. Participants
      will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups: experimental (REBTonAd) and waitlist
      control. The intervention is structured in 8 modules and will be delivered over six weeks.
      Assessments will be conducted at four time points: baseline, post-treatment, 3-month
      follow-up, and 6-month follow-up.
