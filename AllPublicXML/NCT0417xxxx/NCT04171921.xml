  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical and epigastric hernia repair, whether considering primary or incisional hernias,
      are associated with a high risk of local complications, with global rate of surgical
      complications at one month up to 25%. To date three techniques are used.

      Open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) is associated with a high risk of surgical site infection,
      wound dehiscence, and hematoma, but is the main technique due to advantages such as
      cost-effectiveness, short operative time and totally extra-peritoneal repair.

      Laparoscopic hernia repair (LHR) reduces these complications but implies to place a mesh in
      intra-peritoneal position which is known to lead to adhesions, requires advanced laparoscopic
      skills, does not allow the closure of the defect due to limited range of motion, and can lead
      to excessive pain and pain-killers consumption due to the use of &quot;tackers&quot; to hold the mesh
      in place.

      Robotic ventral hernia repair (RVHR) uses the same laparoscopic access as LHR but thanks to
      the extended range of motion given by the robotic system allows defect closure,
      pre-peritoneal placement of the mesh and requires less technical skills.

      LHR is of very low adoption in Geneva University Hospital for the aforementioned
      inconvenient. Moreover, the final result of the procedure is not the same than with OVHR or
      RVHR, since the defect is not primarily closed and the mesh is in intra-peritoneal position.
      OVHR and RVHR , however, lead to the same final result and only defer by the access type
      (direct vs. laparoscopic). RVHR is gaining rapid popularity and adoption in the United States
      but remains a costly solution. It is unclear whether the supposed benefits for the patients
      of RVHR overwhelm the extra costs and time, especially by reducing the complication rate and
      consecutive in-hospital and out-hospital costs. Moreover, increasing experience of the
      robotic system in Geneva University Hospital has led to a significant costs and time
      reduction in other robotic procedures and could eventually make RVHR cost effective if its
      clinical benefits were to be proven.

      This study aims at demonstrating that robotic trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal (rTAPP) primary
      ventral hernia repair leads to lower surgical site complication rate than the same procedure
      performed through standard open approach (OVHR), while being an acceptable solution from an
      economic, operative time and functional standpoint.
