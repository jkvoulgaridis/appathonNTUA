  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study to investigate the yield of continuous
      electroencephalogram (cEEG), as a diagnostic tool in intensive care unit (ICU), for patients
      with refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and the contribution of this test to the patient
      final outcome, compared with standard medical care. Specifically, the hypothesis is that the
      use of cEEG for patients with RSE will significantly reduce the length of in-hospital stay,
      mortality, and subsequent complications (such as infections or pressure ulcers). It is also
      predicted that quality of life will be higher following cEEG at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months after
      discharge. As there are currently no data available from previous studies assessing the
      impact of cEEG on markers of the final clinical outcome in patients with RSE, this study is
      going to start as a feasibility study, aiming to obtain initial data for the primary outcome
      measure, in order to perform a sample size calculation for a larger future trial. The pilot
      study will also assess the integrity of the study protocol, specifically the recruitment
      process and the consent procedure, and also determine the necessary costs for running a cEEG
      service in ICU for patients with RSE

  <detailed_description>

      The study is a randomised feasibility study.

      The patients participating in the study will be randomised 1:1 in two groups. The
      randomisation will be stratified by three status epilepticus (SE) aetiologies a) previous
      epilepsy b) acute central nervous system insult c) cryptogenic/ unknown.

      The standard medical care group (Control group) will receive sequential portable
      electroencephalograms (EEGs), performed according to the clinical demand. The treatment group
      (cEEG group) will have cEEG, which will continue until 24 hours after cessation of clinical
      and electrical seizure activity. The patients will be treated by the same medical team of
      neurologists or neurointensivists, according to the same guidelines.

      Clinical data will be collected from observation of in-patient medical records. The
      information will include demographics i.e. age, gender and ethnicity group, information about
      previous medical history and specifically previous history of epilepsy. The investigators
      will record the type of epilepsy, the type of previous seizures, their frequency, previous
      admissions due to SE and current and previously used antiepileptic drugs. These data can be
      obtained either by the patient or the next of kin and if the patient is followed up in the
      local epilepsy service, the required data may be obtained from the medical records.

      Regarding the acute presentation of status epilepticus, data will be collected regarding the
      date and the time of diagnosis of SE, the date of seizure onset, the level of consciousness
      on presentation, the type of seizures during SE (i.e. focal motor, generalised motor, absence
      etc) and SE aetiology, if available. If the SE is diagnosed by EEG as non-convulsive, the
      date of the diagnosis will be recorded. The types of seizures during the course of SE will be
      recorded, as well as the antiepileptic drugs and sedation used, including the doses. The SE
      severity score (STESS) will be calculated early during the patient admission to ICU. The date
      that the patient was fit for discharge from ICU will be obtained, as well as the date of
      discharge from hospital. It is noted that the date the patient is fit for discharge from ICU
      is not always the same as the actual date of ICU discharge. The data will also include
      in-hospital and 30-days mortality, the time until seizure control and the reported hospital
      acquired complications and specifically healthcare-associated infections, pressure injuries,
      falls resulting in fractures or injuries, respiratory complications, venous thromboembolism
      and medication complications. The quality of life index will be assessed with the health
      questionnaire introduced by EuroQol Group (version EQ-5D-5L), at 0, 3 ,6 and 12 months post
      discharge and/ or the Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire (QOLIE), which will be mailed
      to the patients. If the patient is not able to provide this information in writing, these
      data will be collected with brief telephone interview.

      The observational data will be collected by the research nurse and will be transferred to the
      case report form (CRF). The specific information, regarding the seizure types and the seizure
      aetiology, will require input from the medical team and specifically the neurologist, the
      neurointensivist and the clinical neurophysiologist. The information gather will be reviewed
      and supervised by the Principal Investigator (PI).

      The data regarding the hospital costs for each patient will be collected after the patient's
      discharge and will be based on the specific coding of all medical, diagnostic and therapeutic
      interventions registered for each patient, taking into account the additional time required
      for assessing cEEG data. The clinical neurophysiologist and the physiologist will log their
      clinical activity time required for reviewing the cEEG recordings.

      The data will be transferred to CRF and the length of ICU and in-hospital stay and the
      quality of life measures will be compared between groups in order to identify differences in
      the final outcome between the control and the cEEG groups. Similarly, the costs for
      management of the two patient groups will be compared.

      The calculation of the sample size for the larger study will be performed after the
      collection of 40 cases.

    <description>The standard medical care (Control) group will receive sequential portable EEGs, performed according to clinical demand. These patients usually have 2 recordings of 20-30 minutes each within 24 or 48 hours. The studies include baseline recoding and recording after auditory, tactile and nociceptive stimulation. The EEGs will be visually reviewed and reported within 4 hours after the recording completion by a Consultant Clinical Neurophysiologist or other doctor with equivalent qualifications.</description>

    <description>The treatment (cEEG) group will have cEEG applied within 12 hours of RSE diagnosis, which will continue until 24 hours after cessation of clinical and electrical seizure activity. Reactivity testing with auditory, tactile and nociceptive stimulation will be repeated at least once daily. The cEEG will be visually interpreted twice daily by a Consultant Clinical Neurophysiologist and the results will be communicated within two hours of their completion to the treating clinical team.</description>

    <description>Continuous EEGs will be performed with 21 electrodes and polygraphy (ECG and EMG) placed according to the international 10-20 system. In case of extensive neurosurgical defects, a reduced montage may be applied in patients from either group. This information will be added in CRF. The reduced montage in these cases is not expected to reduce the diagnostic accuracy and the outcome, as the neurophysiological changes are generally diffuse and will be detected by adjacent electrodes.</description>
