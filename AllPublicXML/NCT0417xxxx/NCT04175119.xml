  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brain is composed of a set of areas specialized in specific computations whose outputs
      need to be transferred to other specialized areas for cognition to emerge. To account for
      context-dependent behaviors, the information must be flexibly routed through the fixed
      anatomy of the brain. The aim of this project is to test a general framework for this
      flexible communication between brain areas based on nested oscillations. The general idea is
      that internally-driven slow oscillations (&lt;20Hertz) either set-up or prevent the
      communication between brain areas. Stimulus-driven gamma oscillations (&gt;30Hertz), nested in
      the slow oscillations, can then be directed to task-relevant areas of the network. This
      multimodal, multi-scale approach uses magnetoencephalography using a 3-Dimensional (3D)
      printed individual head-cast system and transcranial stimulation in experiments manipulating
      visual processing, attention and memory to test core predictions of this framework. The
      theoretical approach and the methodological development used in this basic science study will
      provide the basis for future fundamental and clinical research.

    <time_frame>up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is measured using fMRI bold signals (experiment 1), and brain signals obtained through electroencephalography (experiment 1, 3) and magnetoenecephalography (experiment 1, 3), depending on the sessions. The signals are then transformed during analyses and patterns in the composite characteristics are identified.</description>

    <measure>The coupling of behavioral responses to stimuli with physiological responses in the brain.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout the sessions of neuroimaging. There are 5, 1, and 1 sessions of neuroimaging for experiment 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The 5 sessions of experiment 1 are over a period of 1 to 7 months. Each session lasts approximately 2 hours including setup.The sessions take place at between 7 and 198 days after inclusion. The time between the sessions is variable.</description>

    <description>There are 5 sessions of neuroimaging for experiment 1. The 5 sessions of experiment 1 are over a period of 1 to 7 months. Each session lasts approximately 2 hours including setup. This outcome measure will be recorded during these 5 interspaced sessions, at between 7 and 198 days after inclusion. The time between the sessions is variable.</description>

    <intervention_name>Visual attention/perception tasks in healthy participants</intervention_name>
    <description>The participants complete visual attention and perception tasks while fMRI, EEG, and MEG record brain signals. The tasks acquire responses with a visual saccade or button presses which are coupled to brain responses. These responses are then analyzed to identify patterns of communication between brain areas (within-subject). The flickering stimuli (experiment 1) may alter oscillations in the brain, while participants complete visual attention and perception tasks, leading to a secondary outcome measure distinct from the button presses. The procedure concerning the flickers will be the same for participants. The tACS (experiment 2, 3) delivers input in addition to gathering output while participants complete visual attention and perception tasks. A sinusoidal current at a chosen frequency interacts with the brain's natural oscillations and alters responses. Participants will have sham sessions of tACS as well (there is no group division), The sham will be compared with the stimulation</description>
