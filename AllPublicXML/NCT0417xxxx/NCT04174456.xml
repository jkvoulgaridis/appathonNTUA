    <textblock>
      The study proceeds with prospective, randomized, open and controlled clinical trials. The
      subject of the investigator's study was the first patient diagnosed with dilated
      cardiomyopathy. Subjects who agreed to participate in the study and were determined to meet
      the selection / exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to each group, and the experimental
      group was treated with 20 mg of olmesartan and 5 mg of rosuvastatin for 6 months, and the
      control group is treated with 40 mg of valsartan and 5 mg of rosuvastatin.

    <textblock>
      Myocardial viability plays an important role in improving the function of the heart. To date,
      the most reproducible and objective method has been established as a method or tool for
      assessing myocardial viability.

      Olmesartan is known to have the strongest inhibitory ability of angiotensin receptors
      compared with other angiotensin receptor binding inhibitors. Research has been reported that
      statin drugs may help improve vascular endothelial function, and several researchers have
      suggested that these mechanisms may affect the improvement of myocardial survival. In
      addition, studies have shown that angiotensin receptor binding inhibitors and statins may
      improve left ventricular function in patients with left ventricular function. However, since
      the studies did not assess myocardial survival, the mechanisms could not be clearly
      identified.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of olmesartan on myocardial survival
      in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who have left ventricular dysfunction.
