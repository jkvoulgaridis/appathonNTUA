  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diuretic therapy is the cornerstone of the management of fluid overload in heart failure.
      Resistance to diuretic therapy is the most common reason for treatment failure in patients
      affected by the combination of heart failure and kidney disease. Currently, there is no way
      of predicting whether heart failure patients will develop resistance to diuretic therapy and
      what dose of diuretic is necessary to overcome diuretic resistance. Answering these questions
      would allow doctors to be able to prescribe an accurate dose of diuretic therapy to prevent
      diuretic resistance and potential side effects of an excessive diuretic dose.

      With magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to measure the kidney sodium (salt) content
      and observe the diuretic response in patients with heart failure and kidney disease. The
      investigators speculate that measuring kidney sodium content will allow to predict diuretic
      response in these patients.

      The aim of this study is to compare the kidney sodium content in patients with chronic
      cardiorenal syndrome with and without diuretic resistance. Secondly, in a sample of patients
      with diagnosed diuretic resistance,the aim will be to observe the changes in kidney sodium
      content induced by an additional dose of diuretic therapy and to observe whether these
      changes are associated with a response to diuretic therapy.

             -  Proton/23Na kidney MRI

           Summary of Study Procedures

           -Collection of personal demographic and clinical information

           Demographics Primary etiology of heart disease Co-morbidities Medications Volume
           assessment (oedema, New York Heart Association (NYHA) scale)

             -  Fresh urine collection Fasting osmolarity Sodium excretion fraction Urea excretion
                fraction Extra urine samples for storage

             -  Blood collection Full hematological, electrolytic and biochemistry profile
                Creatinine and cystatin C and for estimating glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
                calculation Pro-Brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) Extra plasma and serum

             -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Combined proton/ 23Na kidney MRI

                2) Second Study Visit (Only participants with diuretic resistance)

           The second study visit will be performed within a week of the first one. Patients with
           diuretic resistance will be identified as explained in the inclusion criteria before
           study start and reassessed on the day of the visit.

           Patients will receive an additional single dose of furosemide, equivalent to 50% their
           baseline furosemide dose (or equivalent furosemide to current bumetanide dose). This
           escalated dose will not exceed 100 mg of furosemide. Patients will receive a single,
           i.v. dose of furosemide and will be scanned approximately 1 hour later. After the scan,
           study participants will be followed-up for 24 hours to assess diuretic response and
           stratified in two groups for analysis purposes. The following parameters will be
           monitored: 24-hour urine collection following diuretic administration (to measure
           urinary sodium concentration and urinary volume) and body weight.

           Based on these parameters, diuretic response will be defined as:

           • A reduction in fractional spot urinary sodium

           • An increase in urinary volume

           • A &gt;1 kg reduction in body weight within 24 hours from diuretic administration
           (extrapolation of guidance on management of acute HF)

           Participants will undergo the following study procedures:

           -Weight measurement

           -Collection of demographic and clinical information

           -Physical examination

             -  Blood and urine collection

             -  Echocardiography

             -  Bioimpedance spectroscopy

             -  Sodium intake questionnaires

             -  Intravenous furosemide administration

             -  Proton/23Na kidney MRI within the hours after injection

             -  Follow-up procedures:

           D+1 : Home Weight measurement D+1: 24-hours urine collection
