  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In daily practice, several scales are used to evaluate patients with small vessel diseases of
      the brain (SVD). However, these scales exclude key symptoms such as apathy and mood disorders
      observed in SVD. Furthermore, the use of a combination of scales does not allow neither a
      very sensitive assessment of clinical changes, neither an overall assessment of a patient's
      outcome.

      Moreover, there is no scale dedicated to cognitive, emotional and behavioural complaints in
      patients with SVD. These patients are evaluated with scales used in neurodegenerative
      diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. These are scales that have
      been developed in the elderly and they are not sensitive to minor complaints. It is needful
      to develop scales adapted to patients with SVD in order to understand the consequences of the
      disease symptoms on their daily life at inclusion and during follow-up.

        Patients with small vessel disease will be recruited from the Department of Neurology at
        Lariboisière Hospital. The study will be proposed to patients when they come to
        Lariboisière Hospital for hospitalization (full hospitalization or day hospitalization) or
        consultation.
