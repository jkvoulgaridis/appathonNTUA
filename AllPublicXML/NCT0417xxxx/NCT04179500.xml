  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to rule out clinically significant severe adverse effects on
      testicular function in healthy volunteers receiving oral pretomanid (200mg) once daily for 26
      weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this Male Reproductive Safety - &quot;PaSEM&quot;- clinical study is to generate
      data to evaluate the potential effect of once daily 200mg Pretomanid on human testicular
      function whilst being dosed for 6 months in healthy male volunteers. The 6 months dosing
      period covers current use of pretomanid in approved antimicrobial regimes for the treatment
      of tuberculosis, TB. Subjects will also be followed up to 18 weeks post dose to evaluate and
      ensure coverage of potential recovery of semen parameters which encompasses one and one-half
      cycles (cycle length is around 75 days) of the seminiferous epithelium. This also includes
      epididymal transit time (since we are sampling and evaluating semen), which adds another ~10
      days. Thus, in days 75 + 37.5 + 10 = 122.5 days or 17.5 weeks, therefore 18 weeks should be
      sufficient for follow-up period.

      The safety of pretomanid has been tested in 10 single- and multi-dose Phase I studies with
      healthy adult male and female subjects, with 289 subjects receiving single oral doses of
      pretomanid ranging from 50 to 1500 mg and multiple oral doses ranging from 200 to 1000 mg/day
      given for up to eight days. Pretomanid has also been studied in combination regimens in
      patients for up to 9 months in Phase 2 and 3 studies. We believe the safety and tolerability
      of pretomanid in healthy male subjects has been adequately established to support this
      approach.

      For this study healthy male subjects with proven fertility (history of having fathered
      children) and who do not want to have any more children e.g. pre-vasectomy volunteers and who
      can complete the trial will be required.

          -  Is a healthy adult male at least 19 years of age (inclusive) with proven fertility
             (history of having fathered children; note: history of getting somebody pregnant is
             insufficient) who do not want to have any more children e.g. pre-vasectomy volunteer
             at the time of screening.

          -  Has a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 36.0 (kg/m2) and a body weight of no less
             than 50.0 kg.
