    <textblock>
      Older adults at risk for dementia show a variety of cognitive deficits, which can be
      ameliorated by different cognitive training (CT) exercises. The best combination of CT
      exercises is unknown. The aim is to discover the most efficacious combination of CT exercises
      as compared to cognitive stimulation (which will serve as a stringent, active control) to
      modify the functional trajectories of older adults' with MCI, who are at high risk for
      dementia. The primary objective is to design and pilot-test an adaptive, randomized clinical
      trial (RCT) of cognitive training (CT) combinations aimed to enhance performance of
      instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among persons with mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI). The longitudinal endpoint goal is delaying dementia onset. The primary aim of the
      study is to determine which CT combination has the best probability to delay dementia by
      producing the largest IADL improvements. The study further aims to explore the effects of CT
      on neuroimaging and novel blood-based biomarker outcomes.

      Planning an Adaptive Clinical Trial of Cognitive Training to Improve Function and Delay
      Dementia: The ACTIVE MIND Trial.

      The primary objective is to design and pilot-test an adaptive, randomized clinical trial
      (RCT) of cognitive training (CT) combinations aimed to enhance performance of instrumental
      activities of daily living (IADL) among persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The
      longitudinal endpoint goal is delaying dementia onset.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To pilot test a plan to recruit and enroll under-represented minorities with the goal of
           obtaining a sample representative of the USF population in race and ethnicity.

        -  To explore blood-based biomarkers as outcomes of CT

        -  To explore change in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI-3) MRI
           protocol for neuroimaging to quantify brain structure, white matter hyperintensities
           (WMH), hippocampal size, cerebral microbleed and perfusion, white matter integrity, and
           resting state function as an effect of CT interventions.

      With additional funding and extension of the study:

        -  To examine the efficacy of promising combinations of CT exercises to modify functional
           trajectories in MCI

        -  To examine the efficacy of promising combinations of CT to delay dementia onset

      Design: The design is an adaptive randomized trial to identify the best combination of CT
      exercises to improve IADL function and thereby delay dementia onset among persons with MCI.
      Four arms of CT will be compared to an active control condition.

      Outcomes: Determine which combinations of CT are efficacious to improve IADL performance, and
      thereby most likely to delay dementia onset.

      Everyday Function measures will include: Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and
      iFunction. A composite of performance (measured by time and accuracy) will be derived from
      principal component analyses.

      Cognition measures will include: Useful Field of View test (UFOV), Graduated Continuous
      Performance Test (gradCPT), and Examiner. A composite will be derived from principal
      component analyses.

      Interventions and Duration Four combinations of computerized cognitive training and an active
      control computerized stimulation will be investigated. The five arms will be equivalent in
      terms of frequency and duration of each session (60 min/day, two-three days/wk, 16 weeks).

      Sample size: In-person screening of 100 potential study participants are planned to enroll up
      to 60 participants. The goal is to have at least 60 participants complete the study.
      Individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MCI will be included in the study.
