  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to evaluate the role played by potential precipitating factors
      and risk factors in Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) through of
      prospective selection of carefully characterised patients and controls. The impact of these
      factors on the prognosis will be evaluated through a follow-up assessment of patients.

      Our study will include the formation of a clinicoradiological database and a biobank (plasma,
      cerebro-spinal fluid, DNA) which will be the tools of a future large multicentre study on
      RCVS.

      Introduction : Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) combines headaches and
      segmental constriction of cerebral arteries that resolves within 3 months.

      It is the most recurrent reason of cerebral arteriopathy in people under 70 and of
      thunderclap headache in absence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.

      Objectives :

        -  Principal: identify RCVS's precipitating factors

        -  Secondary:

             1. Determine if migraine, anxiety, depression are risk factors of RCVS.

             2. Determine the role of precipitating factors and risk factors on the RCVS's
                prognosis in short, medium and long term.

             3. Start a formation of a large clinicoradiological database and a biobank (plasma,
                cerebro-spinal fluid, DNA).

      Methodology :

      Monocentric analytic observational 'Case - Control' study with prospective inclusion of cases
      in a follow-up cohort.

      This type of study is nevertheless considered interventional because we are collecting
      additional blood and CSF samples to constitute a biobank.

    <description>The relationship between the assumed precipitating factors and RCVS will be evaluated by comparing the frequencies of exposure of suspected precipitating factors between cases and controls, and given by calculating an odds ratio.
The assumed trigger or risk factors are : a physical and / or emotional stress within 30 days before the clinical beginning; presence of chronic neurological or psychiatric disease (migraine, primary thunderclap headache or circumstancial headache, anxiety or depression); vascular risk factors; and hormonal status in women.</description>
