  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health professionals with adequate training are required to provide quality remote care.
      There are few telemedicine and telehealth training programs for doctors and medical students.
      On the other hand, the use of social networks (Facebook and Twitter) as a medical education
      tool is becoming frequent. However, there is a lack of conclusive evidence in terms of its
      effectiveness. The objective of the present study is to develop and evaluate a telemedicine
      course for resident doctors through Facebook and compare it with one through Moodle. A
      randomized, triple-blind, parallel block controlled trial will be conducted that tests the
      effectiveness of an educational intervention through Facebook compared to another control
      intervention using Moodle. Intervention training is a telemedicine course focused on
      teleconsultation provided through Facebook. Control training is the same educational content
      but through Moodle. The level of telemedicine knowledge of the participants before and after
      the intervention will be evaluated. The inferential analysis to see the association between
      the variables of interest will be carried out by Student's T tests or analysis of variance
      (ANOVA). If potential confounding factors were found, the variable will be adjusted through
      linear regression. The pre and post intervention analysis will be carried out with student t
      or wilcoxon rank test according to the normality of the data. Resident doctors who receive
      the telemedicine course through Facebook are expected to have a greater knowledge gain than
      those who take the course through Moodle.

      Main Objective:

      Develop and evaluate a telemedicine course for resident doctors through Facebook and compare
      it with one through Moodle.

      Study Design:

      A randomized, triple-blind, parallel block controlled trial will be conducted that tests the
      effectiveness of an educational intervention through Facebook compared to another control
      intervention using Moodle. Intervention training is a telemedicine course focused on
      teleconsultation provided through Facebook. Control training is the same educational content
      but through Moodle. The level of telemedicine knowledge of the participants before and after
      the intervention will be evaluated. In addition, at the end of the intervention the level of
      satisfaction of the participants will be evaluated.

      Population:

      Resident doctors of the Faculty of Medicine of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia.

      Sample:

      In a previous study, the response within each group of subjects was normally distributed with
      a standard deviation of 2.62. If the true difference in the experimental and control means is
      3, the investigators will have to study 13 experimental subjects and 13 control subjects to
      be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and
      control groups are equal with the probability (power) 0.8. The probability of Type I error
      associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Then the investigators consider
      the 30% follow-up loss rate, according to previous reports, our final sample size being 38
      people, therefore our intervention and control group will be made up of 19 people each. This
      is the minimum sample size needed; however, a larger number improves the power of the study.

      Group assignment:

      Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control training by simple
      random assignment (random numbers generated by computer). Once the assigned group of each
      participant has been determined, they will be given access to the course content on their
      respective platforms.

      Ethical considerations:

      This project will be guided by the principles of scientific integrity. The project was
      submitted to the Institutional Committee of Research Ethics of the Universidad Peruana
      Cayetano Heredia for evaluation and approval. The content of the classes (educational videos)
      will be based on specialized scientific literature and current technical standards. In the
      end of the course, participants will have received telemedicine training as part of their
      curriculum and they will increase their professional skills. They will not be offered any
      additional incentive. When enrolling in the course, participants will be informed of the
      research objectives and procedures. Resident doctors will accept the use of their data
      generated by the course for the purpose of this study voluntarily

    <measure>Level of Knowledge about telemedicine</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by automatic scoring after the participant took the tests on a web platform. The instrument is a questionnaire made up of 32 multiple-choice questions about knowledge in telemedicine focused on teleconsultation. The test is according to guidelines of the National Board of Medical Examiners of the United States. Each correct question is worth 3.125 points so the scale range will be 0-100 points in total but then it will be converted to vigesimal score from 0 to 20 points, being the passing grade 11.00.</description>

    <measure>The satisfaction assessment will be carried out through the Wang questionnaire (Likert scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Wang questionnaire is an electronic learning satisfaction model of 26 elements related to four qualities: content, learning interface, personalization, learning community and also with two questions which refer to the overall measurement in the context of end-user satisfaction. The measurement scale will be a 7-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 to 7 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot; respectively).</description>

    <description>In this group the participants are exposed to the same course content and perform similar activities as the intervention group on Facebook during the same period but on the Moodle educational platform. The Moodle platform was chosen because it has been widely used in several institutions, with a large user community worldwide, with approximately 50,000 registrations in more than 200 countries and due to the many easy-to-use educational tools it offers. So it is one of the educational platforms that has demonstrated its efficiency in the medical educational field.</description>
