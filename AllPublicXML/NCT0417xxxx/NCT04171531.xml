  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to compare the effectiveness of intradetrusor injection of 100 unit
      injection of Botulinum toxin A to mid-urethral sling for change in MUI symptoms 6 months
      following treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), defined as the presence of both stress urinary incontinence
      (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), is a challenging condition for which clinicians
      frequently use multiple sequential treatments that have undergone limited evaluation in
      rigorous clinical trials. The Mixed Urinary Incontinence: Mid-urethral Sling vs. Botox A
      (MUSA) trial will estimate the effect of Botulinum toxin A (Botox A ®) compared to
      mid-urethral sling for the treatment of MUI symptoms in 110 women. MUSA is a randomized 2-arm
      clinical trial.

      The purpose of MUSA is to:

        -  compare treatment with either Botulinum toxin A (Botox A ®) or mid-urethral sling for
           women with MUI

        -  characterize patient characteristics associated with treatment response

      The primary objective is to estimate the effect of intradetrusor injections Botulinum toxin A
      (Botox A ®) compared to mid-urethral sling for treatment of MUI in 110 women 6 months after
      treatment. The change in severity of MUI symptoms will be measured using the Urogenital
      Distress Inventory.

      Secondary objectives include identifying predictors of treatment failure and
      cost-effectiveness of treatments in this MUI population.
