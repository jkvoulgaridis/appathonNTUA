      The clinic-pathological data were retrieved from the cancer registry database from the Cancer
      Center of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou branch. Of the 92 HCC patients with partial

      This study was approved by the Institute Review Board (IRB) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,
      Linkou Branch (IRB 201801969B0). The clinic-pathological data were retrieved from the cancer
      registry database from the Cancer Center of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou branch. Of
      the 92 HCC patients with partial hepatectomies enrolled, all patients had curative
      hepatectomy and those with different cancers were excluded. HCC tumor tissue and normal
      tissue, 3 cm from the tumor margin, were stored immediately in a -80 degree freezer at the
      Central Biobank of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The personal information was protected with
      decoding and registered with number.
