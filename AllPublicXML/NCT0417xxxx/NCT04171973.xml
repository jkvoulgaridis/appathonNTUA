  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The device that is the subject of this investigation is a solution for driving simulation of
      an electric wheelchair. It is intended to enable patients who are likely to acquire an
      electric wheelchair to train in a virtual environment, favorable to the safety of training,
      to its repetition, and to produce more varied, rich training environments and more tailored
      to specific and individualized needs. These solutions will make it easier to access
      real-world driving for patients who are currently experiencing learning difficulties.

      It is expected that this investigation demonstrates the reproducibility of driving
      performance in electric wheelchair driving simulator compared to the real world.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of this investigation, it is expected to develop a driving simulator that could
      contribute to improving the learning of electric wheelchair driving and access to electric
      wheelchair for people who can not currently claim for physical risks and weak psychology for
      the participant in the research.

      The present clinical investigation aims at evaluating the performances, the safety and the
      satisfaction of the users with regard to a simulator of driving of electric wheelchair in
      virtual reality.

      The main objective is to evaluate the feasibility of a virtual electric wheelchair driving
      training, comparing driving performance in virtual reality versus reality, in identical real
      and virtual standardized circuits, in regular users of electric wheelchairs with neurological
      disorders.

    <description>The cognitive load of tests under both conditions will be measured by the NASA-Task Load Index. It is in the form of six scales where the participant must assign a score between zero and one hundred to each of them, score indicating a growing level of intensity. Three dimensions relate to the demands imposed on the subject (mental, physical and temporal demands) and three to the interaction of a subject with the task (effort, frustration and performance)</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction of the use of the electric wheelchair under the conditions will be evaluated by the self-questionnaire Ease of Use Questionnaire. It measures the subjective usability of a product or service. It is a 30-item survey that examines four dimensions of usability: usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning, and satisfaction. The questionnaires were constructed as seven-point Likert rating scales. Users were asked to rate agreement with the statements, ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).</description>

    <description>The IPQ comprises 14 items rated on a seven-point Likert Scale ranging from -3 to 3. The general item assesses the general &quot;sense of being there&quot;, and has high loadings on all three factors, with an especially strong loading on Spatial Presence. The Spatial Presence sub-scale is related to the sense of being physically inside the virtual environment. The involvement sub-scale is directed to evaluate the attention devoted to the virtual environment. The realness sub-scale evaluates the sense of reality attributed to the virtual environment.</description>
