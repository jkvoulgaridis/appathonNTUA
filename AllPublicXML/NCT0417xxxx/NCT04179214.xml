      This study intends to determine the effects of thoracic manipulation on pressure pain
      sensitivity in patients with rhomboid active trigger points.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded controlled trial and will be conducted at physiotherapy clinic of
      women institute of rehabilitation sciences Abbottabad. The &quot;screw&quot; manipulation is a fairly
      aggressive manipulative technique in which the transverse processes are forced into a
      posterior to anterior direction Individual will be screened out according to inclusion
      criteria. Individuals will be allocated randomly into two groups, 30 in thoracic manipulation
      group and 30 in conventional physiotherapy protocol group by sealed envelope method. Both
      groups will receive conventional physiotherapy protocol (manual pressure release technique
      and muscle imbalances exercises) for rhomboid trigger points in common and the experimental
      group will receive thoracic manipulation in addition to conventional protocol.

      Assessment will be done on baseline and after 3 weeks. Data will be analyzed on SPSS version
      21.

    <description>Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) is an 11 point (0-10) Scale used to measure pain. Patient verbally select value between (0-10) on the basis of intensity of pain. (0) means No pain and (10) means maximum pain experienced at baseline and after 3 weeks</description>

    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a questionnaire designed to assess how neck pain has affected patient's ability to manage in everyday life. It has total 10 sections, For each section the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked the section score = 0, if the last statement is marked it = 5. If all ten sections are completed the score is calculated and converted into percentages. The maximum Score of Neck Disability Index (NDI) is 50. It is measured at Baseline before Intervention and after end of treatment session that is 3 weeks</description>

    <description>Session will be performed twice a week for a three week period if a pop sound occurred then the therapist moved on next procedure ,if not subject will be repositioned and technique will performed again. This procedure will be performed for maximum of two attempts. Approximately 3 minutes of time is required to complete thrust manipulation subjects assigned to thrust manipulation also received general exercise program and manual pressure release technique as the control group. General exercise group involve Stretching exercises for the pectoral muscles and resisted strengthening exercises for the scapular retractors and elevators and the glenohumeral abductors and external rotators were performed three times per week for 3 weeks.</description>
