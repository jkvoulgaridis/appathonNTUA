  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Parkinson's disease (PD) often show gait impairments such as, shuffling gait,
      short steps and gait asymmetry and irregularity. These gait problems are already apparent in
      the early disease stages, having an immense effect on daily life functioning. Especially
      Freezing of Gait (FOG), where the patients are not able to initiate or continue their
      movement despite their intention to do so, is a debilitating problem. It is thought that lack
      of gait adaptability could be an underlying cause of FOG. With a split-belt treadmill the
      speed of both legs can be controlled independently, which forces participants to actively
      adapt their gait to the new situation. In a previous study performed at our lab, it was shown
      that only one session of split-belt training (SBT), in which the speed of one leg was
      reduced, improved gait adaptability and other gait features compared to tied-belt training
      (TBT). Furthermore, overground turning speed improved after only one single training session
      and this was even retained 24 hours later, indicating training induced long-term
      potentiation. Since the short-term effects of SBT are promising, the objective of this study
      is to investigate if 4 weeks of SBT, 3 times a week, has an effect on gait deficits found in
      individuals with PD, compared to 4-weeks, 3 times a week, of TBT.

    <intervention_model_description>Overground turning speed during single and dual-task will be compared between a group who will receive 4 weeks of SBT 3 times a week and a group who will receive TBT in the same dose. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to either the SBT or TBT groups by an independent researcher who is not involved in the measurements of any of the studies using a computerized random number generation technique. The randomization will be stratified based on H&amp;Y stage and freezing status (freezer/non-freezer).</intervention_model_description>

The training will have a progression of training duration over the four weeks. Participants will start at a total training duration of 30 minutes and this will be increased with 5 minutes every week. The maximal length will be 45 minutes of training. One session including breaks will take approximately 1 hour.</description>
