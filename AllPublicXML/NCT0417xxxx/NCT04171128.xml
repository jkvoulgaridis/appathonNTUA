  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to observe the inflammatory marker procalcitonin (PCT) in comparison
      with patient variables on morbidity, mortality and antibiotic treatment.

      The overall aim is to observe if a low PCT value can have potential in reducing unessesary
      antibiotic use in seasonal influenza patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of the clinical utility of early PCT measurements in seasonal
      influenza, with particular attention to PCT's predictive value for prognosis and bacterial
      respiratory superinfection. The aim is to evaluate PCT as a supplementary aid in the standard
      clinical evaluation of influenza patients. Patients may be included if a positive influenza
      test is reported within 48 hours after an initial clinical suspicion of influenza, and the
      hospital stay is lasting more than one day. The investigators have included 74 patients from
      the second half of the 2018-19 influenza season and will continue to include patients from
      the complete 2019-20 season.

      Primary endpoints: Mortality (in-hospital and within 30 days post-discharge), bacterial
      respiratory tract superinfection.

      Secondary endpoints: Intensive care unit stay, the proportion of patients on antibiotic use
      and total antibiotic use in doses and LOT (&quot;length-of-treatment&quot;).
