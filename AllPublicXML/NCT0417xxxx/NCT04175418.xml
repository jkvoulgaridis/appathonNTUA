  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, autoimmune disease of
      the central nervous system. It is thought that MS, which is one of the main causes of
      non-traumatic neurological dysfunction in young adults, affects approximately two and a half
      million people worldwide. The annual cost caused by MS is reported to be between $ 8,528 and
      $ 54,244 per patient. Due to the destruction of the central nervous system, MS has a wide
      range of sensory, motor, cerebellar and cognitive dysfunctions. These dysfunctions may lead
      to a limitation of physical activity in people with MS. In addition, people with MS may limit
      their physical activity because they fear the worsening of their symptoms. Physical
      inactivity and sedentary life style are thought to be among the reasons that increase the
      risk of developing chronic diseases such as cancer, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension,
      arthritis, osteoporosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes, depression and cardiovascular diseases in
      people with MS. It is reported that these chronic diseases secondary to MS increase mortality
      by 1.7 times. In addition, these diseases have been associated with increased disability,
      decreased quality of life, and hospitalization. Physical inactivity can increase disability
      and mortality by aggravating health problems caused by the disease. For this reason, it is
      emphasized that there should be studies to increase physical activity in people with MS.
      Studies have shown that physical activity improves muscle strength, aerobic capacity, gait
      and balance and reduces fatigue in people with MS. In addition, it is stated that physical
      activity increases self-efficacy and improves positive perspective in patients with MS. When
      the literature is examined, it is seen that there are studies about physical activity in MS
      but they have methodological limitations. There are a limited number of studies on the
      effectiveness of the programs planned to increase the level of physical activity. The aim of
      our study was to investigate the effects of physical activity program and online training
      program on physical activity in patients with MS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1-3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-reported leisure-time exercise questionnaire which consists of 2 parts. The first part seeks information about the number of times one engages in mild, moderate and strenuous leisure-time exercise bouts of at least 15 min duration in a typical week. The weekly frequency of mild, moderate and strenuous exercise bouts are multiplied by 3, 5, and 9 metabolic equivalents (METs) and the total score is recorded. Second part seeks information about frequency of activity which is long enough to work up sweat in a typical week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pedometer</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>It is one of the objective methods used to evaluate physical activity. It is used to record the number of steps taken. The estimated step length is entered in the device and recorded as a step when the vertical swing of the body exceeds a certain threshold.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-min walk test (6 MWT) is a submaximal exercise test that entails measurement of distance walked on a 30 meter course over a span of 6 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12</measure>
    <time_frame>3-5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale consisting of 12 questions about mobility which is used to measure walking capacity. The limitations of walking in the last two weeks are questioned. Answers are scored between 1-5 (1 = almost none, 5 = excessive). A high score indicates that the ability to walk is affected or that the patient has difficulty in walking.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3-5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale that evaluates the fatigue of MS patients in daily functions. The assessment consists of 9 questions, each question is scored between 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The result score is the average value of nine questions. High score indicates increased fatigue severity</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5-7 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 31 questions in 6 sub-groups including physical status, symptoms, psychological status, self-esteem, relationship with friends, family and medical staff. The answers are scored between 0 and 5 and a score between 0 and100 is obtained. The higher the score, the higher the level of quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS is composed of 3 parts.In these parts, data processing speed, verbal memory, and visual memory are evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a method that is based on measurement of body resistance with the aid of alternative electric current. Body components are calculated by this method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength Test</measure>
    <time_frame>45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The isokinetic dynamometer and handheld dynamometer are used to assess muscle strength. In this study, the isokinetic dynamometer will be used to evaluate the knee extensor and flexor concentric muscle strength and the handheld dynamometer will be used to evaluate upper extremity muscle strength including arm flexors, abductors, elbow flexors and lower extremity muscle strength including hip flexors and abductors.</description>
