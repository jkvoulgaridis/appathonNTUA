      Background: Using visual materials is effective in education to decrease children's
      pre-operative fear and post-operative pain. Children, especially those aged between 6 and 12
      years, are interested in technology. This study aims to investigate the effects of watching
      an educational animated movie in the pre-operative period on fear and postoperative pain in
      children who are having surgery.

      Methods: The study was a prospective randomized controlled trial. This study was conducted
      between 6- to 12-year-old children in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic of Ege University Medical
      Faculty Hospital. The current study includes data from 132 children who were chosen doing
      block randomization. The &quot;Child and Family Identification Data Form&quot;, &quot;Children's Fear Scale&quot;
      and &quot;Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale&quot; was used in data collection. The patients were
      divided randomly into three groups as the &quot;Educational Animated Movie Group&quot; (EAMG),
      &quot;Documentary Movie Group&quot; (DMG) and &quot;Control Group&quot; (CG). The Educational Animated Movie and
      Documentary Movie were screened using Virtual Reality (VR). Data were collected by the
      researcher in the pre-operative period. The pre-operative fear of the child was evaluated by
      the child and the parent, and the post-operative pain of the child was evaluated by the
      child, parent, and nurse using scales about fear and pain.

    <description>&quot;Children's Fear Scale&quot; (CFS) was developed and adapted by McMurtry et al. (2011).
This scale includes 5 different facial expressions. This scale, graded between 0 and 4, (&quot;0&quot; is none fear, &quot;4&quot; is maximum fear) is a reliable and valid measurement tool for assessing fear.
It includes measuring and evaluating preoperative fears of children.</description>

    <time_frame>15 minutes (2 measurements are made-immediately after surgery and 1 hour after surgery) = total 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale&quot; This scale includes six different facial expressions and is scored between 0 and 10 (&quot;0&quot; is none pain, &quot;10&quot; is maximum pain). It is a reliable and valid measurement tool for acute pain assessment, and it does not require words or numeric value.
It includes measuring and evaluating postoperative pains of children.</description>

    <description>All of the children's and parents' written and verbal informed consent were obtained before the study. Parents who did not want to participate in the study were assured that this would not have any adverse effect on their child's treatment. In the morning of surgery, the researcher administered the &quot;Child and Family Identification Data Form&quot; to the parents of children who had the following parameters. Later, both the child and the parents were asked to complete the &quot;Children's Fear Scale&quot;. Children included in the study groups with randomization watched an educational animated movie through VR Goggles. The educational animated movie lasted around 3-4 minutes each. After watching the movie, children and parents were asked to complete the Children's Fear Scale again. Children, parents, and nurses were asked to grade the pain of the child with Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale when the children returned to their room and after 1 hour in the postoperative period.</description>
