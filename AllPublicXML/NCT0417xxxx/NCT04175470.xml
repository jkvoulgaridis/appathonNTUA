    <textblock>
      A recent study at the Department of Oncology, Vejle Hospital (NCT02399592), investigated
      bevacizumab and tocotrienol in ovarian cancer patients and concurrently monitored the level
      of methylated HOXA9 circulating tumor DNA (HOXA9 meth-ctDNA) in the blood.

      The rate of disease control was 70% with better results than other studies using bevacizumab
      alone. The toxicity was very low and attributed to bevacizumab only.

      When the study results were worked up they showed that patients with a significant increase
      of HOXA9 meth-ctDNA after the first cycle of treatment did not benefit from the treatment
      whereas those with stable or decreasing HOXA9 meth-ctDNA did.

      Therefore, in the current study patients with a high increase of HOXA9 meth-ctDNA after the
      first treatment cycle will discontinue treatment, as it is then considered ineffective. The
      remaining patients may achieve prolonged survival as predicted by their level of HOXA9
      meth-ctDNA.
