  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) was ranked in 2010 as the eleventh highest
      contributor to global disability. In France in 2014, non-spinal OA was the leading
      self-reported cause of morbidity among adults over sixty-five years of age, with a prevalence
      of 49.5 per cent. OA is known to be the first cause of disability in activities of daily life
      and a risk factor of frailty among people over seventy-five years of age. Despite its major
      impact on the elderly population's quality of life and health, quality of care for OA in
      elderly patients remains understudied.

      Objective: The study aims to assess the quality of care for knee and hip OA in patients aged
      75 years and over.

      Method: This prospective multicentric observational cohort study enrolls participants of 75
      years and over with symptomatic hip or knee OA for more than three months, hospitalized in
      seven geriatric departments of three hospitals of &quot;Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris&quot;,
      for any cause of admission. Quality of care for OA before hospitalization is assessed by the
      Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elderly's (ACOVE) quality indicators (QI) for OA, using a
      questionnaire. The primary endpoint is the pass rate for the ACOVE's QI about referral to an
      orthopedic surgeon for patients with severe functionally compromising knee or hip OA. The
      secondary endpoints are the pass rates for the six others ACOVE's QI for OA (annual
      assessment of functional status and degree of pain ; exercise therapy for patients with newly
      diagnosed knee OA ; education regarding the natural history, treatment, and self- management
      of OA ; acetaminophen as first-line pharmacologic therapy ; advising patients treated with
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of their risks ; offering prophylaxis with a
      proton-pump inhibitor or misoprostol to patients treated with non-selective NSAIDs) and other
      elements of hip or knee OA care not assessed by the seven QI (including use of opioid
      analgesics, NSAIDs, intra-articular infiltrations, joint replacements). The sample is
      described with a rheumatologic assessment including Western Ontario and MACmaster
      universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) and Kellgren-Laurence classification, and with a
      geriatric assessment including nutritional status, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scores, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)
      score, Timed Up and Go walking test, modified Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment (mSEGA)
      scale and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G). Participants also complete
      the 12-Item Short Form Survey version 2 (SF-12v2) quality of life questionnaire. They receive
      a call twelve months after inclusion to collect vital status, orthopedic consultation and
      joint replacement during the last year.

    <measure>rate of eligible patients who passed the quality indicator about annual assessment of functional status and degree of pain, assessed by questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The eligibility criterion is answer &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;Do you have pain in your joints that bothers you a lot on most days?&quot;. The pass criterion is a &quot;yes&quot; response to either of the two questions &quot;In the past 12 months, has any doctor or nurse asked you about the severity of your joint pain?&quot; &quot;In the past 12 months, has any doctor or nurse asked you if your joint pain affects the things you like or need to do?&quot;. The rate is calculated using the numerator as the number of eligible patients who passed the quality indicator and the denominator as the number of patients eligible for the quality indicator.</description>

    <description>The eligibility criteria are knee pain that had lasted at least 3 months, health did not limit the patient's ability to bathe or dress, and patients or surrogates indicated that the patient did not have severe dementia. The pass criterion is a &quot;yes&quot; response to the question &quot;Have you ever been sent to physical therapy or an exercise group or class for your knee pain?&quot;.
