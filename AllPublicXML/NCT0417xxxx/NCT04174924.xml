  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The number of highly myopic patients is increasing. Especially in East and
      Southeast Asia, up to 90% of adolescents are currently myopic. Long-term treatment of high
      myopia can be obtained by three types of surgery: laser refractive surgery, phakic
      intraocular lens (pIOL) implantation, and refractive lens exchange Implantation with a pIOL
      is the preferred treatment for high myopes, resulting in increasing patient numbers implanted
      due to the increasing numbers of patients with high myopia.

      Long-term results show that implantation of a pIOL induces an accelerated decrease in corneal
      endothelial cells (EC). Although some risk factors for increase EC loss have been identified,
      the underlying mechanism is currently unknown. It is hypothesized that the aqueous flow in
      the anterior segment of the eye (i.e. anterior chamber) is disturbed, causing an altered
      nutritional flow in the anterior chamber. Another hypothesis is that the pIOL causes chronic
      subclinical inflammation in the anterior chamber resulting in increased EC loss. Currently
      there is insufficient proof to confirm or reject either hypothesis. If one of these
      hypotheses can be confirmed, it is likely to induces significant changes in clinical
      practice.

      Objective: The primary objective of the study is to explore the role of inflammation in the
      anterior chamber on endothelial cell loss in patients implanted with iris-fixated pIOLs. The
      secondary objective is to identify whether there is a correlation between biomarkers in
      aqueous humour and biomarkers in tears, both related to the accelerated progression of EC
      loss.

      Study design: Two strategies are incorporated in the design of this study. The first part
      will retrospectively evaluate EC loss in patients with iris-fixated (IF) phakic intraocular
      lenses (pIOLs). The second part is prospective and will compare EC measurements, cytokines in
      aqueous humour and in tears from patients scheduled for IF-pIOLs explantation and compare
      them to patients with routine cataract surgery.

      Study population: Patients over 18 years of age, undergoing regular cataract surgery, and
      patients undergoing pIOL explantation in combination with cataract surgery. A total number of
      126 patients is needed, equally divided over two groups.

        Two groups will be included to compare endothelial cell loss due to inflammation in
        affected (i.e. iris-fixated [IF] phakic intraocular lens [pIOL] implanted) versus healthy
        (i.e. scheduled for regular cataract surgery) eyes.
