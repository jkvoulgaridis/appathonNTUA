      This is a safety and infectivity study of experimental human Norovirus genogroup GII.4
      administered to 48 healthy non-pregnant adults, 18-49 years of age, inclusive. Subjects will
      be admitted to Cincinnati Center for Clinical Research (CCCR) inpatient facility and
      challenged with a dose of human norovirus GII.4 challenge strain. The challenge study will be
      conducted in 3 cohorts of approximately 16 subjects each, 15 subjects will have a functional
      FUT-2 gene (secretor positive) and 1 subject will have a non-functional FUT-2 gene
      (non-secretor). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 3.5x10^3 copies of norovirus, in Cohort 2
      will receive 3.5x10^4 copies of norovirus and in Cohort 3 will receive 3.5x10^5 copies of
      norovirus. Based on the illness rate of subjects meeting the primary outcome measure in
      secretor - positive subjects of the initial cohort, the decision will be made with regards to
      dosing of the second and the third cohorts. Study duration is approximately 12-18 months with
      subject participation duration of 6-8 months. The primary objective of this study is to
      determine the optimal challenge dose of Norovirus GII.4 CIN-3 Batch No.: 01-16C3 to achieve
      illness in &gt; / = 50% of subjects (illness is defined as norovirus infection determined by
      positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and either: a) &gt; / = 3 loose or liquid stools, in a
      24-hour period, b) &gt; / = 300 gm of loose or liquid stool in a 24-hour period or c) and/or any
      episode of vomiting), during the inpatient period.

      This is a double-blind, safety and infectivity study of experimental human Norovirus
      genogroup GII.4 administered to 48 healthy non-pregnant adults, 18-49 years of age,
      inclusive. Subjects will be admitted to Cincinnati Center for Clinical Research (CCCR)
      inpatient facility and challenged with a dose of human norovirus GII.4 challenge strain. The
      challenge study will be conducted in 3 cohorts of approximately 16 subjects each, 15 subjects
      will have a functional FUT-2 gene (secretor positive) and 1 subject will have a
      non-functional FUT-2 gene (non-secretor). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 3.5x10^3 copies
      of norovirus, in Cohort 2 will receive 3.5x10^4 copies of norovirus and in Cohort 3 will
      receive 3.5x10^5 copies of norovirus. Based on the illness rate of subjects meeting the
      primary outcome measure in secretor - positive subjects of the initial cohort, the decision
      will be made with regards to dosing of the second and the third cohorts. Subjects will remain
      in the inpatient facility for at least four days following the challenge and assessed daily
      for clinical and virologic evidence of norovirus infection. After the discharge, subjects
      will return to the site for evaluation on Days 6, 15, 30, 45, and 60 post challenge. A final
      phone call will be performed at day 180 to obtain an interim medical history. Study duration
      is approximately 12-18 months with subject participation duration of 6-8 months. The primary
      objective of this study is to determine the optimal challenge dose of Norovirus GII.4 CIN-3
      Batch No.: 01-16C3 to achieve illness in &gt; / = 50% of subjects (illness is defined as
      norovirus infection determined by positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and either: a) &gt; /
      = 3 loose or liquid stools, in a 24-hour period, b) &gt; / = 300 gm of loose or liquid stool in
      a 24-hour period or c) and/or any episode of vomiting), during the inpatient period. The
      secondary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety of the Norovirus GII.4 CIN-3 Batch No.:
      01-16C3 challenge strain; 2) To determine the rate of infection at different challenge doses
      by detection of norovirus GII.4 in the stool using specific qRT-PCR and Anti-norovirus GII.4
      serum IgG by Enzyme-Linked Immunnosorbent Assay (ELISA) (&gt; / = 4-fold rise from baseline
      through Day 30); 3) To measure the severity of acute gastroenteritis; 4) To determine the
      quantity and duration of virus shedding in stool by qRT-PCR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject able to provide informed consent.

          2. Male or non-pregnant females between the ages of 18 and 49 years, inclusive.

          3. Women of childbearing potential must be using an acceptable method of birth control
             for at least 30 days prior to enrollment through day 45 after receipt of challenge
             virus.

               -  A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless post-menopausal (absence
                  of menses for &gt; / = 1 year) or surgically sterilized (tubal ligation, bilateral
                  oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Acceptable contraception methods for women include but are not limited to: sexual
                  abstinence from intercourse with men, monogamous relationship with vasectomized
                  partner who has been vasectomized for 6 months or more prior to the subject
                  enrolling in the study, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with
                  spermicide or foam, effective devices (intrauterine devices (IUD's), NuvaRing
                  (R)) or licensed hormonal products such as implants, injectables or oral
                  contraceptives.

          4. For women of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test at screening.

          5. Are in good general health*.

             *As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
             currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have
             been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of the safety of
             subjects. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60
             days (no hospitalizations, Emergency Room (ER), or urgent care for condition and no
             adverse symptoms that need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental
             oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or
             frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition
             in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of
             health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons,
             as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a
             disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the
             site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional
             risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not
             indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes
             subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no
             deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a
             medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with
             the evaluation of responses to study vaccination.

          6. Demonstrate knowledge and comprehension of the study by scoring &gt; / = 70% on a quiz
             (test of understanding) of the study protocol and policies.
