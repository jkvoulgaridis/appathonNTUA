      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT: AGLE-102 is an allogeneic derived extracellular vesicle (EV) product
      derived from normal donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

      INDICATION AND RATIONALE: The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of
      AGLE-102 vs placebo in the treatment of lesions in subjects with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, multi-center, randomized, vehicle controlled, study to
      assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-103 vs placebo on lesions in subjects with EB.

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, multi-center, randomized, vehicle controlled, study to
      assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-102 vs placebo on lesions in subjects with EB.

      AGLE-102 will be applied topically, once a day to the entire body for a period of 60 days.
      Subjects will come into the study site to have 1 target lesion selected at baseline. Selected
      target lesion must be at least 21 days old (size 5 to 50 cm). Photographic confirmation of
      the target lesion location will be collected at baseline, and the picture saved from the
      first visit will be used to confirm location of the target lesion at subsequent visits. The
      subject will return to the study site for visit 2 (14 days +7 days from baseline), visit 3
      (30 days + 7 days from baseline) and visit 4 (60 days ±7 days from baseline) to have the
      target lesion, previously identified at baseline, re-assessed for the level of healing. In
      addition, itching, pain, Body Surface Area (BSA), target lesion closure, and scaring of
      healed target lesion will also be assessed at each visit. The ARANZ SilhouetteStarTM will be
      used to measure the target lesion at all visits.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:

      Primary End Point: The primary end point is to demonstrate in subjects with EB, the safety
      and efficacy of AGLE-102 vs placebo in lesion closure.

      Secondary End Points: Are to assess the change in itching, pain, BSA of blisters or lesions,
      target lesion closure, and extent of scarring of healed target lesion after treatment with
      AGLE-102 vs placebo.

      PLANNED SAMPLE SIZE: 10 subjects will be treated on the protocol with AGLE-102.
