  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few studies that already have validated specific raw accelerometer cut-points for
      people over 65 years old.

      The purpose of the present study is to validate raw accelerometer cut points for general
      people over 65 years old and specific raw accelerometer cut points based on the functional
      status of older adults over 65 years old.

      The study will be carried out with an observational approach. Participants will be divided
      into 4 groups. First of them will be made grouping all subjects and the rest divided
      according to their functional status. They will perform different-intensity physical
      activities while wearing accelerometers attached to their body and wearing a portable gas
      analyser too. Their intensity will be assessed based on their own Rest Metabolic Rate (RMR).
      Energy expenditure and accelerations will be matched and, based on that, sedentary behaviour,
      light physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity cut-points will be
      derived.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge on health implications of sedentary time and physical activity has been
      substantially improved in the last decades with accelerometer-based estimations. The
      popularity of these devices is partially explained by the capacity of objectively recording
      physical behaviors (e.g., sleep, sedentary time, physical activity…) during the whole day.
      The so-called &quot;cut-point&quot; approach is behind most of the research on physical activity with
      accelerometers. Cut-points provide metrics that are easy to understand, to translate to the
      public and to replicate by researchers in different settings. Usually, the minimum
      requirement is to use cut-points adapted to the age-group of the population of interest.

      Under this paradigm, cut-points have been developed in all age-groups and with a variate set
      to data collection and processing protocols. However, some scenarios lack of available
      cut-points to implement, being older adults (&gt; 65 years) the population with less
      alternatives of cut-points to use. In this sense, studies with older adults choose cut-points
      developed in younger adults to classify physical activity intensities. Biomechanical and
      physiological differences between adults and older adults advise against using this strategy.
      Therefore, relative energy expenditure and functional status should be considered for future
      cut-points design. Moreover, must be also awarded that hardly any previous cut-points
      validation protocols have been performed in a free-living setting. For this reason, more
      studies following these designs seems necessary to improve cut-points population's validity.
      Missing all mentioned factors could lead to physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns
      misclassification in this population.
