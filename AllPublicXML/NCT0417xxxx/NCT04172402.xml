      To evaluate disease objective response rate (ORR) of nivolumab in combination with
      gemcitabine and TS1 in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint will be evaluating overall response rate (ORR) of nivolumab in
      combination with gemcitabine and TS-1 in patients with advanced BTC. Simon's two-stage design
      will be used. If there are 3 or fewer subjects with controlled disease in these 19 patients,
      the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 25 additional patients will be accrued for a total of
      44. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 11 or more subjects with controlled disease are
      observed in 44 patients.
