  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) account for 3.2 million
      hospital admissions per year and have over three times more hospitalizations than those
      without cognitive impairment, yet hospital caregivers (HCGs) are ill-prepared to manage
      patients with ADRD with less than 5% reporting mandatory dementia care training.
      Three-quarters of hospitalized persons with ADRD display Behavioral and Psychological
      Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) associated with functional and cognitive decline, increased
      resource consumption, institutionalization, premature death, and caregiver burden. The
      overall objective is to test the preliminary efficacy of an innovative model of care,
      PES-4-BPSD, for reducing BPSD by empowering Patient Engagement Specialists (PES) to deliver
      dementia care for acutely-ill patients with ADRD. Traditionally, mental health assistants
      with training in crisis-prevention techniques provide care to psychiatric patients. On the
      intervention unit, these mental health assistants, as PES, purposefully engage patients with
      BPSD. In the pilot study, investigators found patients with cognitive impairment admitted to
      the PES unit were significantly less likely to require constant observation, chemical and
      physical restraints, suggesting improved management of BPSD. The central hypothesis is that
      PES-4-BPSD will improve the ability of PES to create an &quot;enabling&quot; milieu that addresses
      factors leading to BPSD and improves the experience of hospital caregivers. Guided by a
      social-ecological framework, PES-4-BPSD incorporates dementia education and training,
      environmental modifications-cohorting, increased staffing-PES, and staff support. The
      investigators' multidisciplinary research team is well-positioned to accomplish the
      following: Aim 1) Determine the preliminary efficacy of PES-4-BPSD for reducing BPSD during
      hospitalization, and Aim 2) Evaluate whether dementia care training improves the perceived
      ability of PES staff (intervention) and nurse assistant staff (control) to care for
      hospitalized persons with ADRD. For Aim 1, investigators will conduct a non-randomized
      preliminary efficacy trial of the PES-4-BPSD intervention enrolling N=158 patients (79
      control, 79 intervention). The primary outcome will be presence of BPSD during
      hospitalization using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q). In Aim 2,
      investigators will use survey methodology in a repeated measures design to evaluate within
      and between-group differences in attitudes, experience, and satisfaction toward managing
      patients with ADRD. Measures will be completed at baseline (T1), immediately following
      training (T2), and at the end of the intervention period (T3). This proposal will be the
      first to study an innovative model of care utilizing PES as specialized hospital caregivers
      for reducing BPSD in the hospital setting. The investigators' findings will lay the essential
      groundwork for a multi-site trial of PES-4-BPSD and inform the development of a program that
      can be easily implemented in other hospitals.

      We will evaluate whether dementia care training improves the perceived ability of PES staff
      (intervention) and nurse assistant staff (control) to care for hospitalized persons with
      ADRD. We will use survey methodology in a repeated measures design to evaluate within and
      between-group differences in attitudes, experience, and satisfaction toward managing patients
      with ADRD. Measures will be completed at baseline (T1), immediately following training (T2),
      and at end of the intervention period (T3). This study will utilize a repeated measures
      design to capture the impact of dementia care training on the experience of PES (intervention
      unit) and NA (control unit) staff to care for patients with dementia. Measures will be
      completed at baseline, prior to dementia training (T1: baseline), immediately after
      completion of the training program (T2: 3 months post-baseline) and following the completion
      of the 1-year intervention period (T3: 12 months post-training).

      A 3 month dementia training program will be implemented on both the intervention and control
      units. On the intervention unit, training will target the PES and on the control to the nurse
      assistants. The 3 month dementia training program is based on the John A. Hartford Institute
      for Geriatric Nursing and the National Alzheimer Association publications Try This: Best
      Practices in Nursing Care for Persons with Dementia, &quot;ACT&quot; on Alzheimers guide to dementia
      friendly hospitals, and the Person-Centred Care Training Programme for Acute Hospitals
      (PCTAH), the research team will provide PES staff with weekly 20 minute sessions. The
      sessions will consists of the following topics: types and impact of dementia, providing
      person-centered care, identification of and meeting peoples emotional and physical needs,
      effective communication, connecting to the family caregiver (FCG), the impact of the physical
      environment, and redefining and supporting behaviors staff may describe as challenging. In
      order to ensure all staff get the training, sessions will be repeated 3 times per week during
      change of shift.

    <measure>Change in Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire Total Score from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) is a 19-item scale designed to evaluate staff attitudes to people with dementia and providing dementia care. A five-point Likert Scale (1-5) is used for each item. The ADQ total score ranges from 19-95 with higher scores indicating a more positive attitude. The ADQ will be completed by Patient Engagement Specialists and Nurse Assistants at baseline (enrollment) and 3 months from enrollment. The average ADQ score at baseline and at 3 months will be calculated separately for each group and change will be assessed by subtracting each group's average score at baseline from their average score at 3 months. Differences in individual subject scores across time cannot be calculated because the survey data must be anonymous. However, the mean of the individual differences from baseline to 3 months is equal to the difference of the means at baseline and 3 months. A positive value for the change outcome represents improvement in staff attitudes.</description>
