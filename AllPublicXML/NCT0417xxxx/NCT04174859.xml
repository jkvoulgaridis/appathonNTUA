  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While it is well known that stopping or changing medication with blood thinners in patients
      who suffer from non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) increases the risk of ischemic stroke
      (a condition which occurs when a vessel supplying blood to the brain is obstructed), bleeding
      or thromboembolism (a condition that happens when a blood clot forms elsewhere in the body
      and travels through the blood stream to plug another vessel), limited data are available on
      the number of NVAF patients and the reasons why NVAF patients in Italy stop or change their
      treatment with blood thinners to prevent stroke or thromboembolism.

      By following the NVAF patients in routine clinical practice in Italy who are treated with
      rivaroxaban to prevent stroke or systemic embolism researchers want to find out how many NVAF
      patients and for what reasons NVAF patients stopped or changed rivaroxaban treatment. Study
      data will be collected through patients' routine visits at their treating doctor over a
      period of 24 months for each patient.

        NVAF patients who are treated with rivaroxaban to prevent stroke or non-CNS systemic
        embolism. Owing to the observational study design, patients will only be enrolled in the
        study if the decision to treat with rivaroxaban has been made by the treating physician in
        advance and independent of study inclusion. The decision to prescribe rivaroxaban is solely
        at the discretion of the investigator and made in accordance with his/her experience in
        accordance to SmPC.
