      All admitted patients diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral chronic subdural hematoma are
      included into this registry after consent. Clinical condition, radiological details, therapy
      (intervention/medication treatment/conservative) and outcome are documented. Patient
      follow-up is documented over at least 24 month with focus on neurological condition (NIHSS),
      cognitive impairment (MoCA) and quality of life (SF-12 ver. 2).

    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a frequent disease in- predominantly - elderly patients
      often caused by minor trauma to the bridging veins eventually leading to a collection of old
      blood in the subdural space over time. Besides age of the patients a number of further risk
      factors are assumed to favor pathogenesis. Depending on size and location of blood
      collections diverse neurological symptoms can be seen. Therapy approaches are heterogeneous
      ranging from conservative treatment with or without medication to surgical treatment. There
      also is lacking knowledge regarding neurocognitive impairment and effects on quality of life
      in patients under different therapy regimes.

      The prospective patient registry will enclose all patients admitted to the investigator's
      department diagnosed with cSDH either by MRI or CT scan after informed consent. Medical
      history, regular medication, social status, radiological findings and neurological
      examination using NIHSS will be performed at time of inclusion, discharge and follow-up.
      Additionally, neurocognitive testing and documentation of Quality of Life using MOCA Test and
      SF-12 will be conducted at different timepoints. Moreover a detailed documentation of therapy
      strategies is implemented in the study protocol.

      With this registry the study group expects to obtain significant data leading to a more
      standardized and optimized therapy regime and furthermore widening understanding on so far
      rarely known impact of cSDH on neurocognition and quality of life.

The score is composed of 11 items each scoring one specific ability with values between 0 and 4 points. A higher score indicates a higher level of impairment.

It consists of 12 items representing 4 physical and 4 mental domains which are aggregated into 2 summary measures: Physical Health (PCS) and Mental Health (MCS). Both scales are transformed to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.</description>

        Chronic subdural hematomas (cSDH) are a very common pathological entity particularly in the
        western countries with an aging population. The estimated incidence in older patients is
        roughly 300/100,000, which is in contrast to the general incidence of less than 20 per
        100,000.

        cSDH patients represent a relevant portion of all patients referred to neurosurgical
        departments.

        The prognosis of cSDH is generally considered to be good even when surgical intervention is
        required, however cSDH may still result in significant patient mortality and morbidity.
