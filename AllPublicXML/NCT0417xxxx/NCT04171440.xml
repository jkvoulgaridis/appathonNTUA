      The phase 3 randomized trial is to compare perioperative outcomes between minimally invasive
      and open approach for pancreaticoduodenectomy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized trial aiming to examine the outcomes associated with
      minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIPD), including robotic or laparoscopic, versus
      open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Adult patients with symptomatic benign, premalignant, or
      resectable malignant pathologies recommended for resection after a multidisciplinary review
      will be evaluated for inclusion into the study.

      Patients recruited will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either MIPD or open
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. A specialized abdominal dressing (40x40cm) will be applied to blind
      the patient from the intervention. The primary outcome(time to functional recovery) and
      secondary outcomes(including rates of post-surgery complications and sequential quality of
      life) will be recorded in detail and analyzed.

Pain controlled on oral analgesics only

    <measure>Pathological outcomes as assessed by Pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90-post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy(if there is any) reported by pathologist reviewing the resected surgical specimen. Pathological outcomes as defined by Protocol for Examination of Specimens from Patients with Carcinoma of the Pancreas (Pancreas Exocrine 4.0.0.1), where: complete response (score 0) is no viable cancer cells; marked response/minimal residual cancer (score 1) is presence of single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells; moderate response (score 2) is residual cancer with evident tumor regression, but more than single cells or rare groups of cancer cells; poor or no response (score 3) is extensive residual cancer with no evident tumor regression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (QoL) as measured by EQ-5D-3L</measure>
    <time_frame>EQ-5D-3L will be measured at 2 to 4 weeks and 3 to 6 months-post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems.This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. Numbers range from 1-3, with a higher number reflected more problems.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state', ranging from 0 to 100. A higher score reflects a worse health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (QoL) as measured by QLQ-C30 (version 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>QLQ-C30 will be measured at 2 to 4 weeks and 3 to 6 months-post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>QLQ-C30 questionnaire includes five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher score represents a higher response level.</description>
