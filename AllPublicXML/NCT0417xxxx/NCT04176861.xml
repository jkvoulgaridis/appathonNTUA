  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term pain affects one-third of the United Kingdom population and can be very disabling.
      People experiencing long-term pain often suffer from disturbed sleep because of their pain
      symptoms, and disturbed sleep can then make their pain symptoms worse. Managing long-term
      pain is also very costly to the National Health Service. The most common treatment is
      prescribed medicines, but these do not always work and can have serious side-effects for some
      patients.

      The investigators have been developing an alternative approach for treating long-term pain.
      This approach uses simple non-invasive tools to promote some kinds of brain activity over
      others. It involves patients using headphones to listen to some specific sounds, or using
      googles to look at lights flashing at particular frequencies. The studies undertaken so far
      seem to show that doing this can change how the brain responds to pain. It potentially offers
      an inexpensive yet effective way of reducing pain and improving sleep for patients with
      long-term pain. There are a few small studies that support this approach and more work is
      needed. The next step is to find out whether these tools can be reliably used in home
      settings, how people feel about using this approach, and to gather information to design a
      larger trial of this technology.

      Therefore the aim of this study is to test the suitability and acceptability of these
      home-based tools with individuals with long-term pain. 30 participants with long-term pain
      and pain-related sleep disturbance will use the tools for at least 20 minutes at bed time
      every day for 4 weeks. The investigators will interview them to ask about their experiences
      of using the tools, and their feedback and suggestions on how the approach should be
      developed. The investigators will measure changes in the nature of participants' pain, sleep,
      fatigue and mood.

      These findings will inform the planning and design of a future much larger study to test this
      technology. The investigators will make sure that findings from this study are shared widely
      within the National Health Service and beyond among patient groups, professionals, charities,
      specialist centres and commissioners.
