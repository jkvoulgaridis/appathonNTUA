  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of the oral Factor D (FD) inhibitor ACH-0145228
      (also known as ALXN2050 [formerly known as ACH-5228]) in participants with PNH as monotherapy
      and in combination therapy with an approved C5 complement protein (C5) inhibitor. After
      signing consent, participants will have periodic visits through Week 12, at which time the
      primary endpoint and key secondary assessments will be analyzed. Participants will continue
      on treatment past 12 weeks into a long-term extension portion of the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants currently receiving ACH-0144471 (danicopan) in Study ACH471-101 (NCT03472885) or
      Study ACH471-103 (NCT03181633) are eligible to participate in this study (ACH228-110). In
      addition, newly identified participants with PNH currently untreated with an approved C5
      inhibitor, and participants with PNH on a background therapy with an approved C5 inhibitor,
      may be eligible to participate in this study.

      After signing the informed consent form, participants will enter the screening period. During
      the screening period, eligibility and screening assessments will be performed. Screening
      assessments may be spread over more than one visit if necessary. At the baseline visit,
      screened participants who continue to meet eligibility criteria will enter the treatment
      period.

      Blood will be collected to assess the efficacy endpoints, such as, change in hemoglobin
      (Hgb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and other measures of hemolysis. Safety and transfusion
      requirements will also be assessed.

      Participants will continue on treatment past 12 weeks in a long-term extension portion of the
      trial. Participants may choose to discontinue at any time.
