    <textblock>
      Prospective monocentric study of patients with systemic sclerosis disease.

      The primary outcome is to define the prevalence of olfactory disorders (hyposmia and anosmia)
      in systemic sclerosis disease.

      The secondary outcomes are:

        -  To assess the correlation of olfaction disorders with clinical and biological and
           factors related to systemic sclerosis patients.

        -  To estimate the frequency of sinonasal disorders in patients with systemic sclerosis
           disease

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patient with hyposmia defined by a ETOC (European Test of Olfactory Capabilities) score strictly inferior to 27 points</measure>
    <time_frame>once time, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The European Test of Olfactory Capabilities is an olfactory test based on standardized odorants.A composite score evaluates the ability of the patients to define odors localisation and odors identification.The maximum global score is 32 points, the minimum is 0 point. The localisation ability score is rated from 0 to 16 points; The identification score is rated from 0 to 16 points. An hyposmia is defined by a global score strictly inferior to 27 points.</description>

    <description>The European Test of Olfactory Capabilities is an olfactory test based on standardized odorants.

The localisation ability score is rated from 0 to 16 points; The identification score is rated from 0 to 16 points.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients with an unilateral Lund Kennedy score of more than 3 points.</measure>
    <time_frame>once time, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of nasal mucosa inflammation status is based on Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score. The Lund Kennedy score ranged from 0 to 8 points for each nasal fossa. It evaluates oedema, discharge, the presence of polyps and crusting, that can be seen through nasal fibroscopy. A score strictly under 3 points on each side is considered as non pathologic whereas a score equal or over 3 points on each side is pathological. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of systemic sclerosis disease activity with Medsger Score</measure>
    <time_frame>once time, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Medsger Score estimates disease involvement of each organ (heart, vessels, skin, brain, kidney, gut, muscle, joint and loss of weight,) ranging from 0 to 4 (0: normal, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe, 4: terminal). The score ranges from 0 to 36 points.A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between global olfactory score measured with ETOC score and systemic sclerosis disease activity measured with Medsger Score</measure>
    <time_frame>once time, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ETOC score ranges from 0 to 32 points ( as previously described ).A higher score means a better outcome.
Medsger score ranges from 0 to 36 points. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Correlation between global olfactory score measured with ETOC score and skin involvement severity measured with Rodnan score.</measure>
    <time_frame>once time, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ETOC score ranges from 0 to 32 points ( as previously described ). A higher score means a better outcome.
The Rodnan score measured skin thickness (0 : normal, 1 : mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe) on 17 different sites. A global score between 0 point to 51 points is established.A higher score means a worse outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between global olfactory score measured with ETOC score and systemic sclerosis disease activity measured with Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>once time, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ETOC score ranges from 0 to 32 points (as previously described ). A higher score means a better outcome.
The Health Assessment Questionnaire is based on 20 questions related to routine activities with a grading system ranging from 0 to 3 (0: no difficulty, 1: moderate difficulty, 2: severe difficulty, 3: total incapacity). A global score between 0 point to 60 points is established. a higher HAQ score means a worse outcome</description>

    <measure>Correlation between global olfactory score measured with ETOC score and the rhinologic quality of life score measured with the sinonasal outcome test 22)</measure>
    <time_frame>once time, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ETOC score ranges from 0 to 32 points ( as previously described ). A higher score means a better outcome.
The sinonasal outcome test 22 is based on 22 questions with a grading from 0 to 5 ( 0: no probem, 1: very mild problem, 2: mild problem, 3: moderate problem, 4: severe problem, 5: very severe problem). A global score between 0 and 110 points is measured. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between global olfactory score measured with ETOC and Hospital anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>once time, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ETOC score ranges from 0 to 32 points ( as previously described ). A higher score means a better outcome.
The Hospital anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale is based on 14 questions with a grading system ranging from 0 to 3. A global score between 0 and 42 is measured. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
