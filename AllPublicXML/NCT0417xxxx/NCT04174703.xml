  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compassion-focused therapy (CFT) seeks to lower shame and help people develop compassion for
      personal distress and shortcomings. There is increasing evidence to support the benefits of
      incorporating CFT-based interventions into the treatment of eating disorders (EDs). Building
      on the investigators' prior research, this study will examine the effects of a two-week
      CFT-based self-compassion letter-writing intervention on patients with eating disorders.
      Participants will be recruited from the wait-list of patients scheduled to begin treatment at
      the outpatient St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton Eating Disorders Program, and will be
      randomly assigned to the two-week letter-writing intervention or to a control group. Results
      will inform the integration of new empirically-derived interventions into ED treatments to
      improve the currently dismal rates of ED recovery.

      The study consists of two phases. In phase one, participants will be randomly assigned to a
      two-week daily letter-writing intervention condition or a two-week control condition; phase
      one will occur two to four weeks prior to the start date of group ED treatment. Participants
      will complete a brief set of online questionnaires pre-, mid-, and post- two-week condition
      (i.e. baseline, after one week, and after two weeks).

      Following these two weeks of intervention/control condition, all participants will complete a
      25-week group treatment program as scheduled by the Eating Disorders Program. For phase two
      of the study, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires after 5 weeks, after 11
      weeks, and post-group treatment. Data that is routinely collected as part of patients'
      clinical care pre- and post-treatment (i.e. on the first day and last week of group
      treatment) will also be collected.

    <description>Self-report questionnaire with 12 questions on a 5-point Likert scale (scored 0-4). Total scores range from 0-48, with higher decrease in score indicative of a better outcome (i.e. higher decrease in levels of shame and guilt).</description>

    <description>Self-report questionnaire with 12 questions on a 5-point Likert scale (scored 1-5). Total scores range from 12-60, with higher increase in score indicative of a better outcome (i.e. higher increase in levels of self-compassion).</description>

    <description>Self-report questionnaire with 3 questions on a 10-point Likert scale (scored 1-10). Total scores range from 3-30, with higher increase in score indicative of a better outcome (i.e. higher increase in readiness to change disordered eating behaviours).</description>

    <measure>Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from day 1 to week 25 of group eating disorder treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report questionnaire with 28 questions, collecting two types of data. The EDE-Q collects frequency data of eating disorder behaviours. The EDE-Q also has four subscales assessing the severity of four aspects of ED psychopathology. These subscales are scored using 7-point Likert scales (scored 0-6). Higher decreases in scores are indicative of a better outcome (i.e. higher decreases in eating disorder symptomatology).</description>
