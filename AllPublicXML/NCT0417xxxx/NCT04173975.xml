  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This present study will be devoted to the first clinical study on the efficacy of the BELK
      system in enhancing mobility and improve the knee rehabilitation process in people with
      NeuroMuscular Diseases (NMD) and Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders with knee instability
      that implies deficit in gait and in locomotion during ADL.

      Participants will receive a 6-week training program (3 weeks with the BELK orthosis knee
      module) in a clinical setting in add-on to the standard neuro-rehabilitation treatment. Gait
      analysis and Instrumental Test will be performed every week till the end of the six-week
      training period while the Clinical Scales and Questionnaires will be performed after three
      weeks and at the end of the training period. Finally, additional outcome measures comprise
      the scores on the System Usability Scale (SUS) to evaluate the hardware and the Software
      Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) to evaluate the software of the BELK orthosis. These
      two measures will be administrated at the end of training with Belk orthosis, to rate
      patients' and operators' (e.g., physical therapist, medical doctors) satisfaction.

      During 2018, the company GOGOA (www.gogoa.eu), specialized in design, manufacturing and
      commercialization of Robotic Assisted Rehabilitation (RAR) systems, has developed a first
      prototype of the BELK system, a powered wearable robotic device that can be used for knee
      rehabilitation, in the sub‚Äêacute phase of knee injuries. As BELK is a wearable device, it can
      be used both, by the physiotherapist in the rehabilitation centers, improving the knee
      rehabilitation process and increasing patients' comfort, and accelerating their
      rehabilitation process.

      Casa di Cura del Policlinico (CCP https://www.ccppdezza.it/en/) is a fully integrated
      multi-specialty clinical center aiming at providing both inpatient and outpatient services
      mainly directed to neurological patients. The Center is constituted as a Department of
      Neuro-rehabilitation Sciences, accredited by the Italian National Health System, and
      economically supported by Regione Lombardia. CCP offers to chronic neurological patients the
      highest comprehensive standards of care in a comfortable environment, through a
      multidisciplinary patient management approach organized around a core rehabilitation program.

      The study design comprises a clinical study aimed at assessing efficacy of the BELK orthosis
      knee module on management of instability of the knee in 15 adults who have NMD or a CNS
      disorder. Participants will receive a 6-week training program (3 weeks with the BELK orthosis
      knee module) in a clinical setting in add-on at the standard neurorehabilitation treatment.

      The add-on rehabilitation training will be focused on lower limb with specific activities for
      knee instability, and will comprise 3 weeks using the BELK orthosis knee module and 3 weeks
      without any orthosis. The activities will concern both physical training (e.g., locomotion
      task, balance exercise, muscle reinforcement, proprioceptive task) and occupational treatment
      tasks (e.g., transferring/mobility, meal preparation, house-working).

      This clinical study will be a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) crossover longitudinal.

      The clinical trial will be split in the following phases :

        -  Recruitment. Subjects admitted to CCP Neurorehabilitation unit will be recruited after
           considering inclusion and exclusion criteria through clinical history and medical visit.

        -  Randomization. Enrolled participants will be randomly allocated (per 2 blocked
           randomization lists, generated electronically by www.random.org) into the BELK assisted
           group (Group A) or the control group (Group B).

        -  Clinical, instrumental and questionnaires assessment at T0 (baseline)

        -  Rehabilitation Treatment (first block) three weeks period, all the patients will perform
           rehabilitation training. The patients allocated in Group A will perform the training
           wearing the BELK device while patients allocated in Group B will perform the same
           exercise without any exoskeleton.

        -  Clinical, instrumental and questionnaires assessment at T1 (crossover)

        -  Rehabilitation Treatment (second block) three weeks period, all the patients will
           perform rehabilitation training. The patients allocated in Group B will perform the
           training wearing the BELK device while patients allocated in Group A will perform the
           same exercise without any exoskeleton.

        -  Clinical, instrumental, questionnaires and usability assessment at T2 (final)

        -  Additional Instrumental Test will be performed after the first and the second week of
           each rehabilitation treatment block (i.e., T01, T02, T11, T12).

      Instrumental Test consist of:

        -  Bio-mechanical performance (gait kinematics/kinetics analysis),

        -  Surface electromyography for knee functional evaluation (EMG),

        -  6-minute walking test (6mWT),

        -  Baseline assessments uptake (VO2),

        -  Hearth rate (HR),

        -  Breathing frequency (BF),

        -  Timed Up and Go Test (TUG),

        -  Stair Climb Test (SCT).

      Clinical scales consist of:

        -  Functional Ambulation category scale (FAC),

        -  lower-leg Ashworth scale (sum of score for hip, knee and ankle) (AS),

        -  Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-Best),

        -  Motricity Index (MI),

        -  Self-reported perceived effort (CR-10 Borg).

      Questionnaires consist of:

        -  International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee evaluation form (IKDC),

        -  Knee Outcome Survey Activity of Daily Living (KOS ADL) and health-related quality of
           life (SF-36).

    <description>Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive procedure involving the detection, recording and interpretation of the electric activity of groups of muscles at rest (i.e., static) and during activity (i.e., dynamic). The procedure is performed using a single or an array of electrodes placed on the skin surface over the muscles to be tested. Recording can also be made using a hand-held device, which is applied to the skin surface at different sites.

    <measure>Change in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and immediately after the rehabilitation training of each arm (Initial, after 3 weeks and final)</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC Questionnaire is a subjective scale that provides patients with an overall function score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. Symptoms sub scale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Meanwhile, the sports activity sub scale focuses on functions like going up and down the stairs, rising from a chair, squatting and jumping. The knee function sub scale asks patients one simple question: how is their knee at present versus how was their knee prior to injury?
Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Knee Outcome Survey (KOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and immediately after the rehabilitation training of each arm (Initial, after 3 weeks and final)</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Outcome Survey (KOS) is a patient-completed questionnaire that provides a percentage of disability during every day activities (activities of daily living sub scale) or sports (sports activity sub scale). The lower the percentage, the higher the disability.
This is a self-report measure that is broken down into two categories (ADLs and sport activities) that rates perceived disability with 5 being &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 0 being &quot;unable to perform&quot;.[1]</description>

    <description>BELK is a wearable system that assists when and where the patient needs it intelligently through proper control of the system and optimized gait assistance techniques. Assisted-as-needed control allows to create a force field along a desired trajectory, proportionally applying torque only when patient deviates from the pre-programmed correct pattern. This force field control, by assisting only the segments that the patient need, produces a natural gait pattern, improving the rehabilitation process.</description>
