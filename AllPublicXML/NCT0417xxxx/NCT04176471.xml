  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TIME study is a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate impact on early measures of
      neurodevelopment and the safety profile of therapeutic hypothermia in term neonates with Mild
      Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy who are &lt; 6 hours of age. Neurodevelopmental outcome will be
      assessed at 12-14 months of age. The study will enroll 68 neonates randomized to therapeutic
      hypothermia or normothermia across 5 centers in California.

      The TIME study is a multi-center randomized, controlled trial of Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH)
      (33.5°C ± 0.5° for 72 hours) versus normothermia using targeted temperature management,
      initiated within 6 hours after birth in term neonates with Mild Hypoxic-Ischemic
      Encephalopathy (HIE). Mild encephalopathy will be identified using the 6 component modified
      Sarnat exam as in the Neonatal Research Network of the National Institute of Child Health and
      Human Development trials of TH for moderate-severe encephalopathy and will be expanded to
      include features of mild encephalopathy. Eligible subjects must demonstrate ≥ 2 exam
      abnormalities (mild, moderate, severe) but without evidence of moderate-severe encephalopathy
      (≥ 3 moderate or severe features). The primary outcome is neurodevelopmental outcome at 12-14
      months of age. Secondary outcomes include evaluating the safety profile of therapeutic
      hypothermia in patients with Mild HIE. Therapeutic hypothermia is well tolerated and did not
      demonstrate serious safety concerns when evaluated in multiple large studies of neonates with
      moderate-severe HIE. It is now being applied by some practitioners to neonates with Mild HIE
      without systematic evidence of benefit or potential harm. This data will be necessary in
      order to develop and larger trial of efficacy to be determined at 2 years of age.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 68 neonates with mild HIE will be enrolled and randomized to therapeutic hypothermia (33.5°C ± 0.5°C for 72 hours plus 6 hours of rewarming) or normothermia (36.5-37.3°C for 72 hours ) with targeted temperature management. Each treatment group will have 34 patients. Participants randomized to normothermia who develop signs of moderate-severe HIE in the first 24 hours after birth will be crossed over to the treatment arm, as therapeutic hypothermia is the standard of care treatment for neonates with moderate-severe HIE.</intervention_model_description>
