  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study with a 3 + 3 dose escalation design followed by a dose-expansion
      phase.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the combination of pevonedistat, azacitidine, and venetoclax
      will be effective, safe, and well tolerated in patients with AML.

      The primary objective of this portion of the study is to determine a recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of pevonedistat, azacitidine, and venetoclax. The investigators will use a variation
      of the 3+3 design where both escalation and de-escalation are possible. A minimum of nine and
      a maximum of 24 subjects will be needed for the phase 1 part of the study (dose-escalation
      phase). The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period for dose escalation will be
      during cycle 1.

      Prior to enrolling patients at the next applicable dose level, all patients must complete the
      DLT period of the current dose level. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review the
      results of each dose level before the next applicable dose level opens for enrollment.

      Dose Expansion Phase

      The primary objective of this portion of the study is to confirm the feasibility and
      tolerance of the combination of pevonedistat, azacitidine, and venetoclax in patients with
      AML. Given that the dose-escalation phase described above will be able to establish the RP2D,
      the dose-expansion phase will employ this dose. In addition to relapsed/refractory AML
      patients, newly diagnosed AML patients can also be included in this phase to assess the
      feasibility and tolerance of this combination regimen.

      A minimum of six patients will be enrolled in the dose-expansion phase, which could be
      expanded based on the safety and tolerability.

    <description>This study uses a varied 3 + 3 design. Three patients will be started at a dose of 10 mg/m^2 days 1, 3 and 5. If no DLTs are observed in the first 3 participants, then a new cohort will be enrolled at the next planned dose level of 15 mg/m^2 days 1, 3 and 5. If two out of three subjects experience a DLT, then they will de-escalate one dose level. If one subject in three experiences a DLT, then expand up to three subjects at 20 mg/m^2 day 1, 3 and 5. If two out of six subjects experience a DLT, de-escalate one level. All subjects will receive Azacitidine and Venetoclax at the indicated dosages and timing.</description>
