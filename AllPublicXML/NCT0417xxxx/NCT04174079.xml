  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with T≥3 or N≥1 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after total two-field
      lymph node dissection were randomly enrolled into the experimental group for adjuvant
      chemotherapy or the controlled group for postoperative observation. The experimental group
      received 4-course chemotherapy of docetaxel combined with nedaplatin, and to observe the
      3-year progression free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) in two groups.
