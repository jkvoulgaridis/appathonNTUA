  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasability study aims to compare the 6-month success rate of a systematic proposal for
      non pharmacological interventions targeting the subject's empowerment among slackline,
      mindfulness, adapted physical activity, self-hypnosis, and Qi Gong versus usual care in the
      management of chronic pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain management is complex. 27.2 to 43.5 % of general population suffers from it.
      Opoid crisis has shown the limit of the WHO 3 step analgesic ladder. Multidisciplinary pain
      management programs, shared decision making and non pharmacological interventions targeting
      subject's empowerment are needed. Among these non pharmacological interventions, patients are
      increasingly turning to traditional and complementary medicines. Evidence about their safety
      and efficacy is hard to build. Thus our study aims to assess the feasibility of a systematic
      proposal for non pharmacological interventions targeting the subject's empowerment.
