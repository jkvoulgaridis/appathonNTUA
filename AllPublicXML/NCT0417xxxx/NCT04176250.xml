                    3. participant willing to continue practicing one of the above-mentioned birth
                       control methods throughout 14-day Study Treatment Phase and for 4 weeks
                       after the last dose of study medication or discontinuation from study
                       medication in case of early withdrawal.

          -  Participants must be capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes
             agreeing to compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed
             consent form and the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Need for immediate effective anti-TB treatment as judged by the investigator.

          -  Evidence and/or history of extra-thoracic TB (e.g. miliary TB, abdominal TB,
             urogenital TB, osteoarthritic TB, TB meningitis, ocular TB), as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Evidence and/or history in the last 5 years of one or any combination of the
             following:

               1. uveitis;

             documented in the case report form; however, a positive test for cannabinoids is not
             an exclusion criterion.
