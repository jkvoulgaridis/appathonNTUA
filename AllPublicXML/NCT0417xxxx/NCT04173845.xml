  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial was used to observe
      the effectiveness, safety and side effects of Tianqi Pingzhan Granule in the prevention of
      levodopa induced dyskinesia, so as to determine the clinical efficacy of Tianqi Pingzhan
      Granule in the prevention of levodopa induced dyskinesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trail is to evaluate the effect of Tianqi Pingzhan Granule in the
      prevention of levodopa induced dyskinesia in adults. All patients included in the study
      should meet the inclusion criteria. Half of participants will receive Tianqi Pingzhan
      Granule, while the other half will receive a placebo of Tianqi Pingzhan Granule. All
      participants will be assigned to either the active group or the control group randomly.
      During the clinical trail both doctors and patients are double-blind except serious adverse
      events occurred.
