      Primary objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of EXPAREL® administered as a single
      intrathecal injection in healthy volunteers

      Secondary objective: To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)
      profile of EXPAREL® administered as a single intrathecal injection in healthy volunteers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase-1, single center, randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled
      study in approximately 40 healthy adult subjects.

      All subjects will remain in the Early Phase Research Unit (EPRU) for 5 days and return to the
      research facility for a Day 9 follow-up visit. Subjects will also receive a phone call on Day
      30 (±3 days) to assess safety.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult male or female volunteers ages ≥18 and ≤50 years old.

          2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1.

          3. Able to provide informed consent, adhere to the study schedule, and complete all study
             assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Allergy, hypersensitivity, intolerance, or contraindication to any of the study
             medications for which an alternative is not named in the protocol (eg, amide-type
             local anesthetics, opioids, bupivacaine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             [NSAIDs], spinal anesthesia).

          2. Impaired renal or hepatic function (eg, serum creatinine level &gt;2 mg/dL [176.8
             μmol/L], blood urea nitrogen level &gt;50 mg/dL [17.9 mmol/L], serum aspartate
             aminotransferase [AST] level &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN], or serum
             alanine aminotransferase [ALT] level &gt;1.5 times the ULN).

          3. Subjects at an increased risk for bleeding or who have a coagulation disorder (defined
             as platelet count less than 80,000 × 103/mm3).

          4. Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as
             long-term, consistent use of opioids) in the post dosing period for pain and which may
             confound the post dosing assessments.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy test at
             screening and must be confirmed on the day of drug administration. If postmenopausal,
             must have a documented Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) test confirming menopause at
             screening.

          6. Currently pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or within
             30 days after completion of the study.

          7. Positive serology test result for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B
             virus, or Hepatitis C virus.

          8. Clinically significant abnormal ECG that in the opinion of the investigator would
             preclude the subject from participation in the study.

          9. Previous participation in a Pacira study.

         10. History of, suspected, or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription
             medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years.

         11. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives
             of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration,
             or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the
             subject's participation in this study
