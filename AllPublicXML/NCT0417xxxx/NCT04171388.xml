  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ENAT study will test the impact of packages of antenatal interventions to enhance
      maternal nutrition and manage pregnancy infections on the outcomes of infant birth size,
      gestational length, and infant growth in the first 6 months of life. Approximately 5,280
      pregnant women will be enrolled into the study from 12 health centers in the Amhara region of
      Ethiopia. Routine antenatal care will be strengthened in all health centers, and six health
      centers will be randomized to additionally provide a nutritional intervention including daily
      multiple-micronutrient or a fortified balanced-energy protein supplement for malnourished
      women. Women across all 12 health centers will be individually randomized to receive one of
      three infection management interventions in pregnancy: 1) enhanced infection management
      package (screening-treatment for urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted
      infections, presumptive deworming); 2) presumptive azithromycin (2g at &lt;24 wks and a second
      dose at least 4 weeks later); or 3) placebo. The women and their infants will be followed
      until 6 months postpartum. Outcomes of interest include birth size (weight, length),
      gestational age, maternal weight gain in pregnancy, maternal anemia, antimicrobial
      resistance, and infant size at 6 months.
