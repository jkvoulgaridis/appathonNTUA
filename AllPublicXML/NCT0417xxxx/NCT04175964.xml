    <textblock>
      For the fact of PCOS symptoms could be improved with weight loss and improving insulin
      resistance, the investigators will do this study to evaluate the role of the ketogenic diet
      in overweight and obese women with PCOS.

    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinal abnormalities that
      affect females within the reproductive age, and are found in about 4% of women. PCOS is
      commonly associated with symptoms of increased testosterone such as irregular or absent
      menstrual cycle, increased body hair, and infertility. PCOS is also associated with other
      disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes mellitus type 2,
      and dyslipidemia.

      Until now, there is no known curative treatment for PCOS. However, anti-diabetic medications
      can improve many metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, and increased levels of
      serum testosterone and total cholesterol. In addition, regulation of diet with exercise could
      improve the insulin sensitivity. Therefore, managements that aim to decrease the insulin
      level, improve the insulin resistance and decrease the body weight may be useful for
      improving symptoms of PCOS.

      Ketogenic diets are characterized by a reduction in carbohydrates (usually to less than 50
      g/day) and a relative increase in the proportions of protein and fat. People following the
      keto diet gain 75% of their calories from fat, 20% from protein, and 5% from carbohydrates.
      Previous studies have revealed that the ketogenic diet of low carbohydrate could decrease the
      body weight and improve the insulin resistance.
