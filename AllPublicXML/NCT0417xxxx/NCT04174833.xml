  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the clinical performance, quality of larynx visualization and
      difficulty of videolaryngoscopic intubation in patients with a reduced mouth opening (1.0 to
      3.0 cm) utilizing the latest generation of GlideScopeTM Spectrum low profile laryngoscopy
      system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced mouth opening in adults has been proven an important risk factor for difficult
      endotracheal intubation utilizing both direct and indirect laryngoscopy techniques, and a
      major reason for anesthesia-related adverse events. Over the past two decades,
      videolaryngoscopy has evolved to be the primary indirect laryngoscopy technique in a
      difficult endotracheal intubation setting. The possibility for optimal visualization of the
      laryngeal structures renders this method particularly helpful in patients with limited mouth
      opening. Especially videolaryngoscopy with acute-angle blades has been proposed to be
      favorable over conventional direct laryngoscopy in this setting. However, previous research
      has shown that a mouth opening of approximately 2.0 - 3.0 cm represents an independent risk
      factor and a possible critical lower limit for safe videolaryngoscopic intubation.

      The latest generation of GlideScopeTM Spectrum blades may provide sufficient intubation
      conditions even in patients with a maximum mouth opening below 3.0 cm.

      Our research group aims to evaluate the clinical performance, quality of larynx visualization
      and severity of videolaryngoscopic intubation the GlideScopeTM Spectrum system in patients
      with a small mouth opening.
