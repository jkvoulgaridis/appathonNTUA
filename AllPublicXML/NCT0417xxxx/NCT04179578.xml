  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient undergoing surgery for primary paraesophageal herniation, are randomized to either
      conventional suturing of the diaphragmatic crura only or with the addition of a diaphragmatic
      incision &quot;lateral release&quot;.

      The patients are examined by computed tomography before surgery and at 1 and 3 years after
      surgery.

      SF-36 (global quality of Life instrument), GSRS (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale),
      Reflux frequency issues and Watson's dysphagia score are completed before and at 3 and 6
      month as well as 1 and 3 years after surgery.

      Patients undergoing laparoscopic repair for paraesophageal hernia Type II-IV are eligible for
      inclusion in the study. Included patients will be randomized to either reconstruction of the
      hiatus by suturing of the crura alone or in combination with an approximately 4 cm incision
      of the anterior aspect of the left diaphragma &quot;lateral release&quot; before crural suturing. The
      incision will be covered with a synthetic patch after crural closure is finished. All other
      aspects of the surgical procedure are similar in the two groups including complete
      mobilization of the hernia sac before and a total fundoplication after hiatal restoration,
      respectively.

Physical and mental health summary scores are also derived from the eight RAND-36 scales. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

A mean value for the items in each dimension should be calculated:
Diarrhoea syndrome: 11. Increased passage of stools 12. Loose stools 14. Urgent need for defecation Indigestion syndrome: 6. Borborygmus 7. Abdominal distension 8. Eructation 9. Increased flatus Constipation syndrome: 10. Decreased passage of stools 13. Hard stools 15. Feeling of incomplete evacuation Abdominal pain syndrome: 1. Abdominal pain 4. Sucking sensations 5. Nausea and vomiting Reflux syndrome: 2. Heartburn 3. Acid regurgitation</description>
