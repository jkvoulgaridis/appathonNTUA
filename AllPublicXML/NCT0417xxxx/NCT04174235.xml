      This prospective cohort study of 20225 pregnant women attended Obstetrics Department of
      Beni-Suef University Hospital during period (January 2016 to January 2019). A full history
      taking was obtained according European surveillance of congenital anomalies EURO-CAT core
      data. All women underwent abdominal and transvaginal US (Toshiba Xario 200 unit): ▪ Females
      presented early in first trimester were scheduled for routine first trimester scan in
      accordance with international society of ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology guidelines.
      ▪ Females presented early in second trimester were scheduled for a routine second trimester
      scan. ▪ Females presented afterwards, had a routine ultrasound scan for fetal malformations.
