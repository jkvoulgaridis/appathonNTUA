    <textblock>
      The Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment
      (DISPLACE) study is a multi-center, national, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
      (NHLBI)-funded grant to look at the real-world implementation of stroke prevention guidelines
      (STOP Protocol) in which transcranial Doppler (TCD), a measure of cerebral blood vessel
      velocity, is used to screen for stroke risk in children ages 2-16 with sickle cell anemia
      (SCA). Part 3 of the DISPLACE study is an implementation clinical trial designed to test
      novel implementation strategies with the goal of improving adherence and implementation of
      stroke screening. 16 of the lowest scoring implementation rates from DISPLACE Part 1 will
      participate in DISPLACE Part 3. All original 28 sites from DISPLACE Parts 1 and 2 will
      receive a patient and provider educational intervention including a re-branding of the TCD as
      &quot;Sickle Stroke Screen&quot; with a new infographic and educational materials. The 16 sites with
      moving to Part 3 will be provided a Provider reminder strategy, which is a web based
      application designed to remind providers of when patients are due for their Sickle Stroke
      Screen. These 16 sites will be randomized and 8 will be given an additional Patient
      Communication Strategy. These sites will have a single designed coordinator with whom
      patients will communicate with about scheduling, rescheduling, and any other questions
      regarding their Sickle Stroke Screen. Upon completion, data will be analyzed to compare those
      who have had TCD screenings done appropriately and those who did not as well as the overall
      effect of the multi level interventions on the changes in TCD rates.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>1. Change in uptake and use of the stroke prevention guidelines (STOP Protocol) as defined in the NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) 2014 Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Guidelines by assessing stroke risk with yearly TCD screens</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The TCD measures the speed of blood flow in the blood vessels of the brain. Any unusually slow of fast speed may indicate a child is at a higher risk for stroke. By ensuring patients receive a yearly TCD more children will get a proper intervention and ideally prevent stroke.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>2. Change in uptake and use of the stroke prevention guidelines (STOP Protocol) as defined in the NHLBI 2014 SCD Guidelines by implementing chronic red cell transfusion (CRCT) in patients noted to have abnormal TCD screens.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-2 years</time_frame>
    <description>CRCT has been shown to severely decrease the incidence of stroke in patients who have had TCD screenings with an abnormal result.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in uptake and use of the stroke prevention guidelines (STOP Protocol) as defined in the NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) 2014 SCD (Sickle Cell Disease) Guidelines by re-screening patients with conditional TCD screens</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who have a condition TCD are considered to of slightly higher risk than patients with a normal TCD. By re-screening these patients in a shorter time period, providers are able to confirm or reject the initial screening and make the best plan for stroke prevention depending on these outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A difference in uptake and use of the stroke prevention guidelines (STOP Protocol) as defined in the NHLBI 2014 SCD Guidelines between between implementation arms measured by assessing yearly TCD screening rates.</measure>

    <description>Any difference in TCD implementation rates between each intervention arms will help determine optimal implementation procedures.</description>

    <description>A web-based application called ProviderMinder has been developed and will be used to alert providers when a patient who has been lost-to-follow-up or has missed their Sickle Stroke Screen (TCD). This will allow providers to follow up with such patients and improve screening rates. Additionally, sites will have a patient intervention of a single Sickle Stroke Screen coordinator who will interact directly with patients to schedule, reschedule, remind, and follow-up on stroke screening. This person will also act as a point of contact for any educational needs the patient may have. The second patient intervention will include the caregivers own mobile device. When Sickle Stroke Screens are scheduled the coordinator will ensure these appointments are directly put into the caregiver's mobile device calendar acting as an additional reminder for stroke screening.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) identified at each institution through
             International Classification of Diseases 9/10 (ICD-9/ICD-10) codes and local patient
             databases.

          -  Patients must have been seen by the designated institution (documented in medical
             record) a minimum of two times in the either inpatient or outpatient setting at the
             institution between the years of 01/01/2018-12/31/2019.

          -  Patients identified will include those currently aged 2-7. Thus children born from
             2012 and onward.

          -  Patients already receiving primary or secondary stroke prevention therapy with CRCT
             will be included in registration in Web Data Coordination Unit (WEBDCU) but not
             included in PROVIDER MINDER as they do not require ongoing TCD/SICKLE STROKE SCREEN
             based on protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not have SCA

          -  Patients who were born before 2012 and therefore do not meet age criteria.
