      An open label, single center, single arm Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of LUCAR-20S CAR-T cells in relapsed or refractory CD20+ diffuse large
      B-cell, follicular, mantle cell and small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      This study is an open, dose escalation/dose regimen finding study to assess the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of donor-derived CD20-directed CAR-T cells administered with
      lymphodepletion, and to obtain the preliminary efficacy results in subjects who have been
      diagnosed with relapsed or refractory CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma or small lymphocytic lymphoma. The allo-CAR-T cells will be
      infused in split-dose.
