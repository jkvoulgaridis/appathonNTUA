    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>

          4. Subject must have completed Week 52 (Apremilast Extension Phase) of Study
             CC-10004-PPSO-003.

          5. Subject is able to sign an assent with a legal guardian/s who understand/s and

             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          6. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          7. All female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must either practice abstinence
             from heterosexual contact or use one of the approved contraceptive options as
             described below while on apremilast and for at least 28 days after administration of
             the last dose of apremilast. For the purpose of this study, a female subject is
             considered of childbearing potential if she is ≥ 12 years old or has reached menarche,
             whichever occurred first.

        At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a female subject of
        childbearing potential's contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the
        Investigator will educate the subject regarding abstinence or contraception options and the
        correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully
        prevent pregnancy.

        Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at each visit. All
        FCBP who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one of the approved
        contraceptive options described below:

        Option 1: Any one of the following effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral,

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has a condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, or
             psychiatric illness, that would place the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were
             to participate in the study.

          2. Subject has a condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.
