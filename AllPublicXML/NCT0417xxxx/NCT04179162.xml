  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of BCG and gemcitabine in people who have BCG-relapsing
      Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). The researchers will test increasing doses of
      gemcitabine to find the highest dose that causes few or mild side effects when combined with
      BCG. The study will also look at whether this combination of drugs is effective in treating
      BCG-relapsing NMIBC.

    <description>Eligible patients will receive combination intravesical chemoimmunotherapy. Treatment is sequential, with twice-weekly intravesical gemcitabine given at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, for a total of 8 doses, administered in a standard fashion. In phase I, the dose of gemcitabine will depend on the dose level being assessed for the determination of the MTD. phase II, 1 dose level will be given (the MTD from phase I). Fixed doses of once-weekly intravesical BCG therapy (TICE strain, 50 mg) will be given at weeks 2 (+/- 2 days), 3 (+/- 2 days), 5 (+/- 2 days), 6 (+/- 2 days), 8 (+/- 2 days), and 9 (+/- 2 days), for a total of 6 doses, also administered in a standard fashion. All intravesical therapy will be administered in the chemotherapy suite on an outpatient basis, in accordance with standard clinical practice. Intravesical therapies will be retained in the bladder for up to 2 h (BCG) or 1 h (gemcitabine), or as tolerated.</description>
