  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute esophageal variceal bleeding (AEVB) is a serious complication of cirrhosis, with high
      morbidity and mortality. The latest European recommendations(1) recommend the early
      implementation, within 72 hours following esophageal variceal bleeding, of a transhepatic
      porto-systemic shunt set up by transjugular route (TIPS) called &quot;early TIPS&quot; in patients at
      high risk of recurrence, i.e. Child C&lt;14 or Child B with active bleeding at the time of
      endoscopy. The implementation of early TIPS appears to improve survival without
      transplantation in these patients, although the benefit among Child B patients without active
      bleeding has yet to be demonstrated.

      Renal failure is a determining factor in the prognosis of the cirrhotic patient. For patients
      with refractory ascites, or type 2 hepato-renal syndrome (i.e. chronic renal failure related
      to portal hypertension), the use of TIPS is recommended. Although a few studies with low
      levels of evidence have reported a benefit in the placement of TIPS in hepato-renal syndrome
      type 1 (i.e. acute renal failure related to portal hypertension), the European
      recommendations do not recommend the use of TIPS in this context due to lack of studies on
      the subject. Some studies have shown an improvement in renal function after performing TIPS
      in refractory ascites. To date, no studies have evaluated the impact of the implementation of
      early-TIPS on renal function in intensive care patients.

      The investigators would like to evaluate the impact on survival without liver transplantation
      on D28 of the implementation of early-TIPS in cirrhotic patients with AEVB requiring ICU
      hospitalization, compared to standard treatment (medical and endoscopic).

      Using electronic patient data monitoring systems, the investigators reviewed all patients
      with a diagnosis of cirrhosis admitted to ICUs at the Nantes University Hospital, and
      departmental Hospital of Vendée from January 1, 2012, to december 31, 2018. For enrolled
      patients, general clinical characteristics were collected. Patients were categorized into two
      groups according to the type of treatment performed: early TIPS or standard treatment.
