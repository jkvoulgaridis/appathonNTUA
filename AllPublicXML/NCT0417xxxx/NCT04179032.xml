  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of repeat doses of 200 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) belimumab
      administered via SC injection in pediatric participants 5 to 17 years of age with SLE on a
      background of standard of care therapy. This bridging PK study is part of an extrapolation
      strategy to support the use of SC belimumab in pediatric SLE participants, based on the
      completed adult SLE study with SC belimumab and the pediatric SLE study with intravenous (IV)
      belimumab. Part A is an open label 12-week treatment phase where participants will be
      enrolled and allocated to treatment cohorts based on their body weight at baseline. The dose
      and dosing regimens selected for SC administration in this pediatric population are intended
      to achieve a similar average exposure as observed with the weekly 200 mg SC dosing regimen in
      adult SLE patients. Part B is an optional 40-week open-label continuation phase, open to all
      participants who have completed Part A. Dosing of SC belimumab may continue at the same
      frequency in Part B or may require a change in frequency according to changes in participant
      body weight. The total duration of the study will be 68 weeks including a 12-Week open label
      treatment phase (Part A), an optional 40-week open-label continuation phase (Part B) and
      16-week follow-up.

                  the belimumab treatment period and for at least 16 weeks, corresponding to the
                  time needed to eliminate any study intervention(s) (e.g., 5 terminal half-lives),
                  after the last dose of study intervention. The investigator should evaluate the

          -  Have required renal replacement therapy (e.g. hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis)
             within 90 days of Day 1 or are currently on renal replacement therapy.

          -  Participation in an interventional clinical study either concurrently or within 6

          -  Hepatitis B: Serologic evidence of Hepatitis B (HB) infection defined as Hepatitis B
             surface antigen positive (HBsAg+) or Hepatitis B core antibody positive (HBcAb+)

          -  Hepatitis C: Positive test for Hepatitis C antibody confirmed on an additional blood
             sample by ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Participants
             who are positive for Hepatitis C antibody and negative when the Hepatitis C RNA-PCR
             assay is performed on an additional sample will be eligible to participate.
             Participants who are positive for Hepatitis C antibody and have a positive result for
             the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) when the Hepatitis C RNA PCR assay is performed on the
             additional sample will not be eligible to participate. (Institution or country
             specific guidelines for blood sample volume limits must be followed in collection of
             the additional blood sample).

          -  Have current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, or a history of drug or alcohol

             SC injection and have no reliable source to administer the injection

          -  Children in Care: A Child in Care (CiC) is a child who has been placed under the
             control or protection of an agency, organization, institution or entity by the courts,
             the government or a government body, acting in accordance with powers conferred on
             them by law or regulation. The definition of a CiC can include a child cared for by
             foster parents or living in a care home or institution, provided that the arrangement
             falls within the definition above. The determination of whether a child meets the
             definition of CiC should be made with the study centre staff in consultation with the
             responsible institutional review board (IRB)/Ethics Committee.
