  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-arm, parallel group randomized controlled trial will assess the impact of written
      social norms messaging (i.e., behavioral 'nudges') on healthcare organization administrators'
      decision to access online resources that support the adoption of evidence-based healthcare
      delivery practices. The healthcare delivery practices include the use of population screening
      tools, clinical practice guidelines, and shared decision making training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if behavioral 'nudges' impact the likelihood of
      healthcare organization administrators accessing technical assistance resources to support
      uptake of care delivery practices that: (1) have the potential to improve patient outcomes;
      and (2) have already been adopted by most healthcare organizations. A 'nudge' is a change in
      the way information is presented that attempts to steer people in a certain direction but
      does not restrict their choices.

      The investigator will conduct a randomized controlled trial of written messages to healthcare
      administrators at three types of healthcare organizations - physician practices, hospitals
      and healthcare systems - from among 3,402 administrators who completed Dartmouth's National
      Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems (NSHOS) in 2017-2018.

      In Fall 2019 the investigator will mail a customized report to all NSHOS respondents that
      compares their organizations' survey responses to their peer organizations. The investigator
      will randomize the 2,387 respondents whose organizations have not implemented one or more of
      up to seven chosen care delivery practices to cover letters with or without social norms
      messaging. The written messaging in the 'control condition' cover letter lists the practices
      for which the NSHOS team has prepared technical assistance materials in support of practice
      adoption, and contains a link to these online resources. The 'intervention condition'
      additionally highlights the organization's performance compared to its peers in adopting the
      practices using visual data display and explicit social norms messaging.

    <description>The percentage of participants who access the technical assistance webpage will be determined by email and webpage analytics. The primary analysis will be intention to treat (i.e., among all participants sent a letter); a secondary analysis will be a 'per protocol' analysis (i.e., among all participants whose letter was not sent back as undeliverable). Exploratory sub-group analyses will be conducted by each strata characteristic (e.g., whether organization category influences the likelihood of accessing the webpage).</description>
