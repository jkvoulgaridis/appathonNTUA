  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and performance of the ADAPT 3D - ALR in adult patients
      requiring replacement of aortic valve. 15 patients in one site in Belgium will all be treated
      with ADAPT 3D - ALR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct the initial clinical investigation of single piece
      ADAPT treated 3D - ALR (Aortic Leaflet Repair) to collect evidence on the device's safety and
      performance. The study is anticipated to confirm successful clinical safety and clinical
      performance with significant improvements in clinical hemodynamic performance.

      The ADAPT® technology is used to process animal derived tissues to produce implantable tissue
      prosthetic devices that are compatible with the human body. This technology has been shown to
      produce reliable, biocompatible and versatile regenerative prosthetic devices capable of
      being used instead of synthetic products currently used in many soft tissue repair
      applications.

      15 patients with aortic valve insufficiency or stenosis will be enrolled in this single arm
      single site study.

      Follow-up will continue through to 26 weeks.

    <description>The operation is performed through a median sternotomy and with the hemodynamic support of standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP). diseased leaflets are excised meticulously. Calcifications at the level of the annulus will be removed just like in any other aortic valve replacement procedure. The annulus will be sized and the appropriate 3D single piece valve will be chosen. The implant technique will consist out of one running suture line at the level of the annulus, followed by fixation of the 3 commissural parts against the aortic wall. Valve competence and function will be assessed visually, and by TEE immediately coming of bypass.</description>

             for all child bearing potential females).

         16. Recent (within 6 months) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or a transient ischemic attack
             (TIA).

         17. Myocardial Infarction (MI) within one month of trial inclusion.

         18. Currently participating in, or have been recently exited from (within 30 days of
             enrollment in this study), or plan to be enrolled in another clinical
