  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenvatinib and pembrolizumab work in treating patients
      with anaplastic thyroid cancer that is stage IVB and has spread to nearby tissue or lymph
      nodes (locally advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), or stage IVC that
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Lenvatinib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Given lenvatinib and
      pembrolizumab may work better than giving either one alone in treating stage IVB or C
      anaplastic thyroid cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Demonstrate the efficacy (overall survival [OS]) of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in
      patients in the treatment naive arm (arm 1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with
      lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in arm 1.

      II. Establish safety for concurrent administration of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (in arm 1
      and 2).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate the efficacy (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response,
      overall survival) of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in patients who have progressed on prior
      systemic therapy (arm 2).

      II. Translational endpoints: cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) changes and immune
      correlates will be studied.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and lenvatinib
      orally (PO) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

             the principal investigator. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood
             vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of
             severe hemorrhage and tracheoesophageal fistula associated with tumor
             shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy

          -  Major surgery within 1 week of course 1 day 1

             agent

          -  Previous anti-angiogenic targeted therapy is excluded. However, patients who have
             progressed on previous immunotherapy, or non-antiangiogenic targeted therapy are
             eligible for Arm 2

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B (chronic or acute)
             or hepatitis C infection. Patients with past or resolved hepatitis B infection

             anti-HBc [antibody to hepatitis B core antigen] antibody test) are eligible. However,
             patients with past or resolved HBV should be monitored for reactivation by a

             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (eg, FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed

          -  Has severe hypersensitivity (&gt;= grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a
             positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG] (or human chorionic gonadotropin
             [hCG]) test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-hCG [or
             hCG]). A women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who has a positive urine pregnancy
             test within 72 hours prior to the first infusion will be excluded. If the urine test
             is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required
