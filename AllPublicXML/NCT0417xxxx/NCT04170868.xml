  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to produce and then assess a psychoeducational video series
      intended for use amongst an adult attention deficit/hyperactive clinical population. The
      videos will disseminate evidence-based strategies for the management of Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Each video, roughly two minutes, will both introduce the
      viewer to a single ADHD management strategy and explain how said strategy can effectively be
      applied. The collective of the finished video series will aim to cover the breadth of common
      ADHD-related issues. An example of the animated video styling can be found at the following
      link: bit.ly/ADHD_Ethics. The investigators will evaluate these videos in a proof of concept
      program, looking at outcomes in both functional skill development and patient perspective.
      The results will be presented in an undergraduate thesis presentation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of four phases, each involving the completion of several self-report
      metrics following video exposure or the lack thereof. The investigators expect 30-40 patients
      to progress through a quadriphasic design.

      Phase 1:

      Upon understanding and signing an informed consent form, participants will complete a short
      demographics questionnaire that will enquire into their age, education level, and gender, but
      will not include specific identifying information such as name, initials, email, or home
      address.

      Next, participants will be asked to complete a survey containing both the Tuckman Condensed
      Procrastination Scale (TCPS) and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). The data that are
      gathered from the ASRS will be used as a core inclusion-exclusion metric.

      Finally, participants will be briefed on the video access system and then given their unique
      login credentials, which allow the investigators to track individual usage metrics. The
      investigators will then explain that for the next ten days the participant will have
      unlimited access to a single, randomly assigned experimental video (with participants split
      between one of two videos) adding that at the third and seventh days the participant will
      receive—pending consent—a friendly email reminder of their ability to access the video. Any
      questions will be addressed at this point.

      All in, the time required to complete Phase 1 for a single participant will be 30-45 minutes.

      Phase 2:

      After ten days have elapsed, the participant will be sent an online survey link containing
      the TCPS, ASRS, and a Video Review Survey. The email will also explain how video access over
      the upcoming ten days will be restricted—as Phase 3 of the study commences—but that they need
      not worry as full-access will be reinstated following completion of the study. With that,
      participants will be reminded of the investigator's contact information and left to continue
      using the learned strategies for the upcoming ten days.

      Phase 3:

      Following the ten day washout period, participants will be sent another online survey link
      containing the TCPS and ASRS. The email will also contain access to the second of the two
      videos, along with a re-explanation of how the investigators hope they use it. From here,
      another ten-day exposure period will begin.

      Phase 4:

      After completing the second ten-day exposure period (totalling one month's time), the
      participant will be asked to answer a final Future Video Survey. Once the survey has been
      answered, the participant will have finished the study and will be thanked for their time. A
      contact address and number will be included in the email in the case of any unresolved
      question, and a link will be provided to reinstate participant video access.

    <intervention_model_description>The videos will be evaluated in a split-exposure clinical trial, whereby outpatients will be randomly assigned access to one of the two proof-of-concept videos for unlimited viewing. After ten days of access, the patients will spend an additional ten days without video access. The first ten-day procedure will then be repeated once over, with each participant now gaining access to the opposing proof-of-concept video. Clinical impairment data along with patient perspectives will be gathered at each transition junction for use in pre- and post-exposure analyses. The investigators hope to find meaningful improvements in patient functioning—along with a positive reception to the video format—such as to warrant further clinical investigation.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tuckman Condensed Procrastination Scale (TCPS) Change (Video One)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at days 0 and 10. Day 0 serves as a baseline for changes at Day 10 following exposure to video one.</time_frame>
    <description>The TCPS is a 16-question condensed version of the original Tuckman Procrastination Scale and has been validated as the gold standard for the evaluation of procrastination proclivity. The TCPS assesses respondent behaviour by posing self-statements that can either be agreed or disagreed with on a four-point Likert-type scale. Out of the sixteen questions, five are reversed coded to promote accurate responding.</description>

    <measure>Tuckman Condensed Procrastination Scale (TCPS) Change (Video Two)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at days 20 and 30. Day 20 serves as a quasi-baseline--following washout--for changes at Day 30 following exposure to video two.</time_frame>

    <measure>Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Change (Video One)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at days 0 and 10. Day 0 serves as a baseline for changes at Day 10 following exposure to video one.</time_frame>
    <description>The ASRS is an 18-item self-report screening scale used to assess adult ADHD. Each ASRS item contains a five-point scale where participants indicate how frequently they conduct themselves in the described manner; item responses can range from 'Never' to 'Very Often', where responses of 'Often' or 'Very Often' are consistent with ADHD typical dysfunction. When participant responses meet the criterion for ADHD typical dysfunction on at least 4 out of 6 screener items (denoted as 'Part A'), said participant will meet inclusion for the study. The remaining 12 ASRS items ('Part B') will be administered for use in the event that the screener criteria are met, and thus a need for further psychometric gradation arises.</description>

    <measure>Video Review Survey (VRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered on day 10 and day 30. These are the points in which participants will have completed exposure to videos one and two, respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>The VRS is a short questionnaire that participants will answer twice, each time following completion of a two-week video access block. The VRS requests participants to provide their opinions on the video—and the strategies contained within—that they had access to for the previous month. Through specific opinions, the investigators are better able to adapt future psychoeducational resources to the needs of people with ADHD.</description>
