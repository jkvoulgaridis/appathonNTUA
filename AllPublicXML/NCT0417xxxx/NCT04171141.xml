      A phase 1, open‑label, dose escalation and expansion study of PF‑07062119 in patients with
      selected advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of PF-07062119 administered as a
      single agent in sequential dose levels and then in combination with anti-programmed cell
      death -1 protein (anti-PD-1) and in combination with an anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (anti-VEGF). In Part 1A, successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses
      of PF-007062119 and then in dose finding (Part 1B) with PF-07062119 in combination with
      anti-PD-1 and in combination with anti-VEGF. This study contains 2 parts, dose escalation
      with single agent (Part 1A) and then dose finding with PF-007062119 in combination with
      ant-PD-1 and in combination with anti-VEGF (Part 1B) followed by dose expansion arms as a
      single agent and PF-07062119 in combination with anti-PD 1 and in combination with anti-VEGF
      (Part 2).
