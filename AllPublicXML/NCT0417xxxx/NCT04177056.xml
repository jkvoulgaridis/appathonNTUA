  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy has been shown to be very effective at relieving pain caused by bone
      metastases. However, certain types of cancers such as prostate, kidney, and melanoma can have
      resistance to radiation, making treatment less successful. Stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT) is a newer form of focused treatment that gives higher doses of radiation without
      damage to surrounding organs. It often is used to help control and cure disease, but less
      commonly as a way to palliate and treat symptoms. This study is looking at using SBRT for the
      purposes of improving pain caused by bone metastases in prostate cancer kidney cancer, and
      melanoma patients. It is theorized that the higher levels of radiation may be able to combat
      the resistance some tumour cells have to radiotherapy and provide improved pain response to
      treatment. The investigators are looking to show that SBRT has a role in helping this group
      of patients deal with painful bone lesions from their cancer without increasing side effects
      and toxicity from the radiation treatment.

    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has shown promising early results in the management of
      bone metastases. However, there is a paucity of prospective data studying the use of SBRT for
      bone metastases originating from low alpha-beta tumors, with systematic reporting of changes
      in pain scores and analgesia use over time. The vast majority data looking at SBRT in bone
      lesions focuses on local control and survival, rather than more tangible outcomes in a
      palliative population including symptomatic control, durability of response, and patient
      reported quality of life; a component that is understudied in this group despite its
      tremendous value. Furthermore, SBRT for bone metastases has yet to become common practice
      given the limited evidence for its efficacy and uncertainty in regards to toxicity.

      The current study proposes an investigation of the potential benefits of SBRT for symptomatic
      bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and
      sarcoma. The investigators look to conduct a prospective cohort study that is adequately
      powered to analyse efficacy in alleviating pain from bone lesions and compare this to
      well-established rates in literature for conventionally fractionated palliative RT.
      Furthermore, this study will assess the tolerability of this modality, toxicity rates, and
      effect on quality of life. If our results show that SBRT has a significant benefit on this
      population, the goal would be to pursue a larger randomized trial to confirm the findings.
