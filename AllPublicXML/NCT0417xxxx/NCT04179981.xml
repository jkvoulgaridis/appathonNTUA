  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are highly
      prevalent chronic respiratory diseases in the Veteran population. OSA co-occurring with COPD,
      known as Overlap Syndrome (OVS), is a complex chronic medical condition associated with grave
      consequences. OVS is highly prevalent in Veterans. Veterans with OVS may be at increased risk
      for cognitive deficits, poor sleep quality as well as a reduced quality of life (QoL). The
      overall objective is to study the effects of positive airway pressure therapy on clinical
      outcomes in patients with OVS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no studies regarding the impact of PAP therapy on sleep disturbance, cognitive
      function and quality of life in patients with OVS. The investigators' rationale is that in
      patients with moderate-severe OVS, PAP therapy will effectively alleviate sleepiness, sleep
      disturbances and cognitive deficits, and, thereby, improve QoL. 'PAP' includes either
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive positive airway pressure
      ventilation (NIPPV).

      Objectives:

      Specifically, the investigators will study the effectiveness of PAP therapy vs. conservative
      care in reducing daytime sleepiness and in improving sleep quality and QoL in older Veterans
      with OVS.

      The investigators will also explore whether CPAP is non-inferior to noninvasive positive
      airway pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in reducing daytime sleepiness, sleep disturbances and
      neurocognitive dysfunction, and in improving QoL in older Veterans with OVS.
