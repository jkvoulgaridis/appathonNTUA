  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophagectomy is the cornerstone for treatment of esophageal cancer. However, it is
      associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Studies suggest that systemic
      inflammation after surgery has a negative impact on surgical outcomes. Attenuation of an
      excessive inflammatory response within the perioperative period for high-risk surgical
      procedures may reduce morbidity and mortality. The inflammatory response may be important in
      the development of these complications and reduction of inflammatory cytokine may be
      associated with an improved outcome.

      The current study will evaluate the feasibility and safety of neuromodulation during
      minimally invasive surgery for esophageal cancer (esophagectomy) to assess impact on the
      inflammatory response. During the esophagectomy, a stimulation lead will be placed on the
      exposed nerves, and energy applied to the lead to test whether the nerves can be activated.
      The study will also measure potential physiological responses to nerve activation.

      Active dampening of the inflammatory response may be an important therapeutic target to
      decrease complications and improve recovery following esophagectomy. The current study is
      intended to evaluate the feasibility and safety of stimulating the exposed nerves in
      esophagectomy patients.

      During minimally invasive esophagectomy, a neurovascular bundle (NVB) is exposed or partially
      exposed as part of the obligatory lymph node dissection. At the point in the esophagectomy
      when the NVB is being isolated, a lead will be applied laparoscopically to the NVB and
      connected to an external pulse generator. An ultrasound transducer will be introduced to the
      abdomen and placed on the NVB to visualize splenic arterial blood flow. The NVB will be
      stimulated while physiologic responses are observed. Blood samples will be taken before, and
      at certain pre-defined time points after, stimulation and recovery. The lead and ultrasound
      transducer will be removed after completion of stimulation, and the esophagectomy surgery
      will continue. Surgeon experience applying and removing the cuff electrode will be
      documented, in addition to the responses to NVB stimulation. Post-operative safety will be
      followed through 7-days (or day of discharge if earlier).
