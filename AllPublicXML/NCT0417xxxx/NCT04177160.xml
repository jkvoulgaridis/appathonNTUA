  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjective cognition decline (SCD) is considered as a risk factor of dementia and associates
      not only with further cognition deterioration but with a higher anxiety level. Anxiety may
      lead to decreasing cognitive function and negative impacts on the well-being and quality of
      life. To avoid these consequences, reducing anxiety is an important step to treat SCD. To
      ease anxious emotions, music has been viewed as an effective, safe and easy alternative to
      medication. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of music on
      reducing the anxiety of the healthy elderly and SCD and further to compare the anxiety level
      between SCD and healthy controls.

      Single subject pretest-posttest design was used. 12 SCD subjects was recruited from the
      memory clinic and 12 healthy controls from the community. The anxiety level was assessed both
      by self-reports (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Visual Analogue Scale of Anxiety) and by
      objective measurements related to autonomic nervous system activities (heart rate variability
      and electrodermal activity). The participants underwent a memory task to induce anxiety.
      Next, preferred music and white noise were provided in random order. The anxiety level and
      the effects of music intervention between SCD and healthy controls will be further compared.

    <description>Heart activity was transformed into low- and high-frequency power components, which represented sympathetic and parasympathetic system activities respectively. It is recorded by skin conductance sensors wearing on the 2nd to 4th finger. These sensors connect to ProComp2™ Biofeedback System to collecte biofeedback data. The data is further calibrated and analyzed by CardioPro Infiniti software.</description>
