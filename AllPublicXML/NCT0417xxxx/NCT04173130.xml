      Monocentric feasibility study for a new device for the treatment of anal fissure with
      botulinum toxin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anal fissure is a common anal disease. This is a longitudinal tear in the distal part of the
      anal canal. The fissure provokes a spasm of the internal anal sphincter and as such pain and
      eventually bleeding.

      There are currently 3 different treatments. All available treatments tend to relax the anal
      sphincter, which reduces pain and promotes fissure healing.

      The first treatment consists in the local application of cream into the anal canal.

      The second option is the injection of botulinum toxin into the internal or external anal
      sphincter. Finally the third option is a surgical intervention, most frequently a lateral
      sphincterotomy.

      Although the usefulness of botulinum toxin to treat anal fissure has been demonstrated, the
      results vary. This is most likely largely due to the fact that there is no standardized way
      to inject botulinum toxin and that there is a significant learning curve. In addition, the
      gesture is not without risk for the operator.

      The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of injecting botulinum toxin into the
      anal canal with a new medical device for patients with anal fissure.

      The trial is a mono-centric pilot study conducted on 4 patients. The study is open,
      prospective and all patients will be treated with the botulinum toxin injected using the new
      medical device.

      The device (single-use) under investigation and the botulinum toxin will be made available
      free of charge to the patient.
