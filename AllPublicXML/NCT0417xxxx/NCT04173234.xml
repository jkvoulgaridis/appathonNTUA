  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common neuromuscular disease in childhood with
      an estimate incidence of 1 in 3500 to 5000 male births. The effect of aerobic training on
      muscle architectural properties and motor functions such as muscle activation is not clear in
      DMD. The aim of this study is to compare with children with DMD and healthy peers in terms of
      muscle architectural properties and motor functions, and investigate the effects of aerobic
      training on these parameters in children with DMD. Twenty children with DMD and 10 healthy
      peers will be included in the study. Twenty children with DMD included in the study will be
      divided into two groups as home program and home program+aerobic training with block
      randomization method. Home program including stretching, respiratory, range of motion and
      mild resistance exercise with body weight will be asked to apply 3-5 days a week for 12
      weeks, aerobic training will be performed 3 days a week for 12 weeks at 60% of their maximum
      hearth rate with 50 minutes total duration consisting of 10 min warm up and 10 min cool down
      period. Muscle architectural properties, muscle strength, muscle activation and motor
      function will be assessed with ultrasonographic, hand-held myometry, surface EMG and Motor
      Function Measure, consecutively. Assessments will be applied at pre-training and after 12
      weeks of training.

    <measure>Evaluation of Muscle Thickness, Fascicle Length, Pennation Angle with Ultrasonography</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Bilateral Vastus Lateralis and Medial Gastrocnemius US evaluations were performed with use of a 5-10 MHz linear probe (Diasus Dynamic Imaging Ltd, Livingston, Scotland,UK). Children were positioned supine with their legs extended and their muscles relaxed for vastus lateralis.Children were positioned prone position with their legs and their muscles relaxed for medial gastrocnemius. While Muscle Thickness and Fascicle Length would be expressed as centimeters, pennation angle would be angularly indicated.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of muscle activation with surface Electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal voluntary isometric contraction of bilateral vastus lateralis and medial gastrocnemius was recorded in manual muscle test position as microvolt. In the normalization process, the average of the EMG signal amplitude of standing was divided by the MVIC value for each muscle of interest. The muscle activation levels, expressed as a percentage of MVIC (MVIC%).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Motor Function by Motor Function Measure (MFM)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The total scores of the MFM test were determined in three motor function domains: D1 (Standing Position &amp; Transfers), D2 (Axial and Proximal Motor Function) and D3 (Distal Motor Function) (scored between 0-96 points, low score indicate low performance.)</description>

    <measure>Evaluation Motor Performance with Timed Functional Test and Six minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Timed function tests included time taken to stand from a supine position, time taken to run/walk 10 m, time taken to climb 4 standard-sized stairs, time taken to descend 4 standard-sized stairs and time taken to stand one leg stance (both leg).Participants were instructed to travel as far and as fast as possible in six minutes on 25 meter-indoor course.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shortening assessment of trunk and lower extremity muscles with goniometric measurement and tape</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of back extensors, hip flexors, hamstring, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles. For assessment back extensors, The child was placed in the supine position with his knee fixed at a neutral position, and then shortening was evaluated by having bilateral hip flexion made. For hip flexor, The child was placed in the supine position with his knee fixed at a neutral position, and he was then evaluated by having one leg hip flexion made. Hamstring shortening was measured in a supine position with the hip flexed at 90Â° and the opposite knee and hip were placed in an extended position. Quadriceps shortening was assessed in a prone position and then by bending knee. For gastrocnemius muscle, the child was placed in a supine position and asked to perform passive ankle dorsiflexion while the knee was extended.</description>
