  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) has been increasing in
      China, which poses great challenges and burdens to the medical community due to its unknown
      etiology, recurrence and incurability. Co-infection is one of the important causes in IBD
      development. IBD accompanied with Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI) can significantly
      decrease the treatment efficiency, leading to increased surgical rate, increased mortality,
      prolonged hospital stay, and increased hospital costs. Recently, several Chinese clinical
      guidelines about IBD or CDI have been published, but these guidelines are mainly based on the
      foreign studies. Compared with the developed countries, the lack of multi-center, large-scale
      and multi-test clinical trials and cohort studies caused limited understanding for IBD-CDI in
      China. Therefore, it is of great importance to carry out the multi-center clinical trials and
      analysis on IBD-CDI to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency in IBD-CDI patients

      Objective:

        1. To evaluate the prevalence rate of IBD-CDI in Chinese adults in China based on the
           multi-center clinical trials..

        2. To analyze the related risk factors of IBD-CDI in China based on the multi-center
           clinical trials.

        3. To analyze the intestinal flora of IBD-CDI patients via high-throughput sequencing.
