  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The investigators hypothesize that a simple, personalized, smartphone-based activity
      intervention using a wrist-based activity tracker will help high risk pregnant women increase
      their activity level during pregnancy.

      Participants: Pregnant women who have a documented body mass index of ≥ 30 kg/m2, or who have
      a history of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, or
      preterm birth &lt;37 weeks' in a prior pregnancy and are enrolled in prenatal care at University
      of North Carolina will be recruited for participation.

      Procedures: Women meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited through the University of
      North Carolina prenatal care clinics. They will be contacted for possible participation at
      regularly scheduled prenatal visits. Women who are enrolled will complete validated dietary,
      stress, sleep, and body image questionnaires. Enrolled women will then be randomized to
      receive standard obstetrical care or enhanced counseling. All participants will receive a
      wrist-based activity tracker. Maternal blood sample for biochemical markers of stress and
      gene expression will be obtained at the initial visit; a followup blood sample will be
      obtained later in pregnancy, and a small portion of the placenta saved at delivery. Maternal
      and neonatal outcomes will be compared between groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, women regularly interact with healthcare professionals, an often untapped
      resource and opportune time to optimize weight gain, nutrition, and activity, positively
      impacting outcomes and lifelong health. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that a
      simple, personalized, smartphone-based activity intervention using a wrist-based activity
      tracker will help high risk pregnant women increase their activity level during pregnancy and
      optimize gestational weight gain and biometric parameters. Importantly, the investigators
      propose that women can be engaged in care via a simple, personalized text-message based
      intervention.

      Women will be enrolled early in pregnancy and followed prospectively. All women will receive
      a wrist-based activity tracker. Some women (those randomized to receive individualized
      counseling) will receive weekly text messages based on their activity in the prior week.
      Other women will not receive any specific instructions regarding activity level. The
      investigators will follow their outcomes prospectively. Biologic samples (including blood,
      urine, vaginal swabs, placental tissue) will be collected at enrollment and at delivery.
