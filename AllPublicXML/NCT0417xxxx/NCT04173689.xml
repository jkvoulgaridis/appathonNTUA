    <textblock>
      This is an educational work. Thirty patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis will be included in
      the study and randomly selected into two training groups.One group will receive home
      inspiratory muscle training (IMT) for 15 minutes, twice a day, 7 days a week with the resh
      Threshold IMT 'device. In the IMT group, the initial training intensity will be determined by
      measuring the maximal inspiratory muscle strength (MIP) with the intraoral pressure measuring
      device, 30% of the measured (MIP) value will be started at the first evaluation and the new
      training intensity will be determined by calculating 30% of the measured value by repeating
      the MIP measurement every week. The other group will perform upper extremity and trunk
      exercises combined with respiratory exercises at home for 7 days, twice a day for 15
      minutes.Patients will be evaluated before the training program and 8 weeks after the
      training. In the first evaluation, demographic information and clinical characteristics of
      the patients will be noted.In this study, upper and lower extremity exercise capacity,
      respiratory functions, peripheral muscle strength, dyspnea, fatigue, sleep quality, cognitive
      function, daily living activities, physical activity level, anxiety, depression, upper
      extremity and trunk exercises combined with inspiratory muscle training in patients with
      sarcoidosis and the impact on quality of life.

      Patients who are in stage II-III with sarcoidosis diagnosed pulmonary involvement who are
      admitted to the Department of Chest Diseases of Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty Hospital of
      Istanbul University will be included in the 30-70 age group 6 months after systemic treatment
      or no treatment. Patients with stages I and IV, malignancy, heart failure, orthopedic
      problems and who have to undergo systemic sarcoidosis treatment during the study will not be
      included in the study. Thirty-four patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be included
      in the study by signing the informed consent form. In the first evaluation, demographic
      information and clinical characteristics of the patients will be noted. Lower and upper
      extremity functional capacities of the patients before and after training will be evaluated
      with 6-minute walk test (6MWT), 6-minute step test (6DST), 6-minute pegboard ring test
      (6DPBRT) and 30-second sit-down test. Percentage values of FVC, FEV1, FEV1 / FVC, PEF, FEF
      (25-75%) parameters according to measured and expected values will be recorded by performing
      pulmonary function test. Respiratory muscle strength will be determined by measuring maximal
      inspiratory pressure (MRP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) with the intraoral pressure
      gauge. Dyspnea sensation Modified Borg and Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) scale,
      fatigue state Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), peripheral muscle strength hand dynamometer,
      quality of life George Respiratory Diseases Questionnaire (SGRQ), anxiety and depression
      status Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), physical activity level International
      Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short form (IPAQ-S), cognitive function Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment Scale (MOCA), daily living activities London Chest Daily Living Activities Scale
      and sleep quality will be evaluated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).
