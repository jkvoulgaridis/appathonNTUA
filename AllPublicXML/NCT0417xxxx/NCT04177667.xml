  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spermatozoa are vulnerable to lack of energy and oxidative stress as a result of elevated
      levels of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, it is essential that appropriate nutrients are
      available during maturation.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the effect of 6 months
      supplementation with carnitines and other micronutrients on sperm quality in 104 subjects
      with oligo- and/or astheno- and/or teratozoospermia with or without varicocele. Semen
      analyses were done at the beginning and end of the treatment. In addition to main analyses,
      post-hoc analyses for age and body mass index (BMI) were carried out. Results were
      interpreted by dividing the population into two age and BMI classes.
