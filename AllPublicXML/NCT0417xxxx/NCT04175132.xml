      A study to learn how foliglurax binds in regions of the brain
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study binding of foliglurax to mGlu4 receptors in human brain, up to 9 healthy subjects
      (Part A) and up to 8 patients with Parkinson's disease (Part B) will be injected with a
      liquid dose of a radiolabelled tracer that allows measurement of foliglurax binding in the
      brain to determine to which degree foliglurax binds to regions of the brain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part A:

          -  Healthy subjects

          -  The subject has a normal structural MRI (sMRI) scan performed in the screening period,
             as judged by the investigator.

          -  The subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, generally healthy based on the
             assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, body weight, ECG,
             and the results of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, serology, and
             other laboratory tests.

          -  The subject can tolerate confined spaces for prolonged periods of time.

          -  The subject is suitable for radial and/or brachial artery blood sampling and
             cannulation.

        Part B:

          -  Patients with Parkinson's disease

          -  The subject has a normal sMRI scan performed in the screening period, as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  The patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, fit for enrolment in the study
             based on the assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, body
             weight, ECG, and the results of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis,
             serology, and other laboratory tests.

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease for ≥3 years, with
             a current disease severity of 2 to 4 on the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale in the OFF
             state.

          -  The patient has dyskinesia that is not too severe to cause discomfort for the patient
             during PET imaging and predictable OFF time

          -  In addition to the above criteria, the patient must, in the opinion of the
             investigator, also be suitable for the study and the included PET imaging sessions.

          -  The patient has been receiving a stable regimen of levodopa-containing therapy (total
             levodopa dose ≤1600 mg per day) (≥3 doses per day of standard levodopa or ≥3 doses per
             day of carbidopa and levodopa, sustained-release tablets or extended-release capsules
             of carbidopa and levodopa or benserazide and levodopa), and be on a stable regimen of
             permitted anti-Parkinsonian drugs (peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors, dopamine
             agonists [except apomorphine], monoamine oxidase type B [MAO-B] inhibitors [except
             safinamide], or catechol-O-methyl transferase [COMT] inhibitors) for ≥4 weeks prior to
             foliglurax dosing

          -  The patient can tolerate confined spaces for prolonged periods of time

          -  The patient is suitable for radial and/or brachial artery blood sampling and
             cannulation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has any concurrent disorder that may affect the particular target or
             absorption, distribution, or elimination of the IMP

        Other inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.
