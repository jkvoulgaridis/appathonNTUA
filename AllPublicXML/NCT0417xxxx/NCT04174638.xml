      In the study, which will last for 4 months, the patients in the intervention group will
      receive pre-test and Motivational Interview and Education Based on Watson Human Care Model at
      the first interview. Patients will receive Motivational Interview Based on Watson Human Care
      Model at second interview after one month. Patients will receive Motivational Interview Based
      on Watson Human Care Model at third interview after one month. In the fourth interview and
      post-test after one month, patients will receive Motivational Interview Based on Watson Human
      Care Model. Finally, motivational interview and education based on Watson Human Care Model
      have an effect on adherence to treatment, satisfaction and quality of life in adults
