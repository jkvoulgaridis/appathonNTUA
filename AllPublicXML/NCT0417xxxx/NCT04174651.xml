    <measure>Change in time of spontaneous scratching</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Change in spontaneous scratching for behavioral only arms will be calculated by subtracting total duration of scratching behavior before and after the TSST and Landscape video.</description>

The participant will then be required to speak (job interview) for 4 minutes in front of 2 experimenters. After completion of the interview, participants will be asked to perform a mental arithmetic task for 4 minutes.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects and AD patients between 18 and 59 years of age.

          2. Healthy subjects: In general, good health without history of neurological and
             psychiatric diseases.

          3. AD patients: An average itch rating of 3 out of 10 or greater in the past two weeks
             using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).

          4. All patients will be required to cease use of oral antihistamines from the night
             before each study visit until the end of the experiment. The purpose is to avoid that
             participants fall asleep during MRI measurement due to side effect oral antihistamine
             (i.e., sedation).

          5. Women of child bearing potential will be administered a pregnancy test to verify that
             they are not pregnant.

          6. MRI Compatibility, criteria include having no major contraindication for MRI
             (pacemaker, vascular stents, metallic ear tubes, and absence of metal implants or
             braces) as assessed by MRI technologist using site approved screening form.

          7. Participants have to be able to speak and read English fluently.

          8. Participants must have signed a written informed consent before being enrolled in the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals under 18 or over 59 years of age.

          2. Inability to complete the required measures.

          3. Suffering from any disease state or physical condition, which would increase their
             health risk by study participation.

          4. Currently enrolled in any investigational study in which the subject is receiving any
             type of drug, biological, or non-drug therapy.

          5. Recent initiation (within last 3 months) of centrally acting agents such as
             antidepressants, neuroleptics or neuropathic medications.

          6. Patients who use centrally acting agents only when they need. The purpose is to avoid
             a risk of acute effect of these agents on brain activity and perceived stress due to
             the stress task.

          7. Current treatment with opioid analgesics.

          8. Uncontrolled thyroid disease.

          9. Use of illicit drugs or history of opiate addiction.

         10. Diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia, major depression or
             bipolar disorder that is active right now.

         11. Any known diseases or disorders that may affect conducting the experiments (e.g.,
             intracranial pathology, claustrophobia, severe respiratory or cardiovascular problems,
             active fibromyalgia) or diseases that have potential risks of infections (e.g., HIV,
             Hepatitis C, etc).

         12. Inability to speak and read English.

         13. Being pregnant.

         14. Incarcerated.
