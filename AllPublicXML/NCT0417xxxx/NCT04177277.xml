  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a survey of dialysis patients and staff to determine both the readiness of ESRD
      patients to use mHealth as well as the Readiness of the dialysis center staff (healthcare
      technicians, nurses and administrative staff) to utilize mHealth in order to assist patients
      who may have barriers to do so for themselves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional observational study. Approximately 700 ESRD patients currently on
      dialysis will be recruited from Satellite In-Center (Hemodialysis) and WellBound (Home
      Dialysis) Centers in the US. These will include centers in Texas, Tennessee, and California.
      In addition, about 100 dialysis staff will be recruited to complete a staff mHealth
      Questionnaire.

      Patients and staff will be asked questions that conform to Khatun's conceptual model.

        -  Technological readiness:

             -  Availability of the devices and internet

             -  Ability to use the devices

        -  Human resource readiness:

             -  Socio-demographics

             -  Awareness of mHealth services

        -  Motivational readiness

             -  Concerns (cost/privacy/ other)

             -  Attitudes/intentions: Current use or potential for use.
