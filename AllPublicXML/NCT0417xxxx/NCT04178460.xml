  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase Ib dose escalation and expansion
      clinical study to assess the safety and antitumor activity of niraparib in combination with
      MGD013 in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who failed prior treatment.

      The dose escalation phase of the study will explore several dose levels of Niraparib in
      combination with MGD013, followed by an expansion phase of the study at the MTD to further
      assess the combination in terms of the safety and anti-tumor activity.
