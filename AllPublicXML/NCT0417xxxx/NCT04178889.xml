  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have had curative treatment for lung cancer are at an increased risk of
      developing second primary lung cancers (and other cancers) over the next 10 years. Doctors
      need to develop better ways of monitoring patients during follow up so we can intervene as
      quickly as possible with further treatments. Measuring DNA in the blood which has come from
      the tumour, so called circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), may be one way to do this.

      This is a multi-centre, observational basic science study to follow patient who have
      undergone radical treatment, surgery or radiotherapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
      between two and five years previously. Following consent, participants will be asked to
      provide blood samples every six months for up to the next five years. Information from their
      routine clinical care, including information from any imaging, diagnostic tissue samples and
      blood tests will be collected. We will also request access to any original surplus diagnostic
      material, as well as future, excess tissue from diagnostic samples.

      Blood samples will be analysed using various new scientific techniques looking to correlate
      emergence of new primary cancer (or recurrence of original NSCLC) with blood based markers.

      Blood samples will be processed and separated into various components for storage, before
      batched analysis.

      Consent will be sought for the sample components to be kept for up to 15 years following the
      end of the study.
