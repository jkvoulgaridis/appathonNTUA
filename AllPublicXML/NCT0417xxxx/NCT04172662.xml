  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate possible effects of music therapy as an adjunct in an invasive
      cardiac procedure where infected or broken pacemaker leads, or leads from implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillators are removed from inside the heart through the vein. The procedure
      is performed in local anaesthesia with the patient awake. Analgesic and anxiolytic drugs are
      given at the start of the procedure, and repeated if needed. In spite of the drugs, most
      patients will experience som degree of pain and/or anxiety and increased stress during the
      procedure. The music therapy intervention contains individually facilitated music listening
      and coping techniques, aiming to regulate stress responses. The music listening and guidance
      is provided by a certified music therapist before, during and after the invasive procedure.

    <description>The patient gets a preparatory session with the music therapist one day before the invasive procedure, where individual assessment is made based on a biopsychosocial approach. Sequences of facilitated Music listening is provided during the pre-, peri and postoperative phase, and a closing dialog performed postoperatively. Patient-preferred music is chosen from a limited set of playlists provided on the app The Music Star.</description>
