  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery involves replacing milky lens with a plastic intraocular lens. This plastic
      lens can be either monofocal (fixates for distance or near without glasses), extended depth
      of focus (EDOF)(fixates for intermediate and distance vision only without glasses) or
      multifocal lenses (fixates for distance, intermediate and near vision without glasses).
      However, EDOF and multifocal lenses are known to produce glare and halos. Tecnis Eyhance
      (Johnson &amp; Johnson, USA) is a monofocal IOL which give added intermediate vision without
      employing EDOF or multifocal technology and hence induces no glare and halos. Whereas
      monofocal IOLs such as RayOne do not give intermediate vision. The objective is to assess
      visual and optical performance of Tecnis Eyhance versus Rayner RayOne in a prospective,
      randomized, comparative bilateral study. The proposed study will be the first study comparing
      the new technology monofocal Eyhance with conventional RayOne Rayner lens to assess the added
      benefits of Eyhance technology at multiple visits until 3 months after the surgery. Patients
      attending the clinics with cataracts will be invited to participate in this randomised study.
      They will be randomised to receive either Eyhance or RayOne in both eyes through surgeries
      performed not more than 2 weeks apart. The patients will be followed up at 1 and 3 months in
      the research clinic to assess the uniocular and binocular vision, spectacle prescription, a
      simple non-invasive scan to look at any distortions in the optics of the eye (wavefront
      aberrometry) and questionnaire for assessing subjective outcomes, glare and halos.

      Study design:

      Prospective, randomised, comparative study assessing visual and optical outcomes after
      bilateral implantation of the new Johnson &amp; Johnson Tecnis Eyhance versus monofocal Rayner
      RayOne in patients undergoing routine cataract surgery.

      Methodology:

      Suitable patients with cataracts in both eyes will be identified from cataract assessment
      clinics. They will be invited to participate in the study by the research nurse and handed
      over the patient information sheet and a consent form. The PI will consent the patient for
      the participation. If they agree to participate, they will be give the dates for their
      surgeries on the same day. The patients can choose to have both eyes done on the same day or
      two eyes within 2 weeks based on the patients convenience. If they chose to participate in
      the study, then the patient will have additional tests performed on the day of their cataract
      assessment clinic. This will take an additional 40 minutes.

      On the day of the surgery, the patients will be randomised using a computer generated
      randomisation to receive either Tecnis Eyhance or the Rayner RayOne lens. They will have the
      same lens in both eyes. The patients will be invited for a research follow up visit at 1
      (between 30-37 days after 2nd eye surgery) and 3 months (90-100 days after 2nd eye surgery)
      were simple research tests will performed including vision assessment and a scan.

      At preoperative visit and 3 months the patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire.
