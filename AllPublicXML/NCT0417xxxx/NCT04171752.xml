  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly, pharmacokinetics is altered. Gastric juice pH is elevated which influences
      drug solubility and absorption. Drug distribution is decreased in the elderly because of
      decreased cardiac output, increased peripheral vascular resistance, diminished blood flow in
      the liver and the kidneys, reduced total amount of water in the body. Drug metabolism and
      biotransformation mainly take place in the liver and is often reduced. Drug elimination is
      altered very often because of reduced excretory (renal and hepatic) function. All these
      changes may lead to significant pharmacokinetic changes in geriatric population. A formal
      pharmacokinetic clinical study is being conducted in order to assess the need of dose
      adjustment in the elderly population.
