  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is highly prevalent in children and adolescents, up to one in four children will
      develop pain that persists or recurs for three or more months. Chronic pain is not only
      linked to significant psychological, physical, and social concerns for affected children and
      their families, but also places an enormous burden on healthcare systems - in the United
      States, chronic pain costs around $19.5 billion dollars each year and ranks among the most
      expensive pediatric health problems. Chronic pain significantly decreases quality of life and
      is associated with numerous missing days at school or at work.

      Several interventions exist, however, for some, the risk-benefit profile is not favorable, or
      the effect sizes are small and the clinical effect can be questioned. In general, a
      multidisciplinary approach that includes medical, psychological, and physiological aspects
      has been shown to be most promising in the treatment of chronic pain in children and
      adolescents.

      Clinical impressions suggest that an Animal-assisted Therapy (AAT) intervention could be
      promising, but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the
      effectiveness of an AAT intervention for children and adolescents with chronic pain. With
      this pragmatic trials investigators aim to investigate the pre- and post-intervention
      differences in pain levels, levels of emotional distress, and quality of life within
      participants with chronic pain.
