    <textblock>
      Background: Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience and in its
      chronic form, pain is highly prevalent, up to 25% of children and adolescents are affected by
      it. The exact etiology of many forms of chronic pain remains unknown. One mechanism that has
      been proposed to underlie increased pain sensitivity is central sensitization, i.e.,
      increased efficacy of the nervous system in transmitting pain signals, which manifests itself
      as a lower pain threshold. A lower pain threshold in turn has been recognized as a risk
      factor for the development of chronic pain. Being more sensitive to pain is one feature
      commonly shared by those with high sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), who are thought to
      react more strongly to both positive and negative environmental influences. The relationship
      between this increased sensitivity and pain tolerance has not been studied to date, but could
      contribute to our understanding of why some children and adolescents are more vulnerable to
      developing chronic pain than others.

      Objectives and Aims: The aim of this project is to increase scientific understanding of 1)
      the distribution and correlates of high SPS among children and adolescents suffering from
      chronic pain, and 2) whether the trait of SPS can help explain increased pain sensitivity and
      hence vulnerability for chronic pain.

      Methods: To determine the distribution (aim 1a) and correlates (aim 1b) of SPS among a
      population of children and adolescents suffering from chronic pain, an online survey will be
      conducted. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about their SPS as well as
      pain history and pain characteristics. The distribution of SPS will then be compared to an
      existing distribution in a sample of healthy children and adolescents.
