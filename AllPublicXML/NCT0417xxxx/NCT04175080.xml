  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity sarcopenia, characterized by the coexistence of excess fat and muscle mass reduction,
      may contribute to the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure
      with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The project will examine the impact of selected
      circulating miRNAs on processes that may form the pathophysiological basis for HFpEF
      development and obesity sarcopenia in correlation with biochemical markers, echocardiographic
      assessment and non-invasive assessment of hemodynamic parameters. In addition, the impact of
      LDL and HDL on these diseases will be assessed. Determinations of selected adipokines and
      asymmetric dimethylarginine will also be carried out and their effects on the cardiovascular
      system will be assessed.
