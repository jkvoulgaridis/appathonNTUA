  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the major complications of posterior fossa surgery is Posterior Fossa Syndrome (PFS).
      This syndrome is due to a possible complication of surgical excision of a tumor of the
      cerebellum (4th ventricle) and is characterized by transient postoperative mutism,
      dysarthria, behavioral, and affective disorders, as well as motor disorders. PFS is thought
      to be related to axonal lesions. The long-term consequences on the cognitive and psychosocial
      sphere of PFS have been widely documented. On the other hand, the literature concerning the
      consequences of this syndrome on language is much restricted. Beyond the language, the role
      of cerebellum would be central in cognition, some authors even comparing it to a great
      &quot;conductor&quot; who would underlie the learning of most motor and cognitive automatisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physiopathology and the anatomo-functional correlates of motor, cognitive, and language
      functions after surgery of PF tumors are still rare and little known. The objective of this
      study is to analyze them via morphometric MRI analysis and functional and structural
      connectivity in children away from PF surgery, coupled with clinical data analysis.

    <description>Review and compare, in MRI, the structural and functional cerebellar-hemispheric connectives. The primary endpoint the analysis of fMRI brain mapping in accordance to the relations with the motor functions (balance and dexterity), cognitive, behavioral/social cognition and language after treatment for a child's posterior fossa tumor (with or without posterior fossa syndrome) and, in comparison with matched control group on age, sex and level study. The MRI data will be the subject of a specific statistical treatment, via dedicated software, which will be implemented under the control of the investigators who have conducted such an fMRI analysis in previous studies. Various brain mapping can be established from the data collected. It may include statistical comparisons between different preselected regions, and different experimental conditions, or correlation studies between brain activation and clinical parameters.</description>

The Quality of Life questionnaire PedsQL 4.0 is composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions. Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. In order to get a total score we must sum all the items scores over the number of items answered on all the scales. If more than 50% of the items in the scale are missing, the scale scores should not be computed.</description>
