  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the effects of intramuscular diaphragm stimulation (pacing) and
      test the hypothesis that diaphragm pacing enhances neuromuscular diaphragm activation and
      respiratory function in adults with cervical spinal cord injuries (C-SCIs). The investigators
      will test the hypothesis by recording activity of the diaphragm from intramuscular pacing
      electrodes and conduct respiratory assessments in adults with intramuscular diaphragm pacing
      electrodes following acute, traumatic C-SCIs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory dysfunction is a leading cause of death in individuals with spinal cord injuries
      (SCIs). Nearly one-quarter of all SCI cases involve injury to the upper spinal cord segments
      which impairs neural activation of the diaphragm muscle and compromises breathing. Although
      mechanical ventilation can be life-saving after cervical SCI (C-SCI), it also triggers rapid
      and profound diaphragm muscle atrophy, thereby complicating (or even preventing) ventilator
      weaning. Intramuscular diaphragm stimulation, or diaphragm pacing, was developed to replace
      long-term ventilator support and is now used acutely post C-SCI (&lt;4 months following injury)
      to promote ventilator weaning. This study will assess the effects of diaphragm stimulation on
      respiratory neural drive and breathing function in individuals with acute, traumatic C-SCI.
      Recording from these surgically implanted electrodes allows comparisons of electromyogram
      (EMG) recordings, in association with respiratory assessments, before and after short periods
      of diaphragm pacing to isolate the unique contribution of diaphragm pacing on neuromuscular
      diaphragm activation.

    <description>Neuromuscular activation of the diaphragm will be assessed by recording diaphragm EMGs from the surgically-implanted intramuscular stimulating electrodes. This approach will allow for comparisons of EMG recordings across time. EMGs will be recorded during non-stimulated respiration (diaphragm pacer turned off) and simultaneously with assessments of respiratory function.</description>

    <description>The Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) is measured by a device that applies an inspiratory load which provides a resistance. The MIP will be measured in cmH20 and assesses diaphragm strength. MIP will be recorded will be recorded during non-stimulated respiration (diaphragm pacer turned off).</description>

    <description>Intramuscular stimulation of the diaphragm, or diaphragm &quot;pacing' is achieved by laparoscopic placement of stimulation wires into each hemidiaphragm. Phrenic motor points on the diaphragm are mapped to optimize electrode placement. The electrodes are threaded into the diaphragm muscle and wire leads are externalized and attached to a stimulation controller.</description>
