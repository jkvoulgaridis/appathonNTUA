    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profiles,
      immunogenicity of GB222 in Chinese patients with relapsed/progressive high-grade glioma;
      moreover, changes in cerebral edema, changes in KPS score from baseline, objective response
      rate (ORR), 4-month progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)will be evaluated.
      The dose reduction of hormone during continuous administration period will be observed.
