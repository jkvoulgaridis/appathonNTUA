      Meridian system is the pathway of transporting qi and blood, and that distributes all the
      body. Meridian system connects to internal visceral organs interior, and also connects to
      joints (or acupoint) exterior. The relationship among meridian, acupoints and internal
      visceral organs is still unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to
      investigate the relationship among meridian, acupoints and internal visceral organs. Total 33
      subjects randomly finished three sessional studies as follows: 1) sham electroacupuncture
      (EA) session: the stainless steels acupuncture needles inserted into the subcutaneous layer
      of Zusanli (cathode) and Shangjuxu acupints (anion) , and the needles connected to EA
      stimulator, but no electric discharge for 30 min; 2) Zusanli session: the acupuncture needles
      inserted into Zusanli (cathode) and Shangjuxu acupoints (anion), and twisting obtain qi, and
      the needles then connected to EA stimulator, the frequency was 2 Hz, the duration was 30 min,
      and the intensity was visual slightly muscle contraction; 3) Shaohai session: the methods
      were identical Zusanli group, but Shaohai acupoint (cathode), and 3 cm below Shaohai (anion)
      . The major outcome measure was the changes of the percentage of gastric slow wave and
      dysrhythmia in 30 min electrogastrogram recordings, and the changes of cardiac output and
      stroke volume in 30 min recordings. Secondary outcome measure was the changes of saliva,
      blood and urine metabolites.

      The investigators predict the results of the present study can test and verify meridian
      theory of traditional Chinese Medicine, meridian system connects internal visceral organ
      interior, and connects joint (or acupoint) exterior.
