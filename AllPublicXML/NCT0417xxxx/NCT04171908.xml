  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video games based on VR technology are emerging as valid tools used in neurorehabilitation
      for patients with neurological disorders, and as a low cost and easily accepted adjunct to
      traditional therapy. Standard games such as the Nintendo Wii, Playstation Move and Kinect
      plus XBOX 360 have been used in PD rehabilitation. However, often these are either too
      difficult for patients or the games progress too quickly, failing to provide
      impairment-focused training or specifically address patients' needs [10]. Therefore, it is
      necessary to develop specific serious games for PD patients. Serious games are defined as
      games designed for a primary purpose other than that of pure entertainment, and which promote
      learning and behavior changes for PD patients. In this context, new low-cost markerless
      devices have emerged, such as the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) System®, which uses a sensor
      that captures the movement of the patient's forearms and hands without the need to place
      sensors or devices on the body. This generates a virtual image of the upper limbs on a
      computer screen and the patient is prompted to perform movements according to the functional
      task proposed. This system presents important advantages over other motion capture systems,
      namely thanks to its portability, ease of use, commercial availability, low cost and
      non-invasive nature. However, evidence is lacking that supports the therapeutic use of LMC in
      the treatment of upper limb (UL) motor disorders in EM.

    <description>Hand-held dynamometer: it is an instrument to measure the maximumisometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. It consists of a sealed hydraulic system with adjustable hand spacing that measures hand grip force. The strength reading can be viewed as pounds or kilograms.Thedynamometer is used for testing the hand grip force and for tracking the grip strength improvements during rehabilitation.</description>

    <measure>Box and blocks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Coordination test: to measure unilateral gross manual dexterity in both the less and more affected side. The BBT consists of moving the maximum number of blocks from one compartment of a box to another, one by one, within one minute. The BBT is a quick, simple, and reliable measurement of manual dexterity. Its administration procedure is standardized and its validity has been shown in elderly subjects with upper limb disability</description>

    <measure>The Purdue Pegboard Test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motricity: to assess coordination, speed of movement and fine motor dexterity. The PPT features a board with two columns with 25 holes each and a specific number of pins, washers and collars placed in four containers across the top of the board. The test consists of inserting as many pins as possible in three distinct phases, with a time limit of 30 s for each. First, the test is performed with the less affected side, then with the more affected side, then with both hands at the same time and, finally, an assembly test is performed (60 s). The number of pins inserted is subsequently recorded.</description>

    <measure>Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motricity: It is a hand function test, which consists of a plastic peg board (25.0 cm × 12.7 cm × 2.3 cm) with nine holes (2.54 cm between the holes) and nine pegs (3.2 cm long, 0.64 cm wide). The participant had to put the nine pegs in the peg board as fast as possible, one at the time with one hand only, and remove them again. The test was performed two times per hand, with the non-affected hand first. The time it takes to fulfill the second trial with the more-affected hand was used for the analysis</description>

    <measure>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) was used to evaluate the satisfaction of health service users for both groups. This is a self-administered post-treatment questionnaire, comprising eight items which evaluate the level of satisfaction regarding the care and quality of the service received and the level of fulfillment of the patient's expectations regarding the treatment administered. The total score of the questionnaire is 32 points, with higher values meaning higher satisfaction with the treatment received</description>
