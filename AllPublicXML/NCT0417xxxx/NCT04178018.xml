  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to validate if photoacoustic imaging potentially reduces benign
      surgeries without compromising cancer detection sensitivity. The study will also explore
      whether using the photoacoustic imaging/ultrasound technique has any potential with early
      ovarian cancer detection in a group of high risk patients.

      In primary and secondary objectives, the investigators will consent patients who are at risk
      for ovarian cancer, or who have an ovarian mass possibly suggestive of a malignancy and are
      counseled to undergo oophorectomy. Patients will be identified by the GYN physicians and
      consented by the study coordinator prior to the date of the scheduled surgical procedure.

      In exploratory objectives, the investigators will consent patients who are at risk for
      ovarian cancer and wish to be followed within one or two years before making decision to
      undergo prophylactic oophorectomy. Patients will be identified based on the eligibility
      criteria by the physicians and consented by the study coordinator prior to the follow up
      studies.

          -  All patients, 18 years or older, referred to the Washington University School of
             Medicine for conditions necessitating surgery to include at least a unilateral
             oophorectomy.

          -  Willingness to participate in the study and able to provide informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria for Exploratory Outcome Measures -Willingness to participate in the
        monitoring study before risk reduction oophorectomy. --Premenopausal women with a
        documented deleterious mutation in one of the following ovarian cancer genes: BRCA1, BRCA2,
        BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, BARD1, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2, or EPCAM.

        *Menopause is defined as ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea. However, for those patients with ≥ 12
        months of amenorrhea who may be pre-menopausal, levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol in the
        pre-menopausal range will be acceptable. Patients age will be in the range of 30 to 50
        years old.

    <ipd_description>Sharing of data collected by this project is essential to gain knowledge on how to improve and manage the current standard of care on high-risk and ovarian cancer patients.
The investigators will share data through multiple channels including:
Publication of results and findings at various stages in peer-reviewed journals
Presentation of results and findings at national and international conferences
Public access to data collected from this project upon reasonable request when the study is completed.</ipd_description>
