  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized controlled trial in which investigators determine the efficacy of
      tranexamic acid (TA) by mesotherapy in comparison to normal saline on participants having
      Melasma.

    <textblock>
      In this prospective single blind split face controlled trial.Total 30 patients referred to
      Dermatology Ward were selected. At first, patients were examined under wood lamp for
      determination of melasma type (epidermal, dermal). Then, patients underwent Tranexamic acid
      microinjections with a concentration of TA 4 mg/ml with 0.9 % normal saline on their left
      half of the face and only 0.9%normal saline on their right half of the face, with mesotherapy
      technique. This procedure was done total of six times with 2‐week intervals. Participants
      were assessed by Hemi Modified Melasma Area and Severity Scoring (mMASI) at start and end of
      the study for each half of face. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) , version 23
      was used for analysis. P value &lt; 0.01 was taken significant.

    <measure>Change in HEMI-Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Calculation of Hemi mMASI score is performed by rating darkness and area of involvement of 3 areas of the each half of face. These figures are then inserted into an equation, resulting in the final Hemi mMASI score for both halves of face. Equation : forehead (0.15×D×A) + malar ( 0.30×D×A) + chin ( 0.05×D×A) The mean value of the data obtained from each half of the face was calculated and the mean percentage change was compared. Hemi-MASI score was used because of the study design of split-face, and it was calculated based on the percentage of the involved area Improvement was considered when there was reduction in mean hemi modified MASI score at both sides of face. Higher score was considered as worse and low score was considered as good in improvement of melasma.
At each follow-up visit, adverse events were also evaluated. Patients were asked to reports side effects such as erythema, burning, swelling, and change in menstrual cycle during and after treatment.</description>
