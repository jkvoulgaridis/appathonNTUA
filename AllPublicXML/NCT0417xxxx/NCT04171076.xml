    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation has been used to treat gait problems in Parkinson's disease, with
      positive results along some studies. The use of non-invasive stimulation can be an
      alternative to stimulate the spinal corn.

      Spinal cord stimulation has been used to treat gait problems in Parkinson's disease, with
      positive results along some studies. The use of non-invasive stimulation can be an
      alternative to stimulate the spinal corn. In this pilot trial, the investigators recruit
      participants with Parkinson' disease and freezing of gait. The aim of the study is to explore
      the safety along the non-invasive magnetic thoracic spinal cord stimulation as well the
      effect on gait problems, especially freezing of gait, prospectively, in an open-label
      fashion.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Freezing of gait score</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the freezing of gait score. 12-item scale, each item scores 3 points at maximum; the score ranges from 0-36; higher scores mean higher severity</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed measured through the time to up and go - It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk ten meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Freezing of gait questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The freezing of gait questionnaire assess the freezing of gait severity in 9-item scale ( ranging from 0-28 points); higher score mean higher severity</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of the intervention - urinary incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of Patients self report problems: urinary incontinence. The urinary incontinence will be measure through the Revised Urinary Incontinence Scale, ranging from 0 to 16. Higher scores mean higher the urinary symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of the intervention - lower limb strength.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of Patients self report problems: worsening in gait due to weakness. The lower limb strength will be measure through the neurologic exam. The force degree ranges from 0 - none, to 5 - normal strength.</description>
