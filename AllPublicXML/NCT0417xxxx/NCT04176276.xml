  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in
      western countries and its incidence is worryingly increasing worldwide. Cardiovascular
      disease shows a continuous relationship with declining of renal function in type 2 diabetes
      patients. Moreover, there is a strong evidence of all-cause mortality risk excess even in
      patients with early stages kidney disease.

      MicroRNA (miRNA) are small non-coding RNA molecules, containing 21-25 nucleotides, that
      modulate post-transcriptional gene expressions. In the past years many human miRNAs involved
      in the pathogenesis of renal disease have been discovered, such as miR-192, miR-194, miR-204
      and miR-25. Among these, miR-192 and miR-25, are receiving greater attention while it seems
      that they play a role in glomerulosclerosis and renal fibrosis. However too few data are
      available in large publish trials among patients with renal impairment and the role of serum
      and urinary levels of miR-192 and miR-25 in people with preserved renal function remain
      unclear.

      To evaluate the association between serum and urinary expression of miR-192 and miR-25 and
      renal function (according to different extent of renal impairment) in patients with or
      without type 2 diabetes.

      The day of the study patients undergo a routine clinical evaluation. Whole blood samples are
      collected from an antecubital vein to assess serum/plasma aliquots of 200 μl each (frozen at
      -80°C until required for quantitation) for evaluation of biochemical parameters (fasting
      glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, serum creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes, liver function
      enzymes, albumin) and determination of serum miR-192 and miR-25.

      Two urine samples will be also collected to assess aliquots of 200 μl each (frozen at -80°C
      until required for quantitation) for determination of albumin:creatinine ratio and urine
      expression of miR-192 and miR-25.
