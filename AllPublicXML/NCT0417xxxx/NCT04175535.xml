  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cervical decompression and fusion is the standard procedure for operation of
      cervical disc herniations. Mobility-preserving Full-Endoscopic Cervical Posterior discectomy
      is the most common alternative in the case of soft localization of the pathology. Endoscopic
      techniques are considered standard in many areas, since they may offer advantages in surgical
      technique and rehabilitation. These days, all disc herniations can be operated in
      full-endoscopic technique. With the full-endoscopic posterior cervical discectomy a
      procedures is available for cervical disc operations.

      Investigators conducted a differential, randomized, 1:1, double-blind clinical control trial
      to compare the clinical effect, safety and feasibility of Full-Endoscopic Cervical Posterior
      discectomy and Anterior cervical decompression and fusion. The study was conducted in three
      centers at the same time, including the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University
      Medical College, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital and Ningbo University Medical College
      Affiliated Hospital. This study is expected to include 308 patients with single level soft
      cervical disc herniation.Participants were randomly assigned to different groups for
      corresponding surgical intervention after complete preoperative evaluation.Participants
      received a standard 5-year follow-up procedure
