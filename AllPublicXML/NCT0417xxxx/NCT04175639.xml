    <textblock>
      The efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) behavioral cancer pain intervention designed to
      decrease pain and disability for breast cancer patients in medically underserved areas has
      not been investigated. The long-term goal of this work is to use mHealth technologies to
      facilitate wide-spread implementation of an efficacious behavioral cancer pain intervention -
      a non-pharmacological approach to pain management. The proposed project's objective is to
      demonstrate the efficacy of an innovative mobile health Pain Coping Skills Training
      (mPCST-Community) designed to meet the needs of breast cancer patients with pain in medically
      underserved areas. mPCST-Community addresses intervention barriers for patients in medically
      underserved areas as it is delivered with video-conferencing in the patients' community based
      oncology clinic by a remote therapist, is extended to the patients' home environment using
      simple mHealth technology, and is low-literacy adapted. The central hypothesis is that
      mPCST-Community will result in decreased pain compared to a mHealth education attention
      control group (mHealth-Ed). The rationale of this proposal is that if mPCST-Community is
      shown to be efficacious it will rapidly increase intervention access for individuals who
      receive their oncology care in medically underserved areas and ultimately reduce pain-related
      suffering. Guided by strong preliminary data, a randomized controlled trial will be used to
      pursue three specific aims: 1) Test the extent to which the mPCST-Community intervention
      reduces pain, fatigue, disability, and distress, 2) Examine self-efficacy and pain
      catastrophizing as mediators through which the mPCST-Community leads to reductions in pain,
      fatigue, disability, and distress, and 3) To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
      mPCST-Community. For Aim 1, based on the study team's extensive work demonstrating the
      efficacy of in-person pain coping skills training protocols and pilot work showing promise
      for mPCST-Community, it is expected that mPCST-Community will lead to decreased pain as well
      as fatigue, disability, and distress compared to mHealth-Ed. For Aim 2, it is expected that
      the effects of mPCST-Community will be mediated by increased self-efficacy for pain control
      and decreased pain catastrophizing. For Aim 3, it is expected that mPCST-Community will
      demonstrate cost-effectiveness as assessed by all-cause medical resource use, participant and
      therapist time, and health utilities as well as successful overall accrual, high subject
      retention, and high intervention adherence.

      Guided by extensive prior work, the investigators have designed an innovative mHealth
      behavioral pain coping skills training (PCST) intervention to reduce pain and disability in
      cancer patients in medically underserved areas (mPCST-Community). Our prior work has tested
      PCST protocols through in-person sessions at major medical centers where resources and
      literacy levels are relatively high. mPCST-Community is different and innovative; it uses
      mHealth technology (e.g., videoconferencing) to decrease access barriers for patients in
      medically underserved areas. The protocol is brief (4 sessions) and delivered in the
      community clinic by a remote well-trained pain therapist. Importantly, this protocol has been
      carefully adapted for low literacy patients.Beverly Thorn, PhD, a nationally recognized
      expert in strategies for adapting pain coping interventions to low literacy, medically
      underserved patients, was instrumental in developing the mPCST-Community protocol.
      mPCST-Community extends to the patient's daily life through use of a simple mobile
      application that provides low literacy text/audio protocol summaries, relaxation audio, daily
      assessment and personalized feedback, and coping messaging.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of the
      developed mPCST-Community protocol in breast cancer patients with pain receiving cancer care
      in medically underserved areas (N=180). The investigators have done careful and extensive
      pilot work to prepare for the proposed trial. Our pilot work (Journal of Psychosocial
      Oncology) was conducted in breast cancer patients with pain in three medically underserved
      rural community clinics. First, focus group data (3 groups; n=19) were used to further refine
      the adapted protocol. Second, the mPCST-Community protocol was evaluated in a single-arm
      trial with 20 patients. The invesitgators found high feasibility (i.e., recruitment met), low
      attrition and high adherence (90% completion), and high acceptability. Importantly,
      impressive and positive pre- to post-intervention changes were found for pain severity
      (t=-2.52, p=0.01,gav=0.62; 30% change), pain interference (t=-2.62,p=0.01, gav=0.62), and
      self-efficacy for pain management (t=3.57, p=0.0004, gav=0.98; 30% change).8Study specific
      aims are:

      Aim 1:Test the extent to which mPCST-Community reduces breast cancer patients' pain severity
      (primary outcome), pain interference, fatigue, physical disability, and psychological
      distress. Hypothesis:mPCST-Community will lead to decreases in these pain-related outcomes
      compared to a Health-Ed control condition.

      Aim 2:Examine mediators through which mPCST-Community leads to benefits. Hypothesis:The
      effects of mPCST-Community on pain severity, pain interference, fatigue, physical disability,
      and psychological distress will be mediated by increased self-efficacy for pain management
      and decreased pain catastrophizing.

      Aim 3:Evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of mPCST-Community. Hypothesis:
      mPCST-Community will be cost-saving or cost effective in terms of its incremental cost per
      quality-adjusted life-year from a societal perspective, inclusive of healthcare, intervention
      and patient-time costs. Its sustainability will be further demonstrated by documenting
      successful accrual, retention, and protocol adherence.
