  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of two pain control pathways following routine
      orthopaedic surgical procedures (single level or two-level ACDF/ACDA, 1st CMC arthroplasty,
      Hallux Valgus/Rigidus corrections, diagnostic knee arthroscopies, total hip arthroplasty, and
      total shoulder arthroplasty / reverse total shoulder arthroplasty). The control group will
      undergo surgery with an opioid-based pain protocol and the intervention group will undergo
      surgery with a multimodal, opioid-free protocol.

      Patients will have data collected with respect to pain scores, overall comfort level, overall
      satisfaction with the surgical experience and recovery, constipation, falls, and overall
      satisfaction with pain control, in addition to procedure-specific outcome scores and
      patient-specific metrics.

    <description>The opioid-based arm utilizes traditional, standard-of-care treatment for each applicable surgery. The medications (including dosage and frequency) used in this arm vary depending on the surgery being performed; however, tend to include medications in the opioid family such as Hydromorphone, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, or Oxycodone.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The opioid-free arm utilizes medications that do not belong to the opioid family of medications. All medications used are FDA-approved and no experimental medications are being used. The medications (including dosage and frequency) used in this arm vary depending on the surgery being performed; however, tend to include medications such as Gabapentin, Tylenol, Meloxicam, Bupivacaine, or Ketorolac.</description>
