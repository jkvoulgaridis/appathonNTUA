  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is a frequently used biomarker of the systemic
      inflammatory response and is considered one of the most sensitive markers of inflammation.
      Many studies have documented the association between the use of opioid drugs in the acute
      phase -as it can be considered the use during general anesthesia- and the increase of the NLR
      value. Such increase could determine a temporary phase of immunodepression in the immediate
      post operative period with consequent increase of the inflammatory state.

      This study intends to assess whether different anesthetic techniques can be associated with
      different variations of the intra-patient NLR value between pre- and post-surgery. Patient
      will be randomized to receive either local regional anesthesia protocols with thoracic wall
      blocks (PEC I and serratus plane block) associated with opioid-free general anesthesia (PECS
      + Opioid-free GA) or general anesthesia.

For the PEC I: infiltration of 10 ml of local anesthetic (Levobupivacaine 0.25% or Ropivacaine 0.5%) between the bands of the pectoralis major muscle and the small pectoralis muscle at the height of the third rib on the anterior axillary line.
