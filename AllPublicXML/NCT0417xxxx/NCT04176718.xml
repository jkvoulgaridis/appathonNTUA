          -  Patient has a history of significant cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine,
             gastrointestinal, respiratory, or inflammatory illness that could preclude study

             failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class 3 or 4); unstable angina; cardiac
             arrhythmia; recent (within the preceding 6 months) myocardial infarction or stroke;

             volume [FEV] in 1 second &lt;60% of predicted normal), known moderate or severe
             persistent asthma within 2 years prior to study registration (intermittent asthma is
             allowed). Patient with known or suspected COPD or asthma must have an FEV1 test within
             28 days prior to study registration.

          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to C1D1.

          -  Patient has any other medical, psychiatric, or social condition that would preclude
             participation in the study, pose an undue medical hazard, interfere with the conduct
             of the study, or interfere with interpretation of the study results.

          -  Toxicity from previous anticancer therapy must resolve to baseline levels or to grade
             ≤1, except for alopecia and peripheral neuropathy.
