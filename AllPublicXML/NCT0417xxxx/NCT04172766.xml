  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Apple Hearing Study is a partnership between the University of Michigan and Apple to
      study sound exposure and its impact on hearing health. This groundbreaking study will advance
      the understanding of how hearing could be impacted over time by exposure to sound at certain
      levels. The investigators will measure headphone and environmental sound exposures over time
      among participants, and determine how these exposures impact hearing and stress levels. US
      residents who own an iPhone, download the Apple Research app and consent to participate will
      be randomly assigned to two groups, one with a &quot;Basic&quot; user interface in the Research app,
      and one with an &quot;Advanced&quot; user interface. Users in the &quot;Advanced&quot; group will receive
      additional information about their exposures and be given additional surveys and hearing
      tests based on their music and environmental sound exposures. The study will provide
      investigators with a better understanding of listening behavior and its overall impact on
      hearing health. This information will in turn help guide public health policy and prevention
      programs designed to protect and promote hearing health in the US and globally.

    <description>Participants in the second (&quot;Advanced&quot;) group will have a UI that includes notifications prompting personal data pattern review in the Health app and then prompting to do an abbreviated Pure Tone Audiometry module completed 0-24 hours after loud headphone audio level exposure (equivalent continuous average noise level, or LEQ, to &gt;97 A-weighted decibels, or dBA for &gt;30 minutes) to evaluate for a temporary threshold shift from baseline.</description>

  <intervention>

    <intervention_name>Advanced</intervention_name>
    <description>&quot;Advanced&quot; group users will receive prompts when an acutely high headphone audio level exposure (LEQ equivalent to &gt;97 dBA for &gt;30 minutes) occurs. Those in the WatchOS arm will be prompted when their weekly environmental sound level (7-day LEQ equivalent to &gt;80 dBA for &gt;40 hrs) is high. Either prompt will occur via notification, and will request that the participant review exposure data in the Research app and answer questions related to their exposure. The survey will ask for confirmation that they reviewed the exposure data and perceive it as accuracy, whether or not they used any hearing protection (e.g., ear plugs worn at a rock concert), and any intended listening behavior change resulting from their data review. To minimize notification burden for participants, exposure notification events will occur no more than twice per month. At this same frequency, they will be asked to take an abbreviated audiogram to test for temporary threshold shifts in their hearing level.</description>
