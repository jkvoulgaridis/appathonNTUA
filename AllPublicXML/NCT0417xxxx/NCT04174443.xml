  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia is a very painful condition, and radiofrequency therapy is reserved for
      patients who are resistant or intolerant to pharmacological therapy. Continuous
      radiofrequency and pulsed radiofrequency both have advantages and disadvantages. Recently,
      studies have found that pulsed radiofrequency combined with low-temperature (&lt;65 °C)
      continuous radiofrequency increases the efficacy of the treatment, without leading to a
      significant increase in complications caused by nerve lesions. However, these reports have
      some limitations. The investigators plan to conduct a randomized, controlled study to compare
      the efficacy of applying high-voltage pulsed radiofrequency, with and without low-temperature
      continuous radiofrequency, to the gasserian ganglion for the treatment of trigeminal
      neuralgia. The primary outcome will be the effectiveness of the treatment after 12 months
      which is the percentage of participants with a modified Barrow Neurological Institute Pain
      Intensity Score between I-III.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the World Health Organisation QoL-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. The WHOQOL-BREF is a abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100 assessment. WHOQOL-BREF is a self-report questionnaire that contains 26 items and addresses 4 QOL domains: physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relationships (3 items) and environment (8 items). Two other items measure overall QOL and general health. Each domain's mean score can range between 4 and 20 and a higher score indicates a higher quality of life. The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. A transformation method converts domain scores to a 0-100 scale.</description>
