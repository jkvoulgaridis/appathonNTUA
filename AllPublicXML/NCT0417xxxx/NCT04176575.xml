  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is common among patients with cancer, with estimates as high as 90% for those with
      advanced disease. Opioid medication, the most common treatment, has potential adverse effects
      including nausea and fatigue, further interfering with quality of life. Acupuncture has been
      studied for the treatment of cancer-related pain, with promising results in a few
      methodologically sound studies with small sample size. Our prior studies have found
      beneficial effects of open treatment using a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)-based
      acupuncture protocol and Dr. Tan's Balancing Method. This open trial seeks to confirm the
      benefit of acupuncture, utilizing Dr. Tan's Balancing Method, for patients with pain related
      to advanced cancer.

    <description>This study will provide acupuncture treatment to patients with moderate to severe pain from their advanced cancer. Participants will attend acupuncture sessions at CIM ideally twice a week their first 4-6 weeks of study involvement and then once per week for up to 12 total study visits for no longer than 12 weeks after their study enrollment. Participants will also be asked to complete a follow-up 4 to 6 weeks after their last study visit. Their total study involvement will range from 12 to 18 weeks.</description>
