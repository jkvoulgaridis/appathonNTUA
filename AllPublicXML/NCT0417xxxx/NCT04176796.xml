  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Publicly available outcome assessments for transplant programs do not make salient that some
      programs tend to reject many of the hearts they are offered, whereas other programs accept a
      broader range of donor offers. The investigators use empirical studies to test whether
      transplant center performance data (i.e. transplant and waitlist outcome statistics) that
      reflect center donor acceptance rates influence laypersons to evaluate centers with high
      organ decline rates less favorably than centers with low organ decline rates. 125 medical
      student participants will be recruited from University of Pittsburgh Medical School and
      randomized to one of two different information presentation conditions. Participants will be
      given an introduction to the donor organ match process, then asked to view the table of
      transplant outcomes corresponding to the condition they were randomized to. Each participant
      is asked to choose the hospital that they would consider to be &quot;higher performing&quot; between
      two hospitals: one hospital with a non-selective, &quot;accepting&quot; strategy (takes all donor heart
      offers), and one hospital with a more selective, &quot;cherrypicking&quot; strategy (tends to reject
      donor offers that are less than &quot;excellent&quot; quality).

      Publicly available outcome assessments for transplant programs do not make salient that some
      programs tend to reject many of the hearts they are offered, whereas other programs accept a
      broader range of donor offers. The investigators use empirical studies to test whether
      transplant center performance data (i.e. transplant and waitlist outcome statistics) that
      reflect center donor acceptance rates influence laypersons to evaluate centers with high
      organ decline rates less favorably than centers with low organ decline rates. 125 medical
      student participants will be recruited from University of Pittsburgh Medical School and
      randomized to one of two different information presentation conditions:

      Condition 1 (&quot;baseline&quot; condition): view only combined transplant survival (e.g. transplant
      survival rate not stratified by number and quality of donor hearts accepted at each center)

      Condition 2: view only stratified transplant survival (e.g. transplant survival rate
      stratified into patients who received excellent donor organs and patients who received less
      than optimal donor organs)

      Participants will be given an introduction to the donor organ match process, then asked to
      view the table of transplant outcomes corresponding to the condition they were randomized
      to.Each participant is asked to choose the hospital that they would consider to be &quot;higher
      performing&quot; between two hospitals: one hospital with a non-selective, &quot;accepting&quot; strategy
      (takes all donor heart offers), and one hospital with a more selective, &quot;cherrypicking&quot;
      strategy (tends to reject donor offers that are less than &quot;excellent&quot; quality). In order to
      identify the decision process that underlies this choice pattern, the investigators will
      examine a putative mediator. Specifically, participants will be asked to rate the extent to
      which they considered patients' chances of getting an excellent heart, avoiding a
      less-than-optimal heart, and getting any type of heart when making their choice between the
      two hospitals.

    <description>The outcome variable will be a measure of binary choice between two hospitals: one with a selective donor-heart acceptance strategy and one with a non-selective donor heart acceptance strategy.
Participants will respond to the question &quot;Which Hospital is a better choice for patients? Please click on one of the two tables below to indicate which hospital is the better choice.&quot; Participants will choose been two outcome tables featuring the selective and non-selective hospital (counterbalanced, such that each of the two choices is equally likely to be presented at top of the choice scenario in each condition). The number of participants that choose each hospital will be the measured outcome variable used in analyses.</description>

    <description>On the next page of the survey, participants will respond to three mediator questions: &quot;There are many reasons why one transplant hospital might outperform another. Which reasons were most important in your decision? Please move the slider to indicate how much you considered each of the reasons below (0=reason was not important, 100=reason was extremely important).&quot;
Participants will then move a slider bar (0-100) to indicate the importance of the following three items:
Patients were more likely to receive an excellent donor heart at the hospital I picked.
Patients were less likely to receive a marginal donor heart at the hospital I picked.
Patients were more likely to receive any kind of heart at the hospital I picked.
The third item (more likely to receive any kind of heart) will be the only variable that is included in the planned mediation analysis.</description>

    <description>The transplant survival rate in the table of outcome statistics is stratified into two groups: (i) patients who received excellent donor organs and (ii) patients who received less than optimal donor organs.
Stratified transplant survival is computed from survival rates of transplant patients who received each quality category of organ.
excellent transplant survival = [number of patients surviving after transplant with excellent organ]/[number of patients for whom excellent organ was accepted for transplant] marginal transplant survival = [number of patients surviving after transplant with marginal organ]/[number of patients for whom marginal organ was accepted for transplant]</description>

    <ipd_description>The PI will make all of the raw IPD files - together with statistical analysis protocol descriptions and information for proper analysis available for download a minimum of 1 year, and a maximum of 3 years, after publication of the corresponding manuscripts. All human subjects data are anonymized immediately when they are initially written from the online survey platform to the server, and thus participant confidentiality will not be compromised by this plan for data sharing.
All hypotheses, methods, and planned analyses for the applicant's studies will be pre-registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and Open Science Framework.</ipd_description>
