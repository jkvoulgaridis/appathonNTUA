      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ipatasertib in
      combination with atezolizumab and paclitaxel in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) previously untreated in this setting. Participants with
      Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) non-positive and PD-L1 positive tumors will be
      independently enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. The combination of ipatasertib,
      atezolizumab and paclitaxel will be evaluated in Cohorts 1 and 2 and the combination of
      ipatasertib and paclitaxel will be evaluated in Cohort 1.
