      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the similarity of the primary
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter AUC0-t of GB222 and bevacizumab after single administration;
      the secondary objective is to observe the safety and similarities and safety of other
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (Cmax, AUC0-∞ etc.) and immunogenicity of GB222 and
      bevacizumab after single administration.
