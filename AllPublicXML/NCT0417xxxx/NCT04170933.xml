    <textblock>
      Biliary stricture is a common complication after end-to-end biliary anastomosis, especially
      after liver transplantation. This study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      magnetic recanalization technique, a newly clinical method, for treating biliary anastomotic
      stricture.

      Biliary anastomotic stricture is a common complication of after end-to-end biliary
      anastomosis. Magnetic recanalization is a promising way to establish connection of biliary
      tract after stenosis or completed obstruction. This study is designed to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of magnetic recanalization among patients with severe biliary stricture
      after biliary anastmosis. Patients who failed to undergo stent placement with endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancretography (ERCP) would be enrolled for magnetic recanalization
      treatment. Magnetic treatment will be implemented by several steps. Firstly, placement of one
      magnet through the sinus of percutaneous transhepatic cholangio drainage (PTCD) in upper part
      of the bile duct; Second, introduction of another magnet via ERCP into the distal part of the
      bile duct, and making them be mated together; Third, after necrosis of the tissue between the
      two magnets, the magnets will drop off and be taken out together through the thread connected
      with them out of the mouth. Last, a plastic stent should be placed in the bile duct for a
      lasting support. The time of recanalization (drop off of the magnets), and adverse events
      (e.g. fever, melena, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, hematemesis, abdominal pain, and
      gastrointestinal bleeding) will be recorded, and each patient will be followed up for
      long-term outcomes.

Perform endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST).
Place one magnet above the stricture through the PTCD fistula.
Introduce another magnet below the stricture through the common bile duct with ERCP.
Place the magnets at the appropriate point to attract each other.
The patient will be strictly followed, and the magnets will be taken out out of the mouth by the thread connected with the magnets.
A plastic stent will be placed in the bile duct for lasting support.</description>
