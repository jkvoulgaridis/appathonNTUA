  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate the performance of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) endoscopy in
      Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) screening, as compared to the currently used White
      Light Endoscopy (WLE) and Lugol's Iodine Staining Endoscopy (ISE). NBI is a simple, safe and
      non-invasive technique, which can provide real-time optical staining for suspicious lesions.
      This trial is designated to enroll 10000 participants from five centers located in different
      regions (North, West and South) in China, which would provide real-world evidence for the
      recommendation of endoscopic diagnostic technique used in ESCC screening projects.

    <description>This opportunistic screening cohort is constructed among patients aged 45-69 years who undergo endoscopic examinations at the endoscopy center in any of the five hospitals included in this study. Enrolled participants are requested to complete a computer aided one-on-one questionnaire regarding demographic factors, smoking and alcohol drinking status, dietary habits，digestive tract symptoms and family history of ESCC. Then experienced endoscopists will perform the upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination for each participant, and the entire esophagus will be visually examined with the white light, NBI and iodine staining endoscopic examination.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Endoscopic examination using white light, NBI and iodine staining</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants' esophagus will be examined by three commonly used diagnostic techniques in the order of : 1. White light endoscopy (WLE); 2. Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) and 3. Iodine Staining Endoscopy (ISE) with 1.2% Lugol's iodine solution. The required observation time is no less than 1 minute for WLE and 2 minutes for NBI and ISE. Endoscopic images of each participant are routinely captured at every 5 centimeters in the esophagus, and information is recorded in detail for each focal lesion. Biopsies are taken from all visually abnormal areas found by any one of the three techniques, histopathologic diagnoses are rendered by two pathologists according to standard criteria and discrepancies are adjudicated by consultation. The recorded endoscopic images for each biopsied lesion are read by two trained researchers and the visualized feature of lesions are decomposed into several indicators (e.g. size, shape, color, and border of lesions) .</description>
