      The purpose of this prospective, single center, single arm registry is to assess technical
      feasibility, peri-procedural complications, post-procedure imaging outcomes, and 30-day
      safety outcomes in subjects with intraventricular hemorrhages utilizing the Artemis Neuro
      Evacuation Device in the hyper-acute phase.

      The purpose of this prospective, single center, single arm registry is to assess technical
      feasibility, peri-procedural complications, post-procedure imaging outcomes, and 30-day
      safety outcomes in subjects with intracerebral hemorrhages utilizing the Artemis Neuro
      Evacuation Device in the hyper-acute phase.

      The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device is used for the controlled aspiration of tissue and/or
      fluid during surgery of the Ventricular System or Cerebrum in conjunction with a Penumbra
      Aspiration Pump.

      The Penumbra Aspiration Pump is indicated as a vacuum source for the Penumbra Aspiration
      Systems.

      The enrollment period will end once 20 evaluable subjects have been enrolled in the registry.
      Each subject will be in the registry for approximately 1 month.

    <description>The purpose of this prospective, single center, single arm registry is to assess technical feasibility, peri-procedural complications, post-procedure imaging outcomes, and 30-day safety outcomes in approximately 20 subjects with intracerebral hemorrhages utilizing the Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device in the hyper-acute phase. For the purposes of this registry, the hyper-acute phase as defined by initiation of the MIS procedure no longer than 12 hours from initial NCCT scans and no longer than 18 hours since time patients last known well.</description>

    <description>The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device is used for the controlled aspiration of tissue and/or fluid during surgery of the Ventricular System or Cerebrum in conjunction with a Penumbra Aspiration Pump.
The Penumbra Aspiration Pump is indicated as a vacuum source for the Penumbra Aspiration Systems.
The Artemis Device will be evaluated by descriptive statistics in this registry to assess its efficiency and reliability in minimally invasive, mechanical evacuation of hematoma in patients with intracranial hemorrhage under direct visualization and control using a neuroendoscope.</description>
