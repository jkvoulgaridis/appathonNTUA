  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is an injury of cutaneous nerve fibers, mainly by a decrease in
      their density within the cutaneous tissue. The symptomatology associated with this SFN is
      broad with symptoms that are essentially sensory, but also autonomic. The etiologies of SFN
      are numerous (diabetes, drug, infectious, immunological...) and clinically non-specific,
      justifying a broad etiological assessment. The appearance of staged skin biopsies in the SFN
      balance sheet has greatly helped to improve diagnosis.

      Despite this, a significant part of SFN remains without associated etiology and is considered
      idiopathic.

      As the distribution of the different causes of SFN remains a missing data to date, the
      completion of this cohort study by one of the SFN reference centres should make it possible
      to establish the prevalence of SFN causes over a large population.

      Only patients with clinical symptoms that may be related to SFN and who have been sampled for
      SFN, positive or not, will be eligible for recruitment.

      The result of the anatomopathological sampling will allow patients to be separated into two
      groups, with or without SFN.

      The main judgement criteria will be the prevalence of etiologies associated with SFN:
      diabetes, medication, systemic lupus erythematosus, Gougerot-Sj√∂gren syndrome, amylosis,
      dysthyroidism, alcoholism, vitamin B12 deficiency, HIV infection, hepatitis C, paraneoplastic
      syndrome, hereditary disease (Fabry disease, Friedreich ataxia,...), idiopathic, others.

    <description>Source population will be patients with symptoms that may be related to SFN, who have performed a biopsy for SFN.
Patient will be considered to have SFN if he or she has a decrease in intra-epidermal distal density at nerve endings below the 5th percentile and at least one clinical sign in favour of small fibre neuropathy.
Clinical signs in favour of SFN are as follows :
Sensitive symptoms: burns, stings, numbness, tingling, hot/cold sensations, electric shocks, hyperesthesia, allodynia, intolerance of bed sheets, pruritus, restless legs.
Vegetative symptoms: erectile disorders, dry syndrome, sweating, hot flashes, vertigo/discomfort (orthostatic hypotension), digestive and/or urinary disorders, resting tachycardia, palpitations
Vascular symptoms: erythromelalgia, acrosyndrome</description>
