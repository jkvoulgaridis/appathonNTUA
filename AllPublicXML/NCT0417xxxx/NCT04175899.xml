  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, oral administration of chemotherapy has significantly increased and is
      anticipated to continue to grow. Despite the conveniences, these oral regimens can be complex
      and pose challenge to patient adherence. Further safety concerns are warranted due to
      insufficient patient education, general perception of reduced toxicity with oral treatment,
      improper prescribing practice, and the lack of monitoring of observable adverse effects.

      Therefore, effective medication counselling and patient education is vital to empower
      patients and their caregivers to increase adherence and safely managed medication to achieve
      optimal treatment outcome.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist intervention with structured oral
      chemotherapy education and patient monitoring on capecitabine treatment effectiveness
      (Relative Dose Intensity (RDI), Adherence and Persistence), safety outcomes (Adverse Event,
      Drug Related Problem and Health service utilization) and chemotherapy knowledge and
      self-efficiency among cancer patient care in Penang, a northern state oncology referral
      centre.

      There are numerous published studies of pharmaceutical care implementations focusing mainly
      on in-patient setting and currently evolving in ambulatory cancer patients especially in
      western countries compared to Asian region. However systematic reviews show major gap still
      exist with paucity of scientific evidence on the effectiveness of therapeutic educational
      interventions for improving patient safety and adherence to oral chemotherapy mainly due to
      study design and method that are unable to strongly prove the outcome.

      Hence highlighting the novelty and significance for this research using randomized controlled
      design, standardized &amp; validated tools for multimodal pharmacist intervention, long-term
      clinical outcome such as RDI with longitudinal assessment till treatment completion.

Led by oncology experienced clinical pharmacist and run alongside oncologist patient review at the clinic or daycare.
It utilizes structured educational material (for patients) and monitoring guideline or checklists (for pharmacists) during provision of service at each clinic visit such as patient education, pre-treatment review, medication reconciliation, prescription screening (dose, regime, supportive meds), adherence, adverse drug event monitoring and treatment recommendations on basis of agreed protocols.
Pharmacist scheduled additional review within 1-week interval of start of oral chemotherapy at clinic or via phone call (according to patient's preference) will also be conducted to review patients taking their oral medications at home, assess adherence and symptom experienced to provide individualized recommendations or support to patients.</description>
