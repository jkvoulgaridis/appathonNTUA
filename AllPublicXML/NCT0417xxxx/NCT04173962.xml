  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the effect of a single IV dose of ketamine (0.5
      mg/kg) on laboratory-induced stress in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress exposure is one of the greatest risk factors for psychiatric illnesses like major
      depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress resilience is the
      ability to experience stress without developing psychopathology. Enhancing stress resilience
      in at-risk populations could potentially protect against the development of stress-induced
      psychiatric disorders. Despite this, no resilience-enhancing pharmaceuticals have been
      identified yet. Pre-clinical studies showed that the administration of the glutamate
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine one week before an acute stress
      prevents the developing of depressive-like behavior in animals. In this project the study
      team proposes a pilot study to test if this stress prophylactic effect of ketamine applies
      also to humans. Ketamine will be compared to an active placebo control condition, the
      anesthetic midazolam, in a sample of healthy volunteers. The specific aims of this project
      are to test the effect of ketamine administered 1-week prior a laboratory-induced stress (1)
      on the positive and negative affect as measured with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) -
      Bipolar and (2) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis),
      adrenaline-noradrenaline axis (ANS axis), and self-reports of anxiety. The study team expects
      that subjects treated with ketamine, compared to midazolam, will experience reduced symptoms
      of negative affect and anxiety and a blunted hormonal response to an acute stress.

    <measure>The Profile of Mood States - Bipolar Version (POMS - Bi)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The Profile of Mood States - Bipolar Version (POMS - Bi) scale measures moods and feelings primarily in clinical rather than nonclinical settings. Responses on 5-point likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Raw scores are subject to T-score transformations on a standard scale with a T = 50 indicating average function compared to the reference population and a standard deviation of 10, with a higher score indicating worse function.</description>

    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) measures both positive and negative affect and is utilized within clinical and non-clinical populations. The PANAS is a 20-item instrument, each item is scored on a 5-likert scale from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). Positive Affect Score - total score from 10-50, with higher score indicating higher levels of positive affect. Negative Affect Score - total score from 10-50, with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale: Anxiety (VAS-Anxiety)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scales are scored in millimeters from the left-hand side of a 100-mm line to a perpendicular mark made by the patient at a point corresponding to the apparent magnitude of the feeling state. Range: 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 100 (&quot;most ever&quot;). The VAS-Anxiety prompts participants to rate their level of anxiety in that exact moment on the visual analog scale.</description>

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). This is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety in adults. The questions used in this measure ask about common symptoms of anxiety (such as numbness and tingling, sweating not due to heat, and fear of the worst happening). It is designed for individuals who are of 17 years of age or older and takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Total score range of 0-63, with higher score indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
