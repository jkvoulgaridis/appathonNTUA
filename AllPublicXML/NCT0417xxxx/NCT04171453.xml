             in taking this drug

          2. Renal impairment patients with CLCr less than 30 mL/min or who are undergoing
             hemodialysis.

          3. Patients who have hypersensitivity to the active substance (pregabalin) or to any of
             the excipients.

          4. Other patients who are decided to be not prescribed by the investigator under the
             routine medical practice, considering the balance the overall risk and benefit, for
