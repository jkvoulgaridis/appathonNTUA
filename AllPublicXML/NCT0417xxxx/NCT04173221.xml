  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining organ perfusion is the key to successful intensive care medicine. Shock is the
      most dangerous microcirculatory disorder and one of the most hazardous and lethal conditions
      of critically ill patients still showing high mortality rates. However, there are still
      ongoing controversies, how to assess microcirculation, how to predict outcome in time and how
      to guide specific therapy. Macrocirculation does not reflect microcirculation.
      Microcirculation reflects organ perfusion and correlates with the outcome. There is growing
      evidence that microcirculatory parameters are powerful tools to predict the outcome after
      cardiac arrest. Several guidelines use it as a target to guide therapy, but these
      recommendations base only on supporting evidence of low quality. Lactate is a late reflector
      of reduced organ perfusion and is of limited value for time-critical decision-making and
      their value as a therapeutic target. Sublingual sidestream dark-field (SDF) - measurement is
      a non-invasive method that reliably reflects organ perfusion. The last generation of
      microcirculation assessment tools are easy to use hand-held devices that use an automatic
      algorithm. In consequence, microcirculation has become a directly detectable physiological
      compartment. However, systematic investigations about this technology in shock are still
      lacking. DAMIS determines the value of directly assessed microcirculation on outcome in
      different types of shock. Therefore, this multicenter study will recruit more than 200
      patients in shock. After the first measurement, patients will be randomized either to
      intervention or to control. The intervention consists in knowing microcirculatory parameters.
      A checklist will assist the treating physicians of the interventional group in explaining
      microcirculatory values and offering possible treatment options. Patients in the control
      group will be measured as well, but results will not be communicated to the treating
      physician.
