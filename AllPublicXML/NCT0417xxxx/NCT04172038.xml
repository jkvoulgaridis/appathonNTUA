    <textblock>
      This study will be sequential, randomization trial where patients with chronic low back pain
      are initially randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatments (physical therapy OR Move 2 Health).
      This will be Phase I of the study intervention. Patients who do not respond to treatment
      after 6 weeks will undergo a subsequent sequential randomization. This will be Phase II of
      the study intervention. Patients in Phase II will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatments
      (addition of physical therapy or Move 2 Health, whichever one they did not receive OR the
      MORE Mindfulness intervention). Patients will be followed for 1 year after enrollment.

    <textblock>
      Improving non-pharmacologic management of chronic pain is a priority for the Military Health
      System (MHS) within the Department of Defense (DoD) and the most common chronic pain
      condition in the MHS and civilian healthcare is low back pain (LBP). Key questions exist
      however about the relative effectiveness of various strategies at different Steps, how to
      sequence treatments and individualize care based on specific patient characteristics and the
      resource implications. This study will recruit active duty military members or members of
      Reserves or National Guard on active duty, family members of active duty personnel, or
      Tricare beneficiaries seeing a primary care provider for chronic LBP in an MHS facility, ages
      18-65. All participants will first receive 6 weeks of Phase I care with either physical
      therapy (PT) or Move to Health (M2H) interventions. After Phase I the investigators will
      assess response to initial treatment strategy. Phase I responders will be receive up to 2
      additional sessions of treatment to facilitate a transition to self-management. Phase I
      non-responders will be randomly assigned to a more intensive Phase II treatment of either
      mindfulness or a combined PT+M2H intervention for 8 weeks. Randomization at each phase will
      be stratified by site, gender, and active duty status (adding Phase I treatment assignment at
      Phase II). Follow-up assessments for all participants will occur at 18 weeks (conclusion of
      Phase II), 6 months and 12 months after enrollment. Outcomes include patient-reported
      measures and health care costs.

    <masking_description>8-week and 18-week follow-up assessments will be performed by a research assistant who will be blind to participants' treatment group assignment. Participants will be reminded by the research assistant not to discuss aspects of their treatment during assessments. If a research assistant becomes unblinded during the course of a participants study participation, he or she will not be allowed to conduct additional follow-up assessments. Instances of unblinding during an assessment will be recorded as an unexpected event.</masking_description>

It is a person-centered, holistic, and experience-centric approach to promoting healthy behaviors (nutrition, physical activity, sleep, instrinsic factors, extrinsic factors). Precise dosage (i.e, number of M2H sessions) will be at the discretion of the health coaches. Sessions may be delivered in-person or utilize technology including text messaging, telephone, e-mail, video chat, app-based self-management etc.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive education for self-management (video and written materials) to introduce the key domains of holistic health in the Move to Health (M2H) model and their relationship to chronic LBP. Next, the participant will complete a Personal Health Inventory. The Inventory will be reviewed by the health coach and patient in order to identify specific domains for priority based on patient preference:
Sleep
Physical Activity
Nutrition
Intrinsic Well-Being (Personal Development, Spiritual Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being)
Extrinsic Well-Being (Family/Social Relationships, Surroundings)
Care may range from guided self-management with the researcher to a specialist referral (e.g., sleep specialist, dietician, behavioral health provider, etc.).</description>
