  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test whether the realization of 3 courses of intra-arterial
      chemotherapy of idarubicin-lipiodol without embolization, administered non-selectively in the
      hepatic artery, following the percutaneous tumour ablation of a hepatocellular carcinoma,
      could constitute an effective adjuvant treatment to reduce the rates of local and
      intrahepatic distant recurrence and thus improve the survival without hepatic progression.

      During this study percutaneous tumor destruction treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy
      (infusion of Idarubicin-Lipiodol intra-arterial hepatic) will be tested. The adjuvant
      chemotherapy is a minimally invasive technique. It consists of the administration of
      Idarubicin (Zavedos®, Pfizer) mixed with Lipiodol (Lipiodol Ultra-Fluid®, Guerbet) in the
      hepatic artery.The first course of treatment will be performed under general anesthesia at
      the same time as the percutaneous tumour ablation. The second and third cures will be
      performed under local anesthesia 3 and 6 weeks after percutaneous tumour ablation
      respectively. In the case of incomplete treatment during the percutaneous tumour ablation,
      the second intervention will be scheduled at the same time as the second intra-arterial
      chemotherapy treatment, under general anesthesia.

    <intervention_model_description>Prospective multi-center phase II, randomized, unmasked comparative study (ratio 1:1), evaluating the efficacy of an adjuvant treatment by hepatic arterial chemo-infusion of Idarubicin-Lipiodol (experimental group) after percutaneous tumor ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma of size less than 3 cm, versus the absence of adjuvant treatment (standard group), on hepatic recurrence at 1 year.
It is planned to include 138 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (CHC) less than 3 cm, non-metastatic, with cirrhosis graded A / B7 on Child Pugh scoring system, and receiving treatment by percutaneous tumor destruction.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Hepatic recurrence will be defined as the appearance on at least one hepatic MRI with gadolinium injection of a large diameter tumor site at least greater than 10 mm, and presenting characteristics of CHC (hyper vascularization at arterial time and washing at portal or late time), either at the edge of the percutaneous tumor destruction site (= local recurrence) or at a distance from the percutaneous tumor destruction site (= intrahepatic recurrence distant), or both, after at least one liver MRI scan with gadolinium injection showed the absence of tumor residues. Lesions of more than 10 mm that do not present with the typical CHC enhancement described above will be considered CHCs if they have a growth in size of at least 1 cm on successive controls.</description>
