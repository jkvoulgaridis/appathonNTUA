    <textblock>
      Emotional support and physical comfort are two important components of the patient experience
      at the oncology outpatient clinic. However, current practices do not seem optimal for meeting
      the psychosocial needs expressed by patients during chemotherapy treatments.

      Comfort talk (CT) is a simple, inexpensive intervention that could maximize the feeling of
      safety and comfort during chemotherapy. Identifying interventions that are interdisciplinary
      and that can enhance the outpatient patient experience will facilitate access to quality
      oncology care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of cancer cases requiring chemotherapy is on the rise in North America. About 84%
      of chemotherapy treatments are administered by nurses in a outpatient clinic context.
      Although outpatient oncology care are generally associated with a significant improvement in
      the quality of life in cancer patients, one-third of patients believe that health
      professionals (including nurses) are not doing everything in their power to comfort or
      relieve discomfort during chemotherapy treatments. Among the known elements for enhancing the
      well-being of oncology outpatients, comfort talk (CT) has been found to be very effective.
      Indeed, CT is a simple and direct form of conversation that is inspired by the principles of
      clinical hypnosis. While the soothing mechanisms of CT are poorly understood, involvement of
      cortical regions involved in the modulation of emotions and pain is suggested in several
      neuroimaging studies.This pilot trial serves as a proof of concept and aims to explore
      whether CT can be used by nurses to optimize the perception of emotional support and physical
      comfort during outpatient chemotherapy treatments. To do this, patients enrolled in a
      chemotherapy treatment cycle will be recruited during a visit to the oncology outpatient
      clinic. Half of the patients will be assigned to enhanced routine care with an CT
      intervention and the other half will receive routine care without CT. If there is an overlap
      between CT mechanisms and those involved in the endogenous control of emotions and pain, a
      significant interaction of these elements on the well-being of patients during chemotherapy
      treatments is expected. The results of this pilot trials will be used to justify and prepare
      for a larger study to evaluate the effects of CT on cancer symptom management and treatment
      at the outpatient clinic.

    <intervention_model_description>This pilot trials will be conducted simultaneously in two outpatient oncology clinics located in the Montreal area: 1) Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, and 2) Hôpital de Saint-Eustache. These sites have been selected has they share the same hemato-oncologists, ensuring some consistency in treatment protocols. Site 1 will serve as the experimental site (combining CT with current care) and site 2 will serve as the control site (current care only).</intervention_model_description>
