  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are an injectable, non-insulin therapy
      for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Semaglutide (Ozempic®) is the newest GLP-1 RA to
      become available in Canada in 2018, and is administered subcutaneously once-weekly. In
      clinical trials, semaglutide has been superior to placebo and other antihyperglycemic agents
      in HbA1c reduction and body weight loss. However, there is little real-world evidence
      available on the effectiveness of semaglutide in real-world clinical practice.

      To better understand the effectiveness of semaglutide on clinical outcomes in a real-world
      setting, this retrospective cohort study will use the Canadian LMC Diabetes Registry to
      examine the effects of semaglutide on glycemic control, body weight, and other clinical
      outcomes in patients with T2D who initiate once-weekly semaglutide as part of usual clinical
      care in a diabetes specialist practice group in Canada.
