    <textblock>
      This is a randomized intervention study to test and develop the national curriculum of a
      parent intervention training targeting parent's ability for advocate for services to improve
      the transition to adulthood for their youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

      UPDATE regarding COVID-19: The current intervention has been paused until it is safe to meet
      as a group again. We are still recruiting participants for cohort 2 (in TN and IL) and Cohort
      1 and 2 (in WI), as the plan is to resume the intervention as soon as the situation allows
      and to keep the future scheduled interventions happening in the Fall of 2020, Fall of 2021
      and Winter of 2022. For the baseline data collection visit, we have moved to remote data
      collection for all measures except the psychological testing with the youth - meaning that
      families will be able to partially complete baseline data via teleconference and/or phone
      calls and online surveys. In-person visits to complete the psychological testing with the
      youth will be scheduled in the future when it is safe to meet face to face.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research plan is designed to develop and test the effectiveness of a national
      curriculum of the ASSIST (Advocating for SupportS to Improve Service Transition) program, a
      12-week parent training program targeting parents' ability to advocate for services to
      improve the transition to adulthood for youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

      Preliminary work demonstrated that youth whose parents participated in the &quot;Volunteer
      Advocacy Program- Transition&quot; or VAP-T (a pilot 12-week intervention program on which ASSIST
      is based) were more likely to be employed or in postsecondary education (PSE), and received
      more school-based and adult services, when compared to a wait-list control group.

      In the proposed research, the investigators conduct a randomized-controlled trial with 180
      families to build on previous findings in four important ways: 1) by making modifications to
      the program content to make it applicable to service systems across the nation, and
      rigorously testing whether the ASSIST program is effective when delivered across three states
      (Tennessee, Illinois, Wisconsin); 2) by incorporating the perspective of offspring with ASD
      into the intervention and data collection; 3) by examining mechanisms by which the ASSIST
      program influences youth outcomes; and 4) by exploring barriers to participation and factors
      that moderate treatment response.

      The investigators hypothesize that ASSIST participation will improve parents' advocacy
      ability, leading to higher rates of employment, PSE, social participation, and service access
      for youth with ASD. The investigators will test this hypothesis by randomly assigning parents
      of transition-aged youth with ASD (ages 16-26) to either a treatment or active,
      materials-only control group, and following families over 3 years. The investigators propose
      four Specific Aims: (1) To use a multi-site randomized-controlled trial to examine whether
      ASSIST participation increases parent advocacy ability (i.e. the intervention target); (2) To
      test whether participating in the ASSIST leads to improved youth outcomes (employment,
      post-secondary education, social participation, service access) during the transition to
      adulthood; (3) To examine which aspects of parent advocacy ability mediate the relations
      between ASSIST participation and youth outcomes; and (4) To explore moderators of treatment
      response and barriers to participation in the intervention.

      By rigorously testing a new intervention to improve the transition to adulthood for youth
      with ASD, the proposed research addresses an area of critical need as identified by the
      2016-7 Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan. The project will result in a
      new intervention to improve outcomes for youth with ASD that can be disseminated through
      state and local agencies across the nation.

    <intervention_model_description>After eligibility is determined and baseline data are collected, parents will be randomized, in two cohorts, to the treatment or materials-only control condition. Given the relatively small sample size in each cohort at each site (n = 30 at each of three sites), simple randomization is not recommended as it might result in unequal group sizes. The investigators will use 1:1 block randomization within each site to give equal number of subjects in each group. To ensure balance of important covariates, the investigators will block on key moderators: whether the youth has an Intellectual Disability (ID) and is in high school. Co-occurring ID and being in vs. out of high school impact service eligibility, and ID impacts the likelihood of post-secondary education (PSE) and community employment. By balancing moderators, the researchers maximize power to detect effect modification of the treatment effect.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ASSIST program is a 12-week advocacy training to educate parents of youth with ASD about the adult service system. It is a group training, comprised of didactic instruction, family-sharing activities, case studies, and group discussions. The ASSIST program for the proposed study will be directed at each site by an experienced Program Facilitator from the community with knowledge about group processes, person-centered planning, and adult service systems, who will be coached by a member of the study team. The ASSIST program will be delivered in full partnership with the local disability community. In most sessions, the Program Facilitator will be aided by community content experts who present the specifics of each topic.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria include:

          1. parents willing to participate in the ASSIST 12-week intervention, who have an
             offspring with ASD between the ages of 16 and 26 years. This age range was chosen to
             allow for the testing of whether the ASSIST is more effective if offered prior to
             versus after high school exit (a key moderator in Aim 4). The investigators set a
             lower bound of age 16, as that is when transition planning is mandated to have begun
             in the schools, and an upper bound of age 26 to capture families of youth who are
             still in the &quot;transition years&quot; as defined by the Institute of Medicine. If both
             parents in a family want to attend the training, the investigators will allow it but
             will designate one as the study's primary respondent;

          2. parents are willing to be randomized to the treatment or control condition;

          3. parents are able to travel weekly to one of the project sites (Nashville, TN;
             Chicagoland;IL; Madison/Milwaukee, WI) to participate in the group ASSIST sessions (12
             weekly sessions). The responding parent and the offspring with ASD must also be able
             to travel to a project site for a diagnostic evaluation to confirm the ASD diagnosis
             (using the gold- standard Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 or ADOS-2) and to
             establish IQ and adaptive behavior functioning;

          4. the participating parent and youth must live in one of the states where the
             intervention is being delivered, as the adult service system is different in every
             state;

          5. son/daughter has a previous diagnosis of ASD from an educational or health care
             provider, and meets lifetime cut-offs for ASD in a telephone screening of the Social
             Communication Questionnaire. This will decrease the risk that youth fail to meet
             diagnostic criteria for ASD during the diagnostic evaluation. Note that although the
             investigators will collect IQ and adaptive behavior information to assess functioning
             of the offspring with ASD, this information will not be used to determine eligibility;
             parents of offspring with all levels of functioning can participate in the ASSIST
             project; and

          6. the participating parent is proficient with the English language, as all ASSIST
             presentations and data collection materials are in English.

        Exclusion criteria include:

          1. parents unable to participate in the ASSIST 12-week intervention due to scheduling
             conflicts, or who are unable to travel weekly to one of the sites;

          2. parents NOT willing to be randomized to the treatment or control condition;

          3. parents and/or youth do NOT live in one of the states where the intervention is being
             delivered;

          4. The youth does not have a previous diagnosis of ASD from an educational or health care
             provider

          5. The youth does not meet lifetime cut-offs for ASD in a telephone screening of the
             Social Communication Questionnaire, answered by the parent.

          6. The participating parent is not proficient with the English language.
