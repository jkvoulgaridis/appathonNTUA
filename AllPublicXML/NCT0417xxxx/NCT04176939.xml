  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term immune responses to the Herpes Zoster
      subunit (HZ/su) vaccine as well as safety up to 7 years after the 2-dose primary vaccination
      course from study ZOSTER-041 (NCT02058589). This study will also assess immune responses as
      well as safety after revaccination with 2 additional doses of the HZ/su administered at 6 to
      8 years after the 2-dose primary vaccination course.
