  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to develop and evaluate an app-based intervention for adolescents
      who have been exposed to cyberbullying. The overarching goal is to offer a low-threshold
      intervention, called NettOpp, that is easy accessible and free to use for every junior high
      school student who has experienced cyberbullying in Norway.

      The main aim of the intervention is to increase coping strategies for adolescents who have
      been exposed to cyberbullying. More specifically the aims are to increase 1) knowledge about
      cyberbullying, 2) help-seeking behavior, 3) coping strategies with cyberbullying, 4) to
      reduce mental health problems, and 5) cyberbullying, and 6) to increase self-esteem and the
      7) sleeping quality of the adolescents.

      To evaluate the mobile application three studies will be conducted: A lab test, a pilot
      study, and a larger effectiveness study with a follow-up examination after 3 months. The lab
      test will be conducted to examine the quality of the prototype of the app in order to find
      out if adjustments have to be made. Thereafter, a pilot study will be conducted with
      adolescents that were exposed to cyberbullying in the past six months. The pilot study will
      use a pre-post design.The effectiveness study will be conducted as a randomized controlled
      trial with an intervention group and a waiting-list control group.
