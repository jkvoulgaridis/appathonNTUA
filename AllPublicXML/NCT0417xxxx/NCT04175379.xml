  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Permissive hypercapnia increased the survival rate in patients with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) who required mechanical ventilation in critical care medicine. This
      has been explained by its association with ventilator induced lung injury. Since then, a
      protective lung ventilation strategy has been very important, with a low tidal volume of 4-6
      ml/kg. Patients undergoing surgery will inevitably require mechanical ventilation. In
      particular, patients undergoing one lung ventilation for thoracic surgery may have increased
      airway pressure and a greater chance of ventilator induced lung injury. Recently, protective
      lung ventilation has been applied to patients undergoing one ung ventilation during thoracic
      surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference in the degree of pulmonary
      oxygenation and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in hypercapnia induced
      by controlling the respiratory rate with a constant tidal volume.
