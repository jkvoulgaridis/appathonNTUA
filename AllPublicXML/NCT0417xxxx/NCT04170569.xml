  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the effect of yoga on posttraumatic growth and
      quality of life. The birth action, which includes positive and negative experiences, can be
      an important opportunity to achieve posttraumatic growth and improve the quality of life.

      This is a experimental model with pretest-posttest control group study. Two hundred and
      fifty-two women who met the criteria for inclusion in the study made up the research
      population. Three instruments were used to obtain the research data: Personal Information
      Form, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) and SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF-36).

    <textblock>
      Failure in modern medicine approaches or side effects of treatments and drugs, as well as the
      woman's anxiety to hurt herself and her baby direct her and her relatives to try
      complementary therapies. Women should prefer natural ways in coping with these postpartum
      problems rather than seeking medical advice.

      When yoga and meditation, which are included in the group of mind-body-based complementary
      therapies, are performed in the postpartum period, they will help to relieve tensions and
      distresses that accumulate during birth, strengthen the pelvic floor, heal perineum, bring
      reproductive organs back to their prepregnancy condition healthily, provide the mother and
      the infant a sleep pattern, and have an easier transition to sleep.

    <description>The posttraumatic growth scale for measure posttraumatic growth;The scale is scored from 0 to 5 and the lowest is 0 and the highest is 105. The higher the scores obtained, the higher the approval from the traumatic experience shows that it is experiencing high growth. There are three sub-dimensions: the change in self-perception of the scale, the change in philosophy of life, and the change in relationship with others.</description>
