  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the differences in cognitive performance and quality of
      life, after a cycle of treatment with the relaxometer, between a group of patients affected
      by fibromyalgia and a control group.

      The relaxometer is a device designed for the physical rehabilitation of patients with
      functional problems of upper limbs. It works by moving passively the patient's fingers in a
      gradual way (with different speeds) in all directions of space, which is innovative compared
      to similar machines already on the market.

      The device consists of an electrical supply unit and two handling units made of 10 silicone
      tips of different sizes for the placement of fingers and it works with a six-minute pre-set
      program. It has obtained patent and certification mark and it has been used in the
      rehabilitation of patients with joint stiffness induced by specific working activities, as
      musicians.

      After the treatment these patients reported a remarkable improvement of motor skills and
      articulation of fingers, in addition to a parallel improvement of cognitive abilities such as
      concentration, visual acuity and mnemonic learning.

      In sight of this, the aim of the study is to establish whether the application of this
      treatment in a small group patients affected by fibromyalgia and cognitive impairment is able
      to improve some aspects of the cognitive dysfunction measured with appropriate functional
      tests and comparing the results with a control group of patients not affected by this
      condition.

    <description>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire revised (FIQ-R) administered before the first treatment with the relaxometer and during the last examination on the 30^ day from the first treatment.
Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire revised (FIQ-R) explores three domains: function, overall impact, and symptoms. The score of each domain is divided by a specific number
Function domain sum (0-90) divided by 3 (upper limit 30)
Overall impact domain sum (0-20) divided by one (0-20)
Symptom domain sum (0-100) divided by 2 (upper limit 50) The three resulting domain scores are added together to obtain the total score of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire revised (FIQ-R) range 0-100.
