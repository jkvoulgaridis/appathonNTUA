  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension during anesthesia often occurs because reduced systemic vascular resistance and
      blocked sympathetic nervous system by anesthetic drugs. In patients who are taking
      hypertension medication, blood pressure drops are exaggerated by inadequate compensation
      mechanism due to decrease of blood vessel elasticity and desensitization of baroreceptors. In
      one-lung ventilation (OLV) during thoracic surgery, persistent perfusion of non-ventilatory
      lungs can lead to increased intra-pulmonary shunt and hypoxemia. As a compensatory mechanism,
      the gravitational effect and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction occur. Among these, hypoxic
      pulmonary vasoconstriction is associated with pulmonary vascular resistance. Norepinephrine
      and vasopressin, which are commonly used in patients with hypotension, affect systemic and
      pulmonary vascular resistance. However, no studies have been done on lung oxygenation and
      pulmonary mechanics of these vasoactive drugs in patients undergoing surgery on one lung.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of vasoactive drugs,
      norepinephrine and vasopressin, in patients with hypertension.
