  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, double-blind prospective in 3 clinical sites to compare the
      efficacy of two currently approved topical ophthalmic drops in the clearing central corneal
      staining in 90 days prior to elective cataract or LASIK surgery.

      The study will be a randomized, double-blind prospective study in 3 sites in the US to
      compare efficacy of improvement in central corneal staining with fluorescein dye evaluations
      at slit lamp exam, secondarily improvement in OSDI questionnaire with additional questions
      regarding dysgeusia, blurriness, and sensation of burning, improvements in corneal topography
      and improvements in Schirmer's testing. 100 study subjects 18-85 male or female will be
      enrolled in the Nashville, Beverly Hills and St. Louis areas who are generally healthy with
      central corneal staining and scheduled for uncomplicated phacoemulsification or uncomplicated
      LASIK.
