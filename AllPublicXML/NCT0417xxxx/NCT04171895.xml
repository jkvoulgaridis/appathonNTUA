Prior to the training, caregivers will also be sent a handout explaining the concept of roleplays as well as the caregiver blueprint which will list and explain the sets of strategies and skills they will learn during the training. ICs will also be sent a set of advanced care planning forms (DNR, healthcare proxy, etc.) which are used as models for this training.</description>

        Participants will be recruited from the MSK Brain Tumor Center (BTC), a multidisciplinary
        center comprised of faculty from Neurology, Neurosurgery, Radiation Oncology, Radiology and
        Psychiatry. The study team may also conduct approaches and recruitment over the phone, in
        situations where clinic recruitment may not be possible. After screening medical records
        for eligibility, study staff will email the treating clinician for approach approval, and
        will only proceed to reach out over phone if the clinician provides explicit permission.
