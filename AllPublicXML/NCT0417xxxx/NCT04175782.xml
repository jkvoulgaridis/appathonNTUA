  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has been shown to improve postoperative outcomes in a
      variety of surgical conditions. However, data regarding its role in urogynecologic surgery is
      limited. This study aimed to investigate the role of the ERAS protocol on postoperative
      outcomes in patients undergoing urogynecologic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) or in other words &quot;fast-track&quot; protocol roughly
      purposes to improve patient satisfaction, reduce complications and shorten the hospital stay.
      Chronic diseases, nutrition, and any volume depletion are corrected prior to surgery and less
      invasive surgical techniques are utilized to this end The impact of ERAS protocols in
      decreasing length of stay (LOS), reducing postoperative pain, improving early ambulation and
      decreasing the rate of potentially serious medical complications have been studied in
      patients undergoing colorectal, urologic, gastric and pancreatic surgery previously. However,
      data regarding the role of ERAS protocol in improving postoperative outcomes and
      postoperative compliance in patients undergoing urogynecological surgery is limited.

      The present study purposes to clarify the role of the ERAS protocol on postoperative outcomes
      in patients undergoing urogynecologic surgery.

    <description>A standardized ERAS protocol is applied to the ERAS group based on the latest guidelines. Smoking and alcohol consumption is stopped 4 weeks before the surgery. Preoperative anemia is corrected with intravenous iron supplementation. Prolonged fasting, bowel preparation, and premedication are avoided in this group. Clear fluids are allowed up to 2 h and solids rich in carbohydrate up to 6 h hours prior to induction of anesthesia. Warmed up intravenous fluids are administered to maintain normothermia intraoperatively. This group of subjects receives general anesthesia. Volume and salt overload and drain usage are avoided to the utmost. Intravenous paracetamol is administered for postoperative analgesia before the completion of the surgical procedure. Nasogastric tube placement is avoided and catheters are removed as soon as possible. Nonopioid oral analgesics and NSAIDs are utilized for postoperative pain medication.</description>

    <description>Preoperative:
Counseling before hospital admission Fluid, and carbohydrate loading Avoiding prolongation of the fasting period Avoiding bowel preparation or its application only in selective cases Application of antibiotic prophylaxis Application of thromboprophylaxis Avoiding premedication
Intraoperative:
Use of short-acting anesthetic agents Refraining from using drains Refraining from salt, and water overload Maintenance of normothermia (heating the body, and use of warmed up intravenous fluids)
Postoperative:
Refraining from the use of nasogastric tube Prevention of nausea, and vomiting Refraining from salt, and water overload Earlier removal of catheters Initiation of oral intake at an early period Use of nonopioid oral analgesics/NSAIDs Early mobilization Adherence to the protocol, and auditing results</description>
