  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a specific time during hematological
      disease management for the patients, theirs relatives and the healthcare team. This heavy
      treatment is most of the time the last possible curative therapy and could cause many side
      effects such as infectious diseases and graft versus host reaction. The protective isolation
      is also a source of physical and psychological isolation. Published studies reported
      depressive syndrome, anxiety symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorders for patients and
      their families. Since 10 years ago, diaries are used in intensive care unit to limit these
      symptoms after a coma. In analogy, the diary for the patients with allogenic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation could be a mean to reduce the psychological adverse impact and long
      terms consequences. The investigators want to evaluate the psychological impact of a diary on
      the patients hospitalized for allogenic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation and on their
      relatives.
