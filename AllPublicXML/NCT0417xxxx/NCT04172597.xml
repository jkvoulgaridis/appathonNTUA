    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and the
      safety/tolerability of poziotinib in five patient cohorts for up to 150 previously treated
      patients with any systemic therapy (Cohort 1: 30 Patients that have HER2-positive or
      HER2-negative breast cancer with HER2 activating mutations, Cohort 2: 30 Patients that have
      colorectal cancer with HER2 activating mutations, Cohort 3: Patients that have solid tumors
      (except NSCLC, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer) with HER2 activating mutations, Cohort 4:
      30 Patients that have high-grade glioma with EGFR activating mutations, and Cohort 5: 30
      Patients that have solid tumors (except NSCLC or high-grade glioma) with EGFR activating
      mutations.

      The Screening period (Day -30 to Day 1) lasts up to approximately 30 days prior to Cycle 1,
      Day 1. Patients must meet all Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria to participate in the study.
      Eligible patients will provide written Informed Consent prior to undergoing any study
      procedures.

      Each treatment cycle is 28 calendar days in duration. There will be five patient cohorts and
      eligible patients will be enrolled into each cohort in parallel based on EGFR or HER2 exon 20
      mutation status and prior treatment status:

        -  Cohort 1: Patients that have HER2-positive or HER2-negative breast cancer with HER2
           activating mutations.

        -  Cohort 2: Patients that have colorectal cancer with HER2 activating mutations

        -  Cohort 3: Patients that have solid tumors (except NSCLC, breast cancer, or colorectal
           cancer) with HER2 activating mutations

        -  Cohort 4: Patients that have high-grade glioma with EGFR activating mutations

        -  Cohort 5: Patients that have solid tumors (except NSCLC or high-grade glioma) with EGFR
           activating mutations

      All patients will be treated 28 days per cycle until 24 months of treatment, disease
      progression, death, intolerable adverse events (AEs), or other protocol-specified reasons for
      patient withdrawal

             disease, asymptomatic biliary stones, liver metastasis, or stabilized chronic liver
             diseases).

         12. Patient has a medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator or medical
             monitor would put her/him at an unreasonable risk including drug toxicity during the
