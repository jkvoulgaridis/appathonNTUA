  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the availability of phytonutrients in two blueberry varieties,
      chosen for their phytonutrient levels. This will be compared to phytonutrient-matched
      processed protein bar and a macronutrient-matched control meal, in healthy human volunteers.
      Blueberry phytonutrients will be analyzed in blood and urine over a four-day period, 48h
      prior to consumption and 48h after. The participants will consume each of the four meals over
      a 3-month period (4-way crossover design, 4 blocks of 4-day periods). The main objective of
      this study is to compare the proportions of blueberry phytonutrients recovered in the blood
      and urine after ingestion of the four treatments. We hypothesize that phytonutrient content
      will be predictive of human bioavailability and that a berry-enriched processed product will
      have similar phytonutrient bioavailability to unprocessed berries.

      The results of this study may establish if the nutritional value of a berry can be predicted
      or enhanced to provide elevated nutritional quality, with the ultimate goal of maximizing the
      health benefits of fruit consumption. As it is challenging for many to increase their fruit
      and vegetable intake to government recommended levels (5+ servings per day), the present
      proof-of-concept study explores a reasonable approach to help consumers achieve optimal
      health associated with high fruit and vegetable intakes, within the context of current
      consumption patterns, through enhancement of the nutritional density and bioavailability of
      common fruits and consumer products.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the proportions of blueberry phytonutrients
      recovered in the blood and urine after ingestion of the four treatments.

      After eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomly assigned to the four berry related
      interventions. The consumption of each intervention corresponds to one study period, which
      are separated by one-week washout. Blood will be collected at baseline and across 48h (1h,
      3h, 6h, 9h, 24h, 48h) after intervention consumption while urine will be collected for 48h
      before and after intervention (-48h, -24h, 0-9h, 9-24h, 24-48h).
