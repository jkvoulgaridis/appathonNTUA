      This study aims to determine the transient, modulatory effects of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) on executive function and inhibitory control in patients with ADHD.
      Deficits in these cognitive functions are core to ADHD, and cause significant impairment and
      morbidity. The study will also include a cohort of healthy controls for comparison.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male and female subjects 18-66 years of age

          2. Healthy volunteers or volunteers with a diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood, meeting the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [American
             Psychiatric Association, 2013] criteria, including at least 5 moderate inattentive or
             impulsive-hyperactive symptoms, and onset of two symptoms of inattentive or of
             impulsive/hyperactive traits by the age of 12.

          3. Patient will be either off stimulant medications or, if undergoing treatment with
             stimulants, will be asked to discontinue two days prior to the experiment, under
             physician-guided protocol, and allowed to resume afterwards. Subjects may resume
             stimulant use between the two study visits so long as they discontinue use two days
             prior to the second study visit. If fatigue is problematic in subjects discontinuing
             medication, they will be allowed to continue with the study if they are able to follow
             the suggested taper plan (50% of the dose day one, 25% dose day 2, stop day of visit
             (day 3)).

          4. English-speaking

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Current or past history of clinically unstable psychiatric conditions such as suicidal
             or homicidal behavior or psychotic disorders.

          2. Pregnant or nursing females.

          3. Inability to participate in testing procedures

          4. Contraindication to tDCS: history or epilepsy, metallic implants in the head and neck,
             brain stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators, VP shunt, pacemakers, pregnancy.

          5. Additional exclusion criteria for healthy controls:

               1. Diagnosis of psychiatric of neurological disorder

               2. Ongoing treatment with any psychotropic medications.
