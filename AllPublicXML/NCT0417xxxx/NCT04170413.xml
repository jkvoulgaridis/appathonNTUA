      The investigators will assess the feasibility of replacing fluoroscopy/iodinated contrast
      with ultrasound/sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres during routine urodynamic
      studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic studies routinely involve instillation of iohexol (OmnipaqueTM), a low osmolality
      contrast agent, into the bladder followed by fluoroscopic imaging to assess for reflux or
      variant anatomy of the genitourinary system. Recently, sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A
      microspheres (LumasonTM), an ultrasound contrast agent, has been approved in the United
      States for intravesicular administration in the pediatric population. Contrast enhanced
      voiding urosonography (CEvUS) is being increasingly utilized in the place of voiding
      cystourethrograms, with the major advantages being decreased (zero) radiation for the
      patient, as well as decreased cost. Given the similarity in procedure between urodynamic
      studies (UDS) and voiding cystourethrograms, the investigators hypothesize that a urodynamic
      study may be performed with contrast enhanced ultrasound instead of fluoroscopy. The
      investigators plan to conduct a small feasibility study by recruiting a group of 30 patients
      under the age of 18, who are willing to undergo their normally scheduled UDS in addition to
      CEvUS. The UDS typically consists of two cycles of bladder filling and voiding; the
      investigators intend to replace the use of fluoroscopy and iohexol with ultrasound and sulfur
      hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres. This will decrease the time commitment and eliminate
      radiation exposure for the patient. There will not be a formal analysis of data as the
      investigators are planning to test the feasibility of the procedure rather than gather any
      quantitative data. The goal of the study is to eventually implement CEvUS instead of
      fluoroscopy in all urodynamic and voiding studies if it is found to be a reasonable
      alternative. This will decrease pediatric radiation exposure, which will be especially
      important in the patients undergoing several studies each year.
