      The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the implant fixation of the NANOS™ Neck
      Preserving Hip Stem (OHST Medizintechnik AG, distributed by Smith &amp; Nephew GmbH, Marl,
      Germany) by measuring the migration of the implant using the model-based roentgen
      stereophotogrammetric analysis (MBRSA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject required primary total hip arthroplasty unilateral or bilateral with a
             diagnosis of primary and secondary coxarthrosis, dysplasia coxarthrosis and
             post-traumatic necrosis of the femoral head confirmed by x-ray analysis. For bilateral
             subjects at least three months between surgical procedures were required.

          -  Subject was willing to consent to participate in the study and planned to be available
             for the follow-up examinations.

          -  Subject had normal motor function of the lower extremities, documented through
             clinical examinations and lack of signs of a neurological disease with changed motor
             function.

          -  Subject was 30 to 65 (inclusive) years of age at time of surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject had previous bone or soft tissue surgery of the affected hip except for
             arthroscopic surgery.

          -  Subject had a local or systemic infection.

          -  Subject had previously diagnosed osteoporosis.

          -  Subject had a femoral neck angle of &gt;145°.

          -  Subject had a femoral neck angle of &lt;125°.

          -  Subject had a disease of the cardiovascular system involving particularly reduced load
             capacity in the everyday life, counting as contraindication of physical stress
             (American Society of Anaesthesiologists' (ASA) Score 3 or 4).

          -  Subject had a documented allergy against elements of the implanted device.

          -  Subject had a neurological disease with changed motor function.

          -  Subject was pregnant.

          -  Subject had a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 30.

          -  Subject suffered from alcoholism or addictive disorders.

          -  Subject needed a revision hip arthroplasty.

          -  Subject had an insufficient command of the language to understand patient information
             and consent.
