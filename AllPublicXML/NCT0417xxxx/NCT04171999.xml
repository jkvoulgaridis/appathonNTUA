  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CommunityRx-Hunger (CRx-H) is a hospital-based intervention that addresses food insecurity
      and other health-related social needs such as transportation, housing, utilities, and safety.
      Study team members are recruiting caregivers at the time of their child's hospital admission
      at a large urban children's hospital. For Aim 1, the primary outcome is self-efficacy among
      food insecure caregivers compared to those who receive the usual standard of care. For Aim 2,
      the primary outcome is satisfaction with care compared between food secure and food insecure
      caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CommunityRx-Hunger (CRx-H) is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial aimed at
      increasing self-efficacy among caregivers with food insecurity in the household. CRx-H is
      recruiting primary caregivers of hospitalized children at a large urban children's hospital
      at the time of admission. Aim 1: Researchers are studying whether the intervention will
      increase self-efficacy among food insecure caregivers compared to those who receive the usual
      standard of care. Aim 2: Researchers will enroll and randomize caregivers with and without
      food insecurity to the intervention to compare satisfaction with care.

      Eligible, self-identified caregivers will complete an in-person baseline survey in the
      hospital (face to face), followed by phone surveys at 7, 30, 90, 180 days, and 12 months.
      Caregivers randomized to the intervention will receive a tailored list of resources to
      address food insecurity and other health-related social needs, plus a brief educational
      component delivered by a trained member of our research team. Cases will receive a &quot;booster&quot;
      dose of the resource list prior to discharge. After discharge, cases will receive proactive
      text messages about those same community resources.

      All caregivers (regardless of research arm) will receive a series of text messages related to
      the study such as reminders to schedule the phone survey with a member of the research team.

    <description>Self-efficacy is measured by Bandura's Self-Efficacy Scale which asks, &quot;How confident are you in your ability to find resources in your community that help you manage your health?&quot; Responses will be assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all confident&quot; to &quot;completely confident.&quot;</description>

    <measure>(Aim 2) Caregiver satisfaction with hospital care</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with hospital care is measured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers Survey (HCAHPS); &quot;Child HCAHPS&quot; which includes 8 items plus one item added by the research team for a total of 9 items. Response options are &quot;Yes, definitely,&quot; &quot;Yes, somewhat&quot; and &quot;No.&quot; The items ask about the child and the hospital related to their recent stay.</description>

    <description>The CRx-H Intervention provides &quot;dosages&quot; of health content that offer assistance for food insecurity and other health-related social needs. A caregiver randomized to the intervention will receive a hard-copy print-out of their tailored list of resources to address food insecurity. A member of our research team will deliver this list and provide a brief educational component which includes: a brief, structured script about the common problem of food insecurity in households with children and co-occuring HRSNs, review of the resource list which includes nearby, vetted resources to address these needs and coaching on how to activate resources on the list. Prior to discharge, the caregiver will receive a duplicate copy of the list of resources. After discharge, the caregiver will receive text messages at a frequency based on the Critical Time Intervention (CTI) Model, from baseline to 3 months post discharge, in order to receive ongoing support by a research team member.</description>
