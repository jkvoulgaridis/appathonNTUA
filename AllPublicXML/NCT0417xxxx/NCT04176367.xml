  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a bioequivalence study to support a generic consistency evaluation program,
      initiated by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2015, for the evaluation of
      quality and efficacy of the products manufactured in China. Related guidance was issued by
      Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) on 27 Nov 2015 named &quot;Use pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter as
      endpoint for chemical generics bioequivalence (BE) study&quot;.

      Nicergoline localized product is manufactured at Pfizer Dalian China, while the reference
      product is manufactured at Pfizer Italia S.r.l., Italy. The selected strength of 10 mg tablet
      is the marketed strength in China, and the selected dose of 30 mg (3 x 10 mg tablet) is one
      of the commonly used clinically approved daily doses with good tolerability profile.

      In each group, participants will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment sequences according
      to a computer generated randomization schedule. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2
      periods, separated by a washout period of at least 7 days between the first day of each
      period.

          7. Participants need to be CYP2D6 non-poor metabolizer (which includes EM, IM and UM) as
             confirmed by genotype (see Section 8.7.1).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Medical Conditions:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy,
             appendectomy).

          3. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;
             positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B surface
             antibody (HepBsAb); hepatitis B virus e antigen (HepBeAg); hepatitis B virus e
             antibody (HepBeAb); hepatitis B core antibody (HepBcAb), hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb)
             or treponema pallidum antibody (TPPA). Hepatitis B vaccination is allowed.

          4. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

             Prior/Concomitant Therapy:

          5. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within
             7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of
             investigational product. (Refer to Section 6.5 for additional details).

          6. Taking any medicinal product that changes the activity of hepatic enzymes within 28
             days prior to Screening, such as inducer of CYP2D6.

             Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:

          7. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).

             Diagnostic Assessments:

          8. A positive urine drug screen.

          9. Screening supine blood pressure (BP) &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;= 90 mm Hg
             (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is &gt;= 140 mm Hg
             (systolic) or &gt;= 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the
             average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.

         10. Baseline 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results
             (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 millisecond [msec], complete left
             bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial
             infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third
             degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias).
             If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate
             corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting corrected QT (QTcF) should be
             used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120
             msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted
             ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding
             participants.

             Other Exclusions:

         11. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).

         12. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day within 3 months of Screening; a positive urine nicotine test.

         13. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 400 mL or more within 60
             days prior to dosing.

         14. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

         15. History of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to ergot alkaloids, or to any
             of the excepients.

         16. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations
             section of this protocol.

         17. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or
             Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of
             the study.
