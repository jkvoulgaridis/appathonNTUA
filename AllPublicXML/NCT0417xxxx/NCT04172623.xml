  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use wearable technology to test the feasibility and efficacy of delivering a
      novel real-time smoking intervention to improve standard tobacco treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this project include evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and helpfulness
      of the real-time smoking intervention and to assess the preliminary efficacy of the real-time
      intervention as an adjunct to standard tobacco treatment. Rates of adherence, participant
      satisfaction, and perceived usefulness will be evaluated through post-treatment interviews
      and ratings. Biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence will be compared
      between the experimental and control groups at the end of treatment (week 8).

    <description>Self-reported patient satisfaction subjective ratings of the real-time intervention will use a scale created specifically for this study to assess the intervention. The 7 item scale uses a 5 point Likert scale and the sum total would indicate level of satisfaction. The highest score of 35, would indicate the highest level of satisfaction.</description>
