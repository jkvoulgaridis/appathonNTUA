    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the i-STAT TBI test for
      the proposed intended use; to assist in determining the need for a CT scan in patients
      presenting with suspected mild traumatic brain injury who are 18 years of age or older. The
      secondary objective of this study is the collection of additional data and specimens from all
      study subjects that may support other purposes related to the understanding of TBI.

        We will enroll patients presenting to the Healthcare Facility with a history of acute TBI
        within the last 12 hours (acute injury) in which the patient has sustained a traumatically
        induced* physiological disruption of brain function, as manifested by â‰¥ one of the
        following:

          -  Any period of loss of consciousness

          -  Any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident

          -  Any alteration of mental state at the time of the accident (feeling dazed,
             disoriented, and/or confused)

          -  Focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be permanent

               -  Traumatically induced includes the head being struck, the head striking an
                  object, or the brain undergoing an acceleration/deceleration movement without
                  direct external trauma to the head

          3. Subject presented to a health care facility or emergency department with a suspected
             traumatic brain injury resulting from an insult to the head by an external force

             (ED) discharge.

          7. Prisoners or patients in custody

          8. Patients on psychiatric hold

        Follow-up Branch Subject Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrollment in Acute Blood Biomarker Branch

          2. Subject or LAR provided informed consent for the Acute Blood Biomarker Branch and the
             Follow-up Branch

        Follow up Branch Subject Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Conditions or circumstances that would interfere with follow-up and outcome assessment,
        as determined by the principal investigator or delegate. Examples include:

          1. Significant polytrauma

          2. Major debilitating baseline mental health disorders (e.g. schizophrenia or bipolar
             disorder)

          3. Major debilitating neurological disease (e.g. stroke, cerebrovascular accident,
             dementia, tumor)
