  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To goal of this research is to assess the ability of Gallium-68 (68Ga) Prostate-Specific
      Membrane Antigen-11 (PSMA-11) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to
      increase diagnostic accuracy in localizing primary and metastatic lesions in patients with
      suspected prostate cancer and elevated Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS)
      scores and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA).

      This study is designed to evaluate the added value of 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT for detection of
      additional primary prostate cancer lesions compared to multiparametric magnetic resonance
      imaging (mpMRI) in a group of patients with elevated PI-RADS scores and PSA. We propose that
      the addition of early dynamic 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging to the more usual delayed imaging
      will enhance detection of primary lesions and additional lesions not detected on the mpMRI.
      In addition, the dynamic imaging will allow us to evaluate the kinetics of uptake in the
      prostate gland. It is possible that even in the absence of focal uptake, hyperemia of the
      gland could indicate the presence of an occult primary.

      A second purpose of this research is to examine the value of 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT in this same
      group of patients in detecting metastatic disease at initial staging in comparison with
      current standard of care imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI).

             least one lesion with a PI-RADS v2.1 score ≥ 4

          -  In men with PI-RADS v2.1 score 4, PSA should be ≥ 10 ng/mL

          -  Patients must be scheduled for biopsy or radical prostatectomy
