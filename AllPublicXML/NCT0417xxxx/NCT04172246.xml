    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of zanubrutinib in Japanese participants with mature B-cell
      malignancies.

      This study intends to assess the use of zanubrutinib as an investigational agent to develop
      new treatment options for Japanese participants with B-cell malignancies. No formal
      hypothesis testing will be performed given the small sample size.
