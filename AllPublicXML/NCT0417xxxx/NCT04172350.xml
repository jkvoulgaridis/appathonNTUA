      This study aims to develop a mobile app-based periopeartive intervnetion for women undergoing
      breast cancer surgery and examine the effectiveness of the program on participants' health
      outcomes of self-efficacy, anxiety and depression, pain and fatigue, quality of life, and
      satisfaction with perioperative care. This study also aims to explore the perceptions of
      participants on strengths and weaknesses of using the app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and Singapore. In
      addition to the disease itself, undergoing surgery is also a stressful event for patients.
      Many of them have physical and psychosocial challenges. A variety of psychosocial
      interventions have been developed to improve patients'/survivors' health outcomes with some
      intervention using mobile technology. However, there is no any smart-phone based solution
      that have developed a comprehensive perioperative solution for this group of patients.

      Aim: This study aims to (1) develop an Innovative Care-improvement Smartphone-based
      Perioperative Solution for Women Undergoing Breast Cancer Surgery (iCareBreast); (2) examine
      the effectiveness of the iCareBreast on participants' health outcomes of self-efficacy
      (primary outcome), anxiety and depression, pain and fatigue, quality of life, and
      satisfaction with perioperative care; and (3) explore the perceptions of participants on
      strengths and weaknesses of iCareBreast.

      Research Questions:

        -  Do the participants receiving routine care plus the iCareBreast report higher level of
           self-efficacy when compared to those receiving routine care alone?

        -  Do the participants receiving routine care plus the iCareBreast report lower levels of
           anxiety and depression when compared to those receiving routine care alone?

        -  Do the participants receiving routine care plus the iCareBreast report lower levels of
           postoperative pain and fatigue when compared to those in the control group?

        -  Do the participants receiving routine care plus the iCareBreast report higher level of
           quality of life when compared to those receiving routine care alone?

        -  Do the participants receiving routine care plus the iCareBreast report higher level of
           satisfaction with perioperative care when compared to those receiving routine care
           alone?

        -  What are the perceptions of participants on strengths and weaknesses of iCareBreast?

      Hypothesis As compared to the participants in the control group, those in the intervention
      group who receive routine care plus the iCareBreast will report a

        -  higher level of self-efficacy,

        -  lower levels of anxiety and depression,

        -  lower levels of pain and fatigue,

        -  higher level of quality of life, and

        -  higher level of satisfaction with perioperative care.

      Methods: A two-group pre- and post-test randomized controlled trial will be conducted. A
      total of 112 eligible women who are diagnosed with breast cancer and are required for breast
      surgery will be recruited from the Breast Department in a public tertiary hospital in
      Singapore. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group
      (receiving routine care provided by the hospital plus iCareBreast) or the control group (only
      receiving routine care provided by the hospital). Outcomes of self-efficacy, anxiety and
      depression, pain and fatigue, quality of life, and satisfaction with perioperative care will
      be measured by relevant valid and reliable instruments at two time-points (baseline and
      post-test). Around 15 participants in the intervention group will be invited to participate
      in semi-structured interviews to explore their opinions on the iCareBreast. Quantitative data
      will be analyzed by SPSS and qualitative data will be analyzed by using content analysis.

      Significance of the study: This study will develop the iCareBreast, which will provide a
      platform for women undergoing breast cancer surgery to receive education about the disease,
      physical, psychological and social support as well as to enable interactions between health
      care workers and patients. This study will generate the preliminary effects of the
      iCareBreast to improve the aforementioned health outcomes of participants, which will be used
      to guide the change of future clinical practice to improve patient care. Mobile health holds
      promise as a low-cost communication tool for enhancing patient engagement and allowing
      healthcare providers to monitor recovery progress. This study will also inform the need for
      further studies for the implementation of similar solution for patients with other surgical
      needs.

    <intervention_model_description>A two-group pre- and post-test randomized controlled trial will be conducted. A total of 112 eligible women who are diagnosed with breast cancer and are required for breast surgery will be recruited from the Breast Department in a public tertiary hospital in Singapore. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group (receiving routine care provided by the hospital plus iCareBreast) or the control group (only receiving routine care provided by the hospital) using a block randomisation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The principal investigator will generate the randomisation number and randomisation sequences according to the block randomisation method. The randomly generated sequences would be used for recruitment of the participants, who will be assigned in successive order according to the sequence. Opaque and sealed envelopes containing slips of paper indicate the randomly allocated group. One research assistant will recruit participants and conduct randomisation and another research assistant who is blind from the group allocation will collect post-test data. Through these carefully deliberated processes, randomization and allocation concealment will be ensured.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Participant's self-efficacy will be assessed at baseline (about 2 weeks before surgery) and assessing changes between baseline and 2 weeks after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's self-efficacy level will be measured using the 10-item General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale. The total score for GSE is tabulated by the sum of all scores of each component. The scoring system ranges between 10 and 40. The higher the score achieved, the higher the level of self-efficacy (Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Participant's anxiety and depression will be assessed at baseline (about 2 weeks before surgery) and assessing changes between baseline and 2 weeks after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's anxiety and depression levels will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS consists of 14 items: 7 items measuring depression and the other 7 items measuring anxiety. The response ranges from 0 (no problem) to 3 (high level of problem). The total score ranged from 0 to 21 with the higher score indicating more anxiety or depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's pain and fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Participant's pain and fatigue will be assessed at baseline (about 2 weeks before surgery) and assessing changes between baseline and 2 weeks after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) will be used to measure participant's pain and fatigue level in this study. The MFSI-SF consists of 30 items. Respondents indicate the extent to which they have experienced each symptom during the preceding one-week period (0 = not at all; 4 = extremely). Ratings are summed to obtain scores for 5 subscales (general fatigue, physical fatigue, emotional fatigue, mental fatigue, and vigor) with the higher score indicating worse symptom.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Participant's quality of life will be assessed at baseline (about 2 weeks before surgery) and assessing changes between baseline and 2 weeks after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's quality of life will be measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment-QOL questionnaire and breast cancer specific module (EORTC QLQ-BR23). The format uses Likert scales, with scoring from 1 ('not at all') to 4 ('very much'). The EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a breast-specific module that comprises of 23 questions to assess body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, future perspective, systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms and upset by hair loss. The scoring of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 was performed according to the EORTC scoring manual. All scores were linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale with a higher functional score representing a more healthy level of functioning, while a higher symptom score represents a worse symptom/problem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with perioperative care</measure>
    <time_frame>Participant's satisfaction with perioperative care will be assessed around 2 weeks after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>A 6-point Ordinal Descriptive Scale (ODS) for assessing patients' satisfaction with perioperative care from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied) will be used to assess patients' self-reported level of satisfaction with perioperative care they received.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Process evaluation interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Semi-structured interviews will be conducted around 2 weeks after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>A semi-structured interview guide will be used to interview about 15 participants from the intervention group for their opinion on the strengths, weaknesses of the iCareBreast, as well as their suggestions for improvement.</description>

    <description>The iCareBreast BuddyCare mobile app is an interactive surgery preparation and recovery app for patients. It is a patient-centric care coordination and patient engagement mobile app that supports patients' perioperative journey. The app provides day-to-day information throughout the perioperative journey to patients from 2 weeks before surgery to 2 weeks after the surgery. Meanwhile the healthcare professional can monitor patients' use of the app. That is, the iCareBreast App provides patients with all the information about the surgery-related procedure and treatment via an efficient, user-friendly and interactive timeline. Patients will receive pop-up reminders daily for them to use the app. The objective of this app is to allow each patient to focus on caring for herself as a patient.</description>
