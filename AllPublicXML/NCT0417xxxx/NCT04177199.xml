  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational, prospective real-world evaluation will estimate and characterize the
      heart-failure related clinical workload burden associated with implementing a new care
      pathway (Triage-HF Plus) for remote monitoring and management in a cohort of device patients
      at 3 hospital sites in North West England as compared to the heart-failure related clinical
      workload burden prior to using this new care pathway. Triage-HF Plus incorporates the
      Triage-HF algorithm which is a device-based algorithm that uses the input from the integrated
      device diagnostics to detect changes in physiological parameters which may indicate an
      individual's increased risk of heart failure event in the 30 days after a high Triage-HF
      score.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Adult patients aged &gt; 18 years with Medtronic CareLinkÂ® and Triage-HF compatible cardiac
        device in situ undergoing remote monitoring.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient implanted with a Medtronic ICD, CRT-D, or CRT-P device that is Triage-HF
             compatible and capable of automated transmission. Note: Remote monitoring data will
             not be available for 60 days post a new or replacement implant but patients can be
             enrolled in the evaluation any time after implant.

          -  Patient (or patient's legally authorized representative) is willing and able to
             provide written informed consent.

          -  Patients with CareAlerts already turned ON will be included in the prospective part of
             the evaluation but their data may be excluded from the pre-Triage-HF Plus (current
             state) data analysis.

          -  Patients willing and able to have CareLink monitor active at all times.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is enrolled in another conflicting evaluation/study that could confound the
             results of this evaluation by increasing clinic workload burden for that patient
             and/or impact clinical interventions and patient outcomes

          -  All patients with non-Triage-HF compatible devices

          -  All patients with devices that require manual transmission (non-automated)

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol, including follow-up visits
             and CareLink transmissions.
