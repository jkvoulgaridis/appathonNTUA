  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite broad advancements in endocrine therapy for ERα+ breast cancer, resistance ultimately
      develops. A common driver of resistance are known ESR1 mutations that lead to constitutively
      active receptor signaling and transcriptional regulation that is always &quot;turned on&quot; despite
      the absence of estrogen. Patients with ESR1 mutations are expected to have decreased binding
      affinity for tamoxifen and thus may be underdosed on standard therapy. [18F]-fluoroestradiol
      Positron Emission Tomography/Computed tomography (FES-PET/CT) imaging is a novel functional
      imaging technique that can non-invasively measure ERα expression and inhibition in metastatic
      ERα+ breast cancer. The proposed a pilot study uses FES-PET/CT imaging to measure ERα
      blockade to determine the optimal dose of tamoxifen in patients with ESR1 mutations.

    <description>Reduction in FES uptake will be described and analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Rates or proportion of responses at each dose level will be provided in data listings. If the SUVmax for all 5 target lesions have decreased by &gt; 75% or all 5 lesions have SUVmax&lt;1.5 on the second scan, then these participants will be prospectively defined as having complete FES blockade. If the SUVmax for any of the 5 lesions has not decreased by &gt; 75% or if any new lesions arise with SUVmax ≥1.5, then these subjects will be defined as having incomplete FES blockade.</description>

             grade 1.

          -  History of cerebellar disorders, ataxia, and uncontrolled seizures unless related to
             transient medical condition and in investigator's opinion is not an active medical
             issue.

          -  History of venous thrombosis/thromboembolic event, including pulmonary embolism and
             stroke.

          -  Have a heart-rate corrected QT interval (using Fridericia's formula) (QTcF) ≥ 470msec
             or other factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g.,
             heart failure, chronic hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome).

          -  Are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval, unless they can be
             transferred to other medications ≥ 5 half-lives prior to dosing or unless the
             medications can be properly monitored during the study. If equivalent medication is
             not available, QTcF should be closely monitored.

          -  Tamoxifen has demonstrated vaginal bleeding, birth defects and fetal loss in pregnant
             women. Tamoxifen use during pregnancy may have a potential long-term risk to the fetus
             of a Diethylstilbestrol syndrome (DES)-like syndrome. Women of childbearing potential
             (WOCP) must not be pregnant (confirmed by a negative urine/serum pregnancy test within
             14 days of tamoxifen treatment). In addition, a medically acceptable method of birth
             control must be used such as an intrauterine device (IUD), use of a double barrier
             method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or
             cream), or total abstinence during the study participation and for 3 months after last
             dose of study drug. Women who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically
             sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) are not
             considered to be WOCP.

          -  Ongoing treatment with other investigational agents. Participants cannot be receiving
             concomitant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, experimental therapy or any other therapy not
             otherwise outlined by the trial for the purposes of anti-cancer treatment.

          -  History of uterine malignancy unless participant has had hysterectomy with no evidence
             recurrent disease for ≥ 3 years from definitive therapy.

          -  Concurrent malignancy except for the following:

               -  Basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer

               -  In situ cervical cancer

          -  The following medications are contraindicated or must be used with caution.

               -  Contraindicated:

                    -  CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 strong inhibitors

                    -  CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 strong inducers

               -  Use with caution:

                    -  CYP2C9 sensitive substrates

                    -  CYP2D6 moderate inhibitors or inducers

                    -  CYP3A4 moderate inhibitors or inducers

        Note: Transdermal products designed for systemic delivery must be assessed for interaction
        potential. Topical products not designed to provide systemic delivery (including inhaled
        products, ophthalmologic products and transvaginal preparations) do not need to be
        considered.

        Contraindicated medications are not allowed. Participants taking these concurrent
        medications are ineligible unless they can discontinue or switch to alternative medications
        prior to initiation of study drug (at least 5 half-lives).

        Use with caution agents are permitted if a) discontinuation is not feasible or b) no
        acceptable alternatives are available as determined by the treating physician; however,
        caution should be used. Consider monitoring by symptoms, labs or drug levels and dose
        adjustments of the medication.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent clinically significant illness including, but not limited
             to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.
