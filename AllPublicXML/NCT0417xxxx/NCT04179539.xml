  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity) of V/Q PET/CT for the
      diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), using CT pulmonary angiography as a reference standard.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      V/Q PET/CT imaging is now possible by substituting 99mTc with 68Ga, a positron-emitting
      radionuclide, using the same carrier molecules as conventional V/Q imaging. Ventilation
      imaging can be performed with 68Ga-carbon nanoparticles using the same synthesis device as
      Technegas. Perfusion imaging can be performed with 68Ga-macroaggregated albumin
      (68Ga-MAA).Technical advantages of PET compared to SPECT include higher sensitivity, higher
      spatial and temporal resolution and superior quantitative capability. This offers the
      opportunity to improve the accuracy of V/Q imaging in patients with suspected PE, while
      decreasing the acquisition time.

      The aim is to perform a formal diagnostic accuracy study of V/Q PET/CT for PE, using CTPA as
      a reference standard.

      Patients with suspected acute PE undergo CTPA and V/Q PET/CT imaging within 24 hours.

      V/Q PET/CT images are not used for patients management.

      After completion of inclusion, central readings of scans will be conducted independently.

    <description>Patients with suspected acute PE undergo CTPA and V/Q PET/CT imaging within 24 hours. V/Q PET/CT images are not used for patients management.
After completion of inclusion, central readings will be independently conducted:
CTPA will be interpreted by two radiologists, blinded to the results of any clinical information or imaging test results. The results of this interpretation will be used as a reference standard.
V/Q PET/CT will be interpreted by two independant nuclear medicine physicians, blinded to the results of any clinical information or imaging test results (including the reference standard).</description>

    <description>Ventilation images are acquired after inhalation of Galligas prepared using a Technegas generator (Cyclopharm, Sydney, Australia). The patients is placed in a supine position and inhaled Galligas using the standard ventilation technique. Ventilation images are then acquired. Without the patient moving, 68Ga-MAA are then injected. Perfusion PET images are then acquired</description>
