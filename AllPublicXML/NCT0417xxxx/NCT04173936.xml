      Aims: Examine the effects of a community Tai Chi program on measures of balance and
      sensorimotor function.

      Methods: In a pre-test and post-test design, balance was measured in older adults (N=344;
      73.4±7.4 years) with 30-second chair stand, timed-up and go, and 4-stage balance test
      following a 12-week community-based tai chi intervention. Balance measures and additional
      sensorimotor measures, including hip abductor electromechanical delay and hip proprioception,
      were measured in a smaller sample of older adults (n=11; 67.3±3.7 years).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip joint proprioception error</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The magnitude of proprioception error was measured on the participant's dominant lower extremity with a custom-built device25,51 that allows for rotation around the axis of a semi-goniometer to measure proprioception in the transverse plane at the hip joint. Proprioception was assessed by measuring the accuracy of actively pointing a marked line on the second toe to target angles along the semi-goniometer during two conditions, a vision condition and an occluded vision condition.</description>
