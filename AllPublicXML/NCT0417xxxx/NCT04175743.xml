  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess safety, tolerability, and PK of CT-044 HCl in normal
      healthy volunteers, in a traditional sequential multiple ascending dose paradigm. The
      multiple-dose escalation is designed to mimic the manner in which the product (CT-044 HCl)
      would be used to manage ongoing pain in patients (i.e., multiple dosing).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive CT-044
      HCl or placebo in three successive dose escalating cohorts of 8 subjects each (2 placebo and
      6 active drug per dose level). Subjects will receive multiple oral CT-044 HCl doses for 7
      days. Subjects will be monitored in-house for vital signs, physical examination,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), safety laboratory testing and documentation of adverse signs and
      symptoms. Serial blood and urine samples will be collected to evaluate CT-044 HCl levels in
      plasma and urine.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Trial Unit on the day prior to dosing (Day
      -1) and remain in house until Day 9 (discharge day). Subjects will return to the Clinical
      Trial Unit on an outpatient basis for follow-up (Day 13, ± 1 day).
