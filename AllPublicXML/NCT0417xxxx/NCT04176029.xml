  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort study, with 171 children admitted for severe malaria that will be
      included in the cohort. The study will take place in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the prevalence of five pre-specified pulmonary diagnoses
      that can be facilitated by the use of LUS (normal lung or acidotic breathing, ARDS,
      concomitant pneumonia, hydrostatic pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion).

      A prospective cohort study, with 171 children (between 1 - 14 years) admitted for severe
      malaria that will be included in the cohort. The study will take place at the Maluku District
      Hospital, located in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.

      Lung ultrasound will be performed on admission, h24, and unscheduled timepoints (in case of
      respiratory deterioration during hospital stay). Lung auscultation and peripheral capillary
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be assessed at each time points. All children will be observed
      from admission to hospital discharge. At 30 days a phone call will be made by the study staff
      to follow up clinical conditions of the child.

      The total duration for each subject's participation in the study is approximately 1 month.
      The study period is approximately 12 months
