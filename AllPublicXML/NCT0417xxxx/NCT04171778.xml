  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that lifestyle intervention consisting of a whole food,
      plant-based (WFPB) diet and group education will favorably impact outcomes germane to
      individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b and 4, including blood pressure
      control, amount of proteinuria (protein in the urine), and preservation of glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR). In addition, this study will assess weight and body composition,
      diabetic control in subjects with diabetes as well as CKD, and quality of life. Safety of a
      WFPB diet in subjects with CKD will be tested with respect to the development of elevated
      serum potassium and phosphorus, hypoalbuminemia (low blood protein), hypotension (low blood
      pressure), and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). An exploratory aim is to test the effects of a
      WFPB diet on the microbiome of subjects by collecting and analyzing stool samples.

    <intervention_model_description>The initial phase of the study will be a three month randomized clinical trial of a whole food plant based nutrition program vs. usual care in patients with chronic kidney disease. Subjects randomized to the intervention arm will start the nutrition program as soon as they are able.
Subjects assigned to the control arm will be placed on a 'wait-list' to start the nutrition program after they undergo three months of testing during their usual care, which consists of routine CKD care as directed by their primary nephrologist. After a 3 month 'wait', they will start the same plant-based nutrition program as the intervention arm subjects.
Both experimental and control group subjects will be followed for a total of 9 months after starting the plant-based dietary intervention. Thus, in addition to the 3-month randomized control trial, there will be data from a 9-month single arm clinical intervention.</intervention_model_description>
