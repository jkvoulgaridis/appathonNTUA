  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multi-center, open-label, randomized phase 1b, active-controlled safety and
      efficacy study of oral administration of tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide or
      abiraterone/prednisone (phase 1b) versus enzalutamide or abiraterone/prednisone alone in
      asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects with progressive, metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on either abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or
      apalutamide or who are second generation anti-androgen treatment naive, and who have not
      received chemotherapy for mCRPC. This study is designed to determine the recommended phase 2
      doses (RP2D) of tazemetostat in combination with either enzalutamide or
      abiraterone/prednisone, based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and
      efficacy profiles.

          6. Metastatic prostate cancer disease, documented by imaging.

          7. Must have undergone bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) or be willing to

         11. Subjects must refrain from donating sperm starting at the planned first dose of
             tazemetostat until 3 months following the last dose of tazemetostat, 3 weeks following
