  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with special needs (e.g. autistic spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder) are found to have sustained attention problems. Several behavioral interventions
      have been carried out in the past to improve this situation. However, these interventions are
      often involved a high administration cost. Recently, researchers have been focusing on
      training the eye gaze fixation using the eye-tracking training games, as some of the research
      studies reported a correlation between atypical eye gaze patterns with poor sustained
      attention. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      computerized eye-tracking attention training. Two batches of 48 primary school students will
      be recruited from email and the subject pool of the Department of Psychology of The Chinese
      University of Hong Kong. Participants are dividedly randomly and equally into either
      intervention or control group. Participants in both groups will undergo pre- and
      post-assessments measuring the executive function and attention before and after the
      intervention, respectively. However, there will be eight eye-tracking training sessions for
      the intervention group, but only the assessments are received in the control group. It is
      hypothesized that after the training, the performance of the training games and assessments
      will improve, indicated by increasing accuracy rates, as well as the reaction time of the
      tasks. The results would provide important information on the value of computerized eye gaze
      training and would guide the direction of interventions that target on improving the
      sustained attention and impulse control of children with special needs.
