  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries and takotsubo
      syndrome often have high levels of stress and anxiety. At present there are no treatment
      alternatives in this group of patients. Previously, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
      primarily aiming at relieving stress, has been shown to decrease morbidity in patient with
      myocardial infarction with obstructive coronary arteries. The present open randomized study
      aims to decrease stress and anxiety in patients with myocardial infarction with
      non-obstructive coronary arteries and takotsubo syndrome by an internet-based (CBT) focusing
      on stress and anxiety.
