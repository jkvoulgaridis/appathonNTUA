  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood
      and an important cause of acquired disability in children . Despite the heterogeneity, all
      forms of JIA are characterized by prolonged synovial inflammation that can cause cartilage
      and bone damage, with severe impairment of physical function and impact on the quality of
      life. The presence of joint involvement in JIA may be expressed by ultrasonography findings
      such as synovial proliferation, effusion, cartilage thinning and bone erosions. US has
      demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting synovitis compared to clinical examination MSUS
      is commonly regarded as a very useful tool in children, as outlined by the results of recent
      national and international surveys among pediatric rheumatologists .For most of the
      respondents, MSUS owned particular relevance for the ability to detect subclinical synovitis
      and to improve the classification of patients in JIA subtypes, as guidance to intraarticular
      corticosteroid injections and for capturing early articular damage. In addition, some
      specific joints were considered as most suited to be studied by MSUS, specifically the
      midfoot, the ankle, the hip, the wrist, the small joints of hands and feet. .
