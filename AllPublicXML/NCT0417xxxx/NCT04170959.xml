  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study the effect of metformin when added to definitive locoregional radiotherapy on
      locoregional control and relapse rate in stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients
      receiving sequential chemoradiotherapy. Try to identify subsets of patients who derive
      maximum benefit of adding metformin to radiotherapy using innovative biomarkers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of oral metformin during radiotherapy is thought to decrease the hypoxic
      fraction of tumour cells, improving radiosensitivity and promoting apoptosis, resulting in
      better outcome. This hypothesis will be evaluated in a trial with randomized design. All
      patients willing to participate will receive definitive radiotherapy, either in combination
      with metformin (arm C) or without metformin (arm B). Patients who refuse to participate in
      the randomized part can be included in the observational arm of the study (arm A). In
      addition, the validated biomarker of tumour hypoxia (18F-HX4 PET/CT scintigraphy
      (18F-flortanidazole positron emission computed tomography) and biomarkers of resistance,
      apoptosis and glucose metabolism will be evaluated for their potential predictive value.
