  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish a pilot randomized, crossover study on applying 2 constraint-induced movement
      therapy (CIMT) interventions in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy after botulinum toxin
      injection during preschool education.

    <textblock>
      This study was designed to be a pilot study on the use of 4-week 2-hours/day and 2-week
      4-hours/day CIMT interventions in children with hemiplegic CP after a BoNT-A injection in
      preschool education, and compared the effects and psychological stress of CP children
      relative to the 2 CIMT programs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        hemiplegic or quadriplegic CP children were under a regular rehabilitation program with
        BoNT-A injections. They were classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System level
        I and II, aged between 3 and 6 years old, with at least below average mentality, and were
        in mainstream preschool education; the extension of their hemiplegic wrist and
        metaphalangeal joint was greater than 10 degrees.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children were excluded if they (a) could not understand or cooperate with the CIMT program,
        (b) had joint contracture of an upper limb, and (c) could not actively extend their
        hemiplegic wrist.
