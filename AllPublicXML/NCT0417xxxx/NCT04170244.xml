  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Everybody's skin has bacteria that normally lives on it. Previous research has shown that
      people with eczema have higher concentrations of a certain bacteria (S. aureus), especially
      when their disease is active. The purpose of this study is (a) to see if reductions in
      another skin bacteria (C. acnes) plays a role in the overgrowth of S. aureus in eczema
      patients, and (b) to examine how the types of bacteria present in the skin of patients with
      eczema or psoriasis change with disease activity.

        The healthy population will be defined as individuals with no personal history of or active
        case of any atopic disorder (e.g. allergic rhinitis, allergic sinusitis, AD, allergic
        asthma, or food allergy). These patients will be individuals seen in URMC Dermatology
        clinic for a non-infectious condition that does not affect the skin of the extremities.

        AD subjects must have moderate-to-severe disease defined as an Eczema Area and Severity
        Index (EASI) of ≥ 12. The psoriasis subjects will have moderate-to-severe disease defined
        as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index of ≥ 7. The healthy controls will be recruited to be
        age- and gender-matched to those with inflammatory skin diseases. Subjects will be
        recruited from URMC Dermatology clinics at Red Creek and Collegetown.
