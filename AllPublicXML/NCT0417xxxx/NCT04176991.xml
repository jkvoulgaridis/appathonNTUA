      Single Ascending Dose (SAD), Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Study.

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of CTI-1601 in subjects
      with Friedreich's ataxia.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CTI-1601 following increasing single doses of
           subcutaneously (SC) administered CTI-1601.

        2. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of CTI-1601 following increasing single doses of
           SC administered CTI-1601.

      CTI-1601 or Placebo - Dose/Mode of Administration: Single Dose/Subcutaneous

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has genetically confirmed Friedreich's ataxia diagnosis, homozygous GAA repeat
             expansions, with repeat sizing (if available) included on diagnostic report.

          2. Subject is male or female, 18 years of age or older at screening.

             feet with or without some assistive device (cane, walker, crutches, self-propelled
             wheelchair) and (a) be able to sit upright with thighs together and arms crossed
             without requiring support on more than two sides; (b) be able to transfer from bed to
             chair independently or with minimal assistance if, in the opinion of the investigator,
             the degree of physical disability does not result in undue risk to the subject while
             participating in the study; and (c) perform basic daily care, such as feeding
             themselves and personal hygiene, with minimal assistance.

          4. Subjects must weigh &gt; 40 kilograms (kg).

          5. Subjects must complete at least one trial of the 9-Hole Peg Test within 3 minutes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are confirmed as compound heterozygous (GAA repeat expansion on only one
             allele) for Friedreich's ataxia.

          2. Subject requires use of amiodarone.

          3. Subject used erythropoietin, etravirine, or gamma interferon within 3 months prior to
             screening.

          4. Subject use of investigational drug (other than CTI-1601) or device within 90 days
             prior to screening.

          5. Subject use of daily biotin supplementation that exceeds 30 mcg/day, either as part of
             a multivitamin or as a standalone supplement, within 7 days prior to study drug
             administration and/or throughout the entire study.

          6. Subject has clinically significant arrhythmia on electrocardiogram (ECG), or evidence
             of predisposition to significant ventricular arrhythmia on ECG, or evidence of active
             and unstable coronary artery disease.

          7. Male subject who has an ECG QTcF &gt; 450 milliseconds or female subject who has an ECG
             QTcF &gt; 470 milliseconds.

          8. Subject has a screening echocardiogram ejection fraction &lt;45 percent.

          9. Subject has a history of aspiration, aspiration pneumonia, or recurrent episodes of
             pneumonia (greater than or equal to 2 episodes of pneumonia) within the last 12
             months.
