    <textblock>
      The study aim is to examine the relationship between providing information to women prior to
      elective cesarean delivery and anxiety levels around surgery.

      the patients will be assigned into two groups - intervention and control. In the intervention
      group - the day before surgery the women will watch a pre-prepared video showing in detail
      the course of events around the operation.

      the level of anxiety, pain level and Intake of Analgesics will be compared between the two
      groups

      Women will be recruited for research at the time of admission preoperatively. According to
      randomization women will be divided into two groups - intervention and control In the
      intervention group - the day before surgery the women will watch a pre-prepared video,
      approximately 10 minutes in length, showing in detail the course of events around the
      operation - from the woman's perspective - from the time they were admitted to the
      department, preparation for surgery, entrance to the operating room, anesthesia procedure,
      surgery Itself, post-operative recovery and recovery course in maternity ward.

      The movie will be shown to the patient by one of the study investigators. In the control
      group - women will receive general information about the surgery as part of the routine
      informed consent process, without watching a pre- prepared film.

      the level of anxiety, pain level and Intake of Analgesics will be compared between the two
      groups

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in anxiety level between the two groups at one hour before surgery.</measure>

    <description>To assess a patient's anxiety response to a given situation, the investigators will use State Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of two sets of 20 different questions that can be answered from 1 to 4. The first (state subscale) assesses a current anxiety condition, while the second (trait subscale) assesses personality characteristics.
This questionnaire was found to be valid for use in a study of a pregnant women population. High scores indicate high levels of anxiety Although the outcome is the The difference in anxiety level between the two groups at one hour before surgery, the investigators will assess the baseline anxiety level and 8 hours after the surgery, for inter-group comparison.</description>

    <description>Cortisol blood levels taken at midnight (24:00) Although the outcome is the change from baseline level at midnight following the surgery, the investigators will assess the cortisol level one night after the surgery for inter-group comparison.</description>

    <time_frame>3 points: before watching the movie (t1), one hour before the surgery (t2), 8 hours after the surgery (t3).</time_frame>
    <description>To assess a patient's pain level, the investigators will use visual analog scale (VAS)- scale for patient self-reporting of pain. 0 represents no pain, 1-3 represents mild pain, 4-6 represents moderate pain, 7-10 represents severe pain). a lower pain level 8 hours after surgery is a better outcome Although the outcome is the change from baseline level at 8 hours after the surgery, the investigators will assess the pain level before the surgery for inter-group comparison.</description>
