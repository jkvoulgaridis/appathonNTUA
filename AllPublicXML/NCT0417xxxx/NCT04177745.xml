    <textblock>
      Background: This study was conducted to examine the effect of local hot and cold applications
      on pain, anxiety level, length of application, and vein evaluation prior to inserting PVC.

      Methods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted with patients who were hospitalised
      in the cardiology department of a university hospital. PVC was inserted, the researcher
      applied a hot or cold application to the catheter insertion site for one minute.

      Background: This study was conducted to examine the effect of local hot and cold applications
      on pain, anxiety level, length of application, and vein evaluation prior to inserting PVC.

      Methods: This randomised controlled trial was conducted with patients who were hospitalised
      in the cardiology department of a university hospital. The sample was comprised of 90
      individuals, including 30 in the cold application group, 30 in the hot application group, and
      30 in the control group receiving treatment in the Cardiology Clinic between November and
      December 2018.

    <description>Before PVC was inserted, the researcher applied a hot application to the catheter insertion site (inner surface of the forearm) using a hot pack for one minute. Then, the researcher made the second vein assessment and inserted a 20-G peripheral catheter into the inner surface of the forearm.</description>

    <description>The standard practice of the clinic was made. Accordingly, the researcher performed the vein assessment after the participants filled out the questionnaire, and then inserted the 20-G catheter into the inner surface of their forearm without any application. Afterwards, she assessed the pain and anxiety levels of the patients twice before and after the catheter insertion procedure.</description>
