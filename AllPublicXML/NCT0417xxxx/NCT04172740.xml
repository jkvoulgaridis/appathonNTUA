  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following treatment with Radiesse, many patients mention an improvement in skin texture This
      observation is independent from the improvement observed on their facial shape. There is
      therefore a need to identify and quantify changes in skin parameters following treatment with
      Radiesse

    <description>RADIESSEÂ® injectable implant is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, semi-solid, cohesive implant, whose principle component is synthetic calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) suspended in a gel carrier of sterile water for injection, glycerin and sodium carboxymethylcellulose. RADIESSE injectable implant has a CaHA particle size range of 25-45 microns. RADIESSE is available in 1.5cc and 0.8cc pre-filled syringes.
RADIESSE injectable implant is indicated for subdermal implantation for the correction of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds and it is also intended for restoration and/or correction of the signs of facial fat loss (lipoatrophy).</description>
