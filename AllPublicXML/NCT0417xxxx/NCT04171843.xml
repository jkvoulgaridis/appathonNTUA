      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose,
      dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of
      PBCAR269A in adults with r/r MM. Before initiating the study treatment PBCAR269A, all study
      participants will be administered lymphodepletion chemotherapy. The initial lymphodepletion
      chemotherapy regimen will be composed of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide during the
      Screening Period. On Day 0 of the Treatment Period, study participants will receive a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion of PBCAR269A. All subjects are monitored during the treatment
      period through Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR269A will be followed in a
      separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) study for 15 years after exiting this study.

    <intervention_model_description>In Phase I, 3 escalating dose groups will be enrolled and treated sequentially, with the possibility of a single de-escalation. Within each dose group, at least 3 and at most 6 study participants will be treated with a single dose of PBCAR269A using a standard 3 + 3 design. The starting dose of PBCAR269A will be 6 x 105 CAR T cells/kg body weight. Subsequent dose groups will be treated with escalating doses to a maximum dose of 6 x 106 CAR T cells/kg. In the absence of DLTs, the dose will be increased using a fixed-dose scheme.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To assess ORR to treatment with PBCAR269A through Day 360 will be noted using the IMWG response criteria.
The ORR is defined as the proportion of study participants meeting the definition of response within the study population to the response evaluable population. ORR will be summarized by number and percentage of study participants meeting the definition of ORR along with the corresponding exact 95% CIs. DoR, defined as the duration (days) from initial response to disease relapse, progression, or death will be descriptively analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The number of study participants achieving DoR at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months will also be calculated. Exploratory efficacy analyses include changes from Baseline in CBC counts, CAR T cells, cytokines, and CRP levels.</description>
