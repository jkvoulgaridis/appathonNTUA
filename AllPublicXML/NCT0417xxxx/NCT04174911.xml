      Subjects diagnosed with Endometriosis will be eligible for enrollment. During a Screening
      Period of 2 weeks, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed to determine if they are
      eligible to move into the Treatment Period.

      During Treatment, subjects will randomly receive either BOL-DP-o-08 or placebo TID for 16
      weeks. At the end of the treatment, a follow-up visit for safety assessments will be
      conducted 4 weeks after the termination visit.
