  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of major non-communicable diseases such as
      type 2 diabetes (7%), cardiovascular disease (6%), musculoskeletal disorders and some
      cancers, and has been proposed to be the 4th leading cause of death worldwide. Reduced
      physical activity leads to an impaired function of the hormone insulin and increased
      adiposity. Thus, the elimination of physical inactivity would remove between 6% and 10% of
      the major non-communicable diseases and increase life expectancy. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the effects of a short-term (2-day) period of reduced physical activity, with and
      without a proportional decrease in energy intake, on the action of insulin to regulate blood
      sugar fluctuations, appetite, and cardiovascular parameters (heart rate, cardiac output,
      stroke volume, blood flow, arterial blood pressure, peripheral vascular resistance) in
      response to food ingestion.
