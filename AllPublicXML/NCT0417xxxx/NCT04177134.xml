  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to obtain clinically meaningful data on survival and
      outcomes of all the patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) 5q types 1 through 4
      (according to international classification), being followed in the reference centers of the
      disease in France between September 1, 2016 and August 31, 2024. The registry will collect
      retrospectively and prospectively the longitudinal data of the long-term follow-up for child
      and adult patients, under real life conditions of current medical practice, in order to
      document the clinical evolution of patients (survival, motor, respiratory, orthopedic and
      nutritional), the conditions of use of the treatments, the mortality rates of treated and
      untreated patients, the tolerance of the treatments, adverse events in order to better define
      their places in the therapeutic strategy.

      As secondary objectives, the study aims:

        -  to estimate the frequencies of patients with SMA 5q types 1 through 4 who have being
           treated in the reference centers between September 1 2016 and August 31 2024;

        -  to describe overall demographic, familial, clinical, biological, and genetic
           characteristics of SMA 5q patients treated in all regions of France, by the type of SMA
           (type 1,2,3, and 4);

        -  to study the impact of proactive and symptomatic medical interventions (bracing, IPPB
           devices) and medications (vaccinations, anti-infectious, digestive, nutritional
           supplements) in the evolution of patients;

        -  to study the long-term evolution (survival, motor and respiratory functions, spinal
           shape, growth and nutritional function) of SMA 5q in treated and untreated populations,
           by new available therapies, throughout the register;

        -  to study mortality rate of SMA 5q in treated and untreated populations, by new available
           therapies, throughout the register;

        -  to identify and document the different therapeutic strategies by sub-populations and by
           discontinuation or follow-up of treatments;

        -  to evaluate prognostic factors of responses to therapies;

        -  to study the tolerance of treatments by type of treatments, by type of SMA and overall
           tolerance (including adverse events);

        -  to estimate the costs of care for SMA 5q patients in different groups (types, ages);

        -  to provide needful elements to evaluate the health care costs for the disease;

        -  to study the autonomy and the quality of life of patients depending on different
           therapeutic strategies;

        -  to study the impact of the disease on caregivers;

        -  to facilitate development of scientific research on SMA in the conduct of trials on new
           therapeutic strategies.
