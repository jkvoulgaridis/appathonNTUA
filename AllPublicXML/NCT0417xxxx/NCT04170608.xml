      This is a prospective, multi-center, safety and feasibility study. Subjects will undergo
      percutaneous PEF ablation for pulmonary vein isolation and at the clinical discretion of the
      investigator receive PEF ablation of additional arrhythmogenic locations. Subjects will be
      followed at 30 days, 75 days, 6 months and 12 months for adverse events, recurrence of
      arrhythmia after a 90-day Blanking Period and other relevant outcome measures.
