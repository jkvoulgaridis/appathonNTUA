  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood ADHD and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) are
      considered risk factors for subsequent substance abuse, and youth with both ADHD and ODD/CD
      are at greatest risk.

      However, the effects of treatment of ADHD with stimulant medications such as methylphenidate
      (MPH) and mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) on risk for substance abuse are poorly understood.
      The study team propose to use fMRI to study the effects of extended release mixed amphetamine
      salts (MAS-XR) in drug-na√Øve youth 7-12 years at low risk (i.e., ADHD only) and high risk
      (i.e., ADHD + ODD/CD) for substance abuse on the brain reward system, to better understand
      the potential impact of these medications on an aspect of brain functioning which is thought
      to underlie vulnerability to substance abuse.

          -  Youth with CD or severe ODD: CD or ODD + 2 symptoms of CD

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  major neurological/medical illness
