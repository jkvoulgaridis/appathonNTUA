      Background: Extralevator abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE) may cause various surgical
      complications including disruption of perineal wound, perineal hernia and adhesive
      small-bowel obstruction. Pelvic peritoneum reconstruction could prevent those complications,
      but it may not always be achievable, especially in patients with severe pelvic fibrosis after
      neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Previous study has reported the application of the pelvic
      peritoneum reconstruction using the bladder peritoneum flap in laparoscopic ELAPE. The aim of
      the study is to evaluate the short-term clinical, technical and safety outcomes of pelvic
      peritoneum reconstruction using the bladder peritoneum flap in laparoscopic ELAPE.

      Methods/Design: This is a single -center prospective cohort study and fulfill the IDEAL 2A
      stage principle. Rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant radiotherapy and about to undergo
      laparoscopic ELAPE will be included. Main exclusion criteria are being complicated with
      urgent complications, ASA grade &gt; 3 and accompanied with mental illness. Patients suffering
      rigid pelvis or huge perineal peritoneum defect, and having difficulty in primary perineal
      wound closure will be considered eligible for the baldder peritoneum flap (BPF) group;
      corresponding rectal cancer patients will be allocated to the control group. After informed
      consent, 10 patients are planned to be included in the BPF group. Standard laparoscopic ELAPE
      with pelvic peritoneal floor reconstruction using BPF are to be performed. The surgical
      safety is to be evaluated after one-year follow-up. Primary endpoints are the occurrence of
      intraoperative and postoperative complications of pelvic peritoneum reconstruction after
      ELAPE. Second endpoints are overall complication rate within 30 days after surgery, extent of
      small intestine falling down to pelvic cavity, and other follow-up consequences within 1 year
      after surgery.

    <textblock>
      In rectal cancers, the overall survival will benefit strongly if a negative incisional margin
      is reached. In order to pursue a negative margin, APR, expecially the extralevator
      abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE) which introduced by Holm et al had been used to improve the
      oncological outcome in T3 and T4 rectal cancer. However, ELAPE could bring a gaping hole
      beyond repair in the pelvic cavity, leading to serious perineal injury and small bowel
      dropping into pelvic cavity inevitably. Pelvic peritoneal defects can also result in perineal
      hernia and adhesive small-bowel obstruction (ASBO).

      Reconstruction the pelvic peritoneum could prevent the small intestine adhering to the true
      pelvis by keeping it in the abdominal cavity, thus decrease the occurrence of ASBO and other
      perineal complications. However, pelvic peritoneum reconstruction may not always be feasible
      especially in those patients who had received a neoadjuvant radiotherapy and suffered severe
      tissue fibrosis or those patients who have a large defect of pelvic peritoneum.

      Recently the investigators have reported a novel method to reconstruct the pelvic peritoneum
      under laparoscope in patients with a rigid pelvis. A bladder peritoneum flap was used to
      cover the defect of pelvic peritoneum. Previous attempts have proved the feasibility of the
      pelvic peritoneum reconstruction using the bladder peritoneum flap in laparoscopic ELAPE.
      This protocol is a further study to verify its short-term clinical, technical and safety
      outcomes.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the short-term clinical, technical and safety
      outcomes of pelvic peritoneum reconstruction using the bladder peritoneum flap in
      laparoscopic ELAPE.

      This is a multi-center, prospective development study. The method of PPR using the bladder
      peritoneum flap in laparoscopic ELAPE is at the development stage. And this protocol fulfills
      the requirement of IDEAL framework stage 2A. Approval of the ethics committee has been
      obtained from the ethics committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University (2019 No. 194).
      The present study was registered on the clinicaltrials.gov. Any technology amendments will be
      presented to the institutional review board for further assessment. Benefits and risks of the
      study will be informed to participants. Only participants who signed an informed consent form
      and agree to participate will be included in this study. Participants have the right to quit
      the study at any time without any reason. In emergency circumstances, surgeons have the right
      to end the study. Data of the details will be stored in a database and published after the
      trial.

    <description>Regarding to the pelvic peritoneum reconstruction, in control group, the pelvic peritoneum will be closed with running suturing. If not possible, the peritoneum covering the surface of the bladder will be secured on the anterior surface of the sacrum with nonabsorbable sutures at the level where the anatomic structure obliterates the pelvic entrance. If neither method was feasible, the pelvic peritoneum defect will be left unclosed.</description>
