  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic foot ulcer will be recruited and screened
      for participation in the study. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to either
      experimental or control group and undergo 10-weeks of treatment (as an addition to standard
      care) and 4 weeks of follow-up to evaluate the effect of chitosan gel on chronic wound
      (diabetic foot ulcer) healing.

          -  Presence of diabetic foot ulcer or an amputation wound that meets following criteria:

               1. Size of the wound 0,5 - 12 cm^2

               2. Wagner grade I or II

               3. Wound is not infected

               4. Wound present for at least 4 weeks

             the distance from other wounds must be at least 2 cm

          -  If there is an amputation wound present, it can be used for the purpose of this study
             if it fits the rest of the criteria

          -  Adequate perfusion (good, strong foot pulses). If foot pulses are weak, evaluation of
             perfusion pressures with Doppler ultrasound is performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known history of alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Patients presenting with Wagner Grade III or higher ulcer

          -  Patients with serious concomitant disease (cancer, heart failure ( NYHA class IV),
             severe anemia (Hb&lt;100 g/L), neoplasia)

             severe depression or psychiatric illness)

          -  Patients that will require surgical procedure to treat their ischemic condition on the
             limb where the wound is present as assessed by the doctor

          -  Excessive lymphedema that could interfere with wound healing (if there is mild edema
             treated with compression therapy the patient can be included)

          -  Patients diagnosed with autoimmune connective tissues diseases

          -  Previous treatment under this clinical protocol

          -  Participation in another clinical trial up to 30 days before the randomization visit.

          -  Receiving or scheduled to receive a medication or treatment which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, was known to interfere with, or affect the rate and quality of wound
             healing

          -  Medical condition likely to require systemic corticosteroids during the study period

          -  Allergic to shellfish, chitosan or one of ChitoCare product compounds
