    <textblock>
      A quality improvement (QI) study that integrates an adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)
      screening algorithm into pediatric primary care visit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are social determinants of health. ACEs include exposure
      to unhealthy parenting and family dysfunction. It is known that people who are exposed to
      adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are at increased risk of over 40 health problems; some
      of these include heart disease, lung disease, obesity, smoking, alcoholism, illicit drug use,
      depression, suicide, and violence. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that primary
      care providers screen for and address ACEs/social determinants of health as part of the
      routine primary care visit.

      Efforts are needed to develop and test algorithms that assess for ACEs in pediatric primary
      care and intervene as indicated. We have tested an ACEs screening instrument with hundreds of
      parents of 2-10 year old children in the pediatric primary care clinic at Vanderbilt without
      incident (please see IRB# 161987). The next step is a quality improvement (QI) study that
      integrates an ACEs screening algorithm into pediatric primary care visit.
