      A Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of three dose
      cohorts of 10 subjects (A: 10mg, B: 25mg, and C: 50mg). Dose escalation will not occur until
      safety data through Day 8 is reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). The study will
      consist of a twenty-eight day screening period and 8-hour clinic stay. Follow-up visits will
      occur on Days (±3 days) 4, 8, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 for all cohorts. Pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and anti-drug antibodies will be tested.

             injection

             • Note: A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless post-menopausal (≥ 1
             year without menses) or surgically sterilized via bilateral oophorectomy, or

             abstinence from sexual intercourse with men or use acceptable contraception during
             participation in the study

             mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW),
             mean platelet volume (MPV), and nucleated red blood cell count (NRBC CT), which are
             included in a complete blood count with differential, will not be exclusions.

          9. The urine dipstick results on protein, glucose and blood are negative or trace

               -  Note: Menstruating females failing inclusion criteria due to a positive blood on
                  urine dipstick may be retested following cessation of menses.

               -  Note: When a urine dipstick is more than trace positive for blood (whether a
                  menstruating female or other subjects), that subject would not be excluded if the
                  urine microscopic exam shows &lt;5 rbcs/hpf.

                  the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Laboratory values that are outside the range of eligibility but are thought to be
                  due to an acute condition or due to laboratory error may be repeated once.
