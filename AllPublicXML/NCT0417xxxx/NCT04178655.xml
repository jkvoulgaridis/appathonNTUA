    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of pre-operative treatment with IV Tranexamic Acid on
      post-operative digit function, in patients that underwent surgical repair of traumatic zone 1
      or zone 2 digit flexor tendon tear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peritendinous adhesions following repair of digital flexor tendons are a major postoperative
      complication, due to loss of motion and the functional disability that they cause.

      Patients who will present to Rabin Medical Center with acute traumatic Zone 1 or Zone 2 Digit
      flexor tendon injury, will be recruited to the study, given the patients' informed consent.

      Patients recruited to the study will be randomly assigned to either the study group or
      control group:

        1. Study Group - Intra-venous Tranexamic acid treatment

        2. Control Group - Placebo (Intra-venous normal saline 0.9%)

      All patients will be treated operatively with primary repair of the lacerated flexor tendon.

      All patients will be treated post-operatively with early controlled mobilization according to
      the Duran Protocol.

      Randomization of the patients will take place before surgery, in the following manner:

      half of the study population will be treated with IV Tranexamic Acid , the other half will be
      treated with or IV Normal Saline as Placebo.

      Either Tranexamic Acid or IV Normal Saline will be administered by the anesthesiologist
      present in the operating room, prior to tourniquet inflation.

      Each patient will be assigned a serial number, and 2 envelopes allocated to that serial
      number will be prepared in advance. The first envelope will be attached to the patient's
      file, and be given only to the anesthesiologist in the operating room. The second envelope
      assigned to the patient will remain closed until the end of the study, along with the study's
      documents.

      All study patients and hand surgeons will be blinded to the treatment received by the study
      population.

      Post-Operative measurements will be made by an orthopedic surgeon or occupational therapist,
      which will also be blinded to the treatment received by the study population.

      To ensure confidentiality, all study documents and data will be kept inside a locked closet,
      in a locked room in the orthopedic department

    <measure>Anatomic Result at 4-Months post-operatively</measure>
    <time_frame>Documentation will take place pre-operatively, and 4-months post-operatively during out-patient clinic follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the anatomical outcome for both Zone1 and Zone 2 tears will be achieved by measuring the Total Active Motion (TAM) using the American Society for Surgery of the Hand Criteria (ASSH).
Active flexion of the MCPJ, PIP and DIP joints are measured in degrees, and summed. Extension deficits in these joints are measured in degrees, summed, and deducted from the flexion measurements. The full TAM of a finger is 260 degrees: MCPJ 85 degrees, PIPJ 110 degrees and DIPJ 65 degrees The TAM of the affected side can be compared to the normal contralateral side, and expressed as percentage of return of motion.
The Change of the TAM from baseline will be recorded for at the planned serial follow-ups, as described below.</description>

    <measure>Extent of finger and hand swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>Serial documentation will take place pre-operatively, and post-operatively during out-patient clinic follow-ups on a planned basis: 2-weeks, 8-weeks, and 4-months post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Estimation of finger and hand swelling will be achieved by calculating a Swelling-Ratio (SR). Direct measurement of the circumference of both the affected and unaffected finger and hand palm will be made. Finger circumference will be measured in two anatomic locations: the middle of both the proximal and middle phalanx. Hand circumference will be measured on the level of the distal palmar crease. Above measurements will be documented in centimeters.
The SR will be calculated by dividing the circumference of the affected side by the circumference of the unaffected side.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength Result</measure>
    <time_frame>Serial documentation will take place post-operatively during out-patient clinic follow-ups on a planned basis: 2-weeks, 8-weeks, and 4-months post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Grip Strength is a widely-used clinical assessment tool , which gives a good global assessment of muscle strength, and delineates the impact of tendon injury on overall strength.
After flexor tendon repair, impairments are more common in isolated finger flexion than in overall handgrip strength. overall grip strength is the mainstay of strength assessment.
There are several standardized protocols to assess grip strength, one is performing the measurement with the elbow flexed 90 degrees, the forearm in neutral, and the Patient gripping the Jamar dynamometer at the second handle position. Estimation of hand grip strength will be achieved by calculating a Grip Strength-Ratio (GSR). Direct measurement of the Grip strength of both the affected and unaffected hands will be made. Above measurements will be documented in kilograms.
The GSR will be calculated by dividing the grip strength of the affected hand by the grip strength of the unaffected side.</description>

    <measure>Functional Result - DASH Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Serial documentation will take place post-operatively during out-patient clinic follow-ups on a planned basis: 2-weeks, 8-weeks, and 4-months post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Evaluation will be achieved using the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Questionnaire.
The DASH Score is the current most practiced scale for upper extremity functionality, and was extensively validated in numerous studies.
The Scale ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>

    <measure>Functional Result - PRWE Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Serial documentation will take place post-operatively during out-patient clinic follow-ups on a planned basis: 2-weeks, 8-weeks, and 4-months post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Evaluation will be achieved using the PRWE (Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation) Questionnaire.
The PRWE was originally developed in 1998 as a measure of patient-rated pain and disability, following Distal Radius or Scaphoid Fractures.
The Scale ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>
