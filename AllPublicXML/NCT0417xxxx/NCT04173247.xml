  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, randomized, open-label comparison pilot study to assess the
      feasibility and effectiveness of KeraStat Cream compared with routine skin care (RSC) in
      managing radiotherapy-induced early adverse skin reaction (EASR) in patients undergoing
      radiotherapy to the head and/or neck.

      Hypothesis: The use of KeraStat Cream in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck is
      feasible, tolerable, and reduces the severity of early adverse skin reaction in the treated
      region of interest.

      Primary Objective(s)

      • To determine the feasibility of the use of KeraStat Cream in patients receiving
      radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To determine the tolerability of KeraStat Cream in patients receiving radiotherapy for
           head and neck cancer compared to routine skin care.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of KeraStat Cream in reducing the severity of EASR in
           patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, compared to routine skin care.
           This will be performed by evaluating:

        -  Objective evaluation of EASR using the CTCAE Version 5.0 scale of radiation dermatitis,

        -  Patient-reported outcomes of radiation dermatitis using the PRO-CTCAE version 1.0, and

        -  Dermatologic-specific quality of life assessment

        -  To estimate the amount of KeraStat Cream used per patient and coverage on the skin.

    <measure>Completion Rate of Use of KeraStat Cream</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post treatment with radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of use of KeraStat Cream is measured by participant compliance with an average of 10 or more applications per week being classified as complaint. In each arm, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated around the estimate of compliance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Discontinuing Skin Care Regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post treatment with radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability is measured by the number of patients who discontinue skin care regimen due to intolerance for any reason. In each arm, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated around the estimate of tolerability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants with Grade 2+ Radiation Dermatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post treatment with radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Objective assessment of early adverse skin reaction defined as Grade 2+ using the CTCAE version 5.0 scale of radiation dermatitis will be compared between the KeraStat group and the RSC group at the end of treatment, using a Fisher's exact test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Radiation Skin Reaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post treatment with radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported assessment of skin toxicity using the PRO-CTCAE version 1.0 scale of radiation skin symptoms (skin dryness, itching, radiation skin reaction and skin darkening). Score scale is none to very severe and Yes or No for skin darkening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post treatment with radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item questionnaire to measure how skin problems have affected participants' lives. Scoring for each question ranges from 0-3 with very much scored as 3 and not at all or not relevant score as 0. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each questions resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a minimum score of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <measure>Number of Tubes of KeraStat Cream Used to Calculate Skin Coverage</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post treatment with radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Skin coverage will be calculated the number of tubes of KeraStat Cream used per week.</description>
