  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis and cancers of the upper digestive tract, colorectal and ENT share common risk
      factors. Liver cirrhosis can change the elimination of cancer drugs.

      Precise data on management and outcome of patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing
      chemotherapy are lacking. Most patients have been excluded from clinical trials evaluating
      conventional therapies.

      The study of tolerance, side effects, and outcome in patients with cirrhosis could help
      improve chemotherapy management for better tolerance and efficacy.

      The main objective is to estimate the frequency of liver cirrhosis among patients evaluated
      in CPR for ENT, upper digestive or colorectal cancer.

      Secondary objective includes the evaluation ofthe impact of cirrhosis on the management of
      chemotherapy by comparing cirrhotic patients' outcomes with a control group of matched
      non-cirrhotic patients.

    <description>Observational study in two parts:
Cross-sectional study of patients with digestive or ENT cancer with indication for conventional chemotherapy treatment according to management guidelines, the objective of which is to determine the frequency of cirrhosis.
Exposed/non-exposed cohort study of patients receiving a first course of conventional chemotherapy initiated in outpatient oncology clinic. (safety population).
Exposed subjects will be patients with cirrhosis, included consecutively. Non-exposed subjects will be non-cirrhotic patients. They will be selected non-consecutively according to the following criteria, for matching to exposed subjects: age (±5 years), type of cancer (digestive vs. ENT), treatment stage (curative vs. palliative). Two unexposed subjects will be selected for 1 exposed subject.</description>

        The patients selected are patients with ENT, upper digestive-tract cancer and colorectal
        cancer from 2 hospitals: the University Hospital of Lille and the Oscar Lambret Centre.

        The study population consists of patients with a theoretical indication of conventional
        chemotherapy according to the usual guidelines for the management presented in
        multidisciplinary board.

        Prospective follow-up will be carried out on the population of patients receiving effective
        administration of a first course of chemotherapy.

        Patients in theoretical indications who are not receiving chemotherapy will be included in
        the first part of the study, but prospective follow-up will not be performed in this
        population.

        Exposed subjects who have received a first course of chemotherapy will be followed
        prospectively.

        Non-exposed subjects will be matched according to age (+/-5 years), ECOG/WHO
        classification, chemotherapy protocol and tumour location and followed prospectively.
