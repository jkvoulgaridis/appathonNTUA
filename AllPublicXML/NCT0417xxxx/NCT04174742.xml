  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate whether younger subjects report pain with
      pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution) more often and/or at higher levels (greater
      intensity) than older subjects.This study will be carried out throughout the course of your
      chemotherapy treatment, which will be prescribed by your study doctor. Participation in this
      study will not affect your cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure pain using ESAS self-reported pain scores over the course of one week
      following each dose of pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution). At the end of that week,
      blood will be drawn from each subject to directly measure the WBC/ANC, which can then be
      compared to self-reported pain and evaluated for any correlation. Finally, subjects will be
      divided into two groups by age: 45 years or younger, and over 45 to look for any differences
      in pain or WBC/ANC measurements based on age.

    <description>It works by increasing neutrophil migration to counteract cytotoxicity. It is commonly administered to patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment. It has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of neutropenic fever, although without statistically significant impact on overall survival.</description>
