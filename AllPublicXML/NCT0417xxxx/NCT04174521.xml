      The investigators are extracting de-identified retrospective data from the Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center electronic health record for mother-child pairs. From this data,
      the investigators will study the association between mothers' weight before, during, and
      after pregnancy, as well as her weight change during those periods, and its association with
      the risk of her child developing obesity during the first 5 years of their life. Included
      mothers must be 18 years of age or older at the time of delivery with at least one weight
      measurement and at least one height measurement; they must have at least one child with
      weight/length measurements at birth and one additional same day height/weight measurement at
      or before 5 years of age.
