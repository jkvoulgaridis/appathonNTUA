  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)
      remains high during the era of effective triple therapy. The main clinical phenotypes of
      cognitive impairment are currently represented by asymptomatic neurocognitive neurocognitive
      impairment (ANI) and mild neurocognitive disorders (MND). In contrast, HIV-associated
      dementia has almost disappeared.

      Among the hypotheses to explain the persistence of such a high prevalence is the persistent
      activation of the immune system despite virological success. This chronic immune activation
      is believed to be responsible for an inflammatory response and therefore for accelerated cell
      aging. Several organ complications in HIV-positive patients have been associated with high
      markers of immune activation.

      Among the causes of chronic immune activation in virologically controlled patients, an
      imbalance in the intestinal flora is suspected. In fact, shortly after HIV infection, the
      virus causes significant apoptosis of intestinal lymphocytes, responsible for a loss of
      integrity of the intestinal barrier and an imbalance of flora, defined as &quot;dysbiosis&quot;.

      Loss of epithelial integrity and intestinal dysbiosis are suspected of causing systemic
      passage of bacterial fragments, of which lypopolisaccharide is best known, resulting in
      chronic activation of the immune system. Several studies suggest a link between digestive
      bacterial translocation and HIV-related neurocognitive disorders. An improvement in
      intestinal dysbiosis could therefore contribute to reducing immune activation and the
      severity of cognitive impairment. A recent study showed that probiotics can reduce levels of
      neopterin, a marker of monocytic activation, in the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-positive
      patients without neurological symptoms.

      Our objective is to evaluate the impact of probiotic supplementation on immune activation and
      cognitive performance in virologically controlled HIV-positive patients with a diagnosis of
      ANI or MND. The potential improvement of cognition through probiotic treatment could
      therefore improve their quality of life at a lower cost than a drug and without the risk of
      serious side effects.
