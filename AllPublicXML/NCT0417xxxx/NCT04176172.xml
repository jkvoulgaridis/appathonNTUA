  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advent of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
      substantially improved life expectancy but has also led to the critical need to address
      modifiable risk factors associated with cancer and cardiovascular disease, such as tobacco
      smoking. HIV-infected smokers lose more life-years due to tobacco use than they do to their
      HIV infection.

      There have been relatively few studies of tobacco use treatments for PLWHA and systematic
      reviews show that there are insufficient data to conclude that tobacco dependence
      interventions that are efficacious in the general population are efficacious for PLWHA.
      Further, many studies in this area have lacked randomization and a control group,
      infrequently used an intent-to-treat (ITT) approach and biological verification of tobacco
      abstinence, and lacked post-treatment follow-up.10 What investigators do know thus far is
      that behavioral interventions and the nicotine patch yield moderate effects on cessation; and
      2 recent placebo-controlled trials - one in France and one by this lab - found that
      varenicline is safe and effective for treating tobacco use among PLWHA, but yield quit rates
      that are substantially lower than those reported in the general population. Thus, there is a
      critical need to rigorously test novel ways to optimize tobacco cessation treatment for
      smokers with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking among PLWHA is a critical public health issue, with the rate of smoking 2-3 times
      greater than it is in the general population and the health risks of smoking outweighing
      those associated with the virus itself. Unfortunately, remarkably few studies have evaluated
      smoking cessation interventions for PLWHA and the available literature indicates that both
      behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation interventions yield modest effect sizes and
      quit rates that are considerably lower than in the general population. A sizable literature,
      including studies by our research team, indicates that using the nicotine metabolite ratio
      (NMR) to personalize the selection of medications for tobacco use and the MAPS intervention
      to augment adherence to these medications can optimize treatments for tobacco use among
      PLWHA. The NCI recognized the potential for clinicians to use the NMR to individualize
      cessation treatment in order to improve effectiveness
      (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget/plan/public-health) and the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) has endorsed MAPS as an evidence-based approach to increasing
      medication adherence among PLWHA. As such, this trial will test these intervention
      optimization strategies to determine if individually or together they can represent an
      effective approach to treating tobacco use in this under-served population of smokers. As a
      major advance for this area of work, the investigators will use rigorous methodology to
      evaluate these optimization strategies (i.e., a randomized design, biological verification,
      an ITT approach, and 6-month outcome assessments) and, overall, our approach is consistent
      with the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework, which has been used to identify
      intervention components that maximize cessation outcomes. This trial will also assess
      theoretically derived and empirically based mechanisms through which these optimization
      strategies affect cessation and explore sub-groups who are more or less responsive to these
      strategies. In the end, this trial, which is consistent with the Office of AIDS Research
      trans-NIH Strategic Plan for HIV and HIV-Related Research
      (https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/research-priorities), will determine if
      getting the right medication to the right person and making sure they adequately use the
      medication optimizes tobacco cessation treatments among PLWHA as a critical way to improve
      health outcomes for this population.

    <description>Standard behavioral smoking cessation treatment is an effective treatment for nicotine dependence. Treatment focuses on self-monitoring of smoking behavior, identifying smoking triggers and alternative trigger management strategies, relaxation, social support for non-smoking, and relapse prevention. Managed Problem Solving (MAPS) is a therapeutic process that involves the systematic delineation of a participant's medication adherence problems and construction of a series of individualized solutions that therapists and participants explore together. Participants will receive up to 5 therapy sessions (2 in person, 3 over the phone) over 8 weeks. The first session will directly address potential medication adherence barriers, and therapist and participant will collaboratively brainstorm ways to overcome these barriers.</description>
