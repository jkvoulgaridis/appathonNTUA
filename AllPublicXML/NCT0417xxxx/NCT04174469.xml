  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study report a unique case of severe intoxication in a child treated with oral ivermectin
      to prevent scabies infection. The ABCB1 gene sequencing found the child compound heterozygote
      for two nonsense mutations, one in each gene copy. The child had inherited from each parent
      one of the alleles. Each mutation generate a predicted truncated protein that likely lead to
      ABCB1 loss of function, and the undesirable effects observed.

      The study report a unique case of severe intoxication in a child treated with oral ivermectin
      to prevent scabies infection. The ABCB1 gene sequencing found the child compound heterozygote
      for two nonsense mutations, one in each gene copy. The child had inherited from each parent
      one of the alleles. Each mutation generate a predicted truncated protein that likely lead to
      ABCB1 loss of function, and the undesirable effects observed.

      While in some animals, nonsense ABCB1 mutations can lead to neurotoxicity of several
      ABCB1-substrate drugs, in humans, ivermectin was considered to have an especially high margin
      of safety, and nonsense mutations have never been reported before, nor has the neurotoxicity
      of ivermectin apparently caused by these two mutations never been reported before.

      This discovery is of critical importance for the child, since it dictates that clinicians
      would need to optimize any ABCB1 substrate-based therapy in the future. More generally, such
      information must be brought to the attention of clinicians' medics, and in particular
      infectious disease specialists, pediatricians, and general practitioners.

      It points the importance of pharmacovigilance, and the benefit of pharmacogenomic genotyping
      in well-defined phenotype, still too rarely considered in clinical practice before the
      implementation of a drug treatment.

      This work results from a multidisciplinary approach, combining several areas of expertise in
      clinical pediatrics, pharmacology, biology, and bioinformatics.
