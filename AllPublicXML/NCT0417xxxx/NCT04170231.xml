        All subjects admitted to the pediatric ICU at MSKCC will be included in this observational

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All children (â‰¥28 days old through 18 years of age) with an oncologic diagnosis
             admitted to the PICU at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

          -  An oncologic diagnosis will include those with a cancer diagnosis or those being
             treated at MSK for blood disorders, immunodeficiencies and complications of
             transplant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Preterm infants (&lt;44 weeks gestation at age of enrollment) as in these patients most
             bleeding etiologies are specific to the neonatal period and the bleeding assessment
             tool is not calibrated for this population

          -  Known limitation of care at enrollment (standing Do Not Resuscitate order), as the
             interventions and clinical outcome would be biased

          -  Pre-existing bleeding disorders
