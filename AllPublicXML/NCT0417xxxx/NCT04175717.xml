  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of critical illness might suffer from ongoing physical, cognitive and emotional
      impairments after being discharged home. Furthermore, several studies have shown that these
      patients might have a need for ongoing support. However, up until now, it is not known what
      the optimal follow-up programme for survivor of critical illness after discharge home should
      look like or which exact patient population would benefit the most. Due to these reasons, it
      is important to further investigate, how these patients can be optimally supported to recover
      from their critical illness.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess, whether a physiotherapy-led follow-up programme
      is feasible in adult survivors of critical illness after discharge home in the county
      hospital of Winterthur.

      Furthermore, the investigators evaluate the influence of this physiotherapy-led follow-up
      programme on health related quality of life, exercise capacity, general muscle strength,
      inspiratory muscle strength, anxiety and depression.

      All of the anticipated 20 patients will partake in the follow-up programme, which will
      consist out of a nine weeks exercise programme and four education sessions. During the
      exercise programme, the patients will exercise twice per week under supervision and once by
      themselves. The supervised exercise sessions will consist out of a combination of a
      cardiopulmonary and strength training and the unsupervised session will be a physical
      activity, which the participants like doing. Furthermore, they will participate in education
      sessions, where they learn things about the intensive care unit, the post-intensive care
      syndrome, relaxation techniques and how to carry on with exercising.

      The whole study will last about ten months and forms a part of a master thesis.

    <measure>Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be measured by the EQ-5D L5 self-complete paper version, which is a self-report questionnaire. Th questionnaire contains five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), with each five levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). The participants rate themselves in these levels. Additionally, they are also asked to rate their health on a visual analog scale from 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you could imagine).</description>

    <measure>Exercise capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise capacity will be evaluated by the six minute walking test, which is a self-paced walking test to assess submaximal functional exercise capacity. The result will tell us, how many meters the participant could walk in six minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>General muscle strength will be measured by the hand grip test with a Jamar dynamometer. The results will be reported in kilograms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inspiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory muscle strength will be evaluated by the CareFusion micro RPM, which measures the maximal inspiratory pressure at the level of the mouth. The results will be reported in centimeter of water.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of anxiety and depression will be assessed by the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), which is a self-administered questionnaire. It contains 14 items (seven to assess anxiety levels und seven to assess depression levels). Each item can be scored from zero to three, leading to a maximal score of 21. The higher a participants scores, the more likely he is to suffer from anxiety or depression (or both).</description>

    <description>In this study arm, the participants will receive a nine weeks exercise programme and four education sessions. During the exercise programme, the patients will exercise twice per week under supervision and once by themselves. The supervised exercise sessions will consisted out of a combination of a cardiopulmonary and strength training and the unsupervised session will be an activity, which the participants like doing. Additionally, when the patient shows a reduced maximal inspiratory pressure (indication for a reduced diaphragm strength), the patient will also be ask to do an inspiratory muscle training at home. Furthermore, they will participate in education sessions, where they learn things about the intensive care unit, the post-intensive care syndrome, relaxation techniques and how to carry on with exercising.</description>
