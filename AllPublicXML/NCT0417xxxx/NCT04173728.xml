    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, explorative, open-label study among 120 subjects(100 healthy, 20
      with Mets) will be recruited. All the subjects are assigned to four groups based on
      combinations of age, BMI and Mets condition. All the subjects will be given a 400ml standard
      meal with a macronutrient composition of 75g glucose, 60 fat and 20g protein and fasting and
      multiple postprandial time points samples (blood, urine and feces) will be collected. The
      primary objects of this study is to explore the metabolic homeostasis healthy condition of
      Chinese people through the capacity of the response to the meal. The study' protocol has been
      approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences.

      In this study 120 subjects(60 males and 60 females, aged between 20 and 70 years)
      including100 healthy subjects and 20 Mets subjects will be recruited. The healthy subjects
      will assigned to three groups as followed: 1) 20 subjects aged 20-29 years with normal body
      weight (18.5 ≤BMI＜24kg/m2); 2) 40 subjects aged 30-70 years with normal body weight (18.5 ≤
      BMI＜24kg/m2); 3) 40 subjects aged 30-70 years with overweight or obesity(BMI＞24kg/m2). All
      the 20 Mets subjects aged between 30-70 years will be assigned to the fourth group. On study
      days before the first blood draw, a cannula was placed and blood samples were taken at t = 0
      (fasting) and five time-points (t = 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h) after consumption of the standard
      meal. Subjects were not allowed to eat or drink until the last blood sampling, except from
      drinking water. At t = 0 ,1 and 2 h, the fingertip blood will be collected as well. Body
      composition will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). All these samples
      will be used to the assesment of blood chemistry, metabolomics, single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP), gut microbiota and etc.
