    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label study of AUSTEDO in study subjects with dystonia. The
      study will provide preliminary experience of the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity
      of AUSTEDO in study subjects with dystonia. Study duration will be up to 13 weeks from
      screening (Visit 1) to the post treatment evaluation (Visit 5). Treatment period from drug
      initiation to final on-treatment Visit will be 12 weeks, or less, as follows: during the
      ramp-up period, study drug will start at 12 mg/day (6 mg twice daily) and will be titrated
      weekly by 6 mg/day increments until either 1) the maximal allowable dose (48 mg/day) is
      reached, or 2) dose-limiting side-effects occur. In study subjects receiving a strong CYP2D6
      inhibitor, the maximum allowed dose of AUSTEDO will be 36 mg/day, reducing study duration
      (due to a reduction in the ramp-up period) to 11 weeks. Study subjects who experience
      dose-limiting side effects will be maintained on their maximum tolerated dose. Once the
      maximal dose is established for each participant, they will complete 6 continuous weeks on
      this dose (maintenance period), followed by a 1-week washout. For study subjects unable to
      titrate up to 48 mg/day due to side effects, the 6 weeks of maintenance will start once they
      reduce the study drug back to the maximum well-tolerated dose. Adverse events will be
      monitored throughout the study and will be reported after drug initiation. Dose reductions,
      suspensions, and withdrawals due to adverse events will be recorded. ECG readings will be
      measured at screening, during week 2, during the first week of the maintenance period
      (whenever this is established to be, typically week 7 for subjects able to titrate up to 48
      mg/day), immediately before washout (week 12 for those study subjects who are able to titrate
      up to 48 mg/day) and during week 13. Assessment of Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores will occur at screening and all clinic Visits. The Mini
      Mental (MMSE) Scale will be performed at screening and at the final on-treatment Visit (week
      12). A video examination of the study subjects will be made at screening (right before
      initiation of the study drug), and after 6 weeks on AUSTEDO at a steady dose (right before
      drug cessation). Part III of the MDS-UPDRS will be performed at both of these Visits as well
      to screen for the appearance of drug-induced parkinsonism. Videos will be sent to raters
      blinded to treatment, Visit number and recording date.
