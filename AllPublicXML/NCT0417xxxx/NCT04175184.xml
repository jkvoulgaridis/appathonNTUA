  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff related pain is considered the main source of musculoskeletal shoulder pain that
      affects function and produces pain on movement. Amongst the existing physiotherapeutic
      management approaches, exercise therapy has been recognized as the first line approach. The
      use of manual therapy in the management of this condition has been debated and studies have
      shown contradictory results. A specific manual therapy approach, mobilisation with movement
      (MWM), seems promising in this population as it aims to improve pain-free range of motion and
      includes active engagement of the participant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff related pain is a term that includes a diversity of shoulder conditions known
      as: subacromial impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinitis/tendinopathy, rotator cuff
      tear, bursitis. The use of a broader term is useful as the diagnostic accuracy of special
      orthopaedic tests have been widely criticised and are unable to identify pathognomonic
      sources of symptoms in people presenting with shoulder pain. Additionally, even though
      diagnostic imaging is capable of identifying pathology in patients with rotator cuff related
      pain, studies demonstrate that their correlation with clinical presentation is questionable.

      Shoulder pain is one of the most common sources of musculoskeletal pain that might affect up
      to 20% of the population. Additional important epidemiological data concerning shoulder pain
      is the fact that approximately 40% of people complaining of shoulder pain will still be
      symptomatic after six months. Physiotherapy has an important role in the management of
      rotator cuff related pain and exercise is the main therapeutic approach when considering pain
      and functional restriction,

      Mobilisation with movement (MWM) is one alternative musculoskeletal approach that focuses on
      improving active pain-free range of motion. This concept of treatment incorporates a passive
      accessory glide produced by the clinician, followed by an active movement executed by the
      patient. Different studies have suggested positive effects of MWM in patients complaining of
      shoulder pain. On the other hand, other studies reported no superior effects when using MWM
      in their studies. Several methodological aspects might have influenced this discrepancy in
      results, such as population, dosage and type of MWM utilized, follow-up period and outcome
      measures. Due to this uncertainty, the current research aims to further explore the inclusion
      of MWM to an exercise programme in patients with rotator cuff related pain.

    <masking_description>Blinding of participants: participants will be unaware about the specificities of the group allocation. The inclusion of a sham mobilisation with movement (MWM) procedure has the aim to mask the manual therapy procedure. For a naive participant, it is unlikely that he/she might be able to discern the real MWM from the sham MWM. In addition, participants will be requested to avoid discussing the interventions received with the outcome assessor.
A scale ranging from &quot;treatment under investigation&quot; to &quot;I don´t know&quot; will be used to assess blinding of participants.
Blinding of outcome assessor: this research assistant will only be responsible for conducting the outcome assessments. He/she will be unaware of group allocation and will also be requested not to discuss any specifics about the treatment programmes with the participants</masking_description>

    <description>Exercise programme: 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions of shoulder girdle and glenohumeral strengthening exercises performed in different positions in addition to three stretching exercises.
Mobilisation with movement (MWM): the participant and physiotherapist will decide one movement more functionally relevant to the patient. Afterwards, attempts of MWM will be applied to different joints in order to identify one particular MWM that improves significantly the movement previously selected. Then, one set of six to ten repetitions will be applied. This process of pragmatically using MWM will be conducted in every session, but from the second session onwards, two to three sets of ten repetitions will be applied, with an interval of sixty seconds between sets. In case of failure to identify an MWM that improves the movement significantly, the patient decides which one seemed to be best and one set of six repetitions will be applied to the onset of discomfort.</description>

    <description>The exercise programme is exactly the same as the experimental group.
Sham MWM: the participant and physiotherapist will decide together one movement that is more functionally relevant to the patient. Afterwards, a sham MWM (Delgado-Gil et al 2015) will be applied and the movement previously selected will be repeated six times in the first consultation. The participant will be informed that he/she should move to the onset of symptoms, if they occur.This process will be conducted in every session, but from the second session onwards, two to three sets of 10 repetitions will be applied, with an interval of sixty seconds between sets. In case the sham MWM failed to improve the movement significantly, one set of six repetitions will be applied only.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mobilisation with Movement</intervention_name>
    <description>MWM is a pain-free manual therapy procedure that aims to restore full active pain-free range of motion. It consists of an accessory movement performed by the therapist followed by an active movement executed by the patient. The accessory glide might be produced by the therapist´s hands or by a belt. Minor changes in the amount of force or direction of the glide are common to produce better results.
The MWM procedures will be used pragmatically in this study. Therefore, several attempts might be needed to produce the outcome desired. In the case of the shoulder, they can be applied to the glenohumeral joint, scapulothoracic joint, acromioclavicular joint, cervical and thoracic spines and the rib cage. The decision making process in this study will be based on the outcome observed. The procedure that produced the greatest improvement in active pain-free range of motion will be the one used on that occasion.</description>

    <description>Sham MWM is a comparator procedure used in this research to control for placebo related mechanisms of action. This procedure has already been used in previous research (Delgado-Gil et al 2015). Briefly, the therapist will stand opposite to the affected shoulder, he/she will place the thenar eminence of the anterior hand on the skin in front of the humeral head, while the posterior hand will rest on the scapula. Both hands will just lightly rest on the skin, no accessory glide will be performed to the humeral head. Then, the participant will move his/her shoulder in the direction previously selected. Shall the procedure elicit pain-free full range of motion, the participant will move their shoulder ten times. Otherwise, the movement should be performed up to the onset of symptoms.</description>
