  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigator initiated, prospective, observational, single-center study is designed to
      assess whether dynamic monitors of cardiac function such as stroke volume variation (SVV)
      that have been shown to predict volume responsiveness differ in clinical utility between
      patients with and without diastolic dysfunction.

      This investigator initiated, prospective, observational, single-center study is designed to
      assess whether dynamic monitors of cardiac function, such as stroke volume variation (SVV),
      that have been shown to predict volume responsiveness differ in clinical utility between
      patients with and without diastolic dysfunction.

      Specific Aims:

        -  Determine the threshold for the predictive response of SVV with respect to increasing
           cardiac output for patients with and without diastolic dysfunction.

        -  Compare the trans thoracic ultrasound assessment of left ventricular diastolic function
           before and after the induction of general anesthesia.

    <measure>Impact of diastolic function on the response threshold for stroke volume variation (SVV) as a predictor of the cardiac output response to fluid administration.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The sensitivity of SVV as a predictor of the change in cardiac output in response to IV fluid administration will be determined by analysis of the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves for each of the patient groups as distinguished by their pre-induction assessment of diastolic left ventricular function</description>

    <description>Transthoracic ultrasound will be performed before and after the induction of general anesthesia to assess left ventricular diastolic function. Measurements of trans-mitral flow velocities and tissue Doppler velocities will be used to establish the grade of left ventricular diastolic function. The reproducibility of this measurement before and after the induction of anesthesia has ramifications for intra-operative measurement of diastolic function.</description>

    <description>Patients undergoing scheduled surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia and invasive arterial pressure and advanced cardiac function monitoring. A trans thoracic ultrasound examination of cardiac function will be performed before induction of general anesthesia . In the operating room, the anesthesia care team will place all of the standard intra-operative monitors and then induce general anesthesia. After induction, the ultrasound examination will be repeated and the planned additional intra-operative monitors will be placed. The arterial catheter will be attached to a FloTrac/EV1000 monitor that will be used to guide fluid management during the procedure. The sensitivity and specificity of SVV to predict the response of cardiac output to intravenous fluid administration will be assessed in this patient group distinguished by their normal left ventricular diastolic function.</description>
