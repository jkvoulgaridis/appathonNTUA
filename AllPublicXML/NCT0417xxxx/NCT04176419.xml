  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how a non-opioid pain control regimen, administered
      before and during surgery, will affect postoperative pain control and total opioid
      consumption in head and neck cancer participants undergoing cancer surgery with free flap
      reconstruction.

  <detailed_description>

      This study will help the study team determine how the experimental, non-opioid pain control
      regimen affects opioid-related side effects, participant satisfaction with pain management,
      PACU length of stay, hospital length of stay, chronic pain level, and chronic pain-related
      disability in participants, and to determine the safety and tolerability of the non-opioid
      pain control regimen in head and neck cancer patients undergoing cancer surgery with free
      flap reconstruction. Ketamine, Lidocaine, Acetaminophen, Gabapentin, and Celecoxib are
      FDA-approved drugs that have been approved for use individually, and have been used in
      combination for perioperative pain control. However, the use of these five drugs together in
      head and neck cancer patients undergoing free flap reconstruction has not been studied, which
      is why this study is experimental.

    <description>Average Opioid Related Symptom Distress Scale (ORSDS) scores
The OR-SDS is used to assess subject-reported levels of severity concerning 12 symptoms known to be associated with opioid medication usage. Symptom frequency, severity, and how bothersome symptom was is rated from 1-4 with higher . The average score for each symptom is calculated by taking the mean of patient-reported score. Total possible severity score: 0 (less severe) to 4 (more severe).</description>

Domains include pain expected vs experienced, frequency of severe pain, promptness of care team, effectiveness of treatment, and future preferences
Domain scores range from 1-5 with higher scores mean worse outcomes (more severe pain, poor quality of care)
