  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD; it is a common, preventable and treatable disease that is associated with increased
      chronic inflammatory responses in the airways and lungs against harmful gases and particles,
      and that it manages progressive airflow. The definition of exacerbation is defined as an
      acute onset with a change in where daily differences in the main symptoms occur and which may
      occur with the presence of drugs. The number of exacerbations in the course of the disease is
      between 1-3 years on average. Routine physiotherapy treatment in COPD exacerbation is
      expected to increase lung volume and effective removal of airway secretions. The concept of
      physiotherapy programs is vibration, thoracic expression exercise, positive expiratory
      pressure therapy and gait programs.

      An incentive spirometer is a simple, inexpensive device to adjust lung tissue re-expansion by
      increasing lung volumes and diaphragmatic mobility, providing maximal inspiration with
      termination control without a resistive loading. In COPD patients, the use of incentive
      spirometry is to increase alveolar ventilation and oxygenation in lifestyle.

      There are a limited number of studies in the literature regarding the results of the use of
      incentive spirometry in COPD patients. The results of postoperative results of incentive
      spirometry in COPD patients were tried and established on pulmonary complications, diseases,
      postoperative dyspnea perception and lifestyle. The importance of the investigator's
      research; this is the first study to evaluate hemodynamic responses and hospitalization plans
      of incentive spirometer and routine physiotherapy program in COPD exacerbations.
