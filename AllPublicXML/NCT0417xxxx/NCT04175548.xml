  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pertrochanteric fractures are a highly relevant topic not only because of the high frequency
      or age of the population concerned, but also because of comorbidity (osteoporosis,
      malnutrition, decreased physical activity, decreased visual acuity, neurological deficits,
      asthenia, disorders of the equilibrium and impaired reflexes) and the mortality associated
      with this type of fractures.

      The cut-out of the cervical screw is a mechanical complication common to different means of
      osteosynthesis of pertrochanteric fractures, this complication significantly increases the
      morbidity.

      From January 2013 to May 2019, out of a total of 340 patients having had surgery for
      pertrochanteric fracture, 12 cases of cervical screw cut-out were recorded within the
      Brugmann University Hospital. The average follow-up after surgery was 18 months.

      This study analyses different parameters and their link with cervical screw cut-outs, and
      compares the results with the ones published in the scientific literature.

    <measure>Parker ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This method involves recording the superior, inferior, anterior and posterior borders of the femoral head. The ratio is calculated in both the AP and lateral views to give a value within a range of 0 to 100 for each view. In the AP view, 0 is considered to be the most inferior screw placement and 100 is considered to be the most superior pin placement. In the lateral view, 0 is considered to be the most posterior screw placement and 100 is considered to be the most anterior pin placement.</description>
