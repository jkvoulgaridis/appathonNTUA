  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBI306 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds proprotein convertase
      substilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9), preventing its interaction with the low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol receptor (LDL-R) and thereby restoring LDL-R recycling and
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol（LDL-C）uptake. In phase I study IBI306 was shown to be
      safe and well tolerated. There was robust reduction in LDL-C, Apo(B), non-HDL-C and
      lipoprotein (a) in healthy subjects. This study is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, repeated-dosing, multiple ascending dose trial to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of a novel PCSK-9 anti-body, IBI306, in Chinese patients with heterozygous
      familial hypercholesterolemia.

      The study plan to enroll 148 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and
      maintained a low-fat diet and stable current lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks,
      randomized into different dose groups at 1:1, followed by 2:1 randomized double-blind
      treatment with subcutaneous IBI306150 mg (n=49) or placebo (n=25) every two weeks; or
      subcutaneous injection of IBI306 450mg (n=49) or placebo (n=25) every four weeks, treatment
      lasts for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, each group entered a 12-week open-label treatment, in
      which IBI306 subjects continued to receive IBI306, and placebo subjects shift to received
      IBI306. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in LDL-C levels relative to baseline
      at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in baseline lipid levels, drug safety, and
      immunogenicity at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. The exploratory endpoint was the population
      pharmacokinetic profile of IBI306 in Chinese heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
      population. If necessary, the dose of IBI306 will be adjusted accordingly based on the
      results of the ongoing multi-dose climbing study. After the open period, the subjects will be
      given a safety visit for 8 weeks.
