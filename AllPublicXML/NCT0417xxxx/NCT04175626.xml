  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-approval study is to confirm that the clinical performance of the
      Orsiro stent in a real-world setting is similar to the clinical performance observed for
      Orsiro in the BIOFLOW-V Investigational Device Exemption pivotal trial, as a condition of the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (P170030).

      BIOFLOW-VII is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study. Subjects with coronary artery
      disease (CAD) who undergo an on-label percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a placed
      Orsiro stent within the prior 24 hours will be screened post-index procedure per the protocol
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Following the index procedure and study enrollment, subjects will be followed for 5 years.
      The follow-up schedule will include an intermediate study visit at 1 month, a primary
      endpoint study visit at 12 months, and long-term study visits at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject had clinical symptoms and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with
             acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) within 72 hours prior to the index procedure.

          2. Subject is pregnant and/or breastfeeding or intends to become pregnant during the
             duration of the study.

          3. Subject has a known allergy to contrast medium that cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated, or any known allergy to thienopyridine, aspirin, both heparin and
             bivalirudin, L-605 cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy or one of its major elements (cobalt,
             chromium, tungsten and nickel), silicon carbide, PLLA, sirolimus.

          4. Revascularization of any target vessel within 9 months prior to the index procedure or
             previous PCI of any non-target vessel within 30 days prior to the index procedure or
             any PCI planned within the next 1 year.

          5. Presence of an untreated clinically significant stenosis post-procedure whether
             treatment is planned or not.

          6. Planned surgery within 6 months of index procedure unless DAPT can be maintained
             throughout the peri-surgical period.

          7. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months prior to the

             100,000 platelets/mm3) or thrombocytosis (i.e. &gt; 700,000 platelet/mm3).

         12. Any significant concurrent medical diagnosis that would potentially impact DAPT
             effectiveness or increase thrombotic risk.

         13. Subject is receiving chronic anticoagulation (e.g. coumadin, dabigatran, apixaban,

         15. Subject is participating in an investigational (medical device or drug) clinical
             study. Subjects may be concurrently enrolled in a post-market study, as long as the
             post-market study device, drug or protocol does not interfere with the follow-up
             requirements of this study or does not involve a drug that may confound the
             interpretation of any relevant clinical events of interest (e.g. investigational DAPT
             therapy).

         16. In the investigator's opinion, subject will not be able to comply with the follow-up
             requirements.

        Subjects will be excluded from the trial if any of the target lesions/vessels met any of
        the following angiographic criteria during the index procedure:

          1. Target lesion was located within or treated through a saphenous vein graft or arterial
             graft.

          2. Target lesion was a restenotic lesion that was previously treated with a bare metal or
             drug-eluting stent (in-stent restenosis).

          3. Target lesion had any of the following characteristics:

               1. Lesion location is within the left main coronary artery, or within 3 mm of the
                  origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) or left circumflex (LCX).

               2. Involves a side branch of &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter.

          4. Target vessel/lesion was excessively tortuous/angulated or is severely calcified, that
             would prevent complete inflation of an angioplasty balloon. This assessment should be
             based on visual estimation.

          5. Target vessel had angiographic evidence of thrombus.

          6. Target lesion was totally occluded (100% stenosis).

          7. Target vessel was treated with brachytherapy any time prior to the index procedure.
