    <textblock>
      Hysteroscopy is still considered the gold standard procedure for uterine cavity exploration.
      Therefore, many specialists have used hysteroscopy as their first-line of routine exam for
      infertility patients regardless of guidelines. Thus, scheduling the office micro hysteroscopy
      as one of the routine steps in the fertility workup program has become mandatory before the
      final diagnosis of unexplained infertility.

    <textblock>
      Although hysteroscopy is generally accepted as the gold standard in diagnosis and treatment
      of uterine cavity pathology, many gynecologist are reluctant to perform hysteroscopy as an
      initial test without a high degree of suspicion for pathology due to the need for anesthesia
      in an operating room setting. The basic infertility work-up has included a HSG to evaluate
      the uterine cavity and tubal patency. However, HSG does not allow for simultaneous correction
      of uterine pathology. Moreover HSG may miss 35% of uterine abnormalities. Hysterolaparoscopy
      (Pan Endoscopic) approach is better than HSG and should be encouraged as first and final
      procedure in selected infertile women.

      Sonohysterography (SHG) has been proposed as a better diagnostic test of the uterine cavity.
      However, it also suffers from a sensitivity and specificity inferior to that of hysteroscopy
      in most studies.

    <description>The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Normal saline was used for uterine distension connected to the inflow channel on the sheath with intravenous tubing. The tip of the hysteroscope was positioned in the vaginal introitus, the labia being slightly separated with fingers. The vagina was distended with saline.
The uterine cavity was systematically explored by rotating the fore-oblique scope in order to identify any anomaly in the uterine walls and/or the right and left tubal ostia. At this stage it was crucially important to avoid lateral movements as much as possible to reduce patient discomfort to a minimum. After that, the scope was removed Finally the evaluation and the data that had been found were written in details by the surgeon. Operative intervention was done if needed. Any complication in the form of pain, bleeding, vasovagal attack and perforation, were registered in the patient sheet.</description>

    <description>One hundred women with unexplained infertility recruited for office micro hysteroscopic sessions. A rigid fiberoptic 2-mm, 0 and 30 degrees angled hysteroscopy along with an operative channel for grasping forceps or scissors were used for both diagnostic and operative indications. The findings, complications, and patient tolerance were recorded.</description>
