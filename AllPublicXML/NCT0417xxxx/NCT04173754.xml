      This study is a prospective, case-control observational trial. The investigators will compare
      the MSAT group to the control group to analyze the effectiveness of shoulder MSAT.

    <textblock>
      Motion Style Acupuncture Treatment(MSAT) is a therapeutic technique using acupuncture needle
      created in Jaseng Hospital. This treatment involves patients with musculoskeletal pain to
      move the part of their body actively during acupuncture treatment under physicians'
      observation. This treatment is known to relieve the pain and increase the range of
      motion(ROM). However, there has been no specific value for the effect of this treatment.

      Therefore, The investigators conducted observational trial to analyze the effectiveness of
      shoulder MSAT. From July 2019, The investigators will collect 80 patients with ROM limitation
      on both or each shoulder and who are suffering from shoulder pain with the numeric rating
      scale(NRS) over 4.

      The investigators will compare pain, dysfunction, quality of life and satisfaction of
      patients who are treated with Korean medical treatment including MSAT and patients who are
      treated with Korean medical treatment not including MSAT.

      For these two groups, The investigators will compare Range Of Motion(ROM), NRS(Numeric Rating
      Scale), Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index(SPADI), Patient Global
      Impression of Change (PGIC) and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D-5L).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder mobility on the Shoulder ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>At within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder ROM was measured in six directions (Flexion, Extension, Abduction, Adduction, Right rotation, Left rotation) with goniometer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale(NRS) of shoulder pain</measure>
    <time_frame>At screening, baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, and through study completion, an average of 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of shoulder pain and discomfort was assessed using NRS. NRS is a pain scale in which the patient indicates their subjective pain as a whole number from 0 to 10. The participant is asked to report their shoulder pain and discomfort using NRS, where 0 indicates 'no pain or discomfort' and 10 indicates 'the most severe pain and discomfort imaginable'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of shoulder pain</measure>
    <time_frame>At screening, baseline, 2 weeks and through study completion, an average of 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is an assessment index in which the patient records their pain on a 100mm line from 'no pain' at one end, and 'the most severe pain imaginable' at the other end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index(SPADI) questionnaire of shoulder pain and disability</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>SPADI is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is an index that assesses improvements in functional limitation caused by whiplash injury. Participants rate the improvement in functional limitations after treatment on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Very much improved, 4=No change, 7=Very much worse). This index was originally developed for use in Psychology, but is currently used in various other medical fields to assess improvements in pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a method of indirectly calculating the weights of certain health states for quality of life after a multidimensional investigation of health states, and is the most widely used instrument for this purpose. The EQ-5D consists of 5 questions about current health state (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression), and each question is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1=no problems, 3=moderate problems, 5=severe problems). In this study, The investigators will use the Korean version of the EQ-5D-5L, which has been demonstrated to be valid.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events(AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events(AE) Physicians will monitor and record any unexpected or unintended patient reaction to integrative korean medicine at each visit. Adverse events (AEs) associated with integrative korean medicine will include, but not be limited to, AEs anticipated from previous reports of korean medicine, and will stay open to all possibilities taking into consideration other potential, unknown AEs.</description>
