  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Engage Coaching Project is a Stage 1 intervention development study. This study asks:
      &quot;what behavioral strategies are needed to help socially disconnected caregivers with
      significant barriers to increasing connectedness?&quot; This study uses a mixed methods approach
      to adapt a brief behavioral intervention—Social Engage psychotherapy—for use with socially
      disconnected caregivers. The ultimate goal is for Social Engage psychotherapy to be offered
      as a second step in a stepped care approach for caregivers who do not demonstrate an adequate
      response to a single-session psychoeducation plus resources intervention. Social Engage
      Psychotherapy helps caregivers bolster motivation for increasing connectedness, teaches
      problem solving skills, and provides behavioral practice with social engagement. Up to 8
      brief sessions (typically 30 minutes) are provided weekly over no more than three months.
      This is a single-arm clinical trial of Social Engage psychotherapy, with up to 30
      participants.

    <description>UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, which assesses self-reported loneliness. 20 items, rated as to how often the participant has felt a certain way in the prior month (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel alone?&quot;) -- &quot;never&quot; (1), &quot;rarely&quot; (2), &quot;sometimes&quot; (3), or &quot;often&quot; (4). Higher scores indicate greater loneliness. However, some individual items must be reverse-coded so that higher total scores reflect greater loneliness (i.e., 1=4, 2=3, 3=2, 4=1). These items (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel there are people you can turn to?&quot;) are items 1,5,6,9,10,15,16,19,20. Total scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores representing a worse outcome (i.e., greater loneliness).</description>

    <description>Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities (PROMIS) is a computerized adaptive test (CAT). It produces T scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Greater scores indicate better outcomes (i.e., greater satisfaction with social role and activities).</description>

    <description>Participants will complete up to 8 weekly individual Social Engage psychotherapy sessions. Participants will be allotted up to 3 months to complete all sessions, a time-frame that allows for two weeks without meeting to address life stressors such as illnesses that may pop up. Phone sessions are allowed for any week except the first and last. The first and last session are longer - up to 60 minutes if needed. Middle sessions are shorter (20-45 minutes). Engage is a stepped care psychotherapy in that the simplest strategy is taught first—action planning (a derivative of problem solving therapy)—and &quot;barrier strategies&quot; are added only if needed. Action plans are designed to address loneliness and social isolation in the context of caregiving demands.</description>

    <ipd_description>The final dataset will include self-reported demographic and health history data from interviews with 30 older adults who are caregivers for individuals with ADRD and transcribed responses to semi-structured interviews. Data from this research will be made available to the public in the University of Rochester's institutional repository, UR Research, at https://urresearch.rochester.edu. We will share the research protocols, in a text format, such as MS Word or PDF. Qualitative data will also be made available in text form. For quantitative data, the PI will make available the actual datasets generated from research, in a commonly- used format such as a SAS® dataset. The datasets will be associated with a related publication, research protocol or other documentation of the original research. Some research data may be in multimedia form (such as recordings of focus group sessions).</ipd_description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>The investigators will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement as suggested by the NIH that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. 4. De-identification of data from human subjects: A final complete database will be created to host all data which will be stripped of any identifiers and stored pursuant to UR Institutional Review Board protocols. Confidentiality for research subjects for qualitative data will be promoted by the use of an anonymization scheme and anonymizing the data as the qualitative files are created for the analysis (following guidelines developed by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, 2012).</ipd_access_criteria>
