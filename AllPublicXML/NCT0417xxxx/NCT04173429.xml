  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy with low
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin in patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent complication of liver cirrhosis, referred to
      partial or complete thrombosis formed in the lumen of portal vein or/and branches of it.
      Currently, clinical guidelines of PVT in cirrhotic patients has not been addressed, and
      anticoagulant therapy of PVT patients with cirrhosis remains controversial. Although
      numerable studies have reported that anticoagulation therapy is effective, while a majority
      of them were respective and a few took control into consideration. In addition, no agreement
      has reached about the safety of anticoagulation. So, the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant
      therapy needs more prospective randomized controlled trial to be investigated.
