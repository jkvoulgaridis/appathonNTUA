    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of life (QoL) for women with breast
      cancer in Taiwan after using the BCSMS App.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After receiving their first diagnosis of breast cancer, women with stage 0 to III were
      randomized into intervention and control groups. Intervention group subjects used BCSMS App
      and the control group subjects received usual care. Two questionnaires: EORTC QLQ-C30 and
      EORTC QLQ-BR 23 were distributed to subjects in both arms at baseline and at 1.5 and 3
      months. All evaluations were anonymous.
