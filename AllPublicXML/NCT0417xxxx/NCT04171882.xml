  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence suggesting that inflammatory processes, through microglial
      activation, would play a key role in brain injury and degeneration. It is considered that
      microglial activation would be part of self-propelling cycle of neuroinflammation that fuels
      Neurologic deterioration. It is however hard to evidence microglial activation in vivo:
      first, the investigators need very high-resolution imaging tools and then, the only ligand
      available to date, 11C-PK11195, has a low sensitivity and specificity and provided
      heterogeneous results. 18F-DPA-714 is a new PET ligand which labels microglial cells. The
      investigators aim to explore the clinical feasibility used PET-CT with 18F-DPA714 to monitor
      microglial cells activation of brain in several different disease. This study might reveal
      significant neuroinflammatory process in the brain. The results of this study might provide a
      new biomarker of disease pathological progression and help as identifying subjects who might
      most benefit from a specific anti-inflammatory drug.
