      Observational study comparing thin pvc with thick silicone gastric calibration tube for
      bariatric surgery.

      Most of the times a thin gastric tube is used. Sometimes insertion is difficult due to
      kinking, resistance, bulging and not advancing in the right spot requiring re introduction,
      help from a colleague, or change to the thick silicone type. When tube is changed during
      insertion to the silicone type the method insertion is compared with the previous approach.

      Observational study comparing thin pvc with thick silicone gastric calibration tube for
      bariatric surgery.

      Most of the times a thin gastric tube is used. Sometimes insertion is difficult due to

      help from a colleague, or change to the thick silicone type. When tube is changed during
      insertion to the silicone type the method insertion is compared with the previous approach.

      A note is made of the problem encountered, how long it took to place it correctly ( time from
      insertion till first staple), what was done to solve the problem, if a new identical tube was
      used or another and what type was used. If another tube how log did it take to get first
      stapler done.

      some demographic and procedure information is recorded: gender, age, BMI, procedure planned,
      first bariatric procedure or second after ...
