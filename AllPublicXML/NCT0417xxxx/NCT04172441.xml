  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of dasiglucagon in reducing glucose
      requirements in children with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) requiring
      continuous intravenous (IV) glucose administration to prevent/manage hypoglycemia.

                  documented during an event of hypoglycemia, and/or

               2. Hypofattyacidemia: plasma free fatty acid &lt;1.7 mmol/L, and/or

               3. Hypoketonemia: Beta-hydroxybutyrate &lt;1.8 mmol/L, and/or

               4. Glycemic response: an increase in PG of &gt;30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) after 1 mg IV or
                  intramuscular (IM) glucagon administration

          -  Male or female, age ≥7 days and &lt;12 months at screening

          -  Was born preterm below 34 weeks of gestational age

          -  Presence of hypertension or hypotension, including circulatory instability requiring
             supportive medication or presence of pheochromocytoma

          -  Known or suspected presence of severe brain damage

          -  Evidence of metabolic, endocrine, or syndromic causes of hypoglycemia not due to
             hyperinsulinism

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids, e.g., hydrocortisone &gt;20 mg/m2 body surface area or
             equivalent within 5 days before screening

          -  Prior use of lanreotide, sirolimus (mechanistic target of rapamycin [mTOR]
             inhibitors), anti inflammatory biological agents, or other immune modulating agents.
             Prior use of octreotide is allowed after a minimum of 48 hour washout before
             randomization.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality identified on echocardiogram that in the
             opinion of the investigator would affect the subject's ability to participate in the
             trial

          -  Any recognized clotting or bleeding disorder

          -  The use of prescription or non-prescription medications known to cause QT prolongation
