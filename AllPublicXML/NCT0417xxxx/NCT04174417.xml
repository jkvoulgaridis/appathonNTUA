    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to evaluate the patients who underwent controlled hypotensive
      anesthesia under standardized depth of anesthesia; preoperative and postoperative blood HIF
      1a, TAS, TOS measurement and cerebral perfusion evaluation with NIRS and to investigate
      tissue hypoxia secondary to hypotensive anesthesia and the changes of the mediators at the
      tissue level and which blood pressure parameters are related.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controlled hypotension is the voluntary reversible reduction of arterial blood pressure.
      Hypotensive anesthesia is a method of anesthesia in which blood pressure is reduced in a
      controlled manner, especially in certain surgeries. İt reduces intraoperative bleeding and
      need for blood transfusion and provides a clean surgical vision in narrow-field surgeries or
      with high bleeding potential. Hypotensive anesthesia can be performed according to mean blood
      pressure (MBP) or systolic blood pressure (SBP).

      A non-invasive cerebral oximeter is used to see the changes in the brain due to high
      oxygen-dependent metabolism during induction and maintenance of anesthesia.

      Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor involved in cell adaptation
      mechanism activated in response to hypoxia.

      The biological activity of HIF 1 is determined by the expression and activity of the HIF 1a
      subunit.

      Total antioxidant status (TAS) shows the total effect of all antioxidants in the human body
      and total oxidant status (TOS) shows the total effect of oxidants.

      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) allows continuous and non-invasive monitoring of cerebral
      oxygenation. HIF 1a, TAS and TOS are laboratory markers that predict tissue oxygenation and
      perfusion.

      Hypotensive anesthesia can be performed according to both MBP and SBP. However, in our study
      that follow-up MBP is more advantageous/protective, although it is not supported by very
      strong data. The investigators recommend hypotensive anesthesia compared to MBP; but further
      studies are needed.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 60 ASA 1-2 patients aged between 18-75 who underwent elective rhinoplasty and orthognathic surgery were included the study.The patients were divided into two groups. One group received hypotensive anesthesia according to MBP an done group received SBP. Continuous regional cerebral oxygen saturation was monitored by NIRS in both groups. Blood samples were taken from all patients before anesthesia induction and at the and of the operation and stored for TAS, TOS, HIF 1a. At the and of the operation patients were fallowed in the post anesthesia care unit for 30 minutes and pain and nause vomiting scores were evaluated. İn addition, surgical satisfaction and bleeding scores and anesthetic consumption of both groups were recorded</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the relationship between hypotensive anesthesia technique and brain hypoxia by the rate of NIRS</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators used to detect brain hypoxia with Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) (INVOS 5100 Medtronic).
Near Infrared measurement, primary absorbing molecules in tissue are metal complex chromophores such as hemoglobin, bilirubin and cytochrome.
The absorption spectra of deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) range between 650-1000 nm, the oxyhemoglobin (Hb02) absorption spectra range between 700-1150 and the cytochrome oxidase aa3 (Caa3) absorption spectra range from 820-840 nm.
NIRS measures the ratio of oxyhemoglobin to total hemoglobin at a depth of 2.5-3 cm in the area under the sensor.This ratio represents regional cerebral oxygen (RsO2) saturation.
RSO2 below 40% or more than 25% decrease in baseline is associated with neurological dysfunction and side effects. A 15-20% reduction or less than 50% of the baseline is considered a critical threshold and requires action.</description>

    <description>Under normoxic conditions, HIF 1a protein can hardly be detected, but when hypoxia starts, its expression starts within 2 minutes and peaks at 4-8 hours of hypoxia.
3 ml blood was taken into MiniCollect® tubes from the venous cannula placed before anesthesia induction for measure HIF 1a,TAS and TOS. At the end of the operation, 3 ml of blood was taken again from the untreated arm of all patients to the HIF1a, TAS and TOS values and sent to the biochemistry laboratory. The collected blood was centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 minutes and the separated sera were sent to the biochemical laboratory to be stored at -80 ° C until the study was performed.</description>
