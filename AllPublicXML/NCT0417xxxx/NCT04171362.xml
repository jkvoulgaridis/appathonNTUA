    <measure>Migraine Disability Assessment Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the level of disability of patients Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) was used. It is a widely used and validated test. MIDAS was translated into Turkish and validity and reliability studies were conducted. MIDAS is a test filled in by patients that identifies migraine disability in all areas of activity during last 3 months.It consists of 5 questions.The total MIDAS score is the sum of the days given as response to these five questions (MIDAS 1 to MIDAS 5).

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to evaluate sleep quality (PSQI) will be used. It is a reliable and valid scale with 19 questions to assess the presence and severity of the disorder. The questionnaire was adapted to Turkish patients by Ağargün et al. The scale can measure subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, sleep medication use and daytime work. The response of each is scored as 0-3. Having a global score of 5 or higher, indicates bad sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>

The lowest score they can get from the sub-scale is 0, the highest score is 21 for each subscale. 10 point is considered as a treshold for depression and or anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Nothingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the treatment and end of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nothingham Health Profile was used to measure quality of life. Nottingham Health Profile, emotional, physical and social problems survey.

    <measure>Allodynia Symptom Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate allodynia symptoms associated with headache attacks &quot;Allodynia Symptom Checklist&quot; will be used. 12 different situations are questioned in this list. Each situations are scored as &quot;does not apply to me&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;less than half&quot;, &quot;half or more often&quot;.
