    <textblock>
      Viela Bio is conducting an open-label, randomized study of inebilizumab, VIB4920, or the
      combination as part of a multi-center study in highly sensitized patients on the deceased
      donor waiting list for kidney transplantation. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of
      three treatment arms, administered the investigational products as an intervention and
      subsequently followed for safety.

          4. Subjects with stable anti-HLA antibody titers (a difference of &lt; 2 titers versus the
             average titer of antibodies compared to the screening sample) based on 2 legacy
             samples drawn within 6 to 12 months prior to Screening Visit 1, verified by the
             central laboratory.

             bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, others) within 12 months prior to randomization.

          3. Candidates for a second kidney allograft if the first allograft was lost within 12
             months prior to screening.

             study or the subject's safety.
