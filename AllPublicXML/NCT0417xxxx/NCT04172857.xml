  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the surgical outcomes of treating phacoemulsification with intraocular lens
      implantation combined with goniosynechialysis (Phaco-IOL-GSL) associated malignant glaucoma
      (MG), using different incision sites in anterior vitrectomy combined with hyaloidotomy,
      zonulectomy, and iridectomy (VHZI).

    <description>First, a 23-G incision was made at the peripheral inferior temporal sector of the cornea and connected with an anterior chamber infusion cannula. Another corneal incision was made at the superior temporal sector or superior nasal sector, and Viscoat® (Bausch &amp; Lomb, Shandong, China) was infused though the incision to fill the anterior chamber. Iridotomy was performed through the incision using Wescott scissors and toothed forceps. Hyaloidectomy and zonulectomy were performed through a peripheral iris defect using an anterior chamber approach to set up a pathway between the anterior chamber and the vitreous cavity. We repeatedly carried out vitrectomy around the pathway to reduce the risk of postoperative re-obstruction of the tunnel created.</description>

        The medical records of all patients who developed clinical evidence of MG after
        Phaco-IOL-GSL, at the Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from May 2015
        to February 2018, were reviewed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MG was diagnosed based on the presence of a central and peripheral shallow anterior
             chamber with normal or elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis was made only after confirming the absence of choroidal detachment or
             hemorrhage and posterior segment mass lesion, using B-scan ultrasonography or
             ophthalmoscopy
