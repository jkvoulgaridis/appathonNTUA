    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose escalating study evaluating the safety of combining talazoparib and
      low dose consolidative thoracic radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer patients. This study
      will also determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of talazoparib in combination with low
      dose thoracic radiotherapy.

      Patients will start on talazoparib on day 1 of study intervention, and will continue to
      orally take talazoparib until the last day of radiation therapy. Up to 24 patients will be
      enrolled to the study, where the first 3 patients will start with a starting dose level of
      talazoparib is 0.5 mg PO once daily. This will increase to 1mg daily with each new cohort.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose escalating study evaluating the safety of combination talazoparib and
      low dose consolidative thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer
      patients with at least stable disease after standard of care 4 - 6 cycles of chemotherapy (a
      platinum agent and etoposide). This study will also determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of talazoparib in combination with low dose thoracic radiotherapy. Secondary objectives
      will be to examine clinical outcomes, including locoregional recurrence within the radiation
      field, progression-free survival, overall survival and acute/chronic toxicities up to 1 year.

      Patients will start on talazoparib on day 1 of study intervention, and will continue to
      orally take talazoparib until the last day of RT. Patient will start low dose RT on day 6-9,
      and will continue for 10 fractions throughout 2 weeks. Up to 24 patients will be enrolled to
      the study, where the first 3 patients will start with a starting dose level of talazoparib is
      0.5 mg PO once daily. This will increase to 1mg daily with each new cohort. Patients will be
      monitored weekly during study treatment, and followed up at 3 weeks, and every 3 months after
      for 1 year.

Talazoparib dose levels will start at 0.5mg daily and increase to 1mg if dose limiting toxicites are not observed. Toxicities include renal impairment and other treatment related toxicities Grade ≥3.
