  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by a loss or mutation in the
      survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) on chromosome 5q13, which leads to reduced SMN protein
      levels and a selective dysfunction of motor neurons. SMA is an autosomal recessive, early
      childhood disease with an incidence of 1:10,000 live births. SMA is the leading cause of
      infant mortality due to genetic diseases.

      Until recently, the mainstay of treatment for these patients was supportive medical care.
      However, advances in medical treatment focusing on gene replacement, gene enhancement, motor
      neuron protection and muscle enhancement is likely to change the management and prognosis of
      these patients in the future.

      The purpose of this registry is to assess the long term outcomes of patients with SMA in the
      context of advances in treatment options.

      This is a prospective, multi center, multinational, non-interventional observational study.
      All patients will be managed according to the clinical site's normal clinical practice, i.e.,
      the diagnostic and clinical treatment/practice process that a clinician chooses according to
      their clinical judgement for an SMA patient. Clinical care will not be driven by the
      protocol. No additional visits or investigations will be performed beyond normal clinical
      practice. Patients will be followed for 15 years from enrolment or until death, whichever is
      sooner.
