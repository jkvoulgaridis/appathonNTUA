  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-market, prospective, multi-centre, open-label, registry designed to collect prospective
      safety and performance data on the use of CardioCel in patients with cardiovascular disorders
      and in accordance with local standard of care.

      The Registry will collect data with a minimum of 50 subjects per major indication (minimum
      total of 200) in 5-10 sites in Europe. The clinical investigation will maintain data for each
      patient from the date of implant through 2 years post-implantation.

      Post-market, prospective, multi-centre, open-label, registry designed to collect prospective
      safety and performance data on the use of CardioCel in patients with cardiovascular disorders
      and in accordance with local standard of care. The Registry has been designed to collect
      prospective product safety and performance data after the CardioCel line extension for
      CardioCel 3D and the indication expansion to include great vessel and peripheral
      reconstruction and suture line buttressing and will collect safety and performance data up to
      2 years following implantation. The CardioCel 3D Registry will collect data on the use of the
      CardioCel,

      CardioCel Neo and CardioCel 3D for the following major indications:

        -  Intracardiac and septal defects

        -  Valve and annulus repair

        -  Great vessel reconstruction

        -  Peripheral vascular reconstruction

      As suture line buttressing is a procedure that does not consistently use tissue, data on this
      indication will only be included if available. Data will be prospectively collected by the
      sites on registry-specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs). The primary endpoints will
      assess devices' safety and performance through measures and images obtained via the
      facility's standard of care at the respective registry site. Additional data will also be
      collected from the implant procedure to assess user (surgeon) satisfaction with the devices'
      handling and performance.
