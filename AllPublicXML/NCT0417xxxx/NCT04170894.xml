  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to assess the effect of apnea (breath hold) during atrial fibrillation (AF)
      ablation by having all ablations performed under apnea. By prospectively studying the effects
      of apnea on AF ablation, the investigators wish to demonstrate its feasibility, safety and
      impact on patient outcomes. This is a prospective study that includes both an apnea arm and a
      control arm. The subjects who consent to the apnea arm will undergo an atrial fibrillation
      ablation with periods of apnea. The subjects who consent to the control arm will agree to
      have their data from their standard of care atrial fibrillation be collected for comparison.
