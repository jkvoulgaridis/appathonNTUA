    <textblock>
      This project will assess self-efficacy levels(SE) ,resiliency and attachment style of
      adolescent with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers.SE and attachment style of patients and
      parents will be compared with each other as well as correlated with diabetes management as
      assessed by A1C and self inventory scale.

    <measure>Examine the effects of patients' attachment styles (secure, mixed and fearful) on their type one diabetes management represented by A1C level</measure>
    <time_frame>25 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The following tool will be used - Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ): The 30-item RSQ is valid and reliable. 76 Re-test reliability of the RSQ ranged from 0.54 to 0.78 and correlation coefficients of RSQ and RQ ranged from 0.41 to 0.6191.
Adolescent Relationship Scale Questionnaire (A-RSQ): Sümer &amp; Güngör (1999) used the A-RSQ and report validity of 0.7-0.95 as well as an internal consistency of 0.82.</description>

    <time_frame>25 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The following tool will be used - Self-Efficacy of Diabetes Self-Management (SEDM): This is a 10-item questionnaire that is used to assess perceived self-efficacy to preform diabetes care behaviours. Respondents are asked to score responses on a 1-10 Likert scale in which '1= not at all sure' to '10= completely sure'.</description>

    <measure>b)Compare diabetes management self-efficacy and attachment style in patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>25 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To compare diabetes self-efficacy (SEDM) in patients and their parents, paired t-tests will be calculated. In addition, to compare attachment styles in patients and their parents, McNemar's test will be used. Paired t-tests and McNemar's tests effectively take into account the correlations between parent-adolescent measures from the same family.</description>
