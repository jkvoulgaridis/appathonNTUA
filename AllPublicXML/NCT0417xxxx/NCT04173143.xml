    <textblock>
      The superficial neck flexor musculature has been given considerate amount of attention to
      explore its effects on the cervical pain in several researches.. This study intends to put
      through the benefits of deep cervical flexor training for treatment of cervical neck pain
      patients.This study will also compare the effects of Cranio cervical flexion training with
      and without pressure biofeedback on neck pain, muscular endurance,forward head posture and
      cervical mobility in mechanical neck pain.

      The study is Randomized Control Trail, which is being conducted in physical therapy
      Outpatient department of Pakistan Railway hospital. Sample size of 24 individual was
      calculated using Epitool with 95% confidence interval (CI) and power 80%. Individual will be
      screened out according to inclusion criteria. Individuals will be allocated randomly into two
      groups, 12 in Craniocervical flexion training with pressure biofeedbackgroup and 12 in
      Craniocervical flexion training without pressure biofeedbackgroup by sealed envelope method.

      Deep neck flexor endurance techniquewas used totrain theCraniocervical flexor muscles in
      control group.Craniocervical flexion technique with Pressure biofeedback unit's was
      positioned behind the neck just below the occiput was used to train the endurance of the
      Craniocervical flexor muscle in experimental group.

      Assessment will be done on baseline and 4th week. Data will be analyzed on SPSS version 21.

    <description>The cranio cervical flexion test (CCFT) is used to assess endurance of the deep cervical flexors. A pressure biofeedback unit is inflated to 20 mmHg and is placed behind the neck. While keeping the back of the head stable, the patient performs cranial cervical flexion in a graded fashion in 5 increments (22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 mmHg). Each position is held for 10 seconds with 10 seconds rest between increments.. The test is ended when the pressure decreases &gt;20% or when substitution occurs during the head nod.</description>

    <description>On protractor tool was used to measure forward head posture through a craniovertebral angle (CVA).. It has excellent reliability value (ICC 0.991).Participants were asked to sit on a stool and concentrate at a specific point on their eye level.Then we used three markers: one on C7, the other on tragus and the third on canthus. The angle between the line connecting C7 to tragus and a vertical line extending from C7 was calculated and images were taken. Patients having a Craniovertebral angle less than 48°were considered in category of forward head posture.</description>

    <description>Total 15 patients participated in this training group. Session was performed thrice in a week. Each session was givenfor approximately 20minutesPatients were asked to lie in supine hook lying position. After that Pressure biofeedback unit's air bag was clipped together and folded in three and positioned behind the neck just below the occiput. Patients were advised to perform Craniocervical flexion and practiced head nodding action to progressively target (reach the incremental targets) and hold the 5 pressure levels for 10 second between 22 mm Hg and 30 mmHg. A 2 minute second rest period was provided between each level. Minimum performance requirement was 26 mm Hg while ideal performance targets are 28 and 30 mm Hg... Patient will be re-assessed for all baseline variables after 4 weeks of training</description>

    <description>Total 15 patients participated in this control group.Session was given 3 times in a week. Each session continue forapproximately 20 minutes. The patient lies in supine crook lying position. The patientwas maximally retracted the chin and asked to maintained it while the patient lifts the head and neck until the head is relatively 2 to 5 cm (1 inch) abovethe couch. The examiner places a hand under the head of patient on the table. Patients were instructed to perform10 repetitions for a hold of 20 seconds initially, increasing it by 10 seconds progressively.The entire session had a maximum of 4 sets. Patient will be re-assessed for all baseline variables after 4 weeks of training</description>
