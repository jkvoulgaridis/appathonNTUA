  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of ultrasound treatment in addition
      to a program consisting of manual therapy and exercise (stretching and strengthening
      exercises) to improve pain and function in individuals with plantar fasciitis. Our primary
      hypothesis is individuals with plantar fasciitis will show a greater improvement in pain and
      function with ultrasound, manual therapy and an exercise program compared to manual therapy
      and exercise program alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common cause of foot pain, affecting an estimated 2 million
      people per year.1 Although there are large numbers of people seeking medical attention for
      this condition, there remains some confusion among health care providers as to the most
      efficacious treatment and some authors conclude that no data solidly supports effectiveness
      of treatment.2

      Several randomized control studies have been published with respect to treatment of PF with
      ultrasound. The current literature on the effectiveness of US in individuals with PF is
      largely inconsistent in the parameters. One study by Crawford and Snaith,3 found the true
      ultrasound was no more effective than sham ultrasound and the authors concluded that future
      studies need to clarify ultrasound parameters. In contrast, a recent study that utilized
      different parameters,4 concluded that the US group showed significant changes in pain and
      function. Strengthening and stretching exercises are well documented through the literature
      to improve function and decrease pain in patients with PF.5-8 It has been reported within the
      literature that patients with PF have subtalar, tarsometatarsal, and first metatarsalphangeal
      (MTP) joint hypo mobility into dorsiflexion, which reduces dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM)
      and places the windlass mechanism at a mechanical disadvantage which has been theorized to
      place increased stress on the plantar fascia.9-12 A variety of studies have explored the
      effects of manual therapy in conjunction with exercises to address the limitations in ankle
      dorsiflexion ROM.9-12

    <description>All subjects will be seated in a chair with the hips and knees flexed to 90 degrees. The subtalar joint neutral position will be 1st identified through appropriate technique. Following this, the examiner will identify the most anterior and inferior position of the navicular tuberosity and mark it with a washable fine tip marker. The participant will be asked to hold that position while the height of the navicular tuberosity will be measured with a digital caliper. Following measurements in seated position for both feet, participants will be asked to stand and assume a relaxed stance position. The process measuring the navicular height position with a digital caliper as described above in seated position will be repeated in standing position. The difference between the seated and standing navicular positions will be defined as the Navicular drop.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive ultrasound (US) for 3 sessions a week for 4 weeks, with continuous US (1.8 w/cm2, 1 Mega Hz 8 minutes). Manual therapy will include posterior glides to talocrural joint, subtalar lateral glide, a 1st tarsometatarsal joint dorsal glide and extension mobilization to the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint. All participants in each group will be given specific exercises by the investgators targeting intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the foot and ankle. Specific stretches for the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon, will be performed. Home exercises will be recorded using a log.</description>
