  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults have a high prevalence of sleep disturbances, which negatively and severely
      impact their health and quality of life. Research indicated that 43% elderly outpatients in
      Taiwan have used benzodiazepine, which collectively led to great medical expenditure.
      Non-pharmacological treatments are highly recommended as first priority for sleep disturbance
      in practice. Music interventions have been reported to modulate the sympathetic nervous
      system and to improve the elderly's sleeping performance. Proprioceptive interventions can
      also activate the parasympathetic nervous system, providing calming effects and significantly
      reducing anxiety, hyperactivity and agitation in various populations. However, the effects of
      these intervention on the sleep disturbances in the elderly remain unclear. The research
      purpose is to investigate the effects of two sensory activities that are easily executed in
      everyday life - auditory (e.g. listening to the music before sleeping) and proprioceptive
      (e.g. joint compression exercises) interventions on improving the sleep performance of the
      elderly. Subjective sleeping quality assessment (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index &amp; Insomnia
      Severity Index) and objective physiological records measured by actigraphy are used as
      outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-case designs study, we will recruit six volunteering elderly with primary
      insomnia and use A-B-A-C-A-D design for 9 weeks including the three periods of baseline
      phases for 1 week(A), the music intervention phase for 2 weeks(B), the proprioceptive
      intervention phase for 2 weeks(C) and the combination phase for 2 weeks(D). The main outcome
      measures include the objective sleeping quality measured everyday by the actigraphy recording
      the sleeping performance and physiological data during sleep, and the subjective sleeping
      quality measured every week via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity.
      The secondary outcome measures, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
      Scale, Geriatric Anxiety Scale - Chinese Version and WHOQOL-BREF, will be assessed weekly.
      The above results will present in visually analyzing graphed data to compare the performance
      among different phases and to evaluate the impacts of different interventions. This study
      will aim to preliminary investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the music
      intervention, the proprioception intervention and the combination of both approaches on
      improving the objective sleeping performance and the subjective sleeping quality of the
      elderly.

    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>once a week during 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale.
A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>

    <description>a brief instrument(7 items) that was designed to assess the severity of both nighttime and daytime components of insomnia.(Total score categories: 0-7 = No clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 = Subthreshold insomnia, 15-21 = Clinical insomnia (moderate severity), 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe)) It is available in several languages and is increasingly used as a metric of treatment response in clinical research.</description>

    <measure>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>once a week during 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D scale is a brief self-report scale designed to measure self-reported symptoms associated with depression experienced in the past week. The items of the scale are symptoms associated with depression which have been used in previously validated longer scales.Possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Anxiety Scale - Chinese Version</measure>
    <time_frame>once a week during 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Anxiety Scale is a 30-item self-report measure used to assess anxiety symptoms among older adults.Individuals are asked to indicate how often they have experienced each symptom during the last week, answering on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;All the time&quot; (3).</description>

    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF instrument comprises 26 items, which measure the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The WHOQOL-BREF is a shorter version of the original instrument that may be more convenient for use in large research studies or clinical trials.</description>

    <description>Music intervention: Listening to soft music was found to be an effective method of relaxation, as indicated by a shift of the autonomic balance toward parasympathetic activity. Participants listen to preferred soft music for 30 minutes before sleeping. Proprioceptive intervention: The proprioceptive intervention can activate the parasympathetic nervous system through pathways of the central nervous system, providing calming effects that significantly reduce anxiety, hyperactivity and agitation in various populations.Participants do 10-minute joint compression exercise three times per day by themselves.</description>
