    <textblock>
      This study is in line with the UAEs national drive to promote happiness and wellbeing.
      University students risk impaired psychological health, wellbeing, and sleep due to academic
      pressures. This research is the first to assess the feasibility of using a laughter
      prescription to improve psychological health and sleep in Zayed University students. Forty
      students will be recruited, and randomized to a control or laughter group.

      The Laughie is a self created app or tool. It is a one minute recording of the user's joyful
      laughter on their smartphone. Once recorded, the user uses it by playing back the recording
      and laughing with it for the duration of the one minute. The Laughie acts as a prompt to
      guide the one minute of laughter.

      In this research the experimental group each record their own Laughie, demonstrated and
      supported by the PI(s). They are then prescribed to laugh with their Laughie: 3x a day the
      first week (morning, lunch, and afternoon) and at least 2x a day during the second week.
      Immediately after using their Laughie they fill in a Laughie checklist to record whether they
      laughed for the full minute, whether they enjoyed their Laughie, and how they felt
      afterwards.

      This study tracks sleep using wrist actigraphy in the control group (no Laughie prescription)
      and in the Laughie group. All participants complete one week baseline using sleep watches,
      and sleep diaries, prior to the Laughie intervention. They all then continue to track their
      sleep during the intervention. All participants complete WHO Five well-being, PSKI, and HADS
      pre and post intervention. During the intervention the Laughie participants complete Laughie
      checklists. All participants are invited for a final interview (the control group about the
      sleep equipment experience). A follow-up survey is sent to the Laughie group 2 months after
      their prescription.
