  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Faced with high rates of immunization drop-out, Uganda's immunization program requires
      innovative approaches to address this weakness. Building upon Uganda's growing mHealth
      infrastructure to pilot a scalable short message service (SMS) system to remind caregivers of
      their children's upcoming vaccination visits, it was hypothesized that the SMS intervention
      will increase immunization coverage in a cost-effective and affordable manner that would make
      it scalable. The study design was an investigator-blinded, multi-center, parallel groups
      randomized controlled trial with randomization occurring at the caregiver level in select
      health facilities of Arua District in Uganda. Enrollment took place at the time of
      Pentavalent 1 vaccination, and both arms included standard of care provided by the health
      worker. However, in the intervention arm, caregivers also received SMS text messages
      reminding them to return for their children's second and third doses of Pentavalent vaccine
      (four and eight weeks after the first dose of Pentavalent vaccine) and measles-containing
      vaccine (9 months of age). The primary outcome of interest is vaccination coverage at 12
      months of age among children enrolled in the study and will be measured by comparing Penta3
      and MCV coverage between arms. The study will also examine the SMS impact on timeliness of
      vaccine receipt, as it is hypothesized that those children receiving the SMS intervention
      will be more likely to have timely vaccination than those in the control group. The study
      will also assess caregiver acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the SMS intervention. In
      addition to assessing its impact on strengthening the immunization program, this intervention
      has implications for strengthening other programs of the health system through similar health
      messaging directed toward caregivers.
