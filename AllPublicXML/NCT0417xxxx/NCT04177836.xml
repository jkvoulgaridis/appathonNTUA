  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this proposal is to experimentally test whether a mindfulness
      intervention improves relationship quality. Romantic couples from the community will be
      randomly assigned to one of two arms: mindfulness vs. active control. Both interventions will
      be completed on a smart-phone for 14 days using identical intervention activities as our
      existing published research. After the 14-day period, couples will attend a lab visit and
      provide relationship quality data.

      Romantic couples from the community will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: mindfulness
      vs. active control. Thus, both partners will either complete the mindfulness intervention
      (developed to increase attention towards and acceptance of current experiences) or a
      relaxation-based active treatment comparison intervention (developed to parallel the
      structure of the mindfulness intervention without the attention towards or acceptance of
      present experiences). Both interventions will be completed on a smart-phone for 14 days using
      identical intervention activities as our existing published research, which demonstrated that
      the mindfulness intervention reduced stress reactivity and improved daily well-being. After
      the 14-day period, couples will attend a lab visit and provide multi-method relationship
      quality data.
