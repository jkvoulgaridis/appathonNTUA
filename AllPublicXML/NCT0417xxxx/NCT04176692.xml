  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The movement control of shoulder joint relies not only on the glenohumeral joint, but also
      the critical contributions from scapulothoracic joint. The relating scapula muscle strength,
      scapula mobility and, the most important of all, the capacity of neuromuscular control should
      be integrated into the rehabilitation program for patients with shoulder disorders. With
      regarding to the subacromial impingement syndrome or rotator tendinopathy, the status of
      scapula dyskinesia and dysfunctions were improved significantly after the intervention of
      scapula-emphasized exercise. But there was no study addressed the relationships between
      stiffness of relating muscles and the deficits of scapula movement. The stiffness had been
      shown to serve an important role in functional performance of the corresponding joint. For
      example, the decreased elasticity of supraspinatus muscle was noticed on affected side
      comparing in patients with impingement syndrome.Few studies examined the effects of altered
      muscle stiffness on kinematic performance in shoulder complex. Laudner et al. found that the
      stiffer the latismuss dorsi muscle was, the less upward rotation and posterior tilting, and
      the more internal rotation of scapula during arm elevation was exhibited in asymptomatic
      swimmers. Another study showed that the increased range of external rotation and posterior
      tilt of scapula during arm elevation were associated with the decreased stiffness of
      pectoralis minor. The recent study presented that the electromyographic activities and
      elasticities of middle deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles correlated
      significantly with the tissue elasticity during shoulder movement in healthy shoulder.
      However, there was no scientific information directly to prove the changes in characteristics
      of rotator cuff function as well as the impacts on kinematic control of shoulder complex.
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the relationship among characteristics of
      muscle properties and kinematic control healthy swimmers.
