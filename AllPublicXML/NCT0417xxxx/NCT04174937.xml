  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first-in-human dose (FHD) trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      dose-escalation trial assessing safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and
      multiple oral doses of PA in healthy male subjects.

      The study consists of two stages: single dose administration and multiple dose
      administration.

      The single dose administration stage includes 5 cohorts, multiple dose administration stage
      includes at least 4 cohorts (groups). Each cohort includes 8 subjects (6 active drugs and 2
      placebos). Cohorts intake ascending doses of study drug. The dose of 1st cohort is 1,0 mg/ml,
      the doses for the following cohorts will be estimated by the Data Monitoring Committee based
      on pharmacokinetics and safety results of previous group.

      For each subject study includes screening period, one baseline period on Day -1, a treatment
      period (1 day - at single dose stage; 14 days - at multiple dose stage), followed by safety,
      PK, assessments up to 72-96 hours post dose. Follow-up visits will take place on Day 7 ; 30;
      60 (single dose stage) and 30; 60; 90 (multiple dose stage).

    <description>The amount of urea nitrogen is measured in the blood. The urea is produced by liver in the urea cycle as a waste product of the digestion of proteins. The elevated levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen may be a sign that that kidneys aren't working efficiently. The accumulation of urea and other nitrogen-containing compounds in the blood due to renal failure leads to uremia. The main causes of an increase in Blood Urea Nitrogen are: high protein diet, decrease in glomerular filtration rate (suggestive of renal failure), decrease in blood volume (hypovolemia), congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage,[4] fever, and increased catabolism. Hypothyroidism can cause both decreased glomerular filtration rate and hypovolemia, but Blood Urea Nitrogen -to-creatinine ratio has been found to be lowered in hypothyroidism and raised in hyperthyroidism. It is measured in mmol/L. Normal range for the study: ≤8.3 mmol/L.</description>
