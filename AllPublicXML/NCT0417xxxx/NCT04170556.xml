  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is an oral tumour deactivation agent that potently blocks multiple protein
      kinases, including kinases involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2),
      oncogenesis (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E), metastasis (VEGFR3, PDGFR, FGFR) and tumour
      immunity (CSF1R). In particular, regorafenib inhibits mutated KIT, a major oncogenic driver
      in gastrointestinal stromal tumours, and thereby blocks tumour cell proliferation.

      Regorafenib has shown in clinical trials an acceptable benefit-risk across different tumor
      types, including colorectal cancer (CRC), GastroIntestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) and HCC.

      The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (≥30%) in patients receiving regorafenib
      are pain, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), asthenia/fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite and
      food intake, hypertension, and infection.

      Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody to the programmed death
      (PD)-1 receptor, blocking the interaction with PD-ligand (PD-L)1/PD-L213 and restoring
      T-cell-mediated antitumor activity. Nivolumab was evaluated in second-line the CheckMate 040
      Study (Escalation and Expansion cohort.

      In both cohorts of the CheckMate 040 Study, the safety profile was acceptable and there were
      no reported nivolumab-related deaths. In the dose-expansion cohorts from the Phase 1/2
      CheckMate 040 Study, 65% of patients had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any
      grade 18% with Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs with fatigue, pruritus, and rash being the most common.
      Elevation of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were the most
      frequent Grade 3-4 TRAEs. AST/ALT elevations, however, were generally asymptomatic and
      readily managed.

      For this reason, the rationale of this Phase I/IIa trial is to optimize the action of
      regorafenib and nivolumab but bearing in mind the potential impact of the drug-interaction
      and enhancement of the severity and/or frequency of adverse events. Thus, regorafenib will be
      administered as monotherapy during the first 2 cycles (each cycle is 3 weeks on plus 1 week
      off) of treatment to enhance T cell trafficking and infiltration into the tumor bed to
      increase the benefits of anti-PD-PD-L1, specific stimuli while emitting Damage-associated
      molecular patterns (DAMPs), followed by regorafenib plus nivolumab to impact step 7 of the
      cancer immunity cycle described by Chen.

      The anti-PD-L1 effect under hypoxia was evaluated by Noman et al in a tumor model and they
      postulated that the abrogated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)-mediated T cell
      suppression is achieved in part by modulating the cytokine production (IL-6 and IL-10).
      Specifically, hypoxia could promote immunosuppression by reducing the cytotoxic efficacy of
      immune cells, by increasing the peri-tumoral immunosuppressive cell populations infiltration
      of and priming the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines.

      The aim of this study is to do a sequential treatment combining regorafenib, second- line
      treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with anti PD-1 to enhance the outcome of patients
      based on the synergy between both drugs.
