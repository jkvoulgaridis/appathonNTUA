      The purpose of this study is to determine the difference in the cornea's response to contact
      lens placement between healthy and unhealthy eyes. The amount of corneal swelling (corneal
      thickness) between normal and FECD patients before and after a stress test will be measured
      and compared.

      Clarity of the cornea is essential for optimal vision. The endothelium is a layer within the
      cornea that controls its clarity. Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive
      disease that affects both eyes in which the endothelium is dysfunctional, causing the cornea
      to swell and lose its clarity. Because of the vision loss associated with this swelling,
      corneal transplantation is needed for patients with advanced FECD.

      Currently, there is no method to directly measure how well endothelium cells are functioning
      in patients with FECD. Such a measurement, if it were possible, would allow physicians to
      identify patients who are at a higher risk of corneal swelling. The goal of this study is to
      establish a tool to measure and compare the amounts of corneal swelling between normal and
      FECD patients after a stress test is performed (the wearing of an FDA-approved contact lens.)
      Data will also be collected regarding how quickly and how well a cornea recovers from
      swelling in patients with healthy eyes compared to those with FECD.

    <intervention_model_description>A stress test will be performed (the wearing of a contact lens) to induce swelling in two groups: group A where the subjects have a diagnosis of Fuch's Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy, and group B where subjects have healthy eyes. Once the contact lens is removed, the cornea swelling will be measured in each group. The length of time it takes for the cornea to recover after being swollen will also be compared between the two groups.</intervention_model_description>
