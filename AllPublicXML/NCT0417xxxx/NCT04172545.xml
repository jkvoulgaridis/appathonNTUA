  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measure anesthetic condition used during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy stapling. Measure
      quality of stapling in resected stomach by measuring staple thickness. Find if any relation
      exists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During each staple firing the staple size, time of compression and anesthetic conditions
      being systolic arterial pressure, fluids transfused and intra abdominal pressure used are
      recorded.

      After removal of stapled stomach during surgery, thickness of stomach wall and thickness of
      staple line are measured and compared to evaluate quality of staple formation.

      the closer the staple height to the wall thickness the better the quality of stapling.
      Because no one has ever analyzed this relationship, and certainly not under different
      anesthetic conditions it is not clear yet if any relationship will be found.

      the analysis will help to understand the relation and help to start perhaps a randomised
      trial to learn what conditions are best to improve staple quality.

    <description>staples are fired through the gastric wall after waiting several seconds for compression without attention to blood pressure, fluids given or intra abdominal pressure, but these might have an impact on quality of stapling. therefore the conditions during stapling will be recorded during stapling.</description>
