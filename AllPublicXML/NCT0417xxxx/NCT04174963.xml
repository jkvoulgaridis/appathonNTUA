  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use disorders are common among young adults in psychiatric treatment. Unfortunately,
      cannabis use can result in deleterious consequences for those in treatment, including
      developing more severe psychopathology and poorer treatment outcomes. Brief, electronic
      interventions for cannabis use have been developed for young adults. An example of a
      frequently used brief electronic intervention for cannabis users is e-Toke. e-Toke can be
      completed on a computer, tablet or phone, and has been shown to improve motivation to engage
      in substance use treatment among college students. However, e-Toke is less useful in
      decreasing the actual frequency of cannabis use. Additionally, e-toke is not tailored to
      young adults in psychiatric treatment. In this study, the investigators will develop and test
      a text messaging intervention that can be easily added to the popular computerized
      intervention e-Toke. The research staff hope the intervention will improve motivation to
      decrease cannabis use, and decrease the frequency of cannabis use, among young adults in
      psychiatric outpatient treatment. The text messages will be developed by, and tailored to,
      young adults in psychiatric treatment and texts will address motivations and barriers to
      reducing cannabis use in the context of psychiatric disorders. If the text message
      intervention is found to be an effective addition to e-Toke, this approach can be tested in a
      larger study, and then disseminated to other young adults in psychiatric treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young adults 18-28 years old have the highest prevalence rates of cannabis use.
      Unfortunately, the biological consequences of cannabis use are more severe compared to older
      adults. These specific biological consequences are due to the negative effect cannabis use
      has on neurological maturation permanently impacting motivation, impulsivity, and future
      addictive behavior. The neurological effects of cannabis use are most disruptive to young
      adults living with psychiatric illness. In the Young Adult Behavioral Health Program at Rhode
      Island Hospital, 68% of patient's ages 18-28 who are in treatment for psychiatric disorders
      have used cannabis, and of those that have used 24% use cannabis daily or weekly. These high
      rates of cannabis use result in deleterious consequences, including developing more severe
      psychopathology, increased rates of psychosis, impairments in educational achievement and
      occupational obtainment, poorer treatment outcomes, poorer adherence to treatment, and
      increased treatment costs. Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) is an efficacious strategy
      for improving readiness to decrease cannabis use and increase motivation to engage in
      substance use treatment. The MET program entitled eToke (also known as E-Check-Up to Go), is
      a popular, frequently used, and previously investigated brief computerized intervention with
      efficacy in improving readiness for change among college students. In this study, the
      investigators propose to develop a text messaging intervention that will accompany eToke and
      will be tailored to young adults with psychiatric illness with cannabis use disorders. This
      intervention will be called e-Toke+TPsy. The text messages used in this intervention will
      contain information about the deleterious consequences of cannabis use, motivational material
      about the specific risks of cannabis use for young adults in psychiatric treatment. Texts
      will also contain behavioral skill building exercises to help reduce the frequency of
      cannabis use. The material for the text messages will be developed with input from young
      adults receiving psychiatric care at the Young Adult Behavioral Health Program. Text messages
      will also be informed by the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills Theory of
      learning (IMB Theory).

    <description>This self-report will be obtained using an abbreviated version of the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) nine times throughout the duration of the study. The abbreviated ASSIST will be administered at weeks 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-reported Motivation to Reduce Cannabis Use (SOCRATES)</measure>

    <description>Motivation to change substance use will be assessed using the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) adapted for cannabis use (19-item questionnaires that assess recognition, ambivalence, and taking steps). Change will be assessed from baseline to 12-weeks follow-up.</description>

    <description>Motivation to change substance use will be assessed using the Readiness Ruler (rates degree of readiness to cut down ranging from 1 to 10 for twelve different substance categories). Change will be assessed from baseline to 12-weeks follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-reported Motivation to Reduce Cannabis Use (DBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation to change substance use will be assessed using the Decisional Balance Inventory (16-item measure of the pros and cons of substance use). Change will be assessed from baseline to 12-weeks follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-reported Psychiatric Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mental health issues will be assessed by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), which yields primary symptom scales and global indices and has norms for adolescents and adults. The reliability, validity, and utility of the BSI instrument have been tested in more than 400 research studies. Internal consistency for the sub-scales (dimensions) range from .71 to .85. Each item will be reported on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater mental health symptoms. Change will be assessed from baseline to 12-weeks follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-reported Self-efficacy to Reduce Cannabis Use (SCQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be assessed with the Situational Confidence Questionnaire (SCQ-8), an 8-item measure that assesses an individual's confidence in being able to resist the urge to use a given substance across different situations. The SCQ has been demonstrated reliable and valid. Each item is reported on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy to resist using cannabis. Change will be assessed from baseline to 12-weeks follow-up.</description>
