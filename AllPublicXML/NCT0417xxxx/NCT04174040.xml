      Aim: The study aims to determine the effect of the anger management program to be implemented
      by integrating the rhythm component of music with the Gross Process Model of Emotion
      Regulation on the anger expression and anger types of nursing students determined to be under
      risk through screenings.

      Materials and Methods: This single-blind factorial designed randomized experimental research
      was conducted with three control groups. The study group consisted of third-grade students
      (N=67) who were determined to have scores above average from The State-Trait Anger Expression
      Inventory (STAXI). The study data were collected with pre-post tests and follow-up
      measurements using STAXI. The experimental interventions were completed in five sessions
      after pilot study with a specialist. The data were analyzed using one-way and two-way
      variance analyses (4x3 Factorial ANOVA). Effect size was measured with ε^2.

      Introduction: Nursing students' anger regulation functionally has increasingly gained
      importance. It is known that cognitive behavioral approaches and music can be used as
      effective tools for young adults. It is important that the rhythm component of music be
      integrated with the Gross Model of Emotion Regulation, which analyzes the emotional
      regulation processes on a cognitive-behavioral basis, and new interventional tools be
      developed, which can be regularly and easily accessed in psychiatric nursing. The study
      results will shed light on future studies in terms of using the Gross Model, integrated in
      musical rhythm studies, to manage functional anger in student nurses.

      Aim: The study aims to determine the effect of the anger management program to be implemented
      by integrating the rhythm component of music with the Gross Model of Emotion Regulation on
      the anger expression and anger types of nursing students determined to be under risk through
      screenings.

      Materials and Methods: This single-blind factorial designed randomized experimental research
      was conducted with three control groups. The study group consisted of third-grade students
      (N=67) who were enrolled in Ege University Faculty of Nursing and determined to have scores
      above average from The State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI). The study data were
      collected from 38 students who met the inclusion criteria. They were collected with pre-post
      tests and follow-up measurements using STAXI and introductory information form developed in
      light of the literature. The Gross Model of Emotion Regulation intervention program,
      integrated with musical rhythms, was completed in five sessions after pilot study. The
      sessions in the musical rhythms were carried out in company with a specialist. The data were
      analyzed using one-way and two-way variance analyses (4x3 Factorial ANOVA). The statistical
      significance level was measured with p˂0.05, and effect size was measured with ε^2. Ethical
      permissions were obtained to conduct the study.

    <description>Anger state and expressions were evaluated with using The State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory. This scale originally organized by Charles D. Spielberger in 1988. The scale, which evaluated trait anger (10 items) and state anger behavior (24 items), was adapted to Turk society by Özer N. in 1992. This tool was used to diagnose anger severity and behavioral reactions of anger in many national studies in child, adolescent and adult groups. Scale's Trait Anger dimension (anger expressions) were separated in three subscales as 'anger out', 'anger in' and 'anger control' which each includes eight items (subscale total score min:8, max:32). State Anger subscale has 10 items and total score range is between 10-40 points.</description>

    <description>Interventions were based on Gross's Process Model which include the basis concepts of cognitive-behavioral therapy and carried on with five semi-structured sessions. Cognitive-behavioral theories accept the existence of a thought process (attention-perception-interpretation) that appears in the mind about the event just before the anger emerges. Therefore, anger studies with cognitive-behavioral approach generally proceed with the steps of gaining awareness about this concealed thought, identifying behavioral response and avoidance attitudes and thus regulating emotion. It consists of five 90-minute group sessions structured in this context. While being an accredited cognitive behavioral therapist, investigator have qualified to manage these approach.
The effectiveness of these semi-structured sessions were evaluated by using:
Pretest application of STAXI
Taking feedback after each intervention session
Posttest application of STAXI

    <description>This musical group rhythm intervention was continued with 90 minute long five sessions. The students participated in the practice together with a music expert and lead researcher. The lead researcher took on the role of observer in these sessions. Each session was continued with warming, improvisation and targeted semi-structured rhythm practices aiming anger regulation.
