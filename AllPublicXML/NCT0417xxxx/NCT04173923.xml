  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Model of this study is a combined both retrospective chart review and follow up survey. Data
      of 4 hospitals will be used to find out the efficacy of conservative treatment in cervical
      myelopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical myelopathy is known as Its symptoms are progressively worsened, and there are only a
      small amount of positive outcomes other than surgery.

      However, as with other spinal and nerve disorders, non-surgical treatments are getting more
      attention in terms of patient safety, and because they provide patients with more choice in
      treatment than in terms of surgical treatment, they can provide closer approach to
      patient-centered care.

      Physical therapy and medication are well known for the currently known non-surgical and
      conservative treatments, but research reported on the treatment of cervical myelopathy by
      using Korean medicine treatment so far has its weak level. Therefore, it is expected that
      this study will demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment of cervical myelopathy in Korean
      medicine treatment and will further pave the way for non-surgical treatment of spinal
      myelopathy.

      Therefore, The investigators conducted observational trial to analyze the effectiveness of
      Korean medicine treatment in spinal myelopathy. Retrospective data will be extracted using
      electronic medical records and computerized data of hospitalized patients. Based on this,
      investigators will conduct research in the form of prospective survey and analyze the causal
      relationship and factors using the two data.

      The hospital's medical records will be used to analyze the patient's condition during the
      hospitalization period and to determine the situation after the end of treatment through
      questionnaire. The questionnaire will be developed after consultation with experts from
      musculoskeletal system and related societies, and will be used for the questionnaire.

    <description>The investigators will survey Numeric Rating Scale(NRS) scores of neck and upper extremity at the time of the disease and current symptoms.
NRS is a pain scale in which the patient indicates their subjective pain as a whole number from 0 to 10. The participant is asked to report their pain and discomfort using NRS, where 0 indicates 'no pain or discomfort' and 10 indicates 'the most severe pain and discomfort imaginable'.</description>

    <description>The investigators will survey current EuroQol 5-dimensions 5-levels scores. The EQ-5D-5L is a method of indirectly calculating the weights of certain health states for quality of life after a multidimensional investigation of health states, and is the most widely used instrument for this purpose. The EQ-5D consists of 5 questions about current health state (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression), and each question is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1=no problems, 3=moderate problems, 5=severe problems).</description>

    <time_frame>Finish survey by Jan 2020</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will survey current Patient Global Impression of Change scores.
The PGIC is an index that assesses improvements in functional limitation caused by whiplash injury. Participants rate the improvement in functional limitations after treatment on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Very much improved, 4=No change, 7=Very much worse). This index was originally developed for use in Psychology, but is currently used in various other medical fields to assess improvements in pain.</description>
