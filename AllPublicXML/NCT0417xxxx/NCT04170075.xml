      This study compares the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) + low intensity functional
      exercise training to improve mobility, lose weight, reduce neuropathy, fatigue and pain in
      cancer survivors with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility and safety of WBV + low intensity exercise training in older,
      overweight cancer survivors with CIPN

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of WBV + low-intensity functional exercise training on weight, body
      composition (muscle and fat mass) and physical functioning in older, overweight cancer
      survivors with CIPN.

      II. Explore the effect of WBV + low-intensity functional exercise training on symptom relief
      (neuropathy symptoms, pain, fatigue) and readiness to exercise in older, overweight cancer
      survivors with CIPN.

      OUTLINE: This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial with two groups. We will compare
      the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) + low intensity functional exercise training versus
      usual care control (UC). The intervention period is 12-weeks, with outcomes measured at
      baseline and 12-weeks.

    <measure>Objective physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Physical Performance Battery (PPB) to determine a person's ability to perform daily tasks independently. The PPB consists of 3 timed tests: 5 repeated chair stands, standing balance, and gait speed over 4 meters.
