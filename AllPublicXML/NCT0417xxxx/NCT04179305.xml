    <textblock>
      When advanced disease progresses, there comes a time when an oncologists must explain to
      their patients that they only have months left to live. During these discussions the
      oncologist attempts to explain to the patient their prognoses and what it means for them
      going forward. However our prior studies shown that even when patients only have months left
      to live, most do not understand that their cancer is incurable and that it is late/end-stage.

      Dying cancer patients who fully understand their prognosis are able to make more informed
      decisions and are therefore more likely to engage in advanced care planning, and receive care
      what in consistent with their values and preferences. They are also in a better position to
      avoid burdensome, non-beneficial care. The investigator developed Oncolo-GIST in order to
      help increase the number of patients who fully understand their prognosis and its
      implications.

      Oncolo-GIST is an intervention aimed at enhancing clinicians' communication with patients by
      teaching them to relay information both sensitively and using simple terminology. The
      Oncolo-GIST training will provide instruction in areas such as how to introduce the topic of
      prognosis (describe scan results as &quot;worse&quot;), how to phrase the prognosis itself (&quot;likely
      months, not years&quot;), how to explain expected treatment outcomes (e.g., &quot;not expected to be
      cured by treatment&quot;) and how to describe expected treatments impact on quality of life - that
      is, whether the anticancer treatment is likely to make them feel overall better or worse. The
      training materials consist of a manual and a set of videos that act out situations described
      in the manual.

      The second phase of this study will be a randomized controlled trial. The investigator will
      recruit (n=50) adults with metastatic GI or lung cancers with scan results that reveal
      progression (worsened disease) on an initial systemic treatment; that is, patients whose
      life-expectancy can reliably be estimated to be months, not years. Medical oncologists (n=8)
      who care for these patients will also be consented for study participation and half (n=4)
      will be randomized to receive the Oncolo-GIST training.

      Patients will be assessed by trained research staff in the week prior to a scheduled meeting
      with their oncologist to discuss the scan results. This will provide patients' baseline
      levels of prognostic understanding and enable the investigator to determine how the
      intervention relates to pre-post scan visit changes in prognostic understanding. Patients
      will be assessed post-scan within a week of that progressive scan visit and then 2 and 4
      months later.

      The assessment battery that will be administered at these time-points will measure the
      patient's degree of prognostic understanding, the primary outcome of the study. Other
      outcomes that will be measured by the assessment battery include the patients quality of
      life, therapeutic alliances of the patient, whether or not a DNR was ordered, the care
      received by the patient, whether or not the patient preferred greater quality of longer
      quantity of life, and whether or not the patients received &quot;value-consistent&quot; care.

      Despite exciting recent advances in cancer treatments, there still, ultimately, comes a time
      when advanced disease progresses, and patients can reliably be expected to have months, not
      years, left to live. For patients with metastatic cancers studied in the investigator's
      Coping with Cancer NCI R01s, this comes after progression on 1st- or 2nd-line therapy -- be
      it chemo-, immune-, or targeted therapy. Prior studies conducted by the investigator have
      found that oncologists can reliably predict when patients have only months to live (e.g.,
      remarkable agreement between oncologist estimates of months to live shared with patients and
      patients' actual survival of months). By contrast, patients appear largely unaware of their
      prognosis. For example, 5% of patients a median of 5 months from death, accurately understood
      they had incurable, late/end-stage, terminal cancer, and likely only months to live. Dying
      cancer patients appear to lack the prognostic understanding needed to make informed choices.

      Patients who grasp that they are dying (e.g., the 8.6% who &quot;get the gist&quot; that they likely
      have months to live), relative to those who do not, have been shown to have: a) higher rates
      of advance care planning (ACP), b) receive less burdensome, unbeneficial care (e.g., fewer
      intensive care unit, ICU, stays, less cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR), and c) more
      value-consistent care. The investigator has found that patient prognostic understanding is
      improved by oncologist discussions of life-expectancy, but despite 71% of patients wanting to
      discuss prognosis with their oncologists (83% adult cancer patients thought prognostic
      information was extremely/very important), only 17.6% of cancer patients within months of
      death reported that they had discussed prognosis with their oncologist. Not only do
      oncologists appear to discuss prognosis less than patients want them to, but even when
      prognostic discussions do occur, the investigator has found that some approaches (e.g.,
      matter-of-fact) are more effective than others (e.g., vague) for promoting patients'
      prognostic understanding. Thus, prior work identifies a need to improve communication to
      promote patient prognostic understanding in a way that oncologists will likely learn, accept,
      use, and possibly implement more broadly in clinical practice.

      To address this need, the investigator developed the &quot;Giving Information Simply
      &amp;Transparently&quot; (GIST), Oncolo-GIST intervention -- a manualized oncologist communication
      intervention that simplifies how to impart prognostic information by focusing on 4 basic
      steps: 1) Giving scan information, 2) Informing prognosis, 3) Strategizing sensitively, and
      4) Transparently asking what the patient heard. Unlike traditional emphasis on numerical or
      medical details, the Oncolo-GIST approach is based on Reyna's Fuzzy-Trace Theory of
      decision-making, which emphasizes the need for an understanding of the bottom-line gist of a
      situation. The Oncolo-GIST approach distills prognostic discussions to clear communication of
      end-of-life (EoL) decision-making essentials (e.g., life-expectancy). 3 specific aims of the
      Oncolo-GIST approach will be tested in 2 phases:

      Phase 1 will consist of two parts: 1) An interview of key stakeholders/key informants
      regarding Oncolo-GIST Version 1.0 in order to inform refinements to produce Oncolo-GIST
      Version 2.0. 2) An open trial of Oncolo-GIST Version 1.0 to inform refinements to produce
      Oncolo-GIST Version 2.0.

      Phase 2 will involve a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Oncolo-GIST Version 2.0
      on 50 patients with metastatic cancers worse on at least 1 line of therapy (chemo-, immune-,
      targeted), whose oncologists do not expect to survive 12 months. Patients will be assessed in
      the week prior to their scheduled scan, within 1 week of the clinic visit in which
      progressive scan results are discussed, and then 2 and 4 months later to explore intervention
      effects on primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Oncologists will be assessed in the
      week following that same clinic visit to obtain their impressions of the discussion of
      prognosis and the patient's prognostic understanding.

      In Phase 2, for the pilot cluster RCT, the investigator will recruit (n=50) adults with
      metastatic GI or lung cancers with scan results that reveal progression (worsened disease) on
      an initial systemic treatment; that is, patients whose life-expectancy can reliably be
      estimated to be months, as opposed to years. Medical oncologists (n=8) who care for these
      patients will also be consented for study participation and half (n=4) will be randomized to
      receive the Oncolo-GIST training. The investigator expects 6-7 patients will be clustered
      within each of the 8 oncologists. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) techniques will be
      employed to address the non-independence of patient assessments within each cluster. Patients
      (n=25) will be seen by either an Oncolo-GIST trained oncologist or an oncologist not trained
      in the intervention; that is, usual care (n=25). Patients in both arms will have met the same
      eligibility criteria (i.e., have similar prognoses).

      Patients will be assessed by trained research staff in the week prior to a scheduled meeting
      with their oncologist to discuss the scan results. This will provide patients' baseline
      levels of prognostic understanding and enable the investigator to determine how the
      intervention relates to pre-post scan visit changes in prognostic understanding. Patients
      will be assessed post-scan within a week of that progressive scan visit and then 2 and 4
      months later. Although not all patients are expected to die within the study observation
      period, given a median life expectancy of ~4-5 months from baseline, the investigator expects
      nearly half of the enrolled patients will die 4 months from baseline, and that the vast
      majority will die during the study observation period. Thus, for all patients enrolled in
      this study, the medical care that they receive can reasonably be considered end-of-life care,
      whether they die during the study observation period or not.

      The primary outcome is the patient's degree of prognostic understanding, measured using the
      investigator's validated 4-item assessment. The investigator will determine if the patient
      understood the scan results to be &quot;worse&quot; and their understanding of expected outcomes of
      treatments proffered (re: curability, survival, quality of life). Outcomes will also include
      whether a DNR order was completed for the patient, the McGill Quality of Life measure,
      performance status (e.g., Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG), and care received (e.g.,
      anticancer, intensive, palliative care). Treatment preferences will be assessed using the
      SUPPORT question regarding quality vs. quantity of life, which will be used to compare with
      actual EoL care received to operationalize &quot;value-consistent&quot; care. The investigator's
      validated Human Connection scale will assess therapeutic alliances from both the patient and
      oncologist perspective, and the investigator will assess oncologists' sense of how the scan
      discussion went (e.g., degree to which they think they communicated effectively, and that the
      patient understood them and had an accurate prognostic understanding). Demographic/background
      information (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, sex, education) and DNR documentation will be
      obtained from subject self-report at baseline and the patient's medical records. Previously
      validated measures will assess potential confounding influences such as time from diagnosis,
      prior discussions of prognosis, and health literacy using the REALM. Preferences regarding
      medical decision-making (e.g., an active vs. passive role in deciding the best course of
      treatment), patients' Religious Beliefs in EoL Care (RBEC), and the question &quot;If your doctor
      knew how long you had left to live, would you want him/her to tell you?&quot; will be assessed.

      Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to evaluate intervention effects. HLM is
      statistically appropriate because it accounts for the clustering of patients within
      oncologists, creating non- independence of clustered assessments. HLM will model oncologists
      as a random effect as has been done in prior RCTs. Baseline covariates known to affect study
      outcomes (e.g., patient health literacy) will be included in models to increase the precision
      of effect size estimates. This will provide a preliminary effect size estimate of Oncolo-GIST
      Version 2.0's ability to improve patients' prognostic understanding for a future, larger
      study. Linear and logistic regression models will estimate effects of the Oncolo-GIST
      intervention on secondary and exploratory outcomes.

      The details for Phase 1 of the study are enumerated in a separate record marked &quot;Giving
      Information Systematically and Transparently in Lung and GI Cancer Phase 1&quot; (Oncolo-GIST P1).

    <description>Changes in illness understanding by patients as measured by the investigator's validated 4-item assessment will be compared between groups at one-week, two-month and 4-month follow up assessments (T2, T3, and T4). The assessment asks four questions that assess patients' terminal illness acknowledgment (TIA), recognition of their incurable disease status, knowledge of the advanced stage of their disease, and expectation to live months as opposed to years. Responses are coded 1 or 0 to indicate the presence or absence of each of these element. These four indicators are then added together to construct summary scores (possible range, 0 to 4). Differences between pre- and post-scan visit illness understanding scores (possible range, -4 to 4) are used to define changes in illness understanding by a patient between the pre- and post-scan visit interviews. Higher total scores represent an increase in prognostic understanding. Lower scores represent a decrease in understanding.</description>

    <description>Preference of patients to prefer treatment focused on extending life as much as possible vs. treatment focused on relieving pain, as measured by the investigator's SUPPORT question, will be matched with actual care received to, as determined from a medical chart abstraction, to create a measure of value-consistent care. This will take place at one-week, two-month and 4-month follow up assessments (T2, T3, and T4). Logistic regression analyses will then model the effects of having an Oncolo-GIST trained physician on the odds of patients' receipt of value-concordant care. Higher odds equal better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Quality of life of patients, as measured by the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire, will be compared between groups at one-week, two-month and 4-month follow up assessments (T2, T3, and T4). This questionnaire contains 16 items and each item uses a 10-point scale, where 0 is desirable and 10 is undesirable. Separate sub-scales scoring for global, physical, psychological, emotional and existential well-being, are determined by taking the mean of the associated items. The score for overall quality of life is determined by taking the mean of all the sub-scales. Higher total scores represent better quality of life. Lower scores represent worse better quality of life.</description>

Topic covered include:
Principles of introducing prognosis in the setting of worsened scan results Coupling communicating realistic prognoses with psychological support (e.g., saying &quot;average life-expectancy is months…&quot; with emphasizing that the oncology team &quot;will always provide care for you&quot;) Addressing informational needs and psychological reactions Applying proven techniques for supporting patients who are reluctant to discuss prognosis.
The 4-step guide will include brief video-clips of demonstrating each &quot;talking point&quot; with a standardized patient, including ideal scenarios, common pitfalls to avoid, and how to respond to patient reactions that are particularly challenging, such as responding to optimism, death anxiety, and reliance on faith.</description>
