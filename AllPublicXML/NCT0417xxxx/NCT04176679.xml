  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Hypervascularized products of conception remain a topic debated in terms of definitions
      (ultrasound criteria, need complement by angio MRI) and management. The different uterine
      vascular lesions are often confused. This is a recurrent problem and care are heterogeneous.
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the management of these entities in CHU of Montpellier
      and determine more homogeneous care. The investigators further aimed to evaluate clinical
      presentation, ultrasound criteria, complications and the gynaecological and obstetrical
      outcomes of patients •Methods: This study will be conducted in compliance of ethic comitee.
      The investigators will collect data from 64 individuals, aged 18 to 50, suffering from
      uterine vascular lesions associated or not with products of conception between 2013 and 2019.
      Caracterisitics of the population, ultrasound and angio MRI data will be collected.
      Management wll be described as expectative, surgery or embolization of uterine arteries and
      the success or not will be noted. The investigators will question patients on their
      gynaecologic and obstetrical outcomes by telephone.

      •Discussion: The investigators aim to define and characterize the different lesions,
      establish ultrasound criteria that would guide treatments. Describe the current treatments
      and compare them in terms of efficiency and safety in order to establish a homogeneous
      treatment protocol in our center
