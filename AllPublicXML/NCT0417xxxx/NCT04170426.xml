    <textblock>
      This is an investigational new drug clinical trial for combined Phase 1 dose escalation study
      and Phase 2a randomized, placebo controlled and double blinded study using intravenous
      injection of autologous adipose stem cells (Celltex AdMSCs) for rheumatoid arthritis
      patients. All subjects are monitored for safety (adverse events/severe adverse events) and
      evaluated for RAPID3, DAS28 and ACR20 regarding AdMSCs up to 52 weeks study duration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must pass communicable disease screen tests for HIV, syphilis, Hepatitis B and C
             Consistent with American Rheumatism Association-European League Against Rheumatism
             (ACR/EULAR) 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria

          -  Active Rheumatoid Arthritis, see RA functional status of class I-IV

          -  Patients must meet at least one of the following: &gt; 6 swollen joints and ≥ 6 involved
             joints (tenderness, swelling, deformity, pain on motion, or decreased motion) and
             morning stiffness ≥ 45 minutes based on 68 joint count.

          -  Patients must also meet at least one of the following: rheumatoid factor (RF) &gt; 15
             IU/mL or &gt; 1:16, C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 2.0 mg/dL, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate
             (ESR) &gt; 30 mm/hour, and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (Anti-CCP) &gt; 20 U/mL, TNFα &gt;
             2.8 pg/mL.

          -  Patients must have failed anti-rheumatoid drug due to adverse event or inefficacy for
             at least 12 week and at least 4 weeks on stable dose of methotrexate ≤ 25 mg/week, or
             leflunomide ≤ 20 mg/day, or sulfasalazine ≤ 3 g/day, or steroids (Prednisone &lt;10
             mg/day).

          -  For other medications, patients must be on the stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior
             to study entry in order to preclude changes to patient medication while participating
             on the study to ensure that a medication change could become a confounding factor in
             data interpretation.

          -  All patients must be clinically stable with no significant changes in health status a
             minimum of at least 4 weeks prior to randomization and confirming patient eligibility

          1. Current or prior to treatment

               -  Participation in another clinical study (with use of another Investigational
                  Medical Product) within 3 months prior to study treatment start

               -  Evidence of immune suppression related to prior/current therapy

               -  &gt; 10% change in delivered monthly dose of anti-rheumatoid medications within 4
                  weeks prior to this stem cell infusion

               -  Use of a new or additional anti-rheumatoid medication within 6 weeks prior to
                  this stem cell infusion

          2. Concurrent Conditions

               -  Clinically active malignant disease

               -  Severe bladder or thrombotic disorder

               -  History of known pulmonary embolism or known secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome

               -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any components used to culture or store
                  the AdMSCs, e.g. sulfur or sulfonamide

               -  Known or suspected antibodies to any components used to culture the AdMSCs, e.g.

               -  Mental condition rendering the subject (or the subject's legally acceptable
                  representative[s]) unable to understand the nature, scope and possible
                  consequences of the study

               -  Alcohol, drug, or medication abuse within one year before study treatment start

               -  Any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, is likely to interfere with
                  evaluation of the AdMSC therapy or satisfactory conduct of the study

               -  Irreversible severe end organ failure, such as heart failure/attack, stroke,
                  liver and renal failure

               -  Heavy smokers, bed-bound patients, patients or family history with

               -  Renal impairment, defined as serum creatinine &gt; 133 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dL)

               -  Positive virology/serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
                  (HBsAg positive), hepatitis C and/or syphilis
