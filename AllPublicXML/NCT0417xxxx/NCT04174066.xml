  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (INS) is a kidney disease characterized by massive proteinuria
      and hypoalbuminemia. It includes two anatomopathological entities: nephrotic syndrome with
      minimal glomerular lesions (SNLGM) and primary segmental and focal hyalinosis (PHF). Renal
      biopsy reveals a fusion of the feet of the podocytes without inflammatory lesions or deposits
      of immune complexes. Clinical and experimental observations strongly suggest that the immune
      system and podocyte dysfunction are the two facets of the disease. There are currently no
      clinical or biological markers to predict the diagnosis of corticosteroid sensitivity,
      corticosteroid dependence, or risk of recurrence of kidney disease after kidney
      transplantation. To our knowledge, no prospective studies have been designed to study both
      immune system alterations and podocyte damage as well as genetic predisposition variants in
      NIS. Therefore, the use of steroids/immunosuppressive agents is purely empirical with a
      multitude of side effects.

      The objective is to identify and test new therapeutic targets rather than conducting new
      trials with existing treatments, using either drug candidates or molecules selected by high
      throughput screening of libraries of repositioning molecules using an appropriate read-out.
      The biobank may also be used to analyze the effects of conventional treatments on identified
      new biomarkers. We expect the project to produce original and patentable results with
      subsequent valuation. Patentability will be anticipated before any publication on the
      subject. The patent and valorization cells of hospitals, INSERM and Universities will be
      involved in the results as soon as they are obtained.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  First episode of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in a child aged 12 months to 18 years
             with a weight &gt; 10 kg and biologically defined as proteinuria &gt; 0.20 g / mmol
             creatinuria and hypoalbuminemia &lt;25 g / mmol

          -  First episode of NIS defined in adults as albumin level &lt;30 g / L and a urinary
             protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) â‰¥ 300 mg / mmol systematically associated with the
             performance of a renal anatomopathological examination and characterized by the
