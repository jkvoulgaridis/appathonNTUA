      This primary objective of the EXPAND G4 study is to confirm the safety and performance of the
      MitraClip G4 System in a post-market setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, multi-center, single-arm, prospective study to assess the safety and
      performance of the next generation MitraClip G4 System. The current protocol describes the
      design of this post-market study.

      Up to 100 post-market, consecutive, consented, patients treated with a MitraClip G4 device
      will be included for analysis into the MitraClip EXPAND G4 study. Clinical follow-up visits
      for this study is at 30 days. Cardiovascular adverse events will be reported through 30 days
      to confirm safety of the MitraClip G4 System.
