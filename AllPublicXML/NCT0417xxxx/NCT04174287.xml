  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose is the main energy source of brain. Different neural degenerative diseases such as
      Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease have shown distinct brain glucose metabolic
      patterns. FDG-PET is a established non-invasive method to measures cerebral glucose
      metabolism and can be used to differentiate different types of neurodegenerative diseases
      that anatomical imaging such as CT or MRI may not be able to differentiate. Among patients
      whose Alzheimer's diseases have not been confirmed, the defects in brain glucose metabolism
      can predict future amyloid plaque deposition. On the other hand, early amyloid plaque
      deposition may predict the future occurrence of Alzheimer's disease as early as 15 years
      before the onset. This research project is focusing on the sequential change of the two
      biomarkers of brain glucose metabolism and amyloid plaque deposition and their correlation
      with clinical symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The subjects in this project
      will be including normal controls without cognitive impairment, patients with prodromal AD or
      AD. The relationship between functional connectivity of FDG-PET and amyloid deposition in
      different group of patients will be investigated. Further correlation with tau PET will be
      also discussed.

      In the imaging process part of this project, the standard tool, SPM (Spatial Parametric
      Mapping) will be applied. As machine learning/deep learning methodology is gaining popularity
      in medical imaging research community, collaboration with artificial intelligence core
      laboratory at Linkou will be pursued to investigate hidden correlation between functional
      connectivity, amyloid plaque, progress of clinical symptoms with time that previous
      statistical methods may not be able to find.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All the participants must meet the following criteria:

               1. Age between 55-80 years.

               2. Patients population: Diagnosed as prodromal AD or mild AD dementia based on IWG-2
                  criteria.

               3. Normal control population: Cognitive unimpaired individual is defined as normal
                  control in this study. Cognitive un-impaired normal control is defined as
                  cognitive performance in the non-impaired range for that individual, defined as
                  not mild cognitive impairment or demented. The normal control should have their
                  clinical dementia rating score 0 AND Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument
                  (CASI) scores rated &gt;50 percentile.

               4. Able to provide written informed consent with reliable caregiver in AD
                  population. The participant should have reading ability OR 6/more years of formal
                  education OR with working experiences.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants must not meet the following criteria:

               1. Already receive outpatient clinic follow-ups with diseases that may affect the
                  cognitive evaluation or presentation that include but not limited to
                  Parkinsonism, Parkinson's disease dementia, epilepsy, schizophrenia, major
                  depression, major psychiatric disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, major head trauma
                  with consciousness loss.

               2. Severe progressive or unstable systemic disease that may interfere with the
                  follow-up and test results. These included but not limited to cancer in the past
                  5 years, end stage renal or liver dysfunction, clinically significant myocardial
                  infarction (New York Heart Association Functional Classification III-IV), Active
                  disease that received admission in the past one year and unstable angina. Other
                  diseases that were not listed but may interfere with the follow-up or test will
                  be judged by the principle investigator.

               3. Any treatment that suggests any of the aforementioned disease will be excluded.

               4. Depression with ongoing diagnosis and treatment, suicide idea or suicide behavior
