  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, multiple dose, 2 cohort, Phase 3b study to assess the
      safety and efficacy of CCH in adult women with mild or moderate edematous fibrosclerotic
      panniculopathy (EFP).

      Cohort 1 will include approximately 80 subjects with mild or moderate EFP in the
      posterolateral thighs and Cohort 2 will include approximately 70 subjects with mild or
      moderate EFP in the buttocks.

          3. Has systemic conditions (coagulation disorders, malignancy, keloidal scar, abnormal
             wound healing) that restricts study participation.

          4. Has local (in areas to be treated) conditions (thrombosis, vascular disorder, active
             infection/inflammation, active cutaneous alteration, tattoo/mole) that restricts study
             participation.

          5. Has skin laxity or linear undulations on the treatment region (both buttocks or both

         10. Has received treatment with an investigational product within 30 days (or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer) of the Screening Visit.
