  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3 double-blinded randomized multicenter clinical trial of SCT-I10A or placebo
      plus docetaxel with previously treated squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer patients. The
      main endpoint is to compare the overall survival (OS) of these two regimens above.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, there were near 787,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer in China. And in the
      very same year, 631,000 lung cancer patients died of the disease. Lung cancer still causes
      most cancer related death in here. Approximately 85% of lung cancer is non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) compared with small cell lung cancer (~15%) pathologically. NSCLC include
      squamous cell NSCLC, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. Although there are therapies
      developed to treat the condition, patients with advanced squamous-cell (NSCLC) who have
      disease progression during or after first-line chemotherapy have limited treatment options in
      China. Hence, we developed a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1)
      immune-checkpoint-inhibitor monoclonal antibody (SCT-I10A) which inhibits the interaction
      between PD-1 and its ligands results in the reactivation of active T cell and finally leads
      to caner immunotherapy. We are now carrying out a phase 3 clinical trial to determine whether
      SCT-I10A plus docetaxel surpass docetaxel monotherapy with previously treated squamous-cell
      NSCLC patients. As designed in the protocol, 360 eligible subjects would be randomized into
      two arms in a ratio of 2:1. 240 subjects would be treated with SCT-I10A plus docetaxel in the
      experimental arm while 120 subjects would be treated with placebo plus docetaxel in the
      active comparator arm. Both of these arms will be treated with maintenance therapy after
      planed treatments. Our primary endpoint is overall survival, secondary endpoints are PFS,
      OSR, ORR, DOR, DCR and other efficacy and safety index.
