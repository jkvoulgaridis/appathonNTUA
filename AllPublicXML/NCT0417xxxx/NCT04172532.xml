    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of M3814 and to see how well it
      works when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer
      that cannot be removed by surgery and has not spread to other parts of the body (localized).
      M3814 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a
      shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving
      M3814 and hypofractionated radiation therapy together may work better than radiation therapy
      alone in the treatment of patients with localized pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of nedisertib (M3814) in combination with
      hypofractionated radiotherapy in patients receiving treatment for locally advanced pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma (LAPC). (Phase I) II. To determine the difference in progression free survival
      (PFS) between patients with LAPC treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy in combination
      with M3814 as compared to patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy alone. (Phase
      II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To evaluate plasma
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of M3814 in patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy.
      (Phase I) III. To compare the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of patients treated with
      hypofractionated radiotherapy plus M3814 to that of those treated with hypofractionated
      radiotherapy alone. (Phase II) IV. To compare the objective response rate (ORR) by imaging of
      patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy plus M3814 to that of those treated with
      hypofractionated radiotherapy alone. (Phase II) V. To compare the disease control rate in
      patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy plus M3814 as compared to those patients
      treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy alone. (Phase II) VI. To explore gene signature
      patterns in baseline patient tumor tissues that may suggest response to the combination of
      M3814 and radiotherapy, as identified on whole exome sequencing and ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      sequencing (seq). (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore changes in gene signature induced by M3814 and hypofractionated radiotherapy
      treatment as identified in analysis of cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the
      peripheral blood. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of M3814 followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy for 5 fractions every other day
      (QOD) over 2 weeks and receive M3814 orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy for 5 fractions QOD over 2 weeks
      and receive M3814 PO QD for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy for 5 fractions QOD over 2
      weeks and receive placebo PO QD for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, and
      then every 3 months for up to 2 years.

             of oral agents

          -  History of anaphylactic reaction to iodinated IV contrast required for radiation
             simulation. Patients with mild reactions may be enrolled, but must receive
             premedications for contrast allergy prior to imaging

          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant medications or herbal supplements that are
             strong inhibitors or strong inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP3A4/5 and
             CYP2C19. Concomitant use of CYP3A4/5 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index are
             also excluded. Patients may confer with the study doctor to determine if alternative
             medications can be used. The following categories of medications and herbal
             supplements must be discontinued for at least the specified period of time before the
             patient can be treated:

               -  Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C19: &gt;= 3 weeks prior to study treatment

               -  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C19: &gt;= 1 week prior to study treatment

               -  Substrates of CYP3A4/5 with a narrow therapeutic index: &gt;= 1 day prior to study
                  treatment

               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the
                  enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk
                  of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
                  prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
                  herbal product

          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant H2 blockers or proton-pump inhibitors
             (PPIs). Patients may confer with the study doctor to determine if such medications can
             be discontinued. These must be discontinued &gt;= 5 days prior to study treatment.
             Patients do not need to discontinue calcium carbonate

          -  Patients who have received a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days of dosing with
             M3814

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M3814 is a DNA-protein kinase (PK)
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with M3814, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother
             is treated with M3814

          -  Patients with a history of malignancy within 3 years of the screening visit. Patients
             with cutaneous carcinomas or in-situ carcinoma will be considered for study entry on a
             case-by-case basis
