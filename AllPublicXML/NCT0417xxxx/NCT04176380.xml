      RAPA-201-RRMM is an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized multicenter Phase II study of
      RAPA-201 autologous T cells in adults with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma who have
      received at least three (3) prior lines.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized multicenter Phase 2 study evaluating
      RAPA-201 cells in subjects with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma.

      After a subject consents to the study, an apheresis procedure will be performed to collect
      cells to manufacture the investigational product, RAPA-201 cells. During Cycle 1, subjects
      will receive pentostatin and low-dose, dose-adjusted Cyclophosphamide (PC regimen), but will
      not receive RAPA-201 cells. During Cycles 2 and beyond, Subjects will receive a conditioning
      regimen consisting of the PC regimen followed by the RAPA-201 cell infusions.

      Subjects will receive at minimum five cycles of treatment. If a subject has stable disease,
      they will receive an additional four cycles of PC regimen+RAPA-201 cells.

      All subjects who complete the active treatment portion of the study, prematurely terminate
      the study, or subjects who discontinue active treatment due to a toxicity attributable or
      related to the study drug will complete the follow-up portion of the study (approximately one
      year).

      Patients who experience progressive disease will be taken off study.

          -  Exposure to at least three different prior lines of therapy including exposure to at
             least two proteosome inhibitors (e.g. bortezomib), and at least two immunomodulatory
             drugs (e.g. lenalidomide) and at least one anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody agent (e.g.
             daratumumab) Documentation of a prior line of therapy must include at least one of the
             following three items: [1] medical records detailing prior treatment, best response to
             treatment, and date of progression; [2] myeloma markers (SPEP, UPEP, Immunoglobulin,
             FLC) at time of treatment and progression; or, [3] documentation by
