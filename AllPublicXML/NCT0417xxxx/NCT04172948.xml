      1. To determine if the adjunctive use of a Virtual Reality (VR) module on diaphragmatic
           breathing (DB) can improve the quality of life (QOL) and symptoms of children with
           functional constipation (FC) with pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) who are receiving
           standard of care treatment.

        2. To assess if a VR module on DB can decrease healthcare utilization for children with FC
           with PFD.

      The investigators will assess if the use a Virtual Reality (VR) module on diaphragmatic
      breathing (DB) can improve quality of life, constipation symptoms, and decrease healthcare
      utilization for children with functional constipation (FC) with pelvic floor dysfunction
      (PFD). FC is a common pediatric condition with a high prevalence and $4.25 billion yearly in
      healthcare expenditures. FC is often complicated with PFD as seen through stool withholding
      behaviors. Children with FC with PFD are referred to occupational therapy for biofeedback and
      DB training as standard of care. Occupational therapy uses to teach children with FC with PFD
      to relax their abdominal muscles, and subsequently their pelvic floor muscles, facilitating a
      more complete bowel evacuation. VR is a technology currently employed in rehabilitation
      services, anesthesiology and surgery. VR can provide a fun, immersive environment with a
      feedback component for children with FC to learn DB effectively and build a positive
      association with toileting.

      The purpose of this study is to examine if a virtual reality module that teaches children
      diaphragmatic breathing through an immersive game can improve the quality of life and
      decrease health care utilization for children with functional constipation and pelvic floor
      dysfunction.

    <description>Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM). The PAC-SYM (12-items) is a survey used to evaluate chronic constipation. Patients rank the symptoms on a 5 point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 4, 0 being absent and 4 being very severe. For each symptom, score changes of 0.5 points indicate minimal improvement, and changes in 1 point correspond to moderate clinical improvement.</description>
