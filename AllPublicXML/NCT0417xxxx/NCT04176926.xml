  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to validate the Fitbit ECG software algorithm's ability to detect
      atrial fibrillation using data derived from a Fitbit wrist-worn consumer device that features
      a single lead ECG. The performance of the software application will be measured against
      centralized Core Lab physician-adjudicated 12-lead ECG tracings from FDA cleared ECG monitors
      as reference standards. The Fitbit software is intended as a pre-screening technology. It
      should identify candidates who may benefit from further evaluation. The software is not
      intended to be a diagnostic system.

    <measure>Evaluate the software algorithm's ability to classify a heart rhythm as sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation from a waveform equivalent to a Lead I ECG.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of the software algorithm in classifying sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation from the equivalent of a Lead I ECG waveform, compared with physician's interpretation of a standard 12-lead ECG. Performance goals are 90% (sensitivity) and 92% (specificity)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Confirm the software's ability to produce a waveform clinically equivalent to a Lead I ECG from a clinical reference device (12-lead ECG).</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative assessment of the software produced waveform to reference Lead I from 12-lead ECG. Goal is &gt;0.80 of strips appear to overlay to the unaided eye.
Comparison of R-wave amplitudes between the Fitbit waveform and the clinical reference. Goal is &gt;0.80 of R-wave amplitudes to be within 2mm.</description>
