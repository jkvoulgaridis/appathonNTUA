    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of multiple abdominal subcutaneous injection of GB224 in
      combination with oral methotrexate in Chinese patients with moderate and severe active
      rheumatoid arthritis in two dose groups; the secondary objectives are to preliminarily
      evaluate the clinical efficacy such as ACR20 at week 32, ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 at weeks 12
      and 24, ACR50 and ACR70 at week 32, and DAS28 at weeks 12, 24 and 32 of multiple abdominal
      subcutaneous injection of GB224 in combination with oral methotrexate in Chinese patients
      with moderate and severe active rheumatoid arthritis in two dose groups as well as to
      preliminarily understand the immunogenicity and changes in pharmacodynamic variable (IL-6) of
      multiple abdominal subcutaneous injection of GB224 in combination with oral methotrexate in
      Chinese patients with moderate and severe active rheumatoid arthritis in two dose groups.

          3. Subjects who have confirmed rheumatoid arthritis for at least 3 months according to
             2010 American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria (amendment);

          4. The active stage is met at screening: the following 3 items should be met (based on 28
             joints): swelling of 4 or more joints; tenderness of 6 or more joints; at least one of
             the following criteria is met: erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt;28mm/h or C-reactive
             protein &gt;10mg/L (1.0mg/dL);

          5. Subjects who have been treated with MTX treatment for at least 12 weeks before the
             before the use of investigational products and the dose remains stable (10~15mg/week)
             for at least 4 weeks;

             least 4 weeks before the use of investigational products. Should any leflunomide is
             previously used, the subjects can be enrolled after washout with cholestyramine (8g,
             three times per day) for 11 days. If leflunomide is discontinued 12 weeks ago, the

             of investigational products, however, it should be discontinued at least 4 weeks
             before administration of investigational products due to inadequate response,
             intolerability or economic reasons. If similar biological preparations (IL-6/IL-6R

             at least 4 weeks; if no glucocorticoids are used, no oral administration is given at
             least 4 weeks ago.

          9. If the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are being administered before
             the use of investigational products, the dose should be stable for at least 2 weeks.
