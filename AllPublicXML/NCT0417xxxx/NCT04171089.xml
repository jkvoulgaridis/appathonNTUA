  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal ideation and behaviors are estimated to be as high as 4-16% and 1.5% (respectively)
      in the general 6-12-year-old population. However, there are currently no validated suicide
      prevention interventions specifically developed for this population.

      This study aims to: (1) test the feasibility and acceptability of the Safety Planning
      Intervention for prepubertal Children (C-SPI) in 30 children (ages 6-12) who have made a
      suicide threat, suicidal behavior or reported suicidal ideation, and their parents, and (2)
      improve the investigator's understanding of suicidal ideation and behaviors in this age
      group. The results from the current project will be used to further develop the C-SPI, and to
      develop preliminary guidance and associated policy for clinicians to use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) is a brief, protocol-driven and individually tailored
      tool that uses evidence-based practices for suicide prevention. The SPI aims to provide the
      individual with quick distraction and coping tools to overcome a suicidal crisis without
      acting upon the suicidal thoughts. The SPI was used in the Treatment for Adolescents Suicide
      Attempters study in youth 12-19 and has been found to be feasible and acceptable among adult
      patients and staff as well as among clinicians who work with adolescents. Its effectiveness
      in reducing suicide risk among veterans has also been confirmed. The SPI could be a good fit
      for children, as it uses concrete ways for the person to recognize their reaction, as well as
      concrete methods to cope with distress, which fits with the developmental stage of
      prepubertal children. Moreover, the collaborative way in which the personal safety plan is
      tailored to the suicidal person will allow the engagement of the child in the intervention.
      The SPI is an intervention that is relatively easy to administer and, therefore, if found to
      be appropriate for this age group, it could be implemented in different child-focused
      settings, including schools. The aim of the study is to evaluate the acceptability and
      feasibility of the Safety Planning Intervention for prepubertal Children's (C-SPI) among
      suicidal children and their parents. Additionally, children will be interviewed and be
      assessed for impulsivity, attention bias, irritability and coping skills.

    <measure>Child's impulsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Child's impulsivity will be assessed using the &quot;Go/No-go&quot; computer task. The Go/No go is a measure of inhibitory control. An adaptation of the original Go/No go paradigm will be used, adjusted for elementary school children.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child's symptoms of irritability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Child's symptoms of irritability will be assessed using the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI). The ARI is a seven-item scale that is both parent- and child-reported. The ARI asks about symptoms of irritability in the previous 6 months and includes an item assessing impairment due to irritability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child's attention bias</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Child's attention bias will be evaluated using the Emotional picture dot prob computer task. The Emotional picture dot prob task is a spatially oriented, motivated attention task that capture the preattentive mechanism that automatically directs attention toward biologically relevant aversive stimuli, providing an indirect index of emotional reactivity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child's coping skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Child's coping skills will be assessed using the Children's Response Styles Questionnaire. The Children's Response Styles Questionnaire consists of 25 items, each of which describes a particular response to symptoms of depression. For each item, children are asked to indicate how often they respond in this way when they are feeling sad. The items are grouped into two scales: (1) Ruminative Response subscale; and (2) Distracting Response subscale.</description>

    <description>Child's conceptual level of death will be assessed using the Death interview for children. The Death interview for children is an interview comprised of open-ended questions. It has been widely used to assess children's understanding of death as a biological event.</description>
