      A Phase 3 randomized clinical trial of oral GnRH antagonist pre-treatment for women with
      endometriosis who are undergoing IVF, with a primary outcome of live birth rate. The
      investigators' central hypothesis is that in infertile woman with endometriosis undergoing in
      vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET), live birth rates will improve in those
      pretreated with GnRH antagonist compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is a common complication of endometriosis; while IVF successfully treats
      endometriosis-associated infertility, pregnancy rates are diminished compared to other
      etiologies of infertility. The study's long- term objectives are to better identify and treat
      endometriosis related infertility. The investigators' central hypothesis is that in infertile
      woman with endometriosis undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET), live
      birth rates will improve in those pretreated with GnRH antagonist compared to placebo. The
      use of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist prior to IVF has been suggested to
      improve success, however studies have been small and rarely reported live birth rates.
      Further, use of this approach is limited by the long treatment time required. Recent approval
      of an oral GnRH antagonist for endometriosis provides a novel option for women with
      endometriosis who are undergoing IVF. This agent avoids parenteral administration and the
      prolonged delay in initiation of action as was seen with GnRH agonists. There have been no
      studies on the efficacy of GnRH antagonists for the treatment of endometriosis-related
      infertility. The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial of oral GnRH antagonist
      pre-treatment for women with endometriosis who are undergoing IVF, with a primary outcome of
      live birth rate. The investigators have also recently demonstrated aberrant microRNAs in the
      circulation of women with endometriosis, a panel of which investigators have subsequently
      validated as a biomarker with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of active
      disease. It is secondarily proposed that disease biomarkers will identify women who will
      benefit from GnRH antagonist pre-treatment, allowing a precision medicine approach to
      endometriosis-related infertility. The proposed study is significant due to the common
      occurrence of both infertility and endometrioses as well as the lack of precision in both
      diagnosis and therapy. The investigators use an innovative approach to identify endometriosis
      as well as a novel intervention designed to improve the prognosis of women with endometriosis
      undergoing IVF.

    <intervention_model_description>Half of the subjects (407) will receive elagolix 200mg twice a day (BID) and the other half of subjects (407) will receive placebo BID, both for a minimum of 60 days before IVF cycle start. For convenience of IVF cycle scheduling, participants may receive up to an additional 14 days of intervention (elagolix or placebo) beyond the minimum 60 days of pre-IVF treatment, such that the last dose of study intervention (elagolix or placebo)is received no more than 24 hours before start of IVF treatment protocol.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A computer-generated randomization list will be created by the PREGnant Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and randomization will be performed prior to the first dose of elagolix. Randomization will have random sizes (2, 4, or 6) of blocks and be stratified by site, i.e. whole blocks are assigned to sites. The randomization list will not be available to any person involved in the conduct and evaluation of the trial until the trial is complete and database is declared clean and is released by the DCC. Likewise, treatment allocation information will not be accessible to investigators (except for serious safety concerns), trial staff at the site or central laboratory personnel during the trial.</masking_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who plan to undergo IVF for treatment of infertility.

          2. Age ≥18 and &lt;38 years at time of signing informed consent.

          3. Documentation of diagnosis of endometriosis by surgical visualization of endometriosis
             (laparoscopy or laparotomy) or diagnosis by pathology within the last 10 years before
             the initial trial entry visit or documentation of ovarian endometrioma &gt;2 cm or two or
             more smaller endometriomas that total &gt;2 cm in diameter. If entry is based on the
             presence of an endometrioma, transvaginal ultrasound evaluation must document the same
             unambiguous endometrioma on two separate occasions in more than one menstrual cycle.
             Images will be printed or transmitted electronically and read centrally by
             investigators at Yale to assure uniform diagnostic criteria (classic ground glass
             appearance) are applied.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 18-40 kg/m2 (both inclusive) at screening.

          5. AMH &gt; 0.8 ng/ml, resulted within 6 months of planned IVF cycle start.

          6. Uterine cavity assessment by sonohysterogram or hysteroscopy within 6 months
             indicating absence of focal intracavitary pathology and hence adequacy for embryo
             transfer. Ultrasound features suggestive of adenomyosis will be acceptable for
             inclusion. Type 3 fibroids are allowed up to 4cm size

          7. Presence of at least one ovary with no clinically significant abnormalities other than
             endometrioma. For eligible subjects with evidence of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, a
             repeat US will be needed in a subsequent menstrual cycle to ensure persistent cyst for
             patient to be deemed eligible.

          8. Negative urine or cervical swab for gonorrhea and chlamydia within 12 months of
             screening.

          9. Willing and able to comply with trial procedures, including reporting of obstetrical
             outcomes after delivery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of GnRH agonists or antagonists within 6 months of study start, unless the
             antagonist was a part of a regular IVF cycle.

          2. Use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or birth control implants (e.g.
             Implanon® or Nexplanon®) within 10 months of study start.

          3. Continuous use of oral progestins (MPA, NETA) within 3 months of study start.

             oral contraceptive pill, progestin-only pill, transdermal patch or contraceptive ring)
             within 1 month of study start.

          5. Pregnancy greater than 8 weeks in length within the last 6 months.

          6. Number of previous IVF/ICSI attempts ≥3

          7. Presence of hydrosalpinx measuring &gt;2cm on ultrasound, untreated endometrial polyps or
             intrauterine adhesions.

          8. Abnormal cytology on a pap smear within last year. (CIN1 or HPV okay, CIN2 excluded
             unless treated and cleared, CIN3 excluded).

          9. History of malignancy within 5 years of the start of screening, except for treated
             basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

         10. Any suicide attempts in last 1 year.

         11. Hypersensitivity to the study drugs.

         12. Planned surgical treatment of endometriosis or planned surgery in the abdominal-pelvic
             area within the duration of the trial.
