  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial or antibiotic agents, which are essential to prevent and treat bacterial
      infectious diseases, have become one of the most widely used drugs in the world. In the
      European region, the highest rates of antibiotic consumption are reported in Turkey. There is
      a nearly fivefold difference between Turkey and the lowest consuming countries.

      Studies in dentistry evaluate participants according to the basis of predefined criteria.
      History of antibiotic consumption is one of the most common exclusion criteria for
      periodontal trials. However, there is still disagreement on how long the effect of systemic
      antibiotic agents on the oral mucosa and periodontal tissue lasts. It is unclear whether the
      timing of antibiotic consumption should be an exclusion criterion for genetic damage and
      histological studies during the selection of healthy participants.

      Periodontal status of participants in study groups is described as with or without
      periodontitis in many studies, because of the lack of clear definitions of periodontal health
      and gingivitis. It should be recognized that even the lack of visual signs of inflammation,
      some mild histopathological changes can be seen in the periodontium. Consequently, for the
      real diagnosis of the clinically healthy periodontium, clinical findings should be supported
      and confirmed with histological results.

      Micronuclei (Mn) are observed as abnormal nuclear structures and indicators of chromosomal
      level DNA damage. The oral mucosa epithelium is an immunologic barrier and affected by
      chemical factors such as antibiotic consumption. The Mn test to exfoliated epithelial cells
      from the oral cavity is utilized as a non-invasive diagnostic technique for monitoring the
      status of oral health. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on the comparison of
      the impacts of the timing of antibiotic consumption on human periodontal tissues and oral
      smear samples. The present study is undertaken to determine whether the different timing of
      antibiotic (amoxicillin) therapy has effects on the histopathology of gingiva and genetic
      damage of exfoliated cells from oral mucosa in healthy participants.

    <description>Modified histological criteria was the measurement used for the semi-quantitative histological assessment of gingival damage. Cellular components, vascularization, cell infiltration, necrosis, pyknotic nucleus, hyperemia, fibrosis, ulceration, atrophy, apoptosis, and rete peg configuration were scored by using a scale ranging from 0 to 3 (none : 0, mild: 1, moderate: 2, and severe : 3) for each criterion.</description>

    <description>The method has been applied both for monitoring chromosome damage and/or proteins may also result in unsuccessful attachment of a whole chromosome at anaphase stage which subsequently also gives rise to a micronucleus. Thus, quantitative determination of the micronuclei are unique amongst cytogenetic tests in that it provides a reliable measure of both chromosome loss and breakage.</description>

        A total of 45 systemically and periodontally healthy participants, who were referred to the
        clinics of the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul Medipol
        University between 2018 and 2019 for routine periodontal visits, were included in this
        study. Participants were divided into three groups based on the history of oral antibiotic
        (1 g amoxicillin bid, two times a day) consumption for upper respiratory tract infection in
        the previous 12 months: group I (n = 19), participants used antibiotic between 12-6 months
        before the sampling; group II (n = 13), participants used antibiotic between 6-3 months
        before the sampling; group III (n = 13), participants used antibiotic within a period of
        1-month before to sampling.
