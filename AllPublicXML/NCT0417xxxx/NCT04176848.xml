      The purpose of this study is to find out the effect that CFI-400945 and durvalumab have on
      breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFI-400945 is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests show that it works by
      blocking a specific protein called Polo-like Kinase 4 (PLK4) that is involved in cancer cell
      growth. CFI-400945 may slow down the growth of cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die.
      This drug has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 60
      patients. It appears to be well tolerated with few side effects. CFI-400945 seems promising
      but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard therapy.

      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Durvalumab is an immunotherapy
      drug and not a chemotherapy drug. Laboratory tests show that it works by allowing the immune
      system (PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction) to detect your cancer and reactivating the immune
      response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die.
      Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 6000
      people. In laboratory studies, when used together with CFI-400945, results seem promising but
      it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone. This is the
      first time that the combination of CFI-400945 and durvalumab has been tested in patients.

             to:
