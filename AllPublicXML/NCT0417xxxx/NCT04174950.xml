  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      200 patients who were diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and received total or partial
      laryngectomy were included. They were allocated into experimental and control group. Patients
      in experimental group were given ERAS based nursing intervention. Control group were given
      routine nursing intervention. Compare hope level, postoperative recovery, complication
      between two groups.
