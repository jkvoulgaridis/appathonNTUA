  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New research in animal models of MS suggests that greater training intensity is required to
      restore lost functions. We have developed and tested vigorous intensity cool room treadmill
      training that people with MS who have fatigue and heat-sensitivity can tolerate. This study
      will focus on the appropriate dosage of training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous research showed that vigorous aerobic training in a room cooled to 16°C can
      improve walking and measures of brain plasticity among people with MS related walking
      disability, especially in those who had fatigue and heat sensitivity. As a next step, we will
      compare our novel vigorous intensity cool room treadmill training to low intensity cool room
      treadmill walking and determine whether intensity is important in order to improve brain
      repair and restore walking among people with MS. Our first objective is to compare the
      effects of 12 weeks of vigorous versus low intensity training on walking. Our second
      objective is to determine whether treadmill training alters indicators of brain repair. We
      hypothesize that the cool room vigorous training will result in greater increases in walking
      and less fatigue, which will be sustained at follow-up. We also hypothesize that improvements
      will align with less brain inhibition (shortened CSP measured using Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation) and greater upregulation of the neurotrophin IGF-1.

    <description>Exercise will be performed on a treadmill using an overhead harness for safety in a temperature controlled-room at 16°C with 1:1 supervision. The high intensity group will maintain vigorous intensity with a target workload &gt;60% of heart rate reserve for 30 min (plus 5min warm up and 5min cool down) while the low-intensity group will walk at mild intensity (&lt;40% heart rate reserve) for the same duration. Heart rate, blood pressure, and rating of perceived exertion will be recorded throughout to monitor for potential adverse events and to ensure that target training zone heart rates are maintained. The intervention is 3 times per week for 12 weeks, with a 3-month run-in observational period to confirm disease stability, and 3-month follow-up to determine the sustainability of effects.</description>
