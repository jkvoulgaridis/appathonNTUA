      WELBOW study is an international, ambispective and prospective, single arm, multicenter,
      observational, non-comparative, Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF). Outcome data collected
      from this study will provide the basis for Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) reporting, Clinical
      Study Report (CSR) and Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) on Wright Medical Elbow system
      devices and support peer-reviewed publications on long-term product performance and safety.

    <measure>Clinical Assessment: MEPS questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 10 years except 7 years.</time_frame>

    <description>The QuickDASH is an abbreviated 11-question subset from the original Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. The questionnaire's answers are scored on a 1-5 points scale that is then transformed to result in a score that ranges from 0 (indicating least disability) to 100 (indicating most disability).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Assessment: Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 10 years except 7 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Range of Motion (ROM) is a movement test conducted on a joint to diagnose level of pain and function. Flexion / Extension, Supination and Pronation will be evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Assessment: Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 10 years except 7 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Elbow strength will be measured with the MRC Strenght Scale The MRC Strength Scale is a 5-items scale. The muscle scale grades muscle power on a scale of 0 to 5 in relation to the maximum expected for that muscle. Grade 5 shows normal contraction of the muscle, Grade 0 shows no movement.</description>
