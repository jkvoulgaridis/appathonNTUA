  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor diets are known risk factors for chronic diseases, and in recent years, food labelling
      has been increasingly sought-after as a cost-effective intervention to help stem the rising
      trend in chronic diseases.

      In efforts to promote a healthy diet, the Singapore Health Promotion Board (HPB) supplements
      traditional nutrition labelling with the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS), which identifies food
      items within a specific category of foods as healthier choices. The original logos were
      enhanced to include additional information focusing on particular macronutrients, taking one
      of two themes; it either indicates that a product contains more of a healthier ingredient, or
      less of a less healthy ingredient.

      However, to date, no published studies have assessed the role of the original and enhanced
      HCS logos in influencing food choices. There is a lack of scientific evidence on the role of
      the existing symbols in assisting consumers make healthier food purchasing decisions. There
      are also concerns over the unintended consequences of health claims made based on a single
      aspect of nutrient content, without considering other aspects. That is the goal of this
      effort. Specifically, the investigators

      propose to conduct the following:

      Use a three arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an experimental fully functional
      web-based grocery store to assess the causal effect of the new HCS logos on measures of diet
      quality either alone, or in combination with a complementary front-of-package (FOP) label:
      Physical Activity Equivalents (PAEs), which provides information on how long one would need
      to engage in a certain activity (e.g., jogging) to burn off one serving of the product.

      The investigators hypothesize that the greatest reduction in calories per serving (primary
      outcome) will occur in the HCS plus PAEs arm, followed by HCS only, and no logo control arm.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a crossover study design with all participants exposed once to 3 shopping conditions (1xControl, 1x Arm 2 and 1x Arm 3) in random order.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Using a within-person crossover design, participants were randomly assigned to one of six intervention sequences, which included the order of the three shops and when the actual purchase would take place, via random permuted blocks of size three with equal allocation for the six sequences (see Appendix Table A1) by a computer program. Participants were blinded to intervention allocation, which was allocated via the NUSMart system. Allocation results were recorded within NUSMart and all investigators, including the data analyst, were blinded to group allocation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in average calories per serving purchased per shopping trip</measure>

    <description>Calories per serving (kCal per serving) is calculated by dividing the total number of calories purchased in the shopping trip by the total number of servings purchased. The average calories per serving purchased (kcal per serving) is based on mean standardized serving sizes within each subcategory.</description>

    <measure>Diet quality per shopping trip as measured by the Grocery Purchase Quality Index-2016</measure>
    <time_frame>Once a week for three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Diet quality per shopping trip as measured by the Grocery Purchase Quality Index-2016 (GPQI-2016). The Grocery Purchase Quality Index-2016 (GPQI-2016) contains 11 different food components with eight components scored based on adequacy and three moderation components. We followed the standard GPQI-2016 scoring methods by mapping NUSMart's subcategories to USDA food plan categories and then to the GPQI components. Each component was scored based on the deviation of the observed expenditure share of each component and the expected expenditure share, and the scores were totaled up to generate the final GPQI-2016 score (minimum possible score = 0, maximum possible score = 75) for each participant's weekly grocery order. A higher score indicates better diet quality of the grocery basket.</description>

    <measure>Diet quality per shopping trip as measured by weighted average Nutri-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Once a week for three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We applied the standard Nutri-Score algorithm to assign a grade to each product. This algorithm assigns a score of A to E based on nutritional quality, which we recoded to 5 to 1 and then calculated an average score for each participant's weekly grocery order (minimum possible score = 0, maximum possible score = 5), weighted by the number of servings of each product. A higher score indicates better diet quality of the grocery basket.</description>

    <description>Arm 2 (termed HCS-only) displayed the HCS on eligible products, crossed referenced via the Health Promotion Board's HCS database (https://www.hpb.gov.sg/food-beverage/healthier-choice-symbol). Out of the 4,177 products available on NUSMart, 311 (7·45%) carried the HCS. This was comprised of 150 foods and 161 beverages.</description>

    <description>Arm 3 displayed the HCS on eligible products as in Arm 2 and the PAE label on all products (termed HCS+PAE). PAE was calculated as the minutes required to burn off the calories of a single serving for a 73 kg person jogging at 8 km per hour.</description>

    <description>The HCS is intended to improve diet quality by signaling to consumers which products are healthier options within a specific category (e.g., which are the healthier biscuits or the healthier beverages). Manufacturers must meet category-specific criteria before a product can display the HCS and an associated tagline. The labels were displayed at the bottom of the product images.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physical Activity Equivalent label</intervention_name>
    <description>For the study, we designed a simple PAE logo (Appendix Figure A1) and added a description encoded into the NUSMart user interface to ensure that participants would understand the contents of the label. Participants saw the following description whenever their cursor hovered over the PAE label: &quot;The Physical Activity Equivalent (PAE) refers to the number of minutes that a typical adult would need to jog to burn off the calories associated with one serving of the product.&quot; Previous studies have shown this labelling approach to be effective.
The labels were displayed at the bottom of the product images.</description>
