  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and the preliminary efficacy of AK101，an
      anti-IL-12/23p40 monoclonal antibody, when administered subcutaneously in subjects with
      moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
