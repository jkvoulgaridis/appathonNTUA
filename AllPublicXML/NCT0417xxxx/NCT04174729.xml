    <textblock>
      This study developed a system to quantify the functional strength of young adults without
      motor impairment during grip and pinch movement. Making it possible to know the accuracy of
      the value of these strength, the range of motion performed and whether the grip force was
      maintained throughout the range of motion. In addition to checking the functionality,
      reliability and reproducibility of the system.

      Quantifying grip and grip movement is essential as it allows for a basis in upper limb
      functionality. However, when there is access, it causes changes in the hands and changes the
      motor in relation to the force and range of motion, or generates changes in activities of
      daily living. Thus, a system with 5 devices, where each one the devices were prints in
      three-dimensional, and instrumented with force sensor for static-dynamic force analysis e
      potentiometer for analysis range of motion, during the execution of movements cylindrical
      grip, spherical grip, hook grip, pulp-pulp pinch, and pulp- side pinch in different
      activities of daily living. Elaborated a data storage interface through MATLAB® software that
      allows recording the data of each device. For the system functionality tests, 30 volunteers
      were selected for both sexes, young adults between 20 and 39 years old, students of the
      Physiotherapy and Graduate courses of the University of Mogi das Cruzes. The tests are
      divided into two sessions and are repeated after 7 days of the first test

    <description>The strength of the cylindrical grip movement was quantified through the door handle device, the spherical grip strength through the tap device, the hook grip strength through the vertical door pull handle, the pulp-pulp pinch strength through the linear switch device and the pulp-side pinch strength through the key device. The test was quantified 3 times with a 1 minute interval between each test and the force throughout the range of motion.

    <measure>Anthropometric variables</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The anthropometric measurement of the right hand was performed using an analog caliper, as it is an important parameter for functional evaluation, as it was of the following anatomical parts: total length of the hand (wrist crease to middle finger tip), longitudinal length of the palm from the hand (wrist crease to the proximal crease of the middle finger) and transverse length of the palm (lateral to medial line of the metacarpophalangeal muscles).

    <description>To make the sample more homogeneous, the Jamar ® dynamometer was used to measure grip strength maximum contraction for 3 seconds. A single measurement was performed. Unit of measure: kilogram - force (kgf).</description>

    <description>The tests were performed in two sessions lasting 1 hour each. The volunteers used the devices: door handle, tap, door pull handle, switch and door key to quantify hand strength. The tests were performed in two sessions lasting 1 hour each. The volunteers used the devices: door handle, tap, door pull handle, switch and door key to quantify hand strength.
In the first session, the volunteers performed the movements 3 times in each device of daily living activities with the right limb, with a 1-minute rest interval between the 3 measurements. The entire procedure performed in the session was repeated again after 30 minutes to verify the reliability and reproducibility of the Intra-evaluator test. The Inter-rater test was repeated after 7 days by the second rater to analyze reliability between the rater.</description>
