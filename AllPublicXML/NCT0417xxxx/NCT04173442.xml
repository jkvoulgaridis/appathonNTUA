  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the potential effect of exposure to dupilumab in pregnancy
      compared to the primary comparison group of disease-matched pregnant women who are not
      exposed to dupilumab, and the secondary comparison group of healthy pregnant women.

      The primary outcome of the study is major structural defects, and the secondary outcomes of
      the study are spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, stillbirth, elective termination/abortion,
      premature delivery, small for gestational age, pattern of 3 or more minor structural defects,
      postnatal growth of live born children to 1 year of age, postnatal serious or opportunistic
      infections in live born children to 1 year of age, and hospitalizations in live children up
      to 1 year of age.

        during pregnancy (1 disease-matched unexposed comparison group, and 1 healthy unexposed
        comparison group).
