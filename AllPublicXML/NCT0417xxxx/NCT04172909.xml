      The objective of the LEGOÂ®Bricks MRI project is to study a new play-based tool for use in
      children preparing to undergo MRI and evaluate its ability to reduce the need for anesthesia.

      A randomized study design will be employed in the experimental &quot;Child Life&quot; (CL) group, in
      regard to which Child Life intervention patients will have. Age matched controls will be
      found retrospectively, and will be patients of the same age, undergoing their first
      non-contrast brain MRI with no Child Life intervention.

      Patients in the CL group will be prepped by a Certified Child Life Specialist with the use of
      one of the following 2 tools, to be randomly selected:

        1. LEGO Bricks model MRI (A model of the MRI machine and adjacent control room made out of
           LEGO bricks)

        2. Mock MRI tube (A six foot long pop-out play tunnel for children, with a diameter of
           around 17 inches to simulate the MRI magnet bore)

      Diagnostic imaging is frequently utilized in modern medical practice, and various imaging
      modalities are routinely utilized in the care of pediatric patients. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) is an advanced imaging modality that is utilized to evaluate many conditions in
      pediatric patients. MRI is frequently favored over other imaging modalities in pediatrics
      since it allows for high-quality cross sectional imaging without the use of potentially
      harmful ionizing radiation, to which children are more sensitive than adults. However, MRI
      quality is highly dependent on patients' ability to hold still and follow instructions, which
      is often challenging in pediatric patients. Young and uncooperative children often require
      anesthesia to successfully complete MRI. Anesthesia can often be avoided with the assistance
      of Certified Child Life Specialists, who use techniques to reduce patient anxiety and improve
      children's ability to follow instructions during MRI. For example, children may visit the MRI
      unit or a simulator prior to the examination to contextualize the procedure1-3. Preparation,
      in the form of play, has been proven to reduce anxiety in children prior to scans and
      invasive medical procedures. Children who are prepared for medical procedures experience less
      fear and anxiety and will have better long term adjustment to medical challenges (Koller,
      2008).

    <measure>Change in quality of MRI image- Comparing CL groups ((1) LEGO Bricks model MRI and (2) mock MRI tube groups) and Control group using image quality and motion artifact grading scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks (average time to get MRI results)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by blinded attending radiologist/ resident radiologist. The above mentioned grading scale scores motion artifact and image quality on a 1 to 4 and 0 to 3 scales as follows:
Image quality:
1 (excellent images, with very high confidence in diagnostic content), 2 (good images, with confidence in diagnostic content), 3 (fair images, with reservations about diagnostic content), 4 (poor nondiagnostic image),
Motion artifact:
0 (no motion artifact)
(minimal motion artifact not interfering with diagnostic content)
(moderate motion artifact degrading diagnostic content)
(severe motion artifact resulting in non diagnostic image)</description>
