  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and associated diseases combined are the
      leading health burden and cause of mortality worldwide; therefore, the necessity for an
      intervention is paramount. Dietary interventions to improve cardiometabolic health are highly
      sought after as they possess less risk than pharmacological drugs. Anthocyanins, found in
      high quantities in both tart cherries and blueberries are powerful antioxidants, that are
      potentially capable of improving cardiometabolic dysfunction. However, to date, no research
      has explored the cardiometabolic responses to tart cherry and blueberry supplementation.

      Therefore, the primary purpose of the proposed investigation is to test the ability of oral
      tart cherry and blueberry supplementation to improve cardiometabolic parameters in healthy
      individuals.
