  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperhidrosis is a condition in which sweating is in excess of that required for normal
      regulation of body temperature. Commonly affected areas in primary hyperhidrosis include
      axillae, palms and soles. Secondary hyperhidrosis can affect scalp, face, neck, back, groin
      and legs. Hyperhidrosis can negatively impact, employment, relationships, or other aspects of
      quality of life.

      The investigators propose to investigate the use of a unique image-guided laser to
      specifically ablate eccrine sweat glands.

             study period (i.e. deodorant, at-home iontophoresis, Botox, MiraDry).

          9. Patient rates symptoms at level &quot;3&quot; or &quot;4&quot; on the hyperhidrosis disease severity scale
             (HDSS, see below).

         10. Subject in appropriate physical health to ride a stationary bicycle to the point of
             eliciting sweat.

         11. No known allergy to iodine or potato starch

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy

          2. Subjects on systemic treatment for hyperhidrosis, such as anticholinergic drugs (e.g.
             glycopyrrolate), sedatives or tranquilizers, within the past 8 weeks.

          3. Subjects who have undergone surgical excision of sweat glands or sympathectomy for
             hyperhidrosis.

          4. Subjects with an underlying disorder, such as neurologic injury or disease affecting
             the autonomic system, vascular disorders and metabolic disorders (e.g.
             hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus) that can produce hyperhidrosis

          5. Subjects with a history of coronary artery disease.

          6. Subjects with a history of poor compliance or psychosis

          7. Subjects taking SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, or MAOIs

          8. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to methylene blue

          9. Subjects with cardiac pacemaker or any other electrically powered implantable device.

         10. Subjects not proficient in the English language.

         11. Subject not in appropriate physical health to ride a stationary bicycle to the point
             of eliciting sweat.

         12. Known allergy to iodine or potato starch.
