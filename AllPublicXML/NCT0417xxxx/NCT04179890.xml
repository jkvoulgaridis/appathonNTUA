          2. Diagnosed with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFRTKI)
             naïve advanced EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),

          3. treated for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutated NSCLC within regular
             clinical practice.

          4. Informed and privacy consent signature must be obtained depending on local
             regulations.

             More specific inclusion criteria for each cohort are the following:

             Uncommon mutation cohort:

          5. Patients harbouring uncommon or compound EGFR mutations

          6. Patients who started with either afatinib (Gi(l)otrif®), gefitinib (Iressa), erlotinib
             (Tarceva), or osimertinib (Tagrisso) in the first- or second-line setting within
             regular clinical practice

          7. Patients must have started EGFR-TKI treatment at least 12 months prior to data entry.

        Sequencing cohort:

        5. Patients with common EGFR mutations (Del19, L858R) 6. Patients were treated with
        afatinib (Gi(l)otrif®) in the first-line setting and for acquired T790M mutation with
        osimertinib in the second line; 7. Patients must have started osimertinib treatment at
        least 10 months prior to data entry.

        Patients treated with osimertinib within an early access program/ compassionate use program
        (EAP/CUP) are allowed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients treated for EGFR mutated NSCLC within a clinical trial or participated in
             GioTag study.

          2. Patients with active brain metastases at start of EGFR-TKI therapy (independent of
             treatment line)

          3. For uncommon mutation cohort: Patients treated with osimertinib with no further
             uncommon mutation than acquired T790M
