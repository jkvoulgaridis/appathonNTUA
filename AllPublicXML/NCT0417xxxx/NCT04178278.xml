      Investigators will perform this study to validate shuttle walking tests in korean patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study will be performed as multi-center
      prospective observational correlation study in ulsan university hospital and asan medical
      center. 36 participants will perform the exercise stress test with cycle, 6 minutes walking
      test and shuttle walking test. Investigators will analyze correlation 6 minutes walking test
      and shuttle walking test with exercise stress test.

      Investigators will perform this study to validate shuttle walking tests in korean patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study will be performed as multi-center
      prospective observational correlation study in ulsan university hospital and asan medical
      center.

      18 patients will be enrolled in each hospital. When then visit, patients will perform
      questionnaire and laboratory study for baseline characteristics. After that, patients select
      memo, in which order for the exercise stress test with cycle, 6 minutes walking test and
      shuttle walking test will be written. Along that order, patients will perform each study at
      every two day in a week.

      Investigators will analyze correlation 6 minutes walking test and shuttle walking test with
      exercise stress test. To analyze reliability in shuttle walking test, patients will shuttle
      walking test in two times. Researchers will analyze correlation between them.

    <description>Patients will be required to walk around a 10-m course marked by cones placed 9 m apart, thus allowing 0.5 m for turning at each end. Walking speed will be regulated by prerecorded signals on a compact disc or MP3 file. Patients will increase walking speed at every minute. patients can stop this study, when they can not maintain their speeds due to dyspnea</description>
