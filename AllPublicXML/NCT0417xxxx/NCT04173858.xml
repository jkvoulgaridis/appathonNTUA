  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is a common feature in patients treated with strong
      opioids. Such medication is often prescribed together with a laxative (osmotic, emollient),
      with effectiveness depending on the individual patient. Peripherally-acting, mu-opioid
      receptor antagonists (PAMORAs), such as Naloxegol, have proven to be effective against OIC in
      patients with inadequate response to laxatives without reducing opioid analgesic effect.
      However, evidence regarding efficacy and safety on patients with cancer is still scarce. The
      objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of naloxegol in a real-world setting by
      assessing Quality of Life outcomes, and to obtain data on its safety in the long term in
      patients with cancer.
