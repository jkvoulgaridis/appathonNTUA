      This study consists of two phases (Phase I and Phase II). Phase II will be conducted
      sequentially after the safety of SCM-AGH is secured in Phase I.

      Phase I (Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, Parallel arm Design) Twenty subjects with
      moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis(AD) are planned to be enrolled from 6 sites in Korea and
      administered with SCM-AGH by intravenous (IV) infusion 3 times at two-week intervals and
      evaluated for safety during the safety evaluation period (12 weeks after first infusion).

      Phase II (Multicenter, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel arm) Phase II of the study
      is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm comparison study in adult
      subjects with moderate to severe AD. 72 subjects with moderate to severe AD are planned to be
      enrolled from 6 sites in Korea. Following up to a 4-week Screening period, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms: SCM-AGH or placebo in the ratio of
      1:1.
