      Primary Objective:

      To determine the excretion balance and systemic exposure of radioactivity after oral
      administration of [14C]-SAR442168.

      To determine the pharmacokinetics of SAR442168 and its contribution to the overall exposure
      of radioactivity.

      To collect samples in order to determine the metabolic pathways of SAR442168 and identify the
      chemical structures and main excretion route of the main metabolites (samples will be
      analyzed according to metabolic analysis plan and results will be documented in a separate
      report).

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the clinical and biological tolerability of an oral solution of SAR442168.
