  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic plasma cell disorder that is characterized by
      osteolytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia and renal failure. belantamab mafodotin was
      well tolerated in previous studies with at least one dose of belantamab mafodotin in heavily
      pre-treated participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This aim of the
      study is to explore safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability, immunogenicity and clinical
      activity of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in Chinese participants with RRMM who have
      received at least 2 prior line of anti-myeloma therapy including an alkylator, a proteasome
      inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD). This study will include two dose cohorts
      2.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) and 3.4 mg/kg. A maximum of 12 participants will be
      enrolled, 6 each for 2.5 mg/kg cohort and 3.4 mg/kg cohort based on 3+3 design. Participants
      will be treated until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, end of study or informed
      consent withdrawal.

             criteria and a) Has undergone stem cell transplant or transplant is considered not
             feasible by local assessment, b) Has failed at least 2 prior lines of anti-myeloma
             treatments, containing all of the following classes of drugs: alkylating agent, IMID
             and PI, c) In addition, eligible participant needs to be refractory to an IMiD
             (i.e.,lenalidomide or pomalidomide), and to a proteasome inhibitor (i.e., bortezomib,

             criteria, d) Participants who failed with cluster of differentiation38 (CD38) antibody
             (i.e., daratumumab) in previous clinical trials can also be considered to include if
             they meet the remainder of inclusion criteria in this protocol.

          -  Has measurable disease with at least one of the following: a) Serum M-protein greater
             than or equal to 0.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (5 g/L) , b) Urine M-protein greater

          -  Participants with a history of autologous stem cell transplant are eligible for study
             participation provided the following eligibility criteria are met: a) Transplant was
             greater than 100 days prior to study enrolment, b) No active infection(s), c)
             Participant meets the remainder of the eligibility criteria outlined in this protocol.

          -  Adequate organ system functions.

          -  Female Participants: Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical
             studies. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a woman of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) or is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is
             highly effective (with a failure rate of less than 1 percent per year), preferably
             with low user dependency, during the intervention period and for at least 80 days
             after the last dose of study intervention and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes)
             for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate
             the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of
             study intervention. A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test
             (as required by local regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of study
             intervention. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual
             history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with
