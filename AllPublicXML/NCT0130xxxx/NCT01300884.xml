  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotheses: High definition manometry (HDM) is safe and feasible in humans; HDM accurately
      characterizes anorectal anatomy and function in healthy humans; HDM provides comparable
      information regarding the structure and function of the anorectal region, to that obtained
      from ano-rectal manometry and anal ultrasonography (AUS), in patients with fecal incontinence
      or constipation.

      Methods: 20 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with fecal incontinence, 20 patients with
      constipation will be recruited. Because anorectal disorders are more common in women, the
      investigators will recruit approximately 8 men and 12 women in each group. Each subject will
      undergo anorectal manometry, anal ultrasound and high definition manometry.

      Data Analysis: Spearman correlational analysis will be performed to compare the parameters
      listed above. Also, the diagnostic yield of anal ultrasonography vs HDM in identifying
      anatomic sphincter defects will be assessed.

        We will recruit 20 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with fecal incontinence, 20 patients
        with constipation. Because anorectal disorders are more common in women, we will recruit
        approximately 8 men and 12 women in each group. Because it is possible subjects may sign
        consent but not participate in the study, or drop out of the study before completion, we
        will recruit a total of 80 subjects.
