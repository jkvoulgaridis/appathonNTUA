  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the MitraClip System Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Clinical Trial
      is to gather real-world clinical and health-economic outcome data to support the long-term
      safety, efficacy and economic value of the MitraClip System in the continuum of therapies for
      treating MR. Specifically, the following clinical and economic data will be collected: New
      York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class, Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) distance, quality
      of life (QOL) information, echocardiographic measures of left ventricular size and function,
      and data associated with the index hospitalization, rehospitalizations, concomitant
      medications and discharge facility to support the MitraClip System economic analysis.

      The MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial is a prospective, observational, single arm,
      multicenter trial to evaluate the MitraClip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation
      (MR). Patients will be enrolled at up to 15 investigational sites throughout Australia and
      New Zealand. Up to 150 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be considered enrolled when
      local or general anesthesia is administered for the MitraClip procedure. Patients will be
      followed at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.

      Investigational sites will recruit consecutive patients who meet trial enrollment criteria.
      Until enrollment in the MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial is closed, all patients who
      undergo a procedure for placement of a MitraClip device at an investigational site should be
      enrolled in the MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial.

Class II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Patients are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain;
Class III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation dyspnea, or anginal pain;
Class IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire(MLHFQ) is comprised of 21 questions.The response for each question ranges from 0(no affect on the patient's living) to 5(affected the patient's life very much during the past month).The total score for the 21 items can range from 0-105.A lower&amp;higher MLHFQ score indicates less effect of heart failure&amp;the worse impact of heart failure on a patient's QOL,respectively.Although the MLHFQ incorporates relevant aspects of the key dimensions of QOL (physical and emotional),the questionnaire was not designed to measure any particular dimension separately.The total score should be taken as the best measure of how heart failure and treatments impact QOL.
The total score is the sum of a)the physical dimension,measured using 8 questions (possible subscale score range 0-40) b)the emotional dimension,measured using 5 questions(possible subscale score from 0-25)&amp;c) other factors,measured using 8 questions (possible subscale score from 0-40).</description>

Cardiac death is defined as any death in which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded.

In the presence of regurgitation of one valve, without any intracardiac shunt, the flow through the affected valve is larger than through other competent valves. The difference between the two represents the regurgitant volume.</description>

        <population>A total of 36 patients had paired regurgitant volume measurements at both baseline and 30 days. Six patients missed the 30-day visit and regurgitant volume data at either baseline, 30 days, or both time points is missing for 36 patients.</population>

        <description>The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire(MLHFQ) is comprised of 21 questions.The response for each question ranges from 0(no affect on the patient's living) to 5(affected the patient's life very much during the past month).The total score for the 21 items can range from 0-105.A lower&amp;higher MLHFQ score indicates less effect of heart failure&amp;the worse impact of heart failure on a patient's QOL,respectively.Although the MLHFQ incorporates relevant aspects of the key dimensions of QOL (physical and emotional),the questionnaire was not designed to measure any particular dimension separately.The total score should be taken as the best measure of how heart failure and treatments impact QOL.
The total score is the sum of a)the physical dimension,measured using 8 questions (possible subscale score range 0-40) b)the emotional dimension,measured using 5 questions(possible subscale score from 0-25)&amp;c) other factors,measured using 8 questions (possible subscale score from 0-40).</description>

        <title>Change in Minnesota Living With Heart Failure (MLWHF) Quality of Life (QOL) Score From Baseline to 12 Months</title>
        <description>The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire(MLHFQ) is comprised of 21 questions.The response for each question ranges from 0(no affect on the patient's living) to 5(affected the patient's life very much during the past month).The total score for the 21 items can range from 0-105.A lower&amp;higher MLHFQ score indicates less effect of heart failure&amp;the worse impact of heart failure on a patient's QOL,respectively.Although the MLHFQ incorporates relevant aspects of the key dimensions of QOL (physical and emotional),the questionnaire was not designed to measure any particular dimension separately.The total score should be taken as the best measure of how heart failure and treatments impact QOL.
The total score is the sum of a)the physical dimension,measured using 8 questions (possible subscale score range 0-40) b)the emotional dimension,measured using 5 questions(possible subscale score from 0-25)&amp;c) other factors,measured using 8 questions (possible subscale score from 0-40).</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Paired MLHFQ quality of life data was available for 40 patients at Baseline and 12 months.Five patients died prior to the 12-month visit,1 patient missed the 12-month visit,3 patients did not complete the MLHFQ assessment. Finally, 29 patients 12-month visits were either expected or not due at the time that the ANZ trial was terminated.</population>

Death is further divided into 2 categories:
A. Cardiac death is defined as death due to any of the following:
Acute myocardial infarction
Cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade
Arrhythmia or conduction abnormality
Stroke within 30 days of the procedure or stroke suspected of being related to the procedure
Death due to any complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery
Any death for which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded.
B. Non-cardiac death is defined as a death not due to cardiac causes (as defined above).
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Defined as a documented diagnosis of CHF on the hospital admission report or discharge summary.</description>
