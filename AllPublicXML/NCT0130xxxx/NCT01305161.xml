      To assess diagnostic accuracy of flow cytometry applied to the diagnosis of allergy to
      neuro-muscular blockers and to the determination of the neuro-muscular blocker (NMB) which
      may be used for an ulterior anaesthesia in case of allergy to one given NMB.

      The flow cytometric protocol used for this study, was based on basophil selection by an anti-
      CCR3 and the analysis of basophil activation by the respective up and down regulation of the
      CD63 and IgE markers as described previously. Basophil activation was expressed in percentage
      CD63 expression on activated basophils and in activation index involving IgE and CD63 markers
      and calculated by a specific algorithm developed by our group.. Our aim is to test a
      sufficient number of patients in order to be able to establish the ROC curves related to the
      allergen type tested and validate the use of an allergen mixture (NMB mix containing the 7
      usual NMB at the optimal activation concentrations). Patients will be included during the
      post-anaesthetic consultation on the basis of the diagnosis of an IgE dependant
      per-anaesthetic reaction. The allegro-anaesthetist diagnostical habits won't be changed.
