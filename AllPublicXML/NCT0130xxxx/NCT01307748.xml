      The study purpose is to evaluate efficacy of stress-reducing aromatherapy and learn about how
      aromatherapy works by comparing participants' physiologic responses to laboratory challenge
      tasks with and without experiencing aromatherapy.

    <measure>Percent of Baseline Level of Salivary Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at baseline (60 min prior to aroma exposure and stress), stress battery (30 min after aroma exposure and during stress), post-stress (60 min after completing stress battery)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of baseline level of salivary cortisol (values greater than baseline indicate increased stress)</description>

    <measure>Electroencephalography (EEG) Frontal Asymmetry</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at baseline (60 min prior to aroma exposure and stress), at the onset of aromatherapy exposure, stress battery (30 min after aroma exposure and during stress), post-stress (60 min after completing stress battery)</time_frame>
    <description>EEG frontal asymmetry (FA) is used to assess emotional state. EEG FA processing was completed by averaging local reference EEG filtered offline from 0.1 to 70 Hz (with 60 Hz notch filter). 5-min data periods during each time were segmented into 2 seconds epochs, and the semi-automatic artifact rejection was applied. The remaining artifact-free epochs were subjected to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) . The power spectra for individual epochs were averaged, and the measures of EEG spectral density were obtained for alpha band (8 -12.99 Hz). Square root values of power were used, and frontal hemispheric asymmetry was calculated as ((L-R)/(L+R))*100, where L and R are square root values at the homologous left and right hemisphere sites (using local average reference values at F3 and F4). With this calculation, FA negative values reflect lower alpha power (higher activation) in the left hemisphere linked to a more positive mood. This is a unit-free measure.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Performance: Percent Change From Baseline in Digit Span Backward Task Score</measure>

    <description>Percent change from baseline in cognitive performance score on the Digit Span Backward (DSB) task. DSB scores range from 0 to 16, with greater scores indicative of better cognitive function. Positive change from baseline indicates better functioning.</description>

      <recruitment_details>212 people potentially interested in the study were evaluated for eligibility between 2010 and 2012.

          <title>Detectable Placebo Aroma: Coconut</title>
          <description>Detectable placebo aroma:organic virgin coconut (Cocos nucifera) base oil (The Ananda Apothecary, Boulder, CO) diluted in 15 ml of grapeseed carrier oil (Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) and mixed until solution appeared clear.
During the visit, three drops of the aroma solution were placed on a 5 x 5 mm cotton pad. The pad was then fixed to a small piece of transparent odor free tape that was attached to the participant’s nose so that the pad infused with the aroma came to the midpoint between the participant’s nose and upper lip. The cotton pad remained attached until the end of testing portion of the visit, but the aroma was not replenished during the testing.</description>

        <title>Electroencephalography (EEG) Frontal Asymmetry</title>
        <description>EEG frontal asymmetry (FA) is used to assess emotional state. EEG FA processing was completed by averaging local reference EEG filtered offline from 0.1 to 70 Hz (with 60 Hz notch filter). 5-min data periods during each time were segmented into 2 seconds epochs, and the semi-automatic artifact rejection was applied. The remaining artifact-free epochs were subjected to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) . The power spectra for individual epochs were averaged, and the measures of EEG spectral density were obtained for alpha band (8 -12.99 Hz). Square root values of power were used, and frontal hemispheric asymmetry was calculated as ((L-R)/(L+R))*100, where L and R are square root values at the homologous left and right hemisphere sites (using local average reference values at F3 and F4). With this calculation, FA negative values reflect lower alpha power (higher activation) in the left hemisphere linked to a more positive mood. This is a unit-free measure.</description>
        <time_frame>assessed at baseline (60 min prior to aroma exposure and stress), at the onset of aromatherapy exposure, stress battery (30 min after aroma exposure and during stress), post-stress (60 min after completing stress battery)</time_frame>
        <population>All participants had EEG recordings during their visit. However, some EEG data were lost due to electrode malfunction or unusable due to presence of too much noise. The data loss was similar in all study groups.</population>
