    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG) is an HIV drug in the integrase inhibitor drug class. This study will test
      the safety of and immune response to DTG in HIV-1 infected infants, children, and
      adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DTG is an HIV medicine in the integrase inhibitor drug class. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of DTG in HIV-1
      infected infants, children, and adolescents.

      Participation in this study will last approximately 48 weeks, followed by long-term safety
      follow-up that will last for about 3 years. Participants may be receiving other
      antiretroviral (ARV) medications while in this study; these medications will be prescribed by
      participants' doctors and will not be provided by the study. This study has two stages. Stage
      I will evaluate the short-term tolerability and safety of DTG, allowing the selection of a
      dose for further study in Stage II. Stage II will then provide long-term safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy data for DTG. Participants will be assigned to one of eight
      cohorts depending on age (4 weeks to younger than 18 years of age). Participants in cohorts I
      and IIA will receive DTG film-coated tablets; participants in cohort IIB will receive DTG
      granules for oral suspension or DTG dispersible tablets; participants in cohorts III and IV
      will receive DTG granules for oral suspension; and participants in cohorts III-DT, IV-DT, and
      V-DT will receive DTG dispersible tablets. Participants will receive DTG orally once or twice
      daily, depending on which other ARV medications they are receiving. (All eight cohorts will
      be included in Stage I of the study; however, Stage II of the study will not include cohort
      IIB).

      Stage I participants will undergo a physical examination and have blood drawn at each of 10
      study visits, occurring on Day 0; Day 5 (+5 days); and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and
      48. Stage I participants will also have their blood drawn 8 times over 24 hours during the
      Day 5 (+5 days) study visit to measure the amount of drug in the blood stream. Stage II
      participants will undergo a physical examination and have blood drawn at each study visit
      (Day 0; Day 10; and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48). Blood, plasma, and urine will
      also be stored and tested to measure immune response. Females of childbearing potential will
      undergo pregnancy testing at every study visit. Questionnaires and assessments will be
      performed at select study visits.

      After 48 weeks, all participants will enter long-term safety follow-up and will continue to
      receive DTG. During this time, participants will undergo a physical examination, blood
      collection, and questionnaires at most study visits (every 12 weeks for about 3 years).

      Note: In January 2018, all participants on DTG granules for oral suspension were recommended
      to transition to DTG dispersible tablets. Cohorts III and IV are closed to further
      enrollments.

               -  Must have been off treatment for greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to
                  screening, OR

               -  Currently taking ARVs for treatment but failing:

               -  Must be on an unchanged, failing therapeutic regimen within the 4 to 12 weeks
                  prior to screening (less than or equal to 1 log drop in HIV-1 RNA within the 4 to

                  are required: one from a date between 4-12 weeks prior to study screening and a
                  second one at study screening. The HIV RNA level at screening must be higher
                  than, equal to, or less than or equal to 1 log lower than the prior HIV RNA
                  level. NOTE: Dose adjustments for growth or formula substitutions (i.e.,
                  switching from single agent to fixed dose combination) during this 4 to 12 week
                  period, substitutions of one ARV within the same class for toxicity or
                  tolerability management, or discontinuation of ARVs are permitted between the HIV
                  RNA measurements and screening or enrollment. OR

               -  For participants less than 2 years of age, initiated ARVs for treatment less than
                  4 weeks prior to screening.

          -  2) ARV treatment naive (no exposure to ARVs for treatment; could have received ARVs
             for prophylaxis or prevention of perinatal transmission)

          -  If an infant has received nevirapine (NVP) as prophylaxis to prevent perinatal
             transmission, he or she must have not received NVP for at least 14 days prior to
             enrollment into Stage I or II.

          -  HIV-1 RNA viral load greater than 1,000 copies/mL of plasma at screening. NOTE: For
             participants enrolling into cohorts IV, IV-DT, and V-DT, the HIV RNA test performed at
             screening may be pending at the time of enrollment. If the screening HIV RNA is less
             than or equal to 1000 c/mL, the participant should discontinue study drug (see the
             protocol for more information).

          -  Demonstrated ability or willingness to swallow assigned study medications. NOTE: Film
             coated tablets MAY NOT be crushed or dissolved. Dispersible tablets MAY NOT be cut and
             must be used in five milligram intervals.

          -  Parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed informed consent.

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential, defined as having reached menarche, and
             who are engaging in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to use
             two contraceptive methods while on study and for two weeks after stopping study drug.

          -  Males engaging in sexual activity that could lead to HIV-1 transmission must use a
             condom.

          -  Optimized background therapy (OBT):

               -  Participants who are both greater than or equal to 2 years of age and
                  ARV-treatment experienced (meeting entry criterion) must have available at least
                  one fully active drug for the OBT to enroll. If screening genotype testing is
                  inconclusive, historical genotypes obtained within 1 year of screening will be
                  considered by the Protocol Team for determination of fully active drugs.

               -  Participants who are greater than or equal to 2 years of age and ARV-treatment
                  naive (meeting entry criterion) can enroll if genotype testing has been obtained
                  with results pending.

               -  Participants less than 2 years of age (either ARV-treatment experienced or ARV
                  treatment naïve) can enroll if genotype testing has been obtained with results
                  pending.
