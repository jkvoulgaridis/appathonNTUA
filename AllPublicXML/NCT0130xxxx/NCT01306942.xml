  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I/II study. In the phase I, patients with Human
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive MBC will be treated with paclitaxel,
      trastuzumab and increasing doses of dasatinib to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD),
      Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RPD) of the combination. Once the
      RPD has been identified, 48 patients will be treated at that dose to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of the combination in the phase II.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be enrolled and treated with 4-week cycles of trastuzumab 2 mg/kg IV
      weekly (following a loading dose of 4 mg/kg in cycle 1) and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly x 3
      weeks followed by a rest period of 7 days. Dasatinib will be administered orally in two dose
      levels 100 and 140 mg once daily (a -1 dose level is included just in case dose de-escalation
      is needed). Treatment will be repeated on Day 1 of a 28-day cycle in all patients (both in
      the phase I as in the phase II) until radiographic or symptomatic progression or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs. Only in the phase I and in all patients included in every different dose
      level, the first cycle will last 38 days.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RPD) of
           dasatinib in combination with fixed doses of trastuzumab and paclitaxel in HER2-positive
           MBC patients (Phase I).

        -  To determine the efficacy, measured by objective response rate (ORR) in HER2-positive
           MBC patients with measurable disease (Phase II).

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To characterize the safety of the combination (in both phase I and phase II).

        -  To evaluate the Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Time to Progression (TTP), Progression Free
           Survival (PFS) and Response Duration (RD) (in the phase II).

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination (in the phase I and selected
           patients in the phase II if necessary).

        -  To evaluate molecular characteristics that may be predictive of the activity (or lack
           of) and any correlation between the biological activity of the study treatment and the
           disease outcome.

      Exploratory objective:

      • To explore the correlation between the lymphocytosis and efficacy.

      Sample Size:

      Phase I: following the 3+3 rule, a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 patients will be
      recruited.

      Phase II:Assuming 10% drop-out rate, 48 patients are required to enter the study.

      The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be
      approximately 42 months.

    <time_frame>Through study treatment, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria. RD is defined as the time from the date when the measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever status is recorded first) until the date of first observation of disease progression or death occurred. Per RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as an &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. For responding patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have progression, RD will be censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment. For responding patients who receive subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to progression, RD will be censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 day 2 and day 18</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the influence of the concomitant administration of paclitaxel and trastuzumab on dasatinib PKs, we compared dasatinib exposures alone (first PK occasion: day 2 of cycle 1) or combined (second PK occasion: day 18 on cycle 1).
The mean profiles of dasatinib plasma concentrations were determined by dose and PK occasion.</description>

    <measure>Phosphorylated SRC (p-SRC) Protein Expression Change in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells After 8 Hours of Treatment (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 day 1 at 0 hours and at 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sequential peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) on Cycle 1 Day 1 before treatment and 8 hours (h) after treatment (0h and 8h) were assessed to explore changes in the expression of p-SRC proteins measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For ELISA analyses, a duplicate of 100 µg of the extract was used to detect p-SRC (Tyr416). ELISA is a plate-based assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying proteins. The instrumentation used for protein signal-detection is an absorbance spectrophotometer (AS), which measures Absorbance (A). A is the quantity of light absorbed by a sample. As different compounds absorb light at different wavelengths, an AS can be used to distinguish compounds by analyzing the pattern of wavelengths absorbed by a given sample. Additionally, the amount of light absorbed is directly proportional to the concentration of absorbing compounds in that sample, so an AS can also be used to determine concentrations of compounds in the sample.</description>

        <title>Response Duration (RD)</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria. RD is defined as the time from the date when the measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever status is recorded first) until the date of first observation of disease progression or death occurred. Per RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as an &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. For responding patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have progression, RD will be censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment. For responding patients who receive subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to progression, RD will be censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy.</description>

        <title>Phosphorylated SRC (p-SRC) Protein Expression Change in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells After 8 Hours of Treatment (Phase II)</title>
        <description>Sequential peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) on Cycle 1 Day 1 before treatment and 8 hours (h) after treatment (0h and 8h) were assessed to explore changes in the expression of p-SRC proteins measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For ELISA analyses, a duplicate of 100 µg of the extract was used to detect p-SRC (Tyr416). ELISA is a plate-based assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying proteins. The instrumentation used for protein signal-detection is an absorbance spectrophotometer (AS), which measures Absorbance (A). A is the quantity of light absorbed by a sample. As different compounds absorb light at different wavelengths, an AS can be used to distinguish compounds by analyzing the pattern of wavelengths absorbed by a given sample. Additionally, the amount of light absorbed is directly proportional to the concentration of absorbing compounds in that sample, so an AS can also be used to determine concentrations of compounds in the sample.</description>

          <title>Phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) Protein Expression Change in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells After 8 Hours of Treatment (Phase II)</title>
          <description>Sequential peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) on Cycle 1 Day 1 before treatment and 8 hours (h) after treatment (0h and 8h) were assessed to explore changes in the expression of p-AKT proteins measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For ELISA analyses, a duplicate of 100 µg of the extract was used to detect p-AKT (Ser473). ELISA is a plate-based assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying proteins. The instrumentation used for protein signal-detection is an absorbance spectrophotometer (AS), which measures Absorbance (A). A is the quantity of light absorbed by a sample. As different compounds absorb light at different wavelengths, an AS can be used to distinguish compounds by analyzing the pattern of wavelengths absorbed by a given sample. Additionally, the amount of light absorbed is directly proportional to the concentration of absorbing compounds in that sample, so an AS can also be used to determine concentrations of compounds in the sample.</description>

        <title>Phosphorylation Status of Phosphorylated SRC (p-SRC) in Skin After Treatment (Phase I)</title>
        <description>p-SRC was analyzed in the skin biopsies taken at cycle 1 day 1 at 0 hours and 8 hours, cycle 1 day 4 and cycle 2 day 1, only in patients accepting to participate.
A semi-quantitative H-score (or &quot;histo&quot; score) determined by the estimation of the percentage of tumour cells positively stained with low, medium, or high staining intensity. The final score is determined after applying a weighting factor to each estimate. The formula used is H-score = (low %) × 1 + (medium %) × 2 + (high %) × 3, and the results ranged from minimum 0 to maximum 300.

        <title>Phosphorylation Status of Phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) in Skin After Treatment (Phase I)</title>
        <description>p-ERK was analyzed in the skin biopsies taken at cycle 1 day 1 at 0 hours and 8 hours, cycle 1 day 4 at 8 hours, and cycle 2 day 1 at 8 hours, only in patients accepting to participate.
A semi-quantitative H-score (or &quot;histo&quot; score) determined by the estimation of the percentage of tumour cells positively stained with low, medium, or high staining intensity. The final score is determined after applying a weighting factor to each estimate. The formula used is H-score = (low %) × 1 + (medium %) × 2 + (high %) × 3, and the results ranged from minimum 0 to maximum 300.
Aim: to confirm the mechanism of action identified in preclinical models where the combination of dasatinib and trastuzumab show a statistically significant reduction in the phosphorylated levels of ERK</description>
