  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biofeedback therapy improves bowel symptoms and anorectal function in patients with
      dyssynergic defecation, however its mechanism of action is not known. The investigators
      hypothesize that biofeedback therapy enhances gut-brain-gut communication by altering
      cortical processing of information and improving cortically mediated neuromuscular function
      of the gut. However, in order to better understand these mechanisms in patients, the
      investigators need to examine and establish normative data and compare findings with healthy
      subjects. The investigators specific aims are to examine and evaluate the following 40 normal
      subjects; (1) To evaluate the afferent cortical evoked potentials in response to the
      electrical stimulation of the anorectum and (2) To evaluate the corticofugal tracts
      (efferent) by recording the anal and rectal electromyographic responses following noninvasive
      lumbosacral and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

      1. Cortical evoked potentials:A probe with 2 ring electrodes is placed in anus and rectum.
           A small amount of electrical current is passed. The cortical evoked responses to the
           anal and rectal electrical stimulation is measured from the scalp using a
           neurophysiology recorder.

        2. Motor evoked potentials: A magnetic coil is placed on the scalp at the anorectal
           cortical site and discharged using magnetic energy. The anal and rectal motor evoked
           potentials are then measured using a probe with 2 ring electrodes.
