    <textblock>
      This trial aims to develop and test the efficacy of a digital media based physical therapy
      protocol on patients after surgical fixation and non-operative treatment of distal radius
      fractures.It is hypothesized that there will not be a difference in outcomes for patients
      after surgical fixation of distal radius fractures with traditional physical therapy and
      digital media based therapy

This will include giving the patients a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive loaded with a 12 week physical therapy protocol presented in digital form with videos and graphical representations of exercises to be done. They will also have access to the videos and multimedia on the Oregon Health &amp; Science University website.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poly-trauma patients with significant previous diagnosis of dementia, previous
             traumatic brain injury, or other reason for significant altered mental status that

             therapy will be excluded.

          -  Patients who present to Oregon Health &amp; Science University for physical therapy who
             will be treated by a physician at another non Oregon Health &amp; Science University
             facility will be excluded.

          -  Patients who are not proficient in the English language will be excluded.
