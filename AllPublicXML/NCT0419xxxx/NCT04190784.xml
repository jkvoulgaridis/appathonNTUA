    <textblock>
      A multitude of stretching parameters are used in the clinical setting. However, there is no
      convincing evidence to suggest which parameters are most effective in the management of
      chronic myofascial pain syndrome .In this regard, although the stretching duration is
      considered one of the most important variables that can affect the treatment outcome, to date
      there is little agreement on the most effective stretching duration.Accordingly ,we will
      conduct this study to investigate the effect of different stretching duration on nerve root
      function ,central conduction time, and chronic myofascial pain management outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As Upper trapezius and levator scapulae are the most common postural muscles that tends to
      get shorten leading to restricted neck mobility as they are most frequently used to maintain
      posture,there seems to be strong rationale for stretching these muscles however, to date
      there is no agreement about the optimal stretching parameters . A multitude of stretching
      parameters are used in the clinical setting. However, there is no convincing evidence to
      suggest which parameters are most effective in the management of Chronic myofascial pain
      syndrome . In this regard, although the stretching duration is considered one of the most
      important variables that can affect the treatment outcome, to date there is little agreement
      on the most effective stretching duration.

      In theory, reflex inhibition during the stretching procedure, an increased stretch tolerance
      , decreased viscoelasticity, and a degree of reduced musculotendinous stiffness could all
      contribute to the sustained increase in elastic ROM. Regardless of these proven underlying
      mechanisms, all the previous studies ignored the adverse mechanical tension that developed
      during stretching exercises . Based on the literature, this tension may adversely affect the
      central nervous system and nerve root function . Accordingly, in the current study ,we will
      try to answer the question that is it theoretically possible, that increased longitudinal
      stress and strain on the spinal cord and nerve root from stretching exercises may subtly
      impair the neural function.in addition to investigate the effect of stretching on other
      management outcomes;pain intensity,disability,range of motion,and Pressure-pain threshold.

    <description>Stretching exercises for upper Trapezius and Levator scapula .
From supine position , the examiner will passively place the participant's head into flexion, side-bending away and rotation towards the side to be stretched (for upper trapezius muscle) and flexion, side-bending away and rotation away from the side to be stretched (for levator scapula ). The patient introduces a light resisted effort to take the stabilized shoulder towards the ear and the ear towards the shoulder. The contraction is sustained for 10 seconds and, upon complete relaxation of effort, the therapist gently eases the head/ neck into an increased degree of side-bending and rotation, where it is stabilized, as the shoulder is stretched caudally. The examiner will depress the participant's shoulder with 100 Newton's of force measured with pressure dynamometer. Once the examiner achieved this level of force, he maintains the stretch for 60 seconds . The procedure is repeated three times.</description>

             For inclusion, cervical myofascial pain syndrome will be diagnosed with all five major
             criteria and at least one minor criterion.

        Major criteria:

          1. Regional pain complaint in the neck.

             tender spot.

          2. Elicitation of a local twitch response by transverse snapping palpation at the tender
             spot or by needle insertion into the tender spot in the taut band.

          3. Pain alleviated by elongating (stretching) the muscle or by injecting the tender spot
             (trigger point).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be excluded if any signs or symptoms of medical &quot;red flags&quot; were present:
        tumor, fracture, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and prolonged steroid use.
