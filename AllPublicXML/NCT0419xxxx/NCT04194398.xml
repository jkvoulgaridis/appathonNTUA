      The purpose of this continuation study is to collect five year follow-up data on patients who
      have already participated in the EXPAND Lung trial and have had transplants with donor lungs
      preserved on the OCS Lung System. The EXPAND Lung trial results have been presented and have
      shown positive results in the use of expanded criteria donor lungs and patient follow-up,
      post-transplant. The current study is being conducted to continue to collect follow-up on
      participants in the EXPAND study, in order to evaluate long-term patient survival status and
      BOS diagnosis.
