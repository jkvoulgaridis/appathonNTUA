  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II clinical trial assessing the tolerability and efficacy of CM4620 in
      children and young adults with acute pancreatitis caused by asparaginase. The tolerability of
      CM4620 when given to patients receiving frontline chemotherapy will be determined. The
      effectiveness in reducing the severity of pancreatitis will be estimated.

      Primary Objectives

      To assess the safety of CM4620 administration in children and young adults with asparaginase
      associated pancreatitis (AAP).

      To profile dose-limiting toxicities and responses of the patients treated in the dose-finding
      phase.

      To estimate the efficacy of CM4620 to prevent pseudocyst or necrotizing pancreatitis in
      children with AAP.

      Secondary Objectives

      To determine the effect of CM4620 on the incidence of severe pancreatitis

      To determine the effect of CM4620 on the incidence of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome
      (SIRS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label safety and efficacy evaluation with comparison of toxicity to a
      historical control population (TOTXVI).There will be 3 cohorts of patients enrolled, and the
      dose for each cohort will be determined based on the toxicities experienced in the ongoing
      and prior cohorts.

      An initial 9 patients (cohort 1) will be enrolled and will receive dose level 1 and monitored
      for toxicity. If the therapy is well tolerated, 6 patients (cohort 2) will be treated at dose
      level 2. Subsequent enrollment of 9 patients (cohort 3) will be at either dose level 1 or 2
      based on tolerability. The keyboard design will be used to determine the dosing for cohorts 2
      and 3. Additional patients will be enrolled at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) until a
      total of 24 patients have been treated at that dose, including any treated during the
      dose-finding phase.

      CM4620 will be given days 1-4 as an IV infusion beginning within 36 hours of the onset of
      acute pancreatitis associated abdominal pain and within 8 hours of enrollment. For patients
      with prior abdominal pain or in those unable to communicate the location/characteristic of
      their pain, a change in the characteristic of the pain or new enzyme elevation/imaging
      findings after previously normal studies will determine the timing of onset of pancreatitis.

      Patients will be followed for about 4 months after treatment.
