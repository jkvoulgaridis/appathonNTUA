  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate clinically and radio-graphically the efficiency of
      &quot;Tent- Pole &quot;grafting technique for reconstruction of anterior or posterior mandibular ridge
      defects using synthetic bone graft and Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) membrane.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various techniques have been described for the reconstruction of large vertical defects
      before implant placement . In this study we assessed the efficacy of tenting the periosteum
      and soft tissue matrix with titanium screws maintaining a space for the graft material in
      order to augment large vertical defects of mandibular ridge (anterior or posterior region)
      using data from 12 patients . After 6 months we assessed the increase in bone height and
      density.

    <measure>Postoperative edema</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Edema was evaluated by its ability to pit.The examiner fingers pressed into dependent area of the patient skin for 5 seconds. The finger sinks into the tissue and leave an impression when they are removed. The pitting was graded on a scale of +1 to +4 as follows:
1 (trace) slight indentation rapid return to normal.
2 (mild) the indentation returns to normal in a few seconds.
3 (moderate) 6 mm indentation rebounds in 10-20 seconds.
4 (severe) 8 mm indentation rebounds in more than 30 seconds.</description>

    <description>Bone graft [NanoBoneÂ® granulate 0,6 mm (24% Silica / 76% Hydroxylapatite)] is mixed with the patient blood and placed to cover the screws completely, the defect is overcorrected with particulate material in anticipation of future graft resorption.
PRF membrane is prepared by:
Ten milliliters of whole venous blood will be collected in sterile glass test tubes without anticoagulant. Then the test tubes will be placed in a table centrifuge machine at 3000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 10 minutes.After separation of PRF, the membrane is prepared compression device.</description>

    <description>All patients were operated under local or general anaesthesia according to the case and patient tolerability.
The oral cavity was prepared by 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinses solution* for thirty seconds.
Full thickness incision down to the bone with blade no.15.
A periosteal elevator was used to perform mucoperiosteal flap.
Gentle elevation of the flap
Fixation of the screws over the alveolar ridge with about 5 mm of the screw threads will be exposed
Bone graft was mixed with the patient blood and placed to cover the screws completely.
PRF membrane was be placed over the grafted sites.
Repositioning of the flap and suturing with 3/0 black silk suture material</description>
