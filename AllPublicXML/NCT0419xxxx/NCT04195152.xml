      The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of lingual nerve injury and related
      factors in difficult intubation cases.

      Demographic data of difficult intubation cases and body mass indices, thyromental and
      sternomental distances, mallampati classification, neck circumference, maximum mouth opening
      be recorded.Numbness of the tongue and metallic taste will be questioned

      The lingual nerve is the anterior descending branch of the posterior trunk of the mandibular
      division of the trigeminal nerve.

      Lingual nerve injury is a recognised complication of orotracheal intubation and has been
      associated with forceful laryngoscopy.

      Although left-sided neuropraxia has been reported, right-sided lesions are thought to be more
      common because the standard Macintosh laryngoscope exerts pressure on the right side of the
      tongue.

      Lingual nerve injury following orotracheal intubation was first described in 1971 by Teichner
      who reported a right-sided neuropraxia which was attributed to direct pressure from the
      laryngoscope.

        included in the study as a control group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are not intubated under general anesthesia

          2. Patients undergoing regional anesthesia or peripheral nerve block

          3. Patients with laryngeal mask placed will not be included in the study.
