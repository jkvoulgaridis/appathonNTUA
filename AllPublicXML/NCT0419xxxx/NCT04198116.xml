  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel design of this study combines a laboratory paradigm to evaluate stress-induced
      smoking behavior and smoking-related reinforcement, followed by a 12-week treatment phase to
      evaluate clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a double-blind, this Phase 2 study will randomize 140 smokers to a parallel group
      design (varenicline + guanfacine vs. varenicline alone). Following titration to steady state
      levels, the investigators will evaluate sex differences in medication effects on
      stress-induced smoking behavior and smoking-related reinforcement in the laboratory, and on
      abstinence outcomes during a subsequent 12-week treatment period.

    <description>Varenicline (2mg/day) + Guanfacine extended release (6mg/day ER). Varenicline (2mg/day) administered orally twice a day at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM while titrating to full dose. Titration schedule: Days 1-9 0mg/day; 0mg/dose, Days 10-12 0.5mg/day; 0.5mg/dose 8:00 PM, Days 13-15 1mg/day; 0.5mg/dose, Days 16-21 2mg/day; 1mg/dose. Guanfacine ER (6mg/day) administered orally twice daily at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM while titrating to the full dose. Titration schedule: Days 1-3 1mg/day; 0.5mg/dose, Days 4-6 2mg/day; 1mg/dose, Days 7-9 3mg/day; 1.5mg/dose, Days 10-12 4mg/day; 2mg/dose; Days 13-15 5mg/day; 2.5mg/dose and Days 16-23 6mg/day; 3mg/dose. Once at steady state, administration is orally once per day at 8:00 PM for both medications.</description>
