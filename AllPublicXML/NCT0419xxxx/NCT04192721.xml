      The university environment presents a valuable opportunity to reach the young population of
      society, which has a high risk of depression, and to provide protective mental-health
      services. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral
      therapy-based group counseling focused on the depressive symptoms, anxiety levels, automatic
      thoughts, and coping ways among undergraduate nursing students with mild to moderate
      depressive symptoms.

      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy-based group
      counseling focused on the depressive symptoms, anxiety levels, automatic thoughts, and coping
      ways among undergraduate nursing students with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.

      The study was completed with a total of 63 participants (n=31 for the intervention group and
      n=32 for the control group) in the 2017-2018 academic year. The effect of the intervention
      was evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Automatic Thoughts
      Questionnaire, and Ways of Coping Questionnaire. The measurements were taken 3 times:
      pre-test, post-test, and 2-months post-test.

    <intervention_model_description>The study used a randomized control clinical trial design. In the BDI pre-test, 80 of the students with mild or moderate depressive symptoms met the other inclusion criteria of the study and volunteered to participate in the study. Out of 80 participants, 40 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 40 to the control group using computer-generated random number sequences. The study was completed with a total of 63 participants (n=31 for the intervention group; n=32 for the control group). While CBT-based group counseling was given to the intervention group, no counseling was given to the control group during the study.
The participants were evaluated at three time points: at screening (pre-test), six weeks after screening (post-intervention/post-test), and two months after the post-test. The measurements were taken simultaneously in the intervention and control groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks (also assessed at 14 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the risk level of depression. It has 21 items. Each item is scored 0-3 points and the total score ranges from 0-63 (0-9=no; 10-16= mild; 17-20= moderate; 21-26=high; 27 or more points severe depressive symptoms)</description>

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks (also assessed at 14 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This self-assessment scale determines anxiety level. It consists of 21 items. Each item is scored 0-3 points and the total score ranges from 0-63. As the total score increases, the anxiety level increases.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks (also assessed at 14 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the thought patterns and negative self-assessments commonly seen in depression. It consists of 30 items. Each item is scored 1-5 points and the total score ranges from 30-150 points. A high score indicates that the frequency of automatic thoughts related to depression is high.</description>
