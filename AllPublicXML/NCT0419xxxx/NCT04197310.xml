      This is open-label, single-arm, phase II research study, studying the combination of
      cabozantinib and nivolumab in treating advanced carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumor is another
      term used to refer to neuroendocrine tumors that arise in organs such as the gastrointestinal
      tract, lungs, or thymus.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
           including evaluations and follow up visits.

        -  Cabozantinib will be administered orally, once daily

        -  Nivolumab will be administered intravenously, every two weeks

        -  The target enrollment for this study is 35 participants.

        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved cabozantinib or nivolumab
           for treating carcinoid tumors.

Retreat Phase (Optional)
Participants may elect to stop nivolumab and cabozantinib with confirmed CR after at least 24 weeks of treatment.

             relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants who have received a prior cabozantinib.

          -  Participants who have received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-

             antibody (including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and any other antibody or
             drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  The participant has tumor in contact with, invading, or encasing major blood vessels
             or radiographic evidence of significant cavitary pulmonary lesions.

               -  Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, intra-abdominal abscess
                  within 6 months before screening

          -  Thromboembolic events within 6 months of registration.

               -  Note: Low dose aspirin ≤ 81 mg/day is allowed. Anticoagulation with therapeutic

                  least 6 weeks prior to registration. Treatment with warfarin is not allowed.

          -  The subject has experienced any significant bleeding episodes, including:

               -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the first
                  dose of study treatment

               -  Clinically significant hemoptysis (&gt; 0.5 teaspoon) within 3 months of the first

                  start of study treatment

               -  Individuals with a history of different malignancy are ineligible except for the
                  following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are
                  eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the
                  investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.

          -  Participant has an active infection requiring IV antibiotics

          -  Any active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with type I diabetes
             mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as
             vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g. celiac disease) are
             permitted to enroll.

          -  Patient has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or on
             any other form of immunosuppressive medication. Adrenal replacement steroid disease
             are permitted in the absence of autoimmune disease.

          -  The participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants with non-detectable viral loads on
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib and nivolumab.

          -  The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines
             include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella,
             varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the
             inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluzone®) is allowed.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females are excluded from this study because cabozantinib and
             nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and nivolumab, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Sexually active fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use medically
             accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female
             condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and
             following treatment. Women of childbearing potential receiving nivolumab will be
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of
             nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of
             nivolumab. Contraception must be used for 4 months after last dose of cabozantinib.
