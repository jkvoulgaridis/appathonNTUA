  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a significant impact on quality of life and
      is costly to the health care system. It has been demonstrated that a self-management program
      improves quality of life, but programs are not universally available and telehealth
      interventions can provide home-based support, but have mixed results.

      The aims of this study are to (1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a 6 weeks'
      educational program related to self-management with remote monitoring for Lebanese COPD
      patients; (2) pre-test its impact on quality of life, emergency visits, and rate of
      rehospitalization, and (3) to make recommendations for a future randomized trial.

      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and pre-test the impact of a
      nursing consultation and tele-monitoring in Lebanon. It will be conducted at the HÃ´tel-Dieu
      de France (HDF) hospital, one of the largest university hospitals in Beirut, and will use
      quantitative and qualitative methods in pre- and post-intervention to collect data over a
      period of 3 months. Data will be collected by two researchers. A consent form will be signed
      by each participant prior to the intervention. Patients will be informed about the purpose of
      the study, the course of the intervention, and the freedom to withdraw from the study at any
      time. Their consent for the video recording will also be taken.

      This study is the first to evaluate the application of telehealth to optimize COPD management
      in Lebanon. The results of this study will provide evidence regarding the efficacy and
      feasibility of this approach for Lebanese patients with moderate to severe COPD.

    <description>Our intervention will be based on the following framework and will consist of 3 phases :
Phase I: At the end of a medical consultation, the doctor will offer the patient the opportunity to benefit from a nursing consultation and remote monitoring to better manage his COPD. A nursing consultation will be scheduled during which the nurse will explain the procedure, obtain the written consent of the patient, and develop an educational diagnosis with the participation of the patient.
Phase II: During the next six weeks education sessions will be provide to the participants and a telephone number will be available in case of emergency and for any additional information.
Phase III: A final consultation will be scheduled at the nurse office to evaluate the patient's achievements and modify his/her educational assessment. A telephone follow-up will be conducted after one month to assess the maintenance of learning.</description>
