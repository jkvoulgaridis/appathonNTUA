      This study will test the efficacy of omalizumab compared with placebo on exercise capacity,
      physical activity, and sleep quality after 24 weeks of treatment in participants with
      moderate to severe allergic asthma. Exercise capacity will be assessed using cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing (CPET). Physical activity and sleep quality will be assessed with a wearable
      physical activity and sleep monitor. The study will consist of a 4-week screening period, a
      24-week double-blind treatment period, and a 4-week safety follow-up. Approximately 150
      participants will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to omalizumab and placebo, respectively.
