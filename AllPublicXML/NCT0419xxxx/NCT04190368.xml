  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 15-month parallel group randomized control trial (RCT) comparing an
      intervention group of middle school aged individuals with type 1 diabetes and their
      caregivers participating in Team Clinic with a control group following usual care (without
      Team Clinic)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Team Clinic is an innovative approach to addressing patient developmental, psycho-social, and
      familial challenges; while also tackling the medical infrastructure and multi-disciplinary
      care challenges encountered by middle school aged individuals with Type 1 Diabetes and their
      caregivers. Visits use a shared medical appointment model staffed by a multidisciplinary team
      of diabetes care providers. Intervention participants will attend quarterly visits (1 visit
      every 3 months) and participate in thematic group visits aimed at improving glycemic control
      and treatment adherence, increasing social supports and diabetes care satisfaction, and aid
      in the transition from caregiver led treatment to self care.

    <ipd_description>Development, execution, and data collection for this study is completed with a Principle Investigator at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. With documented permission of the IRB, a PI may develop a de-identified database, codebook, and mechanism by which data can be shared with qualified investigators. Interested Investigators will complete a request form stating the aims of their analyses, analytic plan, available resources for completing a project, timeline, and goals (i.e. manuscripts or grant applications). The PIs and their research team will review requests to determine whether the analyses constitute an innovative exploration of the data, whether the team has resources to complete the request, and whether data will be adequately protected and managed. If issues arise, the PIs and research team will negotiate a fair resolution with interested investigators and NIH staff.</ipd_description>
