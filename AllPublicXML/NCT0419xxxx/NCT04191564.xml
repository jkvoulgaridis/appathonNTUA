  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the excluded stomach during sleeve gastrectomy can be investigated post removal outside the
      patient. During stapling it is common to reduce systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) below
      100 mmHg to reduce peritoneal perfusion and have better compression. Higher intra abdominal
      pressures reduce also the peritoneal and mucosal perfusion and might help to improve stapling
      compression. Stapling compression can be evaluated by measuring stapling thickness and
      compare it with stomach wall thickness or by measuring leaks during leak test or better
      outside the patient on the excised stomach with a bursting pressure.

      Patients are randomized to two groups: group standard perfusion means that the SAP is kept
      between 100 and 140 mmHg by adapting depth of anesthesia, by level of post expiratory
      pressure or by giving vasoconstriction.

      low perfusion group means that

        1. systolic blood pressure is kept below 100 mmHg from the first linear staple till the
           last by using a Clevidipine infusion to regulate the blood pressure accurate just below
           100 mmHg for a short time while needed.

        2. goal directed fluid therapy using 100 ml/h fluid intravenous and extra load of fluid if
           pulse pressure variation &gt; 20 %

        3. increase intra abdominal pressure (IAP) up to 20 mmHg inly during stapling and return to
           minimum IAP needed to achieve 3 liter workspace.

      The resected stomach is removed and analyzed outside the body before throwing away:

    <description>fluid restriction based on the goal directed fluid therapy is maintained during the whole case and a state of low perfusion is created by reducing the systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg by vasoactive medications like cleviprex or nicardipine, by increasing positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and by a very short period of a high IAP of 20 mmHg only during firing.</description>
