  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, phase III study to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of CS1003 in combination with lenvatinib and placebo in combination with
      lenvatinib in the treatment of subjects with no prior systemic treatment and with
      unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Subjects cannot be eligible for
      locoregional therapy. In this study, CS1003 (or placebo) and lenvatinib are both considered
      as the study treatment while CS1003 (or placebo) is the investigational product of and
      lenvatinib is selected as the basic treatment for HCC.
