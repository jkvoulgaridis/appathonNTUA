  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to evaluate the role of Mirror Neurons in the determination of gestures,
      words, and repetitive vocalizations in subjects affected by Tourette's syndrome and to verify
      if these subjects are faster to assemble sounds, in phonology and morphology, than the
      non-pathological population.

    <description>The subjects of the Tourette group and control group are subjected to routine tests performed at Tourette Center and Extrapyramidal Diseases. Both groups are initially subjected to an evaluation that aims to identify the IQ and therefore 4 tasks are presented. The 1st (with a duration of about 2 and a half minutes) and the 2nd (with a duration of about 2 minutes) related to the motor field, the 3rd (with duration of about 1 minute) and the 4th (with duration about 3 minutes) the language field. These evaluations are in practice at the Center for Tourette patients; the tasks will be administered to both groups.</description>

        The calculated sample size is 20 subjects per arm considering:

          1. error of I type with two queues = 0.05;

          2. Type II error β = 0.20, which corresponds to a test power (1-β = 0.80) of 80%;

          3. a clinically significant difference of 4%;
