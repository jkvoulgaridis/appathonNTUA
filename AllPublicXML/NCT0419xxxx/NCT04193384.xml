  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bariatric surgery is recommended for treatment of patients with severe obesity, resulting
      in greater weight loss and improvement of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities.
      However, weight regain is observed in patients after surgery, leading to health adverse
      outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify the rate of weight regain and predictive
      factors of regain in bariatric patients without outpatients care regular.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-bariatric patients without care by health professional will be recruited. Patients will
      be divided, initially, in two groups by time after surgical procedure, as follows: Group 1≤
      (G1≤) - patients that performed bariatric surgery for ≤ 1 year and Group 1&gt; (G1&gt;) - patients
      that performed bariatric surgery for &gt; 1 year. Patients will be seen in a medical set for the
      first time at the Policlínica Piquet Carneiro (PPC) for outpatients care, which will consist
      of anamnesis and physical examination, obtaining demographic, socioeconomic data, medications
      and clinical history. The TxR will be calculated by [TxR = (current weight - minimum weight
      reported) x 100 / (weight preoperatively reported - minimum weight related)] and information
      on predictive variables for weight regain will be obtained by Alcohol Use Disorders
      Identification Test (AUDIT), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire (IPAQ), ActiGraph GT3X + accelerometer, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey
      (SF-36), Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and Repetitive eating
      questionnaire (REP(EAT) Q). The inclusion period of new patients in the PPC Obesity Clinic
      will be one year.
