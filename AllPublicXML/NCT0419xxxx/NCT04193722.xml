      The &quot;Hyperbaric OxygeN therapy on brEast cancer patients with late radiation toxicity&quot;
      (HONEY) trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of HBOT on late radiation toxicity in breast
      cancer patients using the trial within cohorts (TwiCs) design.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess whether HBOT reduces pain, and improves
      physical functioning and QoL in breast cancer patients with late radiation toxicity.

      Study design: Randomized controlled trial, nested within the prospective UMBRELLA breast
      cancer cohort according to the TWiC's design. UMBRELLA is a prospective cohort study
      including all breast cancer patients visiting the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht
      department of Radiotherapy. In total 120 patients will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1.

      Study population: Breast cancer patients participating in the UMBRELLA cohort who have given
      informed consent to be invited for future research (e.g. cmRCT's), and who have reported
      symptoms of late radiation toxicity.

      Intervention: Eligible patients will be referred to the HBO center for a standard HBO
      treatment. HBOT consists of 30-40 treatment sessions (1 session per day during 5 days per
      week). During the hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) sessions patients breath in 100% oxygen during 4
      times 20 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is patient reported
      breast/chest wall pain. Secondary endpoints are: physical functioning, QoL cosmetic outcome,
      physician reported pain and radiation toxicity (according to CTCAE criteria version 4.03,
      tissue oxygenation previous to HBOT and after HBOT and side-effects of HBOT.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the difference in proportion of patient-reported breast/chest wall pain grade 3-4 between control and intervention group. Pain is assessed by means of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 questionnaire on a 4-point Likert scale. At baseline all patients have a pain score of 3 or 4 (see inclusion criteria). The proportion of patients with 3-4 at 6 months will be compared between intervention and control group. A higher score indicates more pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months after baseline (i.e. 3 months after HBOT)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (QoL) measured by European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30. QoL will be scored on a scale of 0-100. A higher score indicates a better outcome. Change in score between baseline and 6 months will be compared between intervention and control group.</description>

    <description>Late radiation toxicity is assessed by means of a late radiation toxicity questionnaire (ability to move the arm, (breast) edema, fibrosis) in both control group and intervention group. Change in patient reported late radiation toxicity will be compared between intervention and control group. Late radiation toxicity will be assessed on a 4-point Likert scale. A higher score indicates worse outcomes.</description>
