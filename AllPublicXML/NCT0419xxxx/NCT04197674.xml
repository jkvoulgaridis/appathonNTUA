  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is increasing worldwide. Although kidney
      transplantation is the most cost-effective renal replacement therapy, dialysis is still the
      main way to treat ESRD patients due to the limited kidney donor, with approximately 89% of
      such dialysis patients receive hemodialysis (HD) and the remainder receive peritoneal
      dialysis (PD). This distribution of dialysis modality, however, varies widely by health
      jurisdiction. For instance, more than 97% of dialysis patients are treated with HD in Japan,
      but more than 50% treated with PD in Mexico. Evidence comparing the two modalities suggests
      that mortality risks may be comparable, but all evidence come from observational study and
      there is no randomized controlled trial to compare patient survival between PD and HD due to
      patients enrollment issue.More importantly, for most health care systems, such as United
      States, United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia and China, PD is less expensive than HD. It is
      possible, then, that a greater global utilization of PD might improve access to renal
      replacement therapy in less advanced economies.

      The investigators have conducted a prospective, randomized, parallel, open-label,
      multi-center, non-inferiority trial to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with
      PD versus conventional in-center HD in incident ESKD patients. A total of 1082 ESKD patients
      were randomly assigned to PD or conventional in-center HD, and 235 patients enrolled in stage
      1 with complete measures of the &quot;Burden of Kidney Disease&quot; at both baseline and 48 weeks and
      668 patients enrolled in stage 2 were included in analysis. However, this trial was designed
      to evaluate quality of life between PD and HD and all patients were follow-up 48 weeks.
      Therefore, in this observational cohort study, the investigators will perform extended
      follow-up for participants including in analysis . Our primary objective is to evaluate the
      association of dialysis modality (PD and HD) with all-cause mortality in ESKD patients. The
      investigators also explore the impact of PD and HD on major cardiovascular event composite
      (MACE), a composite outcome of MACE and all-cause death, hospitalized myocardial infarction,
      hospitalized stroke and hospitalized heart failure, healthy utility, dialysis cost, activity
      of daily living, and changes of RRF, hemoglobin, and other biochemical parameters.
