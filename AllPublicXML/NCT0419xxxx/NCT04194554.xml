  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerable dose of niraparib when
      combined with prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), abiraterone, leuprolide, and
      prednisone (the phase 1 portion of the study) and determine 3-year biochemical PSA recurrence
      free-survival with this treatment approach (the phase 2 portion of the study).
