  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The STIMO-2 study aims to investigate TESS-supported rehabilitation training in sub-acute
      spinal cord injury (&lt; 6 months post-injury). The primary endpoint of this study is to assess
      the safety and feasibility of TESS. The preliminary effectiveness of the therapy is the
      secondary study endpoint. The mobility recovery status of patients, who undergo
      TESS-supported rehabilitation, will be assessed at 12 months post SCI, compared to their
      predicted recovery expectations based on standard rehabilitation program
