      Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate either a) the
      postsurgical total opioid consumption or b) postsurgical pain control after presurgical
      iovera° treatment plus EXPAREL® and standardized multimodal therapy compared with presurgical
      sham iovera° treatment plus EXPAREL and standardized multimodal therapy in subjects
      undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A single primary objective,
      either a or b, will be declared by an unblinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) in an
      interim analysis after 30 randomized and treated subjects complete the Day 42 assessments.
      The primary objective not selected will be placed in the secondary objectives category.

      Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives of this study are to compare postsurgical pain
      control or postsurgical total opioid consumption (whichever is not chosen as the primary
      objective), opioid-free status, physical function, sleep quality, and safety of presurgical
      iovera° treatment plus EXPAREL and standardized multimodal therapy with presurgical sham
      iovera° treatment plus EXPAREL and standardized multimodal therapy in subjects undergoing
      primary unilateral TKA

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double blind, sham controlled study in adult
      subjects undergoing TKA.

      Subjects will be screened no more than 60 days prior to TKA. During the screening visit,
      subjects will be assessed for past or present neurologic, cardiac, and general medical
      conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude them from study
      participation. No procedures other than the site's standard of care will be performed before
      signed informed consent is obtained. After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed,
      demographic information, medical and surgical history, concomitant medications/concurrent
      procedures information and vital signs will be collected. Assessment of the intended
      treatment areas, functional-ability assessments, a urine drug screen, and a urine pregnancy
      test (UPT) for women of childbearing potential will be conducted.

      Randomization: initially 60 subjects will be randomized 1:1 (30 subjects per group) to one of
      two treatment groups.

      Group 1: subjects will receive iovera° cryoneurolysis treatment of superficial genicular
      nerves (anterior femoral cutaneous nerve [AFCN] and infrapatellar branches of the saphenous
      nerve [ISN]) of the target knee

      Group 2: subjects will receive sham iovera° treatment of superficial genicular nerves (AFCN
      and ISN) of the target knee

      All subjects in all groups will also receive intraoperative local infiltration with EXPAREL
      and postoperative multimodal pain medications.

      Based on the results of an interim analysis, a primary endpoint between a) the postsurgical
      total opioid consumption or b) postsurgical pain control will be chosen and additional
      subjects may be enrolled (up to an estimated target of 200 subjects in total)..

      Subjects will be asked questions and/or be asked to fill forms as part of the following
      assessments: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to assess pain scores and sleep quality, functional
      (physical) ability tests to assess range of motions, and KOOS questionnaire to assess knee
      movement.

      iovera° treatment or iovera° sham treatment (Day -15 [±7 days] prior to TKA). TKA surgery
      will be Day 1 and follow up will be up to Day 90. Therefore, subjects may participate in the
      study for up to 155 days.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to
             enrollment and agree to use a highly effective method of birth control during the
             study. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a
             low failure rate (less than 1% per year).

          7. Able to provide informed consent, adhere to the study visit schedule, and complete all
             study assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of prior contralateral TKA within 6 months or open knee surgery on the knee
             being considered for TKA. Prior arthroscopy is permitted.

          4. Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as an
             NSAID or opioid) in the postsurgical period for pain that is not strictly related to
             the knee surgery and which may confound the postsurgical assessments (e.g.,
             significant pain from other joints including the non-index knee joint, chronic
             neuropathic pain, concurrent or prior contralateral TKA, concurrent foot surgery).

          5. Comorbidity that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may affect the subject's
             ability to participate in the study and postsurgical rehabilitation.

             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, or duloxetine (Cymbalta®). If
             a subject is taking one of these medications for a reason other than pain control, he
             or she must be on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to screening visit.

          9. Current use of systemic glucocorticosteroids within 1 month prior to screening in this
             study, intra-articular corticosteroid injections within 6 weeks, or Zilretta within 3

             subject's participation in this study

        Given the COVID-19 pandemic, the subject must be medically fit/cleared for surgery by the
        investigator. If there is a concern about a subject's recent or potential exposure to
        COVID-19, or if the subject is not medically fit/cleared for surgery due to suspected
        COVID-19 illness/symptoms (or other serious illness), the subject must be excluded per
        Exclusion criterion #5.
