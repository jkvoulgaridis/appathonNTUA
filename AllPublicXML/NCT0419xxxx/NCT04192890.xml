      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and short-term oncological efficacy of the
      NanoKnife Irreversible Electroporation System for localised prostate cancer.

      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is the method of focal treatment for prostate cancer,
      which is already proven by FDA as method of the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It has not
      received clearance for the therapy or treatment of any specific disease or condition.

      Detailed Description:

      Irreversible electroporation is a newly developed non-thermal tissue ablation technique in
      which short duration electrical fields are used to form permanent nanoscale defects in the
      cell membrane which leads to cell apoptosis. Thus, IRE is a non-thermal technique, which
      means that changes associated with tissue freezing or heating are not relevant.

      Moreover, animal studies of IRE in the canine prostate have demonstrated that structures such
      as ejaculatory ducts, neurovascular bundles, blood vessels, and the urethra heal normally
      after ablation. The reason is that collagen matrix during treatment with IRE is not destroyed
      thus allowing for a large structures (blood vessels, nerves, etc.) to heal normally.

      This study is a prospective and non-randomized with one group of 12 patients eligible for
      focal therapy of prostate cancer with IRE (eligibility defined by this protocol).

      Before the surgery all patients will underwent transperineal MRI-fusion biopsy to localize
      the prostate cancer foci.

      Objectives of the study: to asses safety of IRE in patients with localized PCa, to asses
      short-term oncologic efficacy of IRE in patients with localized PCa, to asses functional
      outcomes after IRE.

      All patients will be followed up for 1 year (each 3 months).
