  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate V114 in the prevention of vaccine-type acute otitis
      media (VT-AOM) and the safety of V114 with respect to the proportion of participants with
      serious adverse events (SAEs) through completion of the study. The primary hypothesis is that
      V114 is superior to no V114 in preventing VT-AOM as assessed by the incidence of VT-AOM.
