  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, unblinded worldwide pre-market
      clinical study. The study will provide first in human insights into clinical safety and
      device function of the Medtronic PFA system for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as a treatment
      for AF.

    <description>Acute procedural failure is defined as:
Inability to isolate all accessible targeted pulmonary veins (assessed for entrance block and, where assessable, exit block) during the index ablation procedure.
Ablation using a non-study device to isolate any pulmonary vein.
Acute procedural success is the opposite of acute procedural failure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Failure of at least one antiarrhythmic drug AAD (class I or III) for AF as evidenced
             by recurrent symptomatic AF, or intolerable side effects due to AAD.

          2. A diagnosis of recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF with the following
             documentation:

               1. Paroxysmal: (1) physician's note indicating symptoms consistent with recurrent
                  self-terminating or terminating with intervention (within 7 days) AF or
                  paroxysmal AF; and (2) any ECG documented AF episode(s) within 12 months prior to
                  enrollment

                  OR

               2. Persistent: (1) physician's note indicating symptoms consistent with continuous
                  AF episode lasting longer than 7 days but less than 1 year; and (2) any 24-hour
                  continuous ECG recording documenting persistent AF within 6 months of enrollment;
                  OR (2) two ECGs from any form of rhythm monitoring showing continuous AF taken at
                  least 7 days apart
