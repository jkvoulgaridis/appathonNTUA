  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project to better understand the immune-modulatory effects of continuous
      renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in neonatal and pediatric patients, particularly those
      receiving extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Little is known about the effects of CRRT in
      this particular population and improved knowledge will be useful clinically and may lead to
      novel therapeutic approaches and improved outcomes for these critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Via collection of serum and ultrafiltrate samples, the invesitgators will examine how
      hemofilter lifespan alters the filtration of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

      <textblock>
        Both male and female neonatal (aged 0-28 days of life) and pediatric (children aged 29
        days-17 years) patients receiving ECLS will be eligible. The study team will also enroll
        neonatal and pediatric patients receiving CRRT alone (no ECLS).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonatal or pediatric patients receiving ECLS (&gt;2 kilograms and &gt;34 weeks gestation)

          -  CRRT utilized during ECLS course

          -  For the secondary endpoints comparing CRRT-mediated cytokine filtration in patients
             receiving ECLS with concurrent CRRT to patients receiving CRRT alone (no ECLS), the
             investigators will also enroll neonatal and pediatric patients receiving CRRT alone
             (no ECLS). Patients will be eligible for entry into this study if they meet all of the
             following criteria:

          -  Neonatal or pediatric patients receiving CRRT

        Exclusion criteria:

        -Those patients with inability or unwillingness of legal guardian/representative to give
        informed consent
