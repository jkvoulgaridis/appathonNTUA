      Objective: Determine if, by reducing the dose of propofol and increasing the time elapsed
      between fentanyl and propofol administration, hemodynamic response is improved.

      Methods: Patients were randomized into time groups (2 and 1 minute) and each subdivided into
      dose groups (1, 1.5 and 2 mg kg-1) obtaining six time-dose groups. After receiving 2 μg kg-1
      of fentanyl, propofol was administered after the predetermined time. Time to hypnosis
      (BIS&lt;60) and hemodynamic parameters at pre-induction, pre-intubation and postintubation were
      registered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of 162 patients were required, considering an expected Mean Difference of 5 with
      expected Standard Deviation of 22, confidence level of 95% and power of 80%. Estimating a
      possible loss of 15%, it was raised to 192. Consecutive identification numbers were assigned
      and the sample was randomized in six groups of 32 patients according to time and dose of
      propofol.

      Pre-oxygenation was performed until the expired oxygen fraction exceeded 80% and 2 µg/kg of
      intravenous fentanyl were administered. Depending on the study group, 1 or 2 minutes were
      allowed to pass and 1, 1.5 or 2 mg/kg of propofol were supplied (prior administration of
      intravenous lidocaine 0.5 mg/kg). The time in which the BIS dropped below 60 was recorded. If
      it did not reach that level after two minutes or when it exceeded it but then rose above 60
      again, an extra dose of propofol of 0.5 mg/kg was administered. Muscle relaxation was
      performed with rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. The patient was manually ventilated until endotracheal
      intubation was performed by the same experienced anaesthesiologist and connected to
      mechanical ventilation.

      Data were collected manually. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS ver. 22.
      Inferential statistics were performed using t-test for quantitative variables, chi-square for
      qualitative and ANOVA for qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Non-parametric
      statistical tests were used when necessary. Confidence intervals were estimated at a level of
      95% and a P value of &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant.
