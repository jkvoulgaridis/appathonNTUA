      Through this study, it was found that Anlotinib combined with Sintilimab has a better
      survival benefit. At the same time, genetic analysis and immunohistochemical methods have
      been used to predict the predictive value of targeted therapy combined with Sintilimab.

             disease-relieving drugs, corticosteroids or immunosuppressants) occurred within two
             years before the first administration. Allow the use of alternative therapies (such as

             HBsAb (-) and HBV viral load (-), no prophylactic anti-HBV treatment is required, but
             virus reactivation needs to be closely monitored.
