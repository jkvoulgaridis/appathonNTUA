  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if 5 (five) fractions of external
      radiotherapy with higher radiation doses per fraction to the pelvis leads to similar results
      to the standard of care external radiotherapy treatment that is comprised of 25 fractions of
      external radiotherapy with lower radiation doses per fraction to the pelvis.

      This study aims to investigate the impact in quality of life associated with hypofractionated
      Whole Pelvis Radiotherapy (WPRT) in comparison to conventionally-fractionated WPRT in
      patients with unfavorable-intermediate and high-risk prostate cancers. This information is
      valuable as hypofractionated WPRT is a more attractive and convenient treatment approach, and
      may become the new standard of care if proven to be well-tolerated and effective. Therefore,
      this study aims to provide a more rational justification for use of hypofractionated WPRT in
      future larger randomized trials by comparing this strategy with the current standard of care.
      This study will also provide an initial understanding of the toxicity profile and cancer
      control associated with hypofractionated WPRT and High Dose Rate Brachytherapy (HDR-BT).

    <description>Late bowel function as reported by the patient using the standardized questionnaire Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) sub-domain approximately 1 year after the end of treatment. The EPIC questionnaire contains 32 questions measuring patient function. Each question has a response option ranging from 0 or 1 (best) to 3, 4, or 5 (worst). The responses then correlate to a scoring scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is the best and 100 is the worst. The values vary from 0 to 100 for each question. The scores can then be added to come up with an overall quality of life score.</description>
