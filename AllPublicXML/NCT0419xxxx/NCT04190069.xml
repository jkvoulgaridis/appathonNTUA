      The objective of the study is to examine the extent to which diet/lifestyle change programs
      with a multidisciplinary team (consisting of a dietician, physician and behaviorist/health
      coach) that develop healthy behaviors before creating a calorie deficit for weight loss will
      result in greater weight loss and a longer duration of weight maintenance. It intends to
      compare the extent of weight loss and weight maintenance in participants who will undergo
      calorie restriction without prior behavioral interventions to participants that will undergo
      behavioral interventions prior to starting calorie restriction.

      OPTIFAST is a medically supervised weight loss and weight management program that involves a
      complete meal replacement followed by a gradual introduction of foods after dietary
      education. The resources offered through this program are through a physician, registered
      dietitian and behaviorist, including a psychologist.

      UPMC Prescription for Wellness is an innovative physician/provider prescribed coaching and
      feedback program that improves patient engagement and outcomes in healthy behaviors;
      self-care of chronic disease and condition management; and shared decision-making. The
      resources available through this program are offered via a telephonic health coach, online or
      through a digital intervention based on the participant's convenience.

      behavioral interventions prior to starting calorie restriction.

      Behavioral interventions will first be provided by UPMC Prescription for Wellness prior to
      starting OPTIFAST. Calorie restriction will be during the OPTIFAST Program. The participants
      will be actively recruited by the study team at the Center for Diabetes and Metabolism (CDE)
      at the Falk Clinic in Oakland, Pittsburgh.
