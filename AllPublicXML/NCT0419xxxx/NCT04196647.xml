  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to

        1. Create a guide for hometitration of Duodopa for patients with Parkinson's disease

        2. Outline which patients could be considered for &quot;hometitration&quot;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To start treatment with continuous intestinal levodopa infusion to the duodenum
      (Duodopa-pump) in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson Disease (IPD), it is usually required
      that the patient is hospitalised to test if Duodopa works for the patient and for the
      titration process to find the relevant dosage before operation and connection of the pump.

      A hospitalisation is very costly. Experience shows, that this group of patients are often
      very stressed during hospitalisation because of noise, impaired sleep and unfamiliar
      surroundings. These conditions make fast and effective dosage titration very difficult, and
      experience also shows that the dosage often needs to be recalibrated once the patient is back
      home in familiar surroundings.

      The use of TeleMedicin (TM) is on the rise in Denmark as well as other international health
      care systems.

      These factors were the basis for the home-titration study where patients have their initial
      dosage titration done in their own home, supported by one visit from nursing staff, and one
      TM (video consultation) a day. The goal is to make the titration process more effective,
      reduce cost by treating the patient in their own home and making the patient more satisfied
      with the titration process.
