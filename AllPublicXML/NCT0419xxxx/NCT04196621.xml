    <textblock>
      The investigational device is an approved biometry device to perform biometric measurements
      preoperatively to calculate the needed IOL power.

      First, two native measurements at the IOL Master will be performed. Thereafter randomly
      assigned artificial tears are instilled in the eye and biometry will be repeated within 30
      seconds, as well as after 2 and 5 minutes.

      At least 24hours after those measurements, two native measurements at the IOL Master will be
      performed. Thereafter, the not yet used artificial tears are instilled in the eye and
      biometry will be repeated within 30 seconds, as well as after 2 and 5 minutes.

      Examinations will be implemented in accordance with the approved investigational plan on
      subjects and includes: repeated biometry without and with artificial tear drops.
