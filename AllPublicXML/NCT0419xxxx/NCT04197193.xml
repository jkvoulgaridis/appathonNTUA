  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The European Space Agency (ESA) runs a research centre in Antarctica as an earth-based model
      for long duration deep-space missions. Just like astronauts travelling into space,
      crew-members overwintering at this Concordia base are exposed to a number of extreme
      environmental stressors; including high altitude (approximately 3800m); extreme cold; long
      periods of 24 hour darkness or daylight; and complete isolation. The investigators will
      recruit up to 30 over-wintering crew members working at this station for ESA over a 2 year
      period and observe how their bodies adapt and respond to the stress of living and working in
      this environment. The investigators will collect blood, saliva and urine samples, together
      with ultrasound images of muscle mass and grip strength measurements at regular intervals
      throughout their deployment to Antarctica. These samples will be transported back to
      Southampton to be analysed for biochemical levels of stress. During the final month of their
      stay, all participants will be randomised to receive a daily nutritional drink which is
      either high or low in targeted dietary supplements. Following similar studies that the
      investigators has successfully performed over shorter durations at high altitudes previously,
      they hypothesise that levels of stress experienced in extreme environments such as Antarctica
      or deep space can be reduced with targeted nutritional supplementation. These findings may
      become important to members of the general public as commercial aviation moves increasingly
      towards using low space-orbital vehicles to drastically reduce international travel times
      over the coming decade.

Each is scored from 0 - 3 (for no symptoms to very debilitating respectively) and a total score of 3 or more including at headache symptoms is required for a positive diagnosis of Acute Mountain Sickness</description>
