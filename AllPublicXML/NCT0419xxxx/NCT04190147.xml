  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During recent years, the interest in studying the risks of being born moderate-to-late
      preterm (MLP), defined as birth between gestational week 32 to 36, has increased. Today the
      investigators know that morbidity and mortality are significantly higher in these individuals
      compared to individuals born full-term. However, few studies have focused on the development
      of the eye in MLP individuals. The purpose of the study is to evaluate eye morphology and
      visual function in relation to growth, metabolism, blood pressure, neuropsychiatric factors,
      and quality of life in adolescents born MLP. The results of the examinations will be compared
      to an age-matched control group. The study will evaluate the structural, functional, and
      metabolic aspects of the eye with the hypothesis that early eye abnormalities may detect the
      risk of developing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

        Year 2002 to 2004, 247 children born moderate-to-late preterm i Gothenburg, Sweden, were
        enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal and population-based cohort study. These children
        will be asked to participate in the present follow-up study 15 years later. The age-matched
        control group born full-term will be recruited from schools in Gothenburg.
