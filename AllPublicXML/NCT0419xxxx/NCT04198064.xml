  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether utilization of the &quot;bag squeeze&quot; technique
      during flexible cystoscopy changes pain scores using a study questionnaire designed by the
      team which comprises a validated Lingard pain rating scale.

    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed for up to 4 hours after consent and completion of clinical procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their pain on the study-specific Lingard pain scale post-cystocopy.
The Lingard pain scale is an outcome measure scaled from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad it could be). The higher the reported rating out of 10, the more pain the participant has experienced.</description>
