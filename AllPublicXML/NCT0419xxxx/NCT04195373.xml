    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the safety and tolerability of TMV-018 when given alone or in
      combination with the prodrug 5-Fluorocytosine (5-FC) or an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in
      patients with gastrointestinal tumors. Furthermore, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase II dose of TMV-018 shall be determined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation phase I trial that aims to determine the
      safety and tolerability of TMV-018, an oncolytic measles virus encoding the prodrug
      converting enzyme &quot;super cytosine deaminase&quot;, when given alone or in combination with the
      prodrug 5-Fluorocytosine (5-FC) or an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor up to day 72 in patients
      with colorectal carcinoma (left-sided or rectal), esophageal carcinoma, or gastric cancer.
      Furthermore, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose of TMV-018 shall
      be determined.

      At least 15 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be randomized to different treatment
      groups: all patients will receive intra-tumoral TMV-018 on four visits and additionally 5-FC
      and/or anti-PD-1 treatment. All adverse events will be documented and analyzed for the
      primary safety endpoint. Blood and tumor samples will be collected up to day 72 to determine
      the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the treatment. The patients will be
      followed-up for another two years to determine long-term safety.
