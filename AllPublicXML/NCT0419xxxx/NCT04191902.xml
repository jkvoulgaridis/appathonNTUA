      The investigators evaluated the satisfaction of these patients with the health service and
      their self-care. The study included patients diagnosed with DM, respecting the established
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants were randomized into the control group and the
      intervention group.

    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have greater control over the disease when they acquire
      some knowledge about it. In this context, the use of technology by health professionals for
      nutritional guidance and self-care has shown promising results. This study aims to evaluate
      the impact of these educational approaches via SMS on glycemic control of patients with DM,
      followed at the Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic of the Antonio Pedro University Hospital
      (HUAP). Also, the investigators evaluated the satisfaction of these patients with the health
      service and their self-care. The study included patients diagnosed with DM, respecting the
      established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants were randomized into the control
      group and the intervention group. The patients in the intervention group received weekly SMS
      for six months, with dietary guidelines and DM care. Both groups answered a questionnaire at
      the beginning and end of the intervention, which consisted of assessing satisfaction with the
      health service received and their care for DM. Similarly, the investigators collected their
      clinical and laboratory data from medical records at the beginning and end of the
      intervention.
