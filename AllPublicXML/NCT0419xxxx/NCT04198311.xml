      Project SAFE aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a CBT-I
      supplement to outpatient alcohol treatment.

    <textblock>
      Among those who receive treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD), one in three relapses to
      problematic drinking within one year of treatment. Thus, additional treatment strategies are
      needed. Notably, up to 74% of individuals seeking treatment for AUD report co-occurring
      symptoms of insomnia. Given the negative impact of insomnia on attention and emotion
      regulation, insomnia symptoms may decrease patients' abilities to attend to alcohol treatment
      and manage negative emotions that lead to craving and relapse. This project aims to examine
      the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a CBT-I supplement to outpatient
      alcohol treatment. Forty adults who meet diagnostic criteria for AUD and Insomnia Disorder
      will be randomly assigned to receive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) or
      minimal treatment (sleep hygiene handout; EDU) in addition to alcohol treatment as usual.
      Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the active intervention period (6 weeks) and at 6
      weeks post-intervention

    <description>The satisfaction rating participants give the treatment.Assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire; The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire is an 8-item measure of satisfaction with treatment that has been validated in substance use treatment settings. Items are scores from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with treatment.</description>

    <measure>Insomnia severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 6) to follow-up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); ISI will be used as a 7-item measure of insomnia severity in the past two weeks. Items assess difficulty falling or staying asleep, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, the extent to which others notice their sleep problems, and worry/distress related to sleep problems. Response options range from 0 (not at all worried) to 4 (very much worried), with possible total scores ranging from 0 to 28. Participants scoring 10 or higher will be classified as screening positive for insomnia (Morin et al., 2011).114 Notably, self-report is the recommended method of assessment for symptoms of insomnia in adults (Schutte-Rodin et al., 2008).</description>
