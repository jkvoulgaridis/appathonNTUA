             therapy against HCC. For Phase II, subject has not previously received systemic
             therapy.

          6. At least one measurable lesion as evaluable by RECIST version 1.1.

          9. Expected survival≥3 months.

         10. For Phase Ib and II, fresh or archived tumor tissue should be provided for analysis in
             the central laboratory.

         11. The function of the main organs was basically normal and met the requirements of the
             protocol.

         12. For subject with HCV infection, HCV antiviral treatment with the locally approved and
