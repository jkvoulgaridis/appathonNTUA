  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing a shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair will be enrolled in the
      study. Patients will be asked to undergo driving simulator assessments post-operatively in
      ATI Physical Therapy for up to 12 weeks after surgery in order to determine when it may be
      safe for them to return to driving. Additional assessments include patient-reported outcomes,
      range of motion, and strength measures, which are all standard of care. Study participation
      concludes when the patient passes the driving simulator test.
