      The study will be carried out by the principal investigator and his team at the Division of
      Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery of the Department of Surgery, College of Medicine,
      University of Ibadan and the University College Hospital, Ibadan (UCH), which is the Teaching
      Hospital of the Medical College.The study sets out to prospectively compare the early and
      long-term outcomes between the use of purse-string (suturing U-technique) and
      Un-reapproximated thoracostomy wound edges (Occlusive adhesive-absorbent dressing
      application) at the time of removal of thoracostomy tube drain in patients who have had chest
      tube insertion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Closed thoracostomy tube drainage or chest tube insertion is one of the most
      commonly performed procedures in thoracic surgery. There are several published evidence-based
      guidelines on safe performance of a chest tube insertion. However, there is absence of any
      prospective controlled trial or systematic review, that scientifically proves the safest
      technique of closing the wound created at the time of chest tube insertion and that best
      guarantees good wound and overall outcomes, after chest tube removal. The use of a horizontal
      mattress non-absorbable suture or U- suture which is placed at the time of chest tube
      insertion and used to create a purse-string wound re-approximation at the time of tube
      removal, has been an age-long and time-honored practice in most thoracic surgical settings.
      It has been established by a fairly recent study that an occlusive adhesive-absorbent
      dressing can also be safely used to occlude the wound at the time of chest tube removal with
      good wound and overall outcomes though the study focused on tubes inserted during thoracic
      surgical operations.

      Research Design: The study is an Open-label randomized prospective trial

      Methodology: 142 consenting patients with indication for chest tube insertion, who meet the
      inclusion criteria for enrolment in the study will be randomly assigned into two balanced
      groups- Group A; that will have a Prolene 1 purse-string suture placed around the
      thoracostomy wound at the time of chest tube insertion and which will be used for the
      thoracostomy wound closure at the time of chest tube removal and Group B, that will not have
      a purse-string suture placement during chest tube insertion and will have their wounds
      covered by an occlusive adhesive-absorbent dressing material (Primapore*), at the time of
      chest tube removal. The procedure for chest tube insertion, indwelling chest tube management,
      post-tube removal care and outpatient follow-up; will be similar for both groups and will
      follow a pre-determined standardized protocol. Specific clinical outcomes while the chest
      tube is indwelling and specific clinical and wound outcomes after the chest tube removal will
      be observed in both Groups for comparison and to determine causal relationships. Observations
      will be recorded in a specially-designed study proforma.
