  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of posterior shoulder endurance
      test in overhead athletes and to compare the endurance of posterior shoulder muscles between
      athletes with and without shoulder pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 overhead athletes, 20 with shoulder pain and 20 with no shoulder pain, will be
      included in the study. Shoulder endurance will be measured as isometric and isotonic on both
      arms of athletes using the posterior shoulder endurance test. The measurements will be
      repeated after 3-7 days, and the test-retest reliability of the isotonic and isometric
      posterior shoulder endurance test will be investigated.

    <description>Isometric posterior shoulder endurance test: In the prone position, the athlete's shoulder will be placed at horizontal abduction, and the time for maintaining this position will be recorded.
Isotonic shoulder endurance test: In the prone position, the athlete's shoulder will be placed at horizontal abduction and asked to perform horizontal adduction-abduction, and the athlete will horizontally abducted-adducted his/her arm to 90 degrees at a cadence of 30 beats per minute. The number of repetitions will be recorded.</description>
