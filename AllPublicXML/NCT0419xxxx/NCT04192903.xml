    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most difficult-to-treat breast cancer subtype,
      lacks well-defined treatment options. This is a prospective, single-center, one-arm,
      open-label, phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of chidamide in
      combination with cisplatin in subjects with relapsed or metastatic triple-negative breast
      cancer.
