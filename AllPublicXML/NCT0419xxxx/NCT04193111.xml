    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether a questionnaire can be used to detect
      whether patients referred to the Danish Headache Center have a painful temporomandibular
      disorder (TMD).

      TMD is a major public health problem that affects up to 15% of the adult population and can
      cause headaches that can be immediately difficult to differentiate from other headache types
      such as tension headaches and migraines. By applying the so-called diagnostic criteria for
      TMD through a standardized study program, TMD diseases such as myalgia of the jaw muscles,
      arthralgia and discus displacements of the jaw joints and jaw arthritis can be diagnosed.
      However, this requires dental expertise and is time consuming. At the Danish Headache Center,
      the current screening question is used for TMD in order to identify who could benefit from
      further investigation in dentistry. But it is still unknown how accurate these questions are
      in selecting those patients who have TMD diseases in a patient group with a headache. The
      investigators would like to investigate this in order to improve the referral procedure of
      headache patients for relevant dental treatment or physiotherapy. This is believed to be of
      importance both in a specialized unit such as the Danish Headache Center and in neurological
      medical practice.

      Patients will be recruited who are referred to the Danish Headache Center, who have been
      given TMD screening questions and who have indicated in writing that they wish to be
      contacted for research projects.

      In the study, 25 subjects with TMD screening question score of ≥ 3 points will be included,
      which will be gender and age matched with 25 subjects who have TMD screening question score
      of &lt;3 points. The patients will be interviewed to classify the patients headache 15 min and
      then have a jaw examination done and then the DC / TMD examination will be done and lasts
      approx. 30 min. The examination is performed by a skilled physiotherapist and it does not
      involve any side effects or risks.

        Patients referred to the Danish Headache Center with any type of headache are included.
        Half the population has a high probability of having a painful TMD, the other half is
        matched on age and gender but has a low probability of having a painful TMD.
