  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using decision aids has been demonstrated to support women to make treatment decision
      effectively. However, these studies focused on the decision of receiving breast conservative
      surgery or mastectomy, had short term follow-ups on decision satisfaction.The aims of this
      study were: Evaluate the effect of E-based &amp; personalized breast reconstruction surgery
      decision aid on women's decision satisfaction and mental health.

      Randomized controlled trial will be used to examine the effect of E-based &amp; personalized
      breast reconstruction surgery decision aid on decision satisfaction, body image, anxiety and
      depression. Participants will be randomly assigned into either experimental or control groups
      with 88 women in each group. After completing the questionnaires at baseline, participants in
      the experimental group will be asked to receive a E-based &amp; personalized breast
      reconstruction surgery decision aid at clinic. Control group will only receive pamphlet and
      usual care. All participants will be followed up 1 week after consultation, and 1 month, 8
      month and 12 month after surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body image</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery, 1 month, 8 month, 12 month post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Body Image Scale (BIS) has ten items rated on a four-point Likert scale (0 [not at all] to 3 [very much]), with total scores ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater BI distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Regret</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 8 month, 12 month post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Decision Regret Scale (DRS) accesses &quot;distress or remorse after a surgery decision&quot;. This instrument contains 5 items. The items were summed, divided by 5, and multiplied by 25. Higher scores indicate greater decision regret.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery, 1 week after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Decision Conflict Scale (DCS) accesses the perception of uncertainty in information, values or support for surgery options. This instrument contains 16 items and was developed by O'Connor. The items were summed, divided by 16, and multiplied by 25. Higher scores indicate greater decision conflict.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery, 1 month, 8 month, 12 month post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assesses symptoms of anxiety and depression. The HADS includes 14 items, of which 7 measure anxiety, and 7 measure depression. All items are scored using a 0-3 point scale, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. Cut-off scores are used to categorize anxiety and depressive symptoms, with values of over 8 indicating possible anxiety and depression, and 11 or above indicating probable anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery, 1 month, 8 month, 12 month post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assesses symptoms of anxiety and depression. The HADS includes 14 items, of which 7 measure anxiety, and 7 measure depression. All items are scored using a 0-3 point scale, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. Cut-off scores are used to categorize anxiety and depressive symptoms, with values of over 8 indicating possible anxiety and depression, and 11 or above indicating probable depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Involvement in the Breast Reconstruction (BR) decision-making process scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Involvement in the BR decision-making process was divided into two subscales, one accesses the perception of medical information about surgery obtained with 6 items and the other assesses the perception of partners' involvement in the BR decision-making process with 7 items. The scale used a five-point Likert scale (1 [strongly disagree] to 5 [strongly agree]); the higher the score, the greater the amount of information the participants believed they had obtained and the greater the participants perceived their partner's involvement in the BR decision-making process.</description>
