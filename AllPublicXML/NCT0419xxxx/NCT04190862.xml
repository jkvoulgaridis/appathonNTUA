  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if endothelial cells derived from human umbilical
      vein are safe for use in conjunction with fistulotomy for the treatment of simple anal
      fistulas. Endothelial cells are a special kind of cell in the body that line the inside
      surface of blood vessels. The goal of the study is to evaluate the preliminary safety of
      human umbilical vein cells in anal fistula healing.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of E-CEL UVEC® cells and see what effects
      (good and bad) it has on your anal fistula. It is hoped, that the E-CEL UVEC® cells may help
      to improve healing of your fistula after surgery.

      E-CEL UVEC® cells are genetically engineered human endothelial cells that are taken from the
      umbilical cords of newborn babies. The endothelial cells are cells that line the inside of
      blood vessels including the umbilical cord. Human umbilical endothelial cells are collected
      from the umbilical cord of a healthy newborn baby. The cells are obtained under strict United
      States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The endothelial cells are
      engineered in the laboratory, meaning an extra gene is added. A gene is taken from a virus
      (just a single gene, not the entire virus) and inserted into the endothelial cells.This
      causes the endothelial cells to be more stable and improves their growth capabilities. In
      animal studies, the endothelial cells were cleared from the body within a month. No negative
      side effects related to the endothelial cells were seen in animal studies. A higher than
      normal healing response was seen in animal studies.

      This research study is being done because, in animal studies, E-CEL UVEC® cells have been
      shown to speed up healing in various tissues and organs. This study will test if it is safe
      to use E-CEL UVEC® cells and if they help to improve healing of your fistula after surgery.
