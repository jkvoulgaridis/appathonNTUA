  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study seeks to understand how stress reduction training influences neural
      responses (brain activation) and behavior related to stress, including emotions and reactions
      to social conflict.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The full research project will be conducted over approximately 2-3 weeks, and will consist of
      two data collection sessions, one before and one after a 14-day stress reduction training
      course conducted via a smartphone that participants provide. This course entails
      instructor-facilitated stress reduction exercises previously shown to reduce stress and
      improve well-being. Participants will be randomly assigned to a mindfulness course or a
      cognitive reappraisal course. Both of these courses -mindfulness training (MT) and cognitive
      reappraisal training (RT) - involve expert-facilitated mental wellness techniques. MT
      emphasizes mindfulness-based techniques to reduce stress and promote wellbeing, whereas CT
      emphasizes reframing and reappraisal techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being.

    <measure>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hemodynamic signal change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants who show a statistically significant change in regional specificity, as measured by fNIRS-recorded blood oxygenation representing markers of emotion reactivity and regulation during observation of video stimuli.</description>

    <measure>Change in anger response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Anger subscale of the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire (DEQ) will be used to assess s the extent to which participants experience specific emotions on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (an extreme amount) in response to video stimuli. Lower scores indicate less anger and more emotion downregulation. Higher scores would indicate more anger and less emotion downregulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in disgust response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Disgust subscale of the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire (DEQ) will be used to assess the extent to which participants experience specific emotions on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (an extreme amount) in response to video stimuli. Lower scores indicate less disgust and more emotion downregulation. Higher scores would indicate more disgust and less emotion downregulation.</description>

    <description>The Fear subscale of the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire (DEQ) will be used to assess the extent to which participants experience specific emotions on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (an extreme amount) in response to video stimuli. Lower scores indicate less fear and more emotion downregulation. Higher scores would indicate more fear and less emotion downregulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in anxiety response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Anxiety subscale of the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire (DEQ) will be used to assess the extent to which participants experience specific emotions on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (an extreme amount) in response to video stimuli. Lower scores indicate less anxiety and more emotion downregulation. Higher scores would indicate more anxiety and less emotion downregulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in sadness response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sadness subscale of the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire (DEQ) will be used to assess the extent to which participants experience specific emotions on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (an extreme amount) in response to video stimuli. Lower scores indicate less sadness and more emotion downregulation. Higher scores would indicate more sadness and less emotion downregulation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in intergroup attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beliefs about Groups survey will be used to assess explicit intergroup attitudes. Participants answer 4 questions using a scale from 1 to 6. Higher scores indicate poorer attitude outcomes.</description>
