      A Randomized, Observer-Blinded, Vehicle Controlled, Single Dose, Dose Escalating, Single
      Application Within-patient Bilateral Comparison. The goal is to determine the safety and
      tolerability of DBI-001 Gel vs. Placebo in Adults with Atopic Dermatitis and to determine the
      antibacterial effect of a single application of DBI-001 Gel on the abundance of S. aureus.

      Tolerability will be evaluated through assessment of disease state severity and signs and
      symptoms of local tolerability (pain / burning / stinging, pruritus, erythema, edema, and
      scabbing / crusting) and review of adverse events. Any local skin reaction that requires use
      of a concomitant therapy or study discontinuation will be reported.

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized, observer-blinded, vehicle controlled, single dose application, dose escalating bilateral comparison study of DBI-001 Gel vs. Placebo in the patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) affecting the antecubital areas and/or posterior popliteal areas.
Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and having moderate to heavy growth of S. aureus from a sample collected at screening from an area of dermatitis on at least one arm or at least one leg will be enrolled into the study. Microbiological samples will be collected from all the designated sites on the arms or leg and all subjects will be treated with a single application of the assigned test articles applied by the unblinded treating investigator at the baseline visit.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study:

                  patient is unable to provide consent for him/herself, the patient's legally
                  authorized representative may provide written consent.

               2. A signed Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
                  authorization form which permits the use and disclosure of subject's individually
                  identifiable health information.

               4. Physician diagnosed clinically stable Atopic Dermatitis according to the criteria
                  of Hanifin and Rajka affecting ≤25% of total BSA with comparable bilateral
                  antecubital or popliteal lesions. Each lesion must have an ADSI ≥6 with a
                  difference between the lesions of ≤1. It will be in the opinion of the
                  Investigator whether the lesions are clinically stable.

               5. Moderate to heavy growth of S. aureus based on culture at the time of screening.

               6. Willingness to discontinue use of other Atopic Dermatitis treatment for the

                  lesions on both legs, with soap and water from the time of test article
                  application at baseline visit until after the completion of the Day 2 visit.

               9. Allow digital photos of arms or legs to be taken and stored.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or breastfeeding or have a positive
             pregnancy test at the site.

             2. Any dermatological conditions that could interfere with clinical evaluations or any
             disease state or physical condition which might expose the patient to an unacceptable
             risk by study participation.

             3. Any underlying disease(s) or other dermatological conditions that require the use
             of exclusionary topical or systemic therapy (see Points 5 and 6).

             4. Known sensitivity to any of the components of the study medication. 5. Washout of 4
             weeks for topical treatments used on the six designated sites, including but not
             limited to: antibacterial products, anti-inflammatories (e.g. corticosteroids,
             tacrolimus, Pimecrolimus). Other than the six sites on the arms or legs, topical
             mediations may be used before/during the duration of the study.

             6. Willing not to apply any prescription or over the counter topical product on the
             selected designated sites on arms or legs.
