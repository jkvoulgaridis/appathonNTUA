  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome characterized by generalized musculoskeletal
      pain, fatigue, non-repairing sleep, cognitive changes, depressive symptoms and other
      correlates of autonomic dysfunction. A high prevalence of overweight in patients with
      fibromyalgia is observed, about 80% according to current data, which affects the course and
      prognosis of the disease, besides overburdening health costs and further compromising quality
      of life. life of these patients. Evidence shows possible pathophysiological pathways shared
      by these two pathologies, as well as aspects related to food behavior. It is known that
      dopaminergic neurotransmission is altered in both, suggesting an increase in the sensitivity
      or density of D2 dopamine receptors. Non-pharmacological options for pain management and
      dysfunctional eating behavior include the important contribution of neuromodulatory
      techniques of non-invasive cerebral stimulation, such as transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS), which aims to increase resisting hyperpalatable foods and reducing
      caloric intake. Objectives: To evaluate the association between dopamine receptor-2 (DRD2)
      Taq1A allele A1 polymorphism (rs1800497) and to observe the possible effect of tDCS on the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on homeostatic and hedonistic aspects of eating
      behavior in women with FM. Methods: A randomized, double blind, parallel group, controlled
      trial with simulated treatment will be performed. Will be included in the study women
      literate, right-handed, with confirmed diagnosis of FM. The evaluation will be done through
      questionnaires on pain and eating behavior, anthropometric evaluation and biochemical
      measurements. The intervention will take place through active or simulated home for 4 weeks.
      Perspectives: To evaluate dysfunctional neuroplastic changes in eating behavior and
      biological markers and also to serve as a basis for future effective treatment strategies
      through neuromodulation and nutritional counseling.

    <measure>Three Factor Eating Questionnaire 21</measure>
    <time_frame>6 mouths</time_frame>
    <description>TFE-Q was developed by Stunkard and Messic (1985) to access three dimensions of human eating behavior: Cognitive Restriction (CR), Eating Disorder (AD) and Emotional Eating (AE). Originally made up of 51 items and reduced in the TFEQ-18, TFEQ-18, TFEQ-21 versions. We will use the TFEQ-21. The average obtained from the sum of the questions for each domain was converted to a scale ranging from 0 to 100.
Evaluates dysfunctional eating behavior. Cognitive restriction: limitation of food intake for weight control; Uncontrolled Food: Tendency to lose control over eating from hunger or when exposed to external environments, even in the absence of physiological hunger; Emotional Eating: Susceptible to eating in response to emotional stress or negative mood.</description>

    <measure>State and Trait Food-Cravings Questionnaires (FCQ-s e FCQ-t)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 mouths</time_frame>
    <description>- FCQ-T consists of 39 statements and was developed to access food cravings aspects over time and in various situations, considering them as a (usual) trait behavior of the respondent.
Higher scores in this questionnaire are related to a more exaggerated eating.
- FCQ-S is composed of 15 statements and is a tool sensitive to changes in contextual, psychological and physiological states in response to specific situations (such as stressful events or food deprivation), considering the food craving as a (sporadic) state behavior of the respondent.
Higher scores in this questionnaire are associated with greater food deprivation, negative eating-related experiences and a greater susceptibility to triggers that lead to eating.
Totals of both tools for the full subscales and their dimensions are calculated by adding the corresponding scores of each statement.</description>

    <description>Hunger and satiety measured by the 100 mm Analog-Visual Scale (VAS), whose zero corresponds to the absence of hunger or appetite and 100 mm hunger or maximum appetite. Patients should report hunger, hunger or satiety for most of the last 24 hours.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 24 hours</time_frame>

    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) it is a therapeutic method that modulates membrane potential, where anodic stimuli induce cortical excitability and cathodic stimuli reduce it. The position of the electrodes will be performed based on a 10-20 system according to the international EEG unit system, with the location of the electrodes at C3 and F3, respectively. The anode will be positioned over the left hemisphere at C3 while the cathode will be positioned over the contralateral hemisphere F3.
