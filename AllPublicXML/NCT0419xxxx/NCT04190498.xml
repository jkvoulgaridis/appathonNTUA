    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), one of the most frequent respiratory diseases, could represent
      a major worsening factor in a non alcoholic steatohepatitis and neoplastic context. Our
      hypothesis is that OSA promotes the prevalence of HCC related to NASH. This national,
      multicenter study aims to compare the prevalence of OSA in a group of patient curatively
      resected for NASH-related HCC with a group of HCV-related HCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common respiratory disease characterized by the occurrence
      of recurrent episodes of partial or total obstruction of the upper airway called hypopneas
      and apneas respectively. These episodes are associated with the repetitive occurrence of the
      desaturation-reoxygenation sequences, the so-called chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) which
      is the major stimulus underlying main cardiovascular, metabolic consequences and
      pro-inflammatory state found in patients with OSA. Recent data from cohort studies have
      established that OSA is an even greater risk factor for cancer-related mortality.
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second cancer related death worldwide and has an
      increasing impact in developed countries. The epidemic of metabolic syndrome (MS) plays a
      growing role in the occurrence of metabolic steatohepatitis (NASH) related HCC. Concerning
      transition from NASH to NASH-related HCC, neither the frequency nor the underlying mechanism
      are known. Very recently, a link between OSA (IH) and NASH has been highlighted. OSA and
      intermittent hypoxia should be a major worsening factor in a neoplastic context. Our
      hypothesis is that OSA promotes the prevalence of HCC in a context of NASH.

      The objective is to compare the prevalence of OSA between patients with NASH-related and
      hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC. In this type 3, cross-sectional, multicenter, national,
      non-randomized study patients suffering from a NASH-related or HCV-related hepatocellular
      carcinoma will be recruited. Investigators expect to show a higher prevalence of OSA in
      patients with HCC NASH-related but also a shorter overall survival. Complementary ex vivo
      studies on tumor samples will be conducted in order to explore the mechanisms by which OSA
      and IH would promote carcinogenesis

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality. Consisting of 19 items, the PSQI measures several different aspects of sleep. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>

        Patients will prospectively included in the French Liver Biobanks network - INCa,
        BB-0033-00085 (CRB-Foie). Patients suffering from a NASH-related or HCV-related
        hepatocellular carcinoma who were only treated by surgery will be selected.

        Each NASH-related HCC patient will be adjusted with two HCV-related HCC patients based on a
        propensity score according to their age range, sex, BMI, tumor stage.

        For each patient, the duration of the study will be 1 month maximum, with only one visit
        for inclusion. Survival data at 12 and 24 months will be from the medical record and will
        not require a visit. The total duration of study will be 48 months.
