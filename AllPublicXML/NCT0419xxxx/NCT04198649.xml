      Primary purpose: Evaluate the effect of azithromycin on failure proportion of severe chronic
      periodontitis non-surgical treatment; failure characterized by the persistence of at least
      one periodontal pocket&gt; 5mm at 6 months

      Secondary purpose:

        -  Evaluate the effect of azithromycin on the persistence of pathological periodontal
           pockets &gt; 5mm during non-surgical treatment of severe chronic periodontitis at 3 months
           and 6 months

        -  Evaluate the effect of azithromycin on the changes of clinical signs, periopathogen
           levels, expression of macrolides resistance genes, and expression of antimicrobial
           peptides (PAMs) during treatment of severe chronic periodontitis at 3 months and 6
           months

        -  Assess therapeutic observance and side effects of antibiotic treatment

        -  Assess at 3 and 6 months the potential interactions of local, bacterial (periopathogen
           and resistance gene) clinical factors, and host defense (PAMs) with the effect of
           azithromycin, on failure proportion of severe chronic periodontitis non-surgical
           treatment
