  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of major non-communicable diseases such as
      type 2 diabetes (7%), cardiovascular disease (6%), musculoskeletal disorders and some types
      of cancer, and has been proposed to be the 4th leading cause of death worldwide. The
      investigators aim is to assess the vascular (endothelial) function before and after a 5-day
      period of reduced activity of upper and lower limbs via an arm sling and daily step counts
      reduction, respectively, in healthy participants. Twelve young (ages of 18 - 35 years),
      healthy, males and females, recreationally active with a body mass index between 18 and 27
      kg/m2 will be recruited. The participants will then randomly undergo two 5-day interventions:
      (A) 5 consecutive days of habitual daily levels of physical activity and matched food intake
      (Control trial). (B) 5 consecutive days of reduced step count by 80% compared to the Control
      trial combined with their non-dominant arm placed in a sling and a reduction in food (energy)
      intake (~20%) to match the reduction in energy expenditure induced by inactivity (Inactivity
      trial). On days 1 and 6 of each experimental trial, the endothelial function of the brachial
      and popliteal arteries, and hand grip strength will be measured.
