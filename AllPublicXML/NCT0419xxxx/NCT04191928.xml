  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study investigators will examine the absorption characteristics of apixaban, a direct-acting
      oral anticoagulation, in patients who have underwent a particular kind of surgery
      (pancreaticoduodenectomy) which involves resection of the duodenum.

      This study will examine apixaban pharmacokinetic exposure (AUC(0-24)) and maximum
      concentration (Cmax) when administered as a single oral dose in patients who have undergone
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) compared to historical controls. This is a phase one, single
      dose pharmacokinetic study in stable patients who have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy.
      Apixaban is an orally administered highly selective factor Xa inhibitor, belonging to the
      class of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) along with rivaroxoban and edoxaban. Factor
      Xa is an essential mediator of the clotting pathway in humans. Apixaban is currently approved
      by the FDA for treatment of VTE, prophylaxis of DVT in patients undergoing knee and hip
      replacement surgeries and for reducing the risk of embolic stroke and systemic embolism in
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This study aims to compare the
      pharmacokinetics and absorption of oral apixaban in patients who have undergone
      pancreaticoduodenectomy to that of apixaban in historical controls.

          -  Have a history of pancreaticoduodenectomy

          -  If female, subject can be of childbearing potential and must demonstrate a urine β-hCG
             level consistent with the non-gravid state at the screening visit and agree to use
             (and/or have their partner use) an acceptable method of birth control beginning at the
             screening visit throughout the trial (including washout intervals between treatment
             periods) and until 2 weeks after the last dose of trial drug in the last treatment
             period. Acceptable methods of birth control: intrauterine device (&quot;IUD&quot; with or
             without local hormone release, oral contraceptive pills, diaphragm, cervical cap,
             spermicides, contraceptive sponge, and /or condoms). Abstinence is an alternative life
             style and subjects practicing abstinence may be included in the trial.

          -  Can be of non-childbearing potential which is defined as: a female who is
