    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU)
      using the Exablate® Model 4000 Type 2.0/2.1 as an adjunctive neuromodulatory treatment for
      OUD (Opioid Use Disorder) by assessing its safety and tolerability in subjects with OUD.

    <description>There are two treatment stages. In both stages, the subject will receive both the sham and active ExAblate treatment, and be evaluated for 90 days post-treatment for adverse events. During Stage 1 the subject will receive the moderate intensity Exablate LIFU procedure. During Stage2, the subject will receive the enhanced intensity ExAblate LIFU procedure. The subjects are blinded as to the order of the sham vs active treatment.</description>
