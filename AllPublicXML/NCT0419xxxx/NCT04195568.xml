        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age is ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years

          2. Has a single unruptured target intracranial aneurysm (IA) with the following
             characteristics:

               1. Is located on the internal carotid artery (ICA) or its branches.

               2. Has a neck ≥ 4 mm, dome to neck ratio ≤ 2.0, or no discernible neck

               3. Aneurysm size is ≤ 12 mm (saccular or fusiform configuration)

          3. Has a parent vessel diameter ≥ 2.0 mm and ≤ 5.0 mm at both the proximal and distal
             segments where the implant will be placed

          4. Has multiple increased risk factors for intracranial (IA) aneurysm rupture, including
             but not limited to, aneurysm morphology, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, age, prior
             and/or family history of rupture, and/or history of subarachnoid hemorrhage that may
             result in a benefit risk profile of endovascular treatment that outweighs the risks of
             intracranial aneurysm rupture during the subject's expected lifetime if left
             untreated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has an extradural target aneurysm

          2. Has a target aneurysm in the posterior circulation

          3. Perforator or branch vessel, inclusive of the posterior communicating artery, arises
             from the target aneurysm body or neck (branches or arteries must arise or connect from
             the parent vessel separate from the aneurysm or neck to not be excluded from study)

          4. Has a true bifurcation aneurysm, defined as an aneurysm (saccular or non-saccular)
             located at a point of vessel bifurcation

          5. Target aneurysm is unsuitable for flow diverter treatment

          6. Has vessel characteristics, such as severe tortuosity, stenosis, or morphology that
             would preclude safe endovascular access to the target aneurysm necessary for treatment
             with the study device (e.g., which may be evidenced by excessive resistance felt
             during the procedure); or, presence of intracranial atherosclerotic disease or
             stenosis

          7. Received previous treatment of the target aneurysm or parent artery where it would
             interfere with the placement or proper apposition of the device

          8. Has a medical contraindication to study or procedure related antiplatelet medications
             (aspirin, clopidogrel/Plavix, ticagrelor, and heparin), local or general anesthesia,
             or lifethreatening allergy to contrast dye

          9. Has a known severe allergy to nickel, chromium cobalt, tungsten or platinum.

         10. Modified Rankin Score (mRS) assessment is ≥ 3 at preprocedure exam

         11. Presence of unstable neurological deficit (i.e., worsening of clinical condition in
             the last 30 days)

         12. Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred within 30 days prior to enrollment

         13. Major surgery (including previous intracranial implant) occurred within previous 30
             days or is planned in the next 120 days after enrollment date

         14. Has more than one IA that requires treatment within 12 months

         15. Received previous intracranial implant associated with the symptomatic or vascular
             distribution within the past 12 weeks prior to treatment date

         16. Chronic anticoagulation therapy is ongoing or known coagulopathy exists

         17. Has other known serious concurrent medical conditions such as heart disease (including
             atrial fibrillation, pacemaker, recent myocardial infarction [&lt; 12 weeks], symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, or carotid stenosis), kidney failure [&gt;2.0mg/dl serum
             creatinine], pulmonary disease, uncontrolled diabetes, progressive neurologic
             disorders, terminal cancer, vasculitis, high risk of ischemic stroke or recent stroke

         18. Has acute life-threatening illness other than the neurological disease (e.g., acute
             kidney or heart failure) to be treated in this trial

         19. Life expectancy is less than 5 years due to other illness or condition (in addition to
             an intracranial aneurysm)

         20. Unable to complete study follow up due to dementia or psychiatric problem, substance
             abuse, or history of noncompliance with medical advice

         21. Pregnancy at time of enrollment

         22. Presence of intracranial mass (tumor, except meningioma, abscess, or other infection),
             non-treated arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the territory of the target aneurysm
