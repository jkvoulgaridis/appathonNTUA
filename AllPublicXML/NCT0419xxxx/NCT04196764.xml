  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective observational study of 6 months of follow-up, of national and multicenter scope
      with medical device with CE marking and according to the usual clinical practice.

      In addition, due to the observational design of the clinical investigation, no assignment of
      the patients will be made to any specific study group, but will be carried out in accordance
      with the usual clinical practice, not applying any intervention other than the usual one in
      this type of care practice and always in accordance with current clinical guidelines and
      recommendations and with the indications authorized in Spain.

      Patients will be recruited by specialists and will be followed for 6 months under the
      conditions of usual clinical practice.
