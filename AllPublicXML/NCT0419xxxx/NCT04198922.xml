  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well acalabrutinib works in treating patients with chronic
      graft versus host disease. Acalabrutinib may be an effective treatment for graft-versus-host
      disease caused by a stem cell transplant.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 cycles with an option to continue for up to 24 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then
      periodically thereafter.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Best response (complete and partial response [CR + PR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the first 6 months of treatment when the best response rate is known for each patient</time_frame>
    <description>The composite outcome of CR and PR, calculated according to the proposed response definitions of the 2014 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated for the objective response rate using the Clopper and Pearson method. Will also compare the observed best ORR with the published efficacy of ibrutinib (67%) and provide the 95% CI for the difference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days following the last dose of acalabrutinib</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as grade 3 and above according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 and all serious AEs (SAEs) described for the population receiving at least one dose of acalabrutinib at least from the time of consent through the safety follow-up period. Any AE/SAE at least possibly related to acalabrutinib therapy will be reported for the duration of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date the PR is documented until loss of the response or start of another systemic immunosuppressive treatment for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), whichever occurs first, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be described for the group achieving at least a PR, defined as the number of weeks the subject maintains a PR or CR. Will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Approximate 95% CIs for median DOR will be computed using the formula proposed by Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient-reported outcomes: Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by the Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale score. Scores will be calculated based on published algorithms with absolute changes and clinically meaningful changes described for the population as a whole and based on CR + PR versus stable disease (SD) + mixed response (MR) + progressive disease (PD).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient-reported outcomes: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29. Scores will be calculated based on published algorithms with absolute changes and clinically meaningful changes described for the population as a whole and based on CR + PR versus stable disease (SD) + mixed response (MR) + progressive disease (PD).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Failure-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined as the duration of relapse-free survival without adding any other systemic treatment for chronic GVHD. Will be estimated with the composite event of death from any cause, relapse and addition of secondary immune suppressive agents using the Kaplan-Meier method. Systemic immune-suppressive agents include orally or intravenously administered systemically active immune-suppressive drugs, as well as procedures including extra-corporeal photopheresis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Organ-specific response rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response rates by organ will also be calculated and reported as ORR (CR+PR) versus all other categories (SD, PD, MR).</description>
