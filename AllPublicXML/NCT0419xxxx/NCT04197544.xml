  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In last few years, there is a new technology that permits the endovascular fistula creation
      with a minimum vascular trauma and the first results show encouraging results with high
      technical success rate, low resurgent and failure rates and good usability for hemodialysis.

      The implementation of the endoFAVI realization in dialysis patients is an emergent procedure
      that in our hospital can contribute important benefits to the patients, savings to the health
      system, as well research and innovation in the implicate services.
