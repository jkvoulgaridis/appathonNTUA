  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators organized 18 hospitals to participate in this multicenter study. Patients
      meeting following indications will be included in this study: 1. Biopsy pathology proved
      micropapillary thyroid carcinoma(mPTC), but not high-risk subtype; 2. solitary mPTC, without
      invasion of thyroid capsule or surrounding tissue; 3. no evidence of metastasis; 4 willing to
      participate in this study and perform regular follow-up. Patients themselves decide to
      receive microwave ablation(MWA) or surgical resection(SR) for mPTC after medical
      consultation. Baseline characteristic including age, gender, thyroid function et al. will be
      collected. The treatment protocols of MWA and SR were according to the Chinese and
      international guidelines. The primary outcomes were the local tumor recurrence, lymph node
      metastasis, and distant metastasis. The secondary outcomes include thyroid function,
      complication rate, blood loss et al. Investigators will follow up enrolled patients and
      collect and upload data according to the trial.

      The treatment protocols of MWA and SR were according to the Chinese and international
      guidelines. MWA need to ablate all tumors including at least 2mm safe margin except for
      tumors adjacent to thyroid capsule. SR basic protocol is lobectomy + central lymph node
      dissection. All patients need to receive levothyroxine therapy to keep TSH lower than 0.5
      mU/L. Patients in both groups underwent regular medical imaging and laboratory tests 1 month,
      3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, 24-month and 36-month after treatment.
