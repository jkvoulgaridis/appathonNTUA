      A pilot feasibility study of a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a
      video-conferencing cognitive behavioral coping skills (VC-CBCS) group to standard of care
      (SC) for symptomatic patients previously diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C to evaluate
      feasibility, patient satisfaction and differences in symptoms, quality of life and liver
      markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study of a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a
      cognitive behavioral coping skills (CBCS) delivered via videoconferencing, referred to as the
      &quot;VC-CBCS&quot; compared to standard of care (SC). The study will include a representative sample
      of 32 symptomatic patients who have/had chronic hepatitis C. Patients (n=32) will be
      randomized in a 1:3 ratio to (1) standard of care (SC) or (2) to participate in 14, two hour
      VC-CBCS sessions. Four groups of patients will be randomized and will consist of 7-9 patients
      each. The groups are as follows:

        -  Group 1 - 7 patients with 5 randomized to VC-CBCS and 2 to SC;

        -  Group 2 - 9 patients with 7 randomized to VC-CBCS and 2 to SC;

        -  Groups 3 and 4 - 8 patients each with 6 randomized to VC-CBCS and 2 to SC each group.

      Each wave of VC-CBCS patients will form a group to join the Group Facilitator via a WebEx
      platform on a weekly basis using iPads from their homes. The telehealth intervention provides
      group-based education, skills and practices involving stress management, coping with
      symptoms, and support for healthy lifestyle changes. The researchers will examine: (1) the
      feasibility of delivering a group intervention via telehealth technology remotely using
      iPads, (2) participant satisfaction with the intervention, and (3) whether differences are
      observed in several outcomes between the two conditions on quality of life, physical and
      mental symptoms, and liver markers. Patients will complete patient-reported outcome (PRO)
      surveys at four time points during the study, with main outcomes being change from
      pre-intervention to post-intervention.

    <measure>Global Health Status Physical Health Mean T-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Global Health Status measure is a 10-item short form that will be used to measure an individual's physical, mental, and social health. Item responses range from 5 = None to 1 = Very Severe. The adult PROMIS Global Health measure produces two scores: Physical Health and Mental Health. The raw scores are converted into a T-score. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. Higher T- scores indicate more of that construct, for example, a T-score=60 is 1 standard deviation better (more healthy) than the general population. The Physical Health T-score can range from 23.4 to 63.3.</description>
