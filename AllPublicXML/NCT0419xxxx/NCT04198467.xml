    <textblock>
      Randomized, Double-blind, 12-month, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 100 outpatients
      . Intervention platelet rich plasma( PRP) prepared from 60 ml of blood by adding novel step
      of filtration to manual centrifuge step to achieve 7 times concentration. the efficacy was
      compared with administration of hyaluronic acid. Subjective Womac scores ,6 min pain free
      walking distance as well objective assessments MRI ,synovial fluid assessments were made out
      .Absolute counts of platelets as dose was evaluated to be effective in alleviating symptoms
      in early knee OA.

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) causes substantial physical disability that limits a person ability to
      indulge in daily activities. OA related disability has been affecting millions of older
      adults throughout the world, and the number has almost doubled in 2019.

      Though the process of OA could not be reversed, efficient management strategies could help in
      minimizing primary pain with physical exercises, surgical procedures, and medications.

      Prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been dramatically
      associated with mild to severe side effects, limiting its continuous use. Chondro-protective
      agents (CPAs) have been proven to provide only minimal symptomatic benefit. Platelet-rich
      plasma (PRP) has emerged as a supreme therapy in OA knee however exact dose ,preparation and
      duration of benefit still remains unclear.

      Study was undertaken to demonstrate the potential of leukocyte depleted PRP in cartilage
      repair of knee OA using WOMAC scores as subjective assessment tool.

      Our research also evaluated objective criteria ing joint space width (JSW),cartilage
      thickness on MRI, Ultrasound that would improve knee joint function in patients with knee OA.

    <intervention_model_description>182 patients screened, 100 were considered eligible for the study and were randomized. The most common reason for exclusion was either the lack of radio graphic evidence of knee OA or the presence of severe disease with JSW less than 2 mm at the narrowest point.
Out of the 100 randomized patients, roughly equal numbers, six patients in PRP and 7 in placebo, did not complete the study. Reasons for withdrawal were personal,inefficacy, or adverse event as an increase in pain.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>baseline and at one year</time_frame>
    <description>Using the 1.5-T field strength with standard MRI acquisition protocols, MRI was performed of each joint individually in coronal, sagittal, and transverse planes. The maximum thickness of the cartilage at posterior,meniscal and patellar level measured at the midsagittal plane through the medial condyle was considered. The medial femoral cartilage of the affected knee was chosen for measurement.</description>

             College of Rheumatology for the diagnosis of symptomatic primary knee OA, with pain
             Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of &gt;3 in the previous month. In cases where both the
             knees were symptomatic, the knee which was comparatively more painful was considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of secondary knee OA because of injury, inflammatory or metabolic rheumatic
             disease, or osteonecrosis;

          2. Prior intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (HA), including lavage and
             corticosteroids within the previous three months;
