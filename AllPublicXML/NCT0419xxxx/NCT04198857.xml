      Adequate control and management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy is
      critical to mitigate its short- and long-term health consequences in women and their
      children, and may serve as a key strategy to curb the escalating type 2 diabetes epidemic in
      low and middle income countries (LMICs). Taking a user-centered design approach, here the
      study investigators propose to develop a culturally-appropriate smartphone application (app)
      to support self-management of GDM, and additionally, test its usability and preliminary
      efficacy, among patients in a sub-urban hospital setting in Nepal. App-based lifestyle
      interventions for GDM management are not common, especially in LMICs where its prevalence is
      rapidly increasing, and as such, study findings will have important public health relevance
      for a broader population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is rapidly increasing worldwide,
      particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Tight glycemic control via diet and
      lifestyle modification is critical to treating GDM and preventing its adverse health
      consequences, including increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), in women and their children.
      However, in many resource-limited countries including Nepal, time for diet/lifestyle
      counseling often competes with other components of antenatal care. Mobile health (mHealth)
      technology can be leveraged to promote healthy behaviors, and support self-management and
      treatment of GDM, but this approach has not been tried previously in any LMICs. Taking a
      user-centered design approach, here the study investigators propose to develop a
      culturally-appropriate smartphone application (app) to support self-management of GDM (mGDM),
      and test its usability and preliminary efficacy, among patients in a tertiary level,
      university hospital of Kathmandu University, Nepal. Based on the Social Cognitive Theory
      framework for behavior change, this app will assist in self-management of GDM by increasing
      the patient's knowledge and self-efficacy to adhere to the recommended diet and physical
      activity regimens. The app will also help clinicians by generating easily digestible visual
      displays of patient data and behaviors, which can aid in their clinical decision-making and
      counseling. In the requirements gathering phase, 6 GDM patients will be recruited into a
      focus group to view paper prototypes and provide feedback on its features and functions.
      Additional questions will be asked about their perceived barriers, facilitators, and
      strategies for lifestyle modification. Key informant interviews will also be conducted with 5
      clinicians (gynecologists, dietician, physical therapist) and 3 family members, asking them
      to provide feedback on the mGDM prototype, especially pertaining to the usefulness and format
      of the graphic summaries of patient data. After revising paper prototypes and developing the
      first digital prototype, six additional patients with GDM will be recruited for two rounds of
      usability testing including think-aloud protocol and focus group discussions. Final prototype
      will be developed following an iterative process of product design and user testing. After
      developing the app, the investigators will recruit 60 women who are newly diagnosed with GDM,
      and randomly assign them to one of two treatment conditions: either (A) mGDM app + standard
      care, or (B) standard care alone, from 28 weeks of gestation to delivery. In this
      proof-of-concept trial, feasibility outcomes will be app usage, self-monitoring adherence,
      and app usability and acceptability. Exploratory treatment outcomes will be glycemic control
      measures at 6 weeks postpartum, neonatal birthweight, and rates of labor induction and
      caesarean delivery. Findings from the proposed study will empirically inform a future
      randomized control trial that will be fully powered to test the efficacy and
      cost-effectiveness of the mGDM app in improving treatment outcomes.

    <description>Standard care for GDM will be modifying diet and increasing exercise. Participants will have consultations with a dietitian and a physical therapist to develop a diet and physical activity plan based on pre-pregnancy weight and disease severity. In addition to verbal information about managing GDM with diet and physical activity, patients will be provided with leaflets and brochures. As per the standard care protocol, GDM patients will be asked to visit the OPD for glucose testing every two weeks, and after each testing, blood glucose levels will be recorded in paper booklets assigned to each patient. Additionally, women will be encouraged to buy a glucometer and do a daily blood glucose testing at home, if feasible. The OB/GYN physicians will monitor the blood glucose levels across testing, and will prescribe oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin to the patient if needed.</description>

    <description>We will use a user-centered design approach to develop a mobile app for GDM (mGDM) that matches the needs and technological sophistication of the target users. The goal of the app would be to assist patients in self management of GDM by improving their adherence to the recommended diet and physical activity regimens. The app will also help clinicians by generating easily digestible visual displays of patient data and behaviors, which can aid in their clinical decision-making and counseling</description>
