  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As previously reported (IJC Heart &amp; Vasculature 2017; 17: 11.), our epidemiological analysis
      showing high incidence of cancers in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases as
      compared with those with non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases may imply a clinical
      possibility of a role of atherosclerosis in cancer developments. In the present study, to
      address our hypothesis that cancer developments may come with a strength of atherosclerosis,
      we traced an incidence of cancers in a total of 8,856 patients with coronary artery diseases
      (CAD) for a median follow-up of 1,095 days (interquartile range, 719-1,469 days) using the
      Sakakibara Health Integrative Profile (SHIP) database.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In accordance with a presence or absence of poly-arterial diseases such as aortic and/or
      peripheral artery diseases as an indicator of a strength of atherosclerosis, an incidence of
      cancers and all-cause death in two cohorts of 8,140 patients with CAD-only and 716 with CAD
      with poly-arterial diseases were evaluated to track an incidence of cancers and ali-cause
      mortality during median follou-up periods of 3 to 4 years.
