  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to determine whether the race and gender of a simulated doctor
      affected analog patients' reported confidence and satisfaction in the simulated doctor's
      diagnosis and treatment plan. The study used two randomized patient analog experiments.

      This study is complete and pre-analysis plans (PAPs) for each experiment were published prior
      to data collection. The PAPs are available at: http://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=43xj25
      (Study 1) and https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=369st7 (Study 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior literature is unclear on whether patients display bias in their evaluations of
      physicians based on their race or gender. The investigators estimated the effects of
      physician race and gender using an online clinical vignette. Participants played the role of
      analog patients reporting to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptoms consistent with
      gastroenteritis. Participants were provided with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis by a
      simulated ED physician. The race (black or white) and gender (male or female) of the
      simulated physician was randomly assigned in a 2x2 factorial experiment. Simulated physicians
      provided a diagnosis of gastroenteritis and contradicted by an Online Symptom Checker.
      Following the physician's diagnosis and contradiction by the Online Symptom Checker,
      participants rated the simulated physician on survey measures of satisfaction and confidence
      in both the treatment plan and diagnosis. The main (null) hypothesis tested was that there
      were no differences across the four treatment arms (Black Female, Black Male, White Female,
      White Male). Participants for the first experiment (Study 1) were recruited from Amazon
      Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and participants for the second experiment (Study 2) were recruited
      from Lucid.

      Primary Aim: To determine whether the race and gender of a simulated physician had a causal
      effect on participants' confidence and satisfaction in the physician's diagnosis and
      treatment plan in an ED setting.

      Exploratory Aims: To determine whether the race and gender of a simulated physician had a
      casual effect on participants' perceptions of the warmth and competence of the physician,
      their willingness to sue or complain about the physician for an incorrect diagnosis, and
      their perceived fairness of the charge for the visit.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 2x2 experimental design. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four possible conditions: Black Female, Black Male, White Female, White Male. Within each condition, subjects were randomly assigned 1 of 10 possible putative doctors from a total of 40 putative doctors, 10 for each condition. For example, 10 Black Female doctors, etc. The images of putative physicians were selected from actors in the Chicago Face Database and altered to wear a white coat. Given that the vast majority of Emergency Physicians in the United States are white men, the White Males condition served as the &quot;control&quot;.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Patient Confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;How confident are you that this doctor made the correct diagnosis?&quot; Study 1: [not at all confident (0) to completely confident (100)] Study 2: [not at all confident (1) to completely confident (5)]*
&quot;How confident are you that this doctor made the correct treatment plan?&quot; Study 1: [not at all confident (0) to completely confident (100)] Study 2: [not at all confident (1) to completely confident (5)]*
The Patient Confidence outcome for each study participant was the unweighted average of their ratings on questions a and b. In Study 1, this item was measured using 0-100 point scales. In Study 2, this outcome was measured using 5 point scales. For all analyses, these Patient Confidence outcomes from a and b were rescaled to match the 1-5 point range from Study 2.</description>

*In Study 1, the Patient Satisfaction was measured using a 0-100 point scale. In Study 2, this was measured using a 10 point scale. For all analyses, this Patient Satisfaction outcome from Study 1 was rescaled to match the 0-10 point range in Study 2.</description>

    <description>&quot;You take the doctor's advice and go home. Over the next few days, the pain in your abdomen got worse and you returned to the hospital where you were diagnosed with appendicitis. Your appendix had burst and you developed a serious infection. This required emergency surgery and an extended stay in the hospital's intensive Care Unit&quot;*
&quot;Would you file a complaint against this doctor?&quot; [5 = &quot;Definitely&quot;; 4 = &quot;Probably&quot;; 3 = &quot;Might or might not&quot;; 2 = &quot;Probably not&quot;; 1 = &quot;Definitely not&quot;]
&quot;Would you consider suing this doctors?&quot; [5 = &quot;Definitely&quot;; 4 = &quot;Probably&quot;; 3 = &quot;Might or might not&quot;; 2 = &quot;Probably not&quot;; 1 = &quot;Definitely not&quot;]
Willingness to sue or complain was only measured in Study 2.</description>
