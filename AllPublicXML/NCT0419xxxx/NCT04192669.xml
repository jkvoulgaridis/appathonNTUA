  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart rate (HR) is regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and results from a
      balance between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that accelerates the heart rate and the
      parasympathetic nervous system that slows the HR via the vagus nerve.

      Low HRV is linked to poor emotional and cognitive regulation. Values for HRV are generally
      lower in depressed patients.

      The aim of this study is to determine how HRV could be a clinical marker that can be used in
      routine psychiatry practice in patients with anxio-depressive disorders, to determine the
      severity of symptoms and the degree of response to treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline (day of inclusion of the patient in the study).</time_frame>
    <description>The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is an introspective psychological inventory consisting of 22 items pertaining to occupational burnout. All MBI items are scored using a 7 level frequency scale from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;daily.&quot; Initial development had 3 components: emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5 items) and personal achievement (8 items). Each scale measures its own unique dimension of burnout. Scales should not be combined to form a single burnout scale.</description>

    <description>The Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences (RMSSD) is one of a few time-domain tools used to assess heart rate variability, the successive differences being neighboring RR intervals. It reflects the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (day of inclusion of the patient in the study).</time_frame>
    <description>Spectral analysis of the RR interval is an indirect, noninvasive measurement tool of heart rate variability. High-frequency RR signals (0.15 to 0.4 Hz) reflect a parasympathetic activity and thus an influence of the vagal nerve on the heart. A high frequency heart variability is associated with a better perception of emotions and with pro-social behaviors.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (day of inclusion of the patient in the study).</time_frame>
    <description>The TAS is a 20-item instrument that is one of the most commonly used measures of alexithymia. Alexithymia refers to people who have trouble identifying and describing emotions and who tend to minimise emotional experience and focus attention externally. The TAS-20 uses cutoff scoring: equal to or less than 51 = non-alexithymia, equal to or greater than 61 = alexithymia. Scores of 52 to 60 = possible alexithymia.</description>

    <intervention_name>Heart rate monitoring</intervention_name>
    <description>The heart rate will be recorded and calculated by a heart rate monitor (Polar H10, Finland) located on the chest. The recording is done over a period of 5 minutes, the patient being in a sitting position, without any particular stimulus, in a quiet room. The recording is transferred via the HRV Logger application. Any ectopic beats and artifacts are automatically identified and replaced by values interpolated by the investigator, if necessary. The Kubios HRV Premium Software is used for all calculations.</description>
