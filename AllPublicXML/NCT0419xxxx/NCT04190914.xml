  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotic primary molars in preschool children will be treated with the regeneration concept
      to provide a healthy biological environment within the root canal system and regression in
      clinical signs and symptoms which are the primary outcomes of regeneration treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A convenient sample of preschool children have a necrotic primary second molar randomly
      allocated to one of the 3 study groups which are: group A (control) treated by the
      conventional treatment ( pulpectomy followed by stainless steel crown SSC), group B: treated
      by regeneration using triple antibiotic paste followed by SSC), group 3:(treated by
      regeneration using calcium hydroxide with iodoform(metapex) followed by SSC.

      the 3 groups were evaluated at baseline, 6 months and 12 months for clinical and radiographic
      success.
