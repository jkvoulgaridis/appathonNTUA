  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is a highly effective treatment for patients with symptomatic
      hip osteoarthritis. The surgical approach in THA is important as it influences postoperative
      clinical recovery, functional outcomes, and implant positioning [1]. The evolution of
      surgical techniques in THA has led to the development of minimally invasive surgery, which is
      performed through smaller skin incisions, reduced soft tissue disruption and greater muscle
      preservation [2-10]. This prospective, randomised control study compares clinical and
      radiological outcomes in THA performed using the standard posterior approach (PA) and its
      less invasive modification, the direct superior approach (DSA). The study will include 80
      patients with hip osteoarthritis undergoing THA. Following informed consent, patients will be
      randomised to one of the two treatment groups, and undergo THA using either the PA or DSA.
      The control group includes patients undergoing THA through the PA while the investigation
      group includes patients undergoing THA with the DSA. A further 25 patients randomly selected
      from each treatment group will undergo radiosteriometric analysis (RSA) to assess differences
      in early implant migration between PA and DSA groups.

      Clinical and radiological outcomes of interest will be recorded by blinded observers at
      regular intervals for 2 years after surgery. The findings of this study will enable an
      improved understanding of differences in postoperative clinical recovery, functional
      outcomes, and implant positioning in THA performed using the DSA compared to the PA approach.
