    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO)
      telementoring intervention works in transforming professional engagement, practice
      efficiency, and community building through team meetings in diagnostic imaging clinicians.
      This study may help researchers learn more about the potential benefits of a model for team
      meetings aimed at bringing physicians together from multiple practice locations when few
      opportunities exist for meaningful, collegial interactions. It may also help diagnostic
      imaging clinicians engage more effectively with colleagues at distant sites and become more
      engaged with their work.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the feasibility of the proposed anti-burnout intervention for faculty at MD
      Anderson, defined as at least 35/50 of participants each attending at least 9 out of 13
      sessions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore any changes in burnout, measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and
      Mini-Z surveys.

      II. To explore any changes in the self-reported health status of participants, as measured by
      the RAND Short-Form 36 (SF36) survey.

      III. To understand participants' perception of the benefits and usefulness of the
      intervention, measured by the customized Globalized Perception/Impression of Benefits Survey.

      IV. To define methods for improving the intervention, based on participants' feedback
      following each session.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Participants attend ECHO telementoring sessions over 1 hour weekly for 13 weeks.

      ARM B: Participants are placed on a wait-list for 13 weeks and then attend ECHO telementoring
      sessions over 1 hour weekly for 13 weeks.
