  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation with pulmonary vein (PV) isolation is a commonly performed strategy
      employed for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The conventional approach for
      post-procedure care has been for the patient to stay overnight and be discharged the next
      day. However, the overall incidence of procedure related complications of catheter ablation
      for atrial fibrillation in high volume centers is low. New technologies have been introduced
      and improve the safety of the ablation procedure. Discharging patients the same day after
      ablation is a practice that's currently followed by many centers in the United States and
      abroad. The investigators' hypothesis is that the currently available advanced technologies
      allow for the same-day safe discharge of patients after catheter ablation. The investigators
      propose a prospective single-arm study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the same-day
      discharge after AF ablation at MGH. The protocol of same-day discharge will include the use
      of a commercially available venous closure device, early ambulation, bed-side echocardiogram,
      and follow-up phone calls at day 1 and 3 post-procedure.
