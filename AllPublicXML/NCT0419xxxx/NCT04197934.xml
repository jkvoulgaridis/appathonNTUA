      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of WSD0922-FU for the treatment of
      glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to the
      central nervous system (central nervous system metastases). WSD0922-FU is a targeted
      treatment which blocks the EGFR protein - a strategy that has led to a lot of benefit in
      patients with many different cancers. WSD0922-FU may also be able to get into cancers in the
      brain and spinal cord and help patients with brain and spinal cord cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      of EGFR/EGFRvIII inhibitor WSD0922-FU (WSD0922-FU) in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma,
      IDH wildtype (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH wildtype (AA) and central nervous system
      (CNS) metastases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to
      WSD0922-FU.

      II. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial overall response rate (ORR),
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to Response Assessment in
      Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for GBM/AA and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 for NSCLC.

      III. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial disease control rate (DCR)
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and
      RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.

      IV. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial duration of response (DOR)
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and
      RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.

      V. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial progression-free survival
      (PFS) and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA
      and RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.

      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the presence and/or identity of the drug metabolites of WSD0922-FU, and the
      concentrations of these in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tumor.

      II. To assess plasma concentration of WSD0922-FU and metabolite SN16110801P1 and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters after single and multiple doses of WSD0922-FU.

      III. To assess the brain tumor pharmacokinetics of WSD0922-FU and SN16110801P1 after a single
      dose of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion - Brain tumor penetration [BTP] cohort only).

      IV. To assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of WSD0922-FU and SN16110801P1 after
      multiple doses of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion - NSCLC leptomeningeal metastases [NSCLC LM]
      cohort only).

      V. To explore the impact of tumor markers (e.g. MGMT promoter methylation, EGFR mutation
      [including EGFR vIII], PTEN deletion, TP53 mutation, etc.) on clinical parameters associated
      with WSD0922-FU treatment.

      VI. To evaluate and measure pharmacodynamic biomarkers of inhibition of EGFR and downstream
      signals in tumor samples after a single dose of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion Cohort - BTP
      cohort only).

      VII. To evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of single dose of WSD0922-FU in
      plasma (Dose Expansion - NSCLC LM cohort only).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      DOSE ESCALATION: Patients receive WSD0922-FU orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      DOSE EXPANSION: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients with GBM/AA receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients with BTP receive a single dose of WSD0922-FU prior to surgery. Patients
      then undergo surgical resection of brain tumor. After surgery, patients receive WSD0922-FU PO
      BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT III: Patients with NSCLC LM receive WSD0922-FU PO on days 1 and 4 of cycle 0. Patients
      then receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, then every 2
      months until progressive disease, at progressive disease, and then every 3 months after
      progressive disease for up to 5 years.

                  is the longer, prior to registration (if sufficient wash-out time has not
                  occurred due to schedule or PK properties, an alternative appropriate wash-out
                  time based on known duration and time to reversibility of drug related adverse
                  events could be agreed upon by the Investigator and Wayshine)

             prescribed regimens including uncontrolled hypertension and active bleeding diatheses,
             which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to
             participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.
