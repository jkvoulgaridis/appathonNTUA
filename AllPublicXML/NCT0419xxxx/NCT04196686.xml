    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different technologies, Virtual
      Reality and Augmented Reality with modifications as passive content, active content,
      cognitive load modulation, and positive encouragement coaching to increase the pain threshold
      as assessed by immersing a hand in ice water.
