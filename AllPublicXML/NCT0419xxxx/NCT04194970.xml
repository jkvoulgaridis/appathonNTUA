  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, prospective, double-blind study: Avascular, an√∂ral and non-regenerative cartilage
      tissue mostly repaired via arthroscopic surgeries. After that, the patients rehabilitate with
      optimum weight bearing protocols in post-operative and discharge periods by physiotherapists.
      In the post-operative period, optimum weight bearing is vital for this tissue healing. There
      is not any opportunity or device to follow up the compliance of patients to weight bearing.
      We aimed to develop a device with mobile application to monitor the compliance the patients
      to weight bearing protocols. This device is designed to could give negative live feedback
      (with visual audible and vibrating warnings) in order to ensure the compliance of patients.
      Thanks to the device, health professionals will also have the opportunity to monitor the
      patient's compliance with the protocol on a daily basis. We hypothesized that patients
      monitored with this device may have a better recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cartilage tissue, reduces the friction forces in the joints and distributes loads on the
      joints, is damaged by aging, trauma exposure and degeneration. This tissue is avascular,
      aneural and non-regenerative. To repair the damaged cartilage tissue arthroplasty method is
      mostly chosen and the surgery of talus osteochondral lesions is mostly performed type among
      them. In the post-operative period, optimum weight bearing is vital for this tissue healing.
      Optimum weight bearing means that the repaired tissue is loaded by a weight which is in
      between specific percentage of the body weight. During the healing process, educating and
      compliance of the patients about optimum weight bearing in hospital and after discharge it is
      difficult to ensure continuity of compliance. At that point the clinical problem arises in
      terms of teaching the patients the preferred weight bearing percentages (protocols) and their
      compliance on weight bearing protocols both in hospitalization and home care period. There is
      not any opportunity or device to follow up the compliance of patients to weight bearing
      protocols after discharge. A research stated that as the pain symptom decreases, the
      compliance of patients to optimum weight bearing protocols disappear in home care period even
      if they had adhered the taught protocol at the clinic. The loss of compliance in the
      postoperative rehabilitation phase can delay repaired tissue healing and often revision
      surgery be necessary. This situation necessitated the follow-up of the patients by the
      physiotherapist using the live-feedback systems. For this purpose, we aimed to develop an
      android mobile application (system) that will work synchronized with pressure sensors placed
      under an insole (device). The producing and effectiveness research of mentioned device will
      consist of two stages. At the first stage will be about product development and testing with
      volunteer healthy participants. At the second stage named as testing its applicability on
      patients. The patients will be randomized to two group as Group I (rehabilitate with
      live-feedback system) and Group II (rehabilitate via system without live- feedback) to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the live-feedback and mentioned system. The volunteer patients
      will be evaluated each day, in term of compliance with the weight bearing protocol for 6
      weeks. The American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Society, Ankle-hindfoot (AOFAS-AHF) scoring will be
      administered to each patient on preoperative day and 6 weeks after surgery in order to be
      evaluate assess the effectiveness of clinical recovery. We expect, thanks to this live
      feedback system, the health professionals to be capable of determining and monitoring of
      patients' weight bearing percentages to the body weight during their healing process. Also,
      the patient will be alerted by the system with visual audible and vibrating warnings, if
      non-compliance with the weight bearing protocol. Thus, patients can do their own follow-up
      without a health professional. In this way, continuity of compliance could be ensured. We
      hypothesized that the development of the insole is expected to help overcome the clinical
      difficulties encountered during the rehabilitation process and reduce the need for revision
      operations.

    <description>American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society- Ankle hindfoot scale will be used for this evaluation. The scale includes nine items that can be divided into three sub-scales (pain, function and alignment). Pain consists of one item with a maximal score of 40 points, indicating no pain. Function consists of seven items with a maximal score of 50 points, indicating full function. Alignment consists of one item with a maximal score of 10 points, indicating good alignment. The maximal score is 100 points, indicating no symptoms or impairments. This scale will be used for evaluation the clinical recovery of osteochondral lesion of talus post operative patients.</description>

    <description>Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS-Pain): a pain rating scale based on self-reported measures of symptoms. A 10cm line numbered from 0 to 10 represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; (zero) and &quot;worst pain&quot; (ten). It can also be interpreted as a 0-to-100 points score.
This scale will be used for assessment of patient's pain levels after activity and at rest</description>

    <description>MarWAS is a product that can monitor the pressure under the foot and provide live feedback (if this option activated) to the user in case of exceeding the specified limits. Its components are insole with pressure sensors and mobile applications (IOS, Android). Post-operative patients (osteochondral lesion of the talus) will be monitored with the MarWAS product in case live feedback is turned on. We aimed to ensure the compliance of patients to specified weight bearing limits. We will follow up this grup for 6 weeks periods with MarWAS. Pre-op. and post-op 6 week, we evaluate the patients in case of ankle function, pain with The American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS) Scoring. Also we will monitor the compliance success of patients with MarWAS during 6 week. The relationship with compliance to weight bearing success and AOFAS scores will be evaluate.</description>

After surgery, we will educate the patients about weight bearing protocol on post-op first day and post op 3 week. The protocol is &quot; first 3 weeks, %0 body weight bearing (BWB), second 3 weeks between %10-%20 BWB&quot;. Patients' compliance to BWB protocol will be monitored daily with the MarWAS product in case live-feedback is turned off. Pre-op and post-op 6 week, we evaluate the patients in case of ankle function, pain with The American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS) Scoring.
