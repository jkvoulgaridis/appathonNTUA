  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare between the lingually based triangular
      flap with the buccally based triangular flap in the surgical removal of impacted mandibular
      third molars.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many flap designs used for impacted third molar surgery do not place the mucoperosteal
      incision on sound bone, as they involve incisions that are placed on the extraction socket
      resulting in higher incidence of mucosal dehiscence, followed by secondary wound healing

      This study involved 20 patient with bilaterally mesially angulated impacted third molar
      (class II position B). One side was surgically removed using the lingually based triangular
      flap and the other side was surgically removed using the bucally based triangular flap

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was assessed through on a 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). (0-1= None, 2-4= Mild, 5-7= Moderate, 8-10= Severe)</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Edema</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>For the objective evaluation of swelling, five distances were measured
The distance from the mandibular angle to the lateral corner of the mouth
The distance from the mandibular angle to the nasal alar curvature
The distance from the mandibular angle to the lateral canthus of the eye
The distance from the tragus to the soft tissue pogonion
The distance from the tragus to the lateral corner f the mouth</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trismus Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Trismus was assessed by measuring the maximum inter-incisional opening (in millimeters) the distance between the incisal edge of the upper and lower central incisor using caliber.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound healing/ Presence of alveolar osteitis</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) will be determined clinically using BLUM'S criteria. Wound healing was assessed and recorded depending on the absence or presence of dehiscence, every opening along the incision will be recorded as dehiscence , dental tweezers will be used to identify it.</description>

    <description>A lingually based triangular flap was used to remove the impacted third molar. An incision was made adjacent to the distal surface of the mandibular second molar and extended along the sulcus to the distobuccal corner of the mandibular second molar, an oblique vestibular incision was made and extended into the vestibular fornix of the mandible. Aligned with the mesiobuccal cusp of the second molar.
It was continued posterosuperior towards the anterior border of the mandibular ramus An incision will be made from the anterior border of the mandibular ramus to the distal surface of the mandibular second molar.</description>

    <description>The impacted teeth was removed using a buccal based triangular flap. It will be extended along the sulcus to the distobuccal corner of the second molar . The incision was continuous, with a relieving vertical incision, oblique into the mandibular vestibular fornix, aligned with the mesiobuccal cusp of the second molar.</description>
