  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent peer-reviewed observational evidence suggests that school children receive anywhere
      from 10-33 minutes of seated lunch time and that students with less time to eat discard
      higher amounts of milk, entr√©e (i.e. protein items), grains, and vegetables. This waste is a
      missed nutritional and food security opportunity and also negatively impacts the environment.
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the impact that lunch time constraints have on child
      food selection, consumption and waste behaviors using a crossover trial design, where lunch
      periods are randomly allocated to be either 20 minutes or 30 minutes each day.
