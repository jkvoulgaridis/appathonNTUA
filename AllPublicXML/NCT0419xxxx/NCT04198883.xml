      The purpose of the pilot study is to evaluate the safety and the individual efficacy of the
      use of ProtheraCytes® in patients with acute myocardial infarction and decreased ejection
      fraction. CD34+ cells will be re-injected using a dedicated catheter pushed through the
      femoral artery up to the left ventricle, thus avoiding open chest surgery.

      Primary Objective : The objective is to establish the safety of the interventional procedure
      beginning at the first G-CSF administration to 6 months after the injection of autologous
      expanded CD34+ stem cells (ProtheraCytes®) in AMI patients with a LVEF≤45% after PTCA and
      stent(s) implantation.

      Secondary Objective : The objective is to establish the individual efficacy of the
      interventional procedure beginning at the first G-CSF administration to 6 months after the
      injection of autologous expanded CD34+ stem cells (ProtheraCytes®) in AMI patients with a
      LVEF≤45% after PTCA and stent(s) implantation.
