    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a randomized trial including a 3-month single-arm part and a 6-month
      extension phase.

        -  Following randomization between the 1st group and 2nd group, a 2-week baseline period in
           open-loop for 148 adults and 30 adolescents will be performed. Patients will receive the
           standard of care treatment including their usual subcutaneous insulin pump augmented
           with continuous glucose measurement with Dexcom G6.

        -  Then, a 3-month study phase will be performed during 12 weeks:

             -  1st group (111 adults randomized from 148 adults and 30 adolescents) will receive
                the treatment via the Closed-loop System (closed-loop condition).

             -  2nd group (37 adult controls randomized from 148 adults) will receive the standard
                of care treatment including their usual subcutaneous insulin pump augmented with
                continuous glucose measurement with Dexcom G6 (open loop condition).

        -  An extension period of 6 months with the Closed-loop System (closed-loop condition) will
           be performed at the end of the study phase for all patients enrolled.
