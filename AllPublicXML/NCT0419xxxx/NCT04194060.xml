  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares 2 different ways of perioperative management in patients of peptic
      perforation. Experimental arm is the ERAS arm( Enhanced recovery after surgery) and the
      comparative arm is Conventional arm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the conventional approach to perioperative management can potentially prolong the post
      operative hospital stay, ERAS(Enhanced recovery after surgery), a multi-modal and
      multispeciality approach to perioperative management may reduce the length of hospital stay.
      In the preoperative period, patients will be counselled regarding the operative procedure and
      particulars of the perioperative management.In the intra-operative period short acting
      general anesthetic agents and short acting muscle relaxants will be used.Intravenous fluid
      administration will be goal directed. After the operative procedure, bilateral rectus sheath
      block will be administered. Patient will also receive post-operative nausea and vomiting
      prophylaxis. Nasogastric tube will be removed immediately after the operative procedure. In
      the post operative period, patients will be encouraged to ambulate early. Enteral nutrition
      will be initiated as early as possible. Indwelling catheters will be removed in the early
      post-operative procedure.

    <time_frame>Post operative period - at day of discharge, at one month follow up and at third month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life assessment will be done using EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (Euroqol 5 dimensions and 5 levels). It has 2 components, descriptive and objective. Descriptive component comprises of 5 dimensions which are mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels, namely no problem, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Objective component is also called Euroqol visual analog scale. Score ranges from zero to hundred.The endpoints are labelled as 'the best health participant can imagine' and 'the worst health participant can imagine'. It will be assessed on the day of discharge, follow up at one month and follow up at third month in the post operative period.</description>
