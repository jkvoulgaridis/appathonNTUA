    <textblock>
      Since over 50% of the US population have gingivitis, mouthrinses serve as a valuable adjunct
      to brushing and flossing. The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of the oral
      rinse in reducing plaque and gingivitis and improve a patient's breath

      This clinical study design is a randomized, double-blind, single-treatment, parallel design
      with a placebo as the control. Following a screening exam, the duration of the trial will be
      1 month. Oral examinations will occur at Visit 1 (baseline), and Visit 2 (4 weeks post
      screening). Also, at these visits, subjects will be asked keep a diary for the one month and
      their thoughts about the effect of the mouthrinse on their breath and their mouth feeling of
      &quot;freshness&quot;. They will also be asked about the taste and consistency of the mouth rinse.
      Plaque accumulation will be measured by the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein method
      of quantifying plaque formulation (PI). Gingival health will be measured using the Modified
      Gingival Index (MGI)
