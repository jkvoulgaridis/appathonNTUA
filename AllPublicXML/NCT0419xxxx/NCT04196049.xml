    <description>Patients with massive subretinal hemorrhage from age related macular degeneration and organized subretinal blood clot were managed by inferior retinectomy. The subretinal organized blood clot was dragged to the preretinal space and removed by fragmatome. The retinal was reattached with perfluorocarbon liquid and laser was applied at the margin of retinectomy. Silicon oil was infused at the end of surgery.</description>
