      The investigators will test the central hypotheses according to the following Specific Aims:

      Aim 1. Determine if an individually prescribed exercise program initiated within the first
      week of mild traumatic brain injury can reduce the risk of developing persistent
      post-concussion symptoms relative to usual care. The investigators hypothesize that the
      exercise group will have a lower risk of developing persistent post-concussion symptoms than
      the usual care group.

      Aim 2. Examine the effect of a two-month exercise program on psycho-social, pain
      interference, and sleep outcomes following mild traumatic brain injury. The investigators
      hypothesize the exercise group will report lower anxiety, depression, and pain interference
      ratings, and higher peer relationship and sleep quality ratings two months of exercise
      following mild traumatic brain injury compared to usual care.

      The long-term research goal of the proposed study is to develop individualized sub-symptom
      exercise prescriptions for youth who sustain mild traumatic brain injury that can help to
      alleviate mild traumatic brain injury symptoms, reduce the risk of persistent post-concussion
      symptoms, and improve psychosocial outcomes. The overall objectives of this application are
      to prospectively (1) determine if a prescribed exercise program initiated within the first
      week of mild traumatic brain injury can reduce the risk of developing persistent
      post-concussion symptoms and (2) examine the effects of an exercise program on psychosocial,
      sleep, and pain outcomes when initiated within 7 days of injury and continued for two months.
      The investigators will address these objectives by testing the central hypotheses that those
      assigned to an exercise intervention will have lower risk of developing persistent
      post-concussion symptoms and will report lower anxiety, depression, and pain interference
      ratings, higher peer relationship ratings, and better sleep quality ratings compared to usual
      care. In order to achieve this, the investigators will use a block stratified randomized
      intervention design. Block stratified randomization procedures will be conducted according to
      standard procedures so that sample numbers are equally assigned to each group, selected due
      to the relatively small sample size of the proposed study. Participants will be identified,
      enrolled, and assessed within 5 days of mild traumatic brain injury, randomized to an
      exercise intervention or usual care group 3-7 days after mild traumatic brain injury, and
      follow-up with in person assessments at approximately one and two months post-injury.

    <time_frame>Baseline (within 1 week of injury), Month 1, Month 2</time_frame>
    <description>A brief generalized quality of life questionnaire. We will calculate the sub-scale scores for the domains of Mobility, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, Peer Relationships, and Pain Interference. Each sub-scale is calculated as a sum of 4 questions, rated from 0-4. Thus, each subscale is from 0-16, where a 16 indicates a greater presence of the domain being measured.</description>

    <description>A brief questionnaire about fear of movement and injury related to returning to sport. The subject answers 18 questions rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). There is a total sum score ranging form 18-72, where a higher score represents more fear of movement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Concussion or mTBI diagnosis by a board-certified Sports Medicine physician, pediatric
             Emergency Medicine physician, general pediatrician physician, or advanced practice
             provider under the direction of a physician. This will be defined in a similar manner
             according to available guidelines: a direct or indirect blow to the head, face, neck,
             or elsewhere that manifests with the presence of symptoms and neurological impairment

          2. Aged 10 - 18 years to ensure a pediatric sample of participants.

          3. A persistent postconcussion symptom risk score â‰¥ 9 to ensure all participants are in
             the high risk of persistent postconcussion symptom category.

          4. A Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory score &gt; 9 to ensure participants have not
             recovered by the time they enroll in the study.

          5. Access to an internet connection (via computer or smart phone) so that physical
             activity and exercise can be tracked via heart rate monitor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent lower extremity injury so that exercise testing results are not confounded
             by other injury.

          2. Aerobic exercise contraindication so that participants are able to complete the
             exercise testing protocol.

          3. Diagnosed mild traumatic brain injury by a healthcare provider within 6 months of
             qualifying injury to ensure that residual effects of prior mild traumatic brain injury
             do not bias the results of our investigation.

          4. Mild traumatic brain injury that results in positive findings on neuroimaging, or
             extra-axial or intraparenchymal bleeds to avoid potential injuries that are more
             severe than mild traumatic brain injury.
