      To evaluate the feasibility of performing EGBD as a treatment of acute calculous

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gold standard for treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis is laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. Recently, gallbladder drainage with EUS-guided gallbladder drainage (EGBD)
      has been described as a treatment option. However, whether this is an effective treatment
      option in surgically fit patients are uncertain.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the feasibility of performing EGBD as a treatment
      of acute calculous cholecystitis in patients that are indicated for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. The investigators hypothesis that the technique is safe and feasible.

    <description>The procedure would be performed with a linear echoendoscope using a 10mm x 10mm or a 15 x 10mm stent. The distal flange of the stent would be deployed under EUS guidance, followed by deployment of the proximal flange under endoscopic guidance. Once deployed, the gallbladder would be completely emptied by suction and irrigation until the effluent through the stent is clean.</description>
