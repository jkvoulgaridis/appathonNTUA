  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the investigators continue to work on better understanding Misophonia, it is also
      important to identify treatments that can help people who are currently suffering. Further,
      it is important that the treatments provided are acceptable to the people who receive them.
      In this study, participants will complete one of two treatments the investigators believe can
      help manage symptoms of Misophonia: The Unified Protocol or process-based therapy. Both
      treatments will use evidence-based psychological principles (e.g., managing attention or
      behavior) in a flexible manner and will focus on developing skills to help reduce the
      distress and impairment associated with Misophonia. The aims of this study are (1) to explore
      the acceptability and feasibility of these treatments for individuals who experience
      Misophonia and (2) to examine whether these treatments help reduce symptoms associated with
      Misophonia.

    <measure>Number of patients that are satisfied with treatment as measured by the credibility and expectancy questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CEQ is a 6-item measure that asks patients about their perceptions of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients who indicate treatment was acceptable to them (i.e., the treatment approach made sense and was perceived as reasonable)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This form has two questions that assess how satisfied patients were with treatment and how acceptable treatment was to them. The remaining three items are open ended questions that allow patients to provide narrative feedback about their experience in treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in misophonia symptoms as assessed by the Misophonia Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed weekly, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Misophonia Questionnaire is a 17-item questionnaire that assesses the presence of misophonia symptoms, emotions and behaviors associated with misophonic reactions, and symptom severity. The first two subscales are rated on a scale of 0 (not at all true) to 4 (always true). These two parts are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 - 68. The severity subscale is a single item that asks an individual to provide a rating of their sound sensitivity on a scale from 0 (no sound sensitivities) to 15 (very severe sound sensitivities).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety as measured by the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed weekly, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale is a five item measure that assesses interference and distress related to the experience of anxiety. Items are scored from 0 to 4 and summed to produce a total score (ranging from 0 - 20), with higher scores indicating greater functional impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression as measured by the Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed weekly, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale is a five item measure that assesses interference and distress in an individual's day-to-day life related to the experience of depression. Items are scored from 0 to 4 and summed to produce a total score (ranging from 0 - 20), with higher scores indicating greater functional impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anger as measured by the Clinical Anger Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed weekly, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Anger Scale is a 21-item measure that assesses the severity of anger-related symptoms (e.g., current anger, anger about the future).Items are scored from 0 to 3 and summed to produce a total score (ranging from 0 - 63), with higher scores indicating greater anger-related symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients who use the skills taught in treatment as measured by the Skill Use Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed weekly, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Skill Use Questionnaire is a four-item measure that assesses the extent to which patients use the skills taught in therapy and find them to be helpful.</description>
