    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well CPX-351 or the CLAG-M regimen (consisting of the drugs
      cladribine, cytarabine, G-CSF, and mitoxantrone) works in treating medically less-fit
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia or other high-grade myeloid neoplasms. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as CPX-351, cladribine, cytarabine, G-CSF, and mitoxantrone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving CPX-351 or the CLAG-M regimen
      at doses typically used for medically-fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia may work
      better than reduced doses of CPX-351 in treating medically less-fit patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia or other high-grade myeloid neoplasms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms in a 1:1 fashion. ARM I = CPX-351; ARM II =
      CLAG-M.

      ARM I (INDUCTION): Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3,
      and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a
      response other than an MRDneg CR receive a second course of CPX-351 intravenously IV over 90
      minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM I (POST-REMISSION): Patients who achieve a CR or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery
      (CRi) receive a reduced dose of CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 for up to 4
      additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (INDUCTION): Patients receive cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV
      over 2 hours on days 1-5, G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, and mitoxantrone IV over 60
      minutes on days 1-3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      who achieve a response other than an MRDneg CR receive a second course of cladribine IV over
      2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, G-CSF SC on days 0-5, and
      mitoxantrone IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (POST-REMISSION): Patients who achieve a CR/CRi receive an intermediate dose of
      cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-6 for up to 4 additional courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.

             variants according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Outside
             diagnostic material is acceptable to establish diagnosis; submission of peripheral
             blood specimen for flow cytometry performed at the study institution should be
             considered. Diagnostic material must have been submitted for cytogenetic and/or
             molecular testing as clinically appropriate

          -  Treatment-related mortality (TRM) score &gt;= 13.1 as calculated with simplified model

          -  The use of hydroxyurea before enrollment is permitted; hydroxyurea should be
             discontinued prior to start of study treatment. Patients with symptoms/signs of
             hyperleukocytosis or white blood cells (WBC) &gt; 100,000/uL or with concern for other
             complications of high tumor burden or leukostasis (e.g. hypoxia, disseminated
             intravascular coagulation) can be treated with leukapheresis or may receive up to 2
             doses of cytarabine (up to 500 mg/m^2) any time prior to enrollment

          -  Patients may have received low-intensity treatment (e.g. azacitidine/decitabine,
             lenalidomide, growth factors) for antecedent low-grade myeloid neoplasm (i.e. &lt; 10%
             blasts in blood and bone marrow)

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/mL unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by
             neoplastic cells, Gilbert's syndrome, or hemolysis (assessed within 14 days prior to
             study day 0)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;= 45%, assessed within 12 months prior to
             registration, e.g. by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan or echocardiography or
             another appropriate diagnostic modality

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             beginning at the signing of the consent until at least 4 weeks after the last dose of
             study drug

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not
             considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment

          -  Concomitant illness associated with a likely survival of &lt; 1 year

          -  Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under
             treatment with anti-microbials and/or controlled or stable. Patients with fever
             thought to be likely secondary to leukemia are eligible

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any study drug used in this trial

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Concurrent treatment with any other approved or investigational anti-leukemia agent
