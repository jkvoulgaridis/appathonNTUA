  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in studying why experienced clinicians make specific
      decisions regarding the monitoring of patients' physiological states and why clinicians might
      make decisions that are contrary to current best practices or known evidence. More generally,
      the program objective is to refine and validate a novel methodology to delineate clinicians'
      decision-making strategies. More specifically, the investigators will study the decision to
      reverse neuromuscular blockade at the end of an anesthetic. This clinical decision will be
      studied in this project because: 1) it has been well documented that a substantial percentage
      of practitioners do not follow best practices; 2) the variables are relatively circumscribed
      and well described; and 3) it can be framed as a binary decision.

      The investigators propose to conduct an observational mixed-methods study developing and
      using clinical vignettes and cognitive interviews to better understand the decision-making
      approaches and preferences of clinically active anesthesia providers with regard to their
      decision-making during clinical anesthesia cases. After developing clinical vignettes and
      related questions, the investigators will first obtain detailed demographic and clinical
      practice variables from the participants via a survey. Participants will then review multiple
      vignettes that present different clinical situations that focus on decisions to reverse
      neuromuscular blockade and/or extubate the patient. Each participant will provide their
      decisions for each vignette. The investigators will then conduct an audiotaped interview,
      using cognitive task analysis methods, to ascertain the factors that played a role in these
      decisions.

      The investigators propose to conduct a 3-site prospective observational mixed-methods study
      using clinical vignettes and cognitive interviews to better understand the decision making
      approaches and preferences of practicing community anesthesiologists with regard to the
      management of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade (NMB) at the end of general
      endotracheal anesthesia cases.

      The objectives of this initial study is to begin to understand:

        1. When and why do community anesthesiologists choose to reverse NMB?

        2. What are the decision preferences of community anesthesiologists with regard to their
           decisions to reverse NMB, and what are the clinician and clinical case factors that
           influence those decisions?

        3. What are the operational knowledge gaps of anesthesia professionals with regard to their
           ability to follow best-practice evidence for the reversal of NMB? More generally, the
           program objective is to refine and validate a novel methodology to delineate clinicians'
           decision making strategies and triggers.

      2.1.2. Study Hypotheses

      For this initial study, the investigators hypothesize that:

        1. The clinical vignette-based decision threshold method will describe the distribution of
           values of clinical variables (i.e., decision thresholds) for community
           anesthesiologists' decision to reverse NMB.

        2. There will be measurable differences in participant demographics and practice attributes
           between those who closely follow evidence-based expectations for reversal of NMB and
           those who do not. The investigators expect community practitioners who do not reverse
           NMB in accordance with current best evidence to be older, to not be fellowship trained
           or subspecialty certified, and to practice in lower acuity settings.

      This will be a three-site prospective observational simulation study of 36 experienced
      community anesthesiologists using clinical vignettes and cognitive interviews to better
      understand the decision making approaches and preferences of practicing community
      anesthesiologists with regard to the management of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) at the end of
      general endotracheal anesthesia cases.

      Case presentations to participants will be randomly assigned to vignettes using a Latin
      Square design. Cognitive interview transcript coders and analysts will be blinded to the
      identity and attributes of the participants.

    <description>The average decision threshold is the average across all participant's decision threshold for this measure. The decision threshold is calculated by sequentially varying values of the pharmacological variables (i.e., doses and timing) within the context of a clinical scenario. Each participant's decision threshold is the equivalent of an ED50 or a MAC value (i.e., the equipoise point for their clinical decision based on that variable).</description>
