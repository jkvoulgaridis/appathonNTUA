  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrocnemius spasticity is one of the main complaints in Multiple Sclerosis patients.Local
      muscle vibration is a method used for spasticity inhibition. However, when the studies in the
      literature are examined; It is noted that local vibration applications for spasticity are
      usually single sessions and evaluate the acute effect, do not produce functional outputs,
      there is no consensus on frequency and amplitude and the changes in muscle architecture are
      not examined. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of local vibration applied on
      spastic gastrocnemius on muscle architectural and functional properties in Multiple Sclerosis
      patients in addition to the standard physiotherapy program. The study was planned to include
      3 groups, 2 treatment and 1 control group. The control group will receive standard
      physiotherapy, one of the treatment groups will receive 50 Hz local vibration in addition to
      standard physiotherapy, and other treatment group will receive 100 Hz local vibration in
      addition to standard physiotherapy. Disease severity, gastrocnemius spasticity, architectural
      and viscoelastic properties of muscle, ankle proprioception, balance and gait skills will be
      evaluated before and after 8 weeks treatment program. As a result; effectiveness of local
      vibration in addition to standard physiotherapy program and whether there is a difference
      between applications at different frequencies will be examined.
