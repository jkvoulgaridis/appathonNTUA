    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and tamoxifen with or without vorinostat
      work for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Estrogen can
      cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy with tamoxifen may may fight breast
      cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Vorinostat may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This trial is being done
      to find a drug combination to better control estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and
      reduce the number of pills taken.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To define the role of epigenetic immune priming in a biomarker enriched estrogen receptor
      (ER)+ breast cancer population on the basis of overall response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess duration of response (DOR) 24-week landmark progression-free survival (PFS:24).

      II. Median PFS and overall survival (OS). III. Tumor responses will also be calculated by
      Immune Related Response-Criteria (irRC).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluation of biomarker target threshold on response rate (retrospective cut off of 20%
      versus [vs] 10%).

      II. To assess the ratio of effector T cells: regulatory T cells in blood and tumor biopsies
      pre- and post-therapy.

      III. To evaluate inflammatory T cell signature changes in blood and tumor biopsies pre- and
      post-therapy.

      IV. To evaluate changes in number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in peripheral
      blood and tumor biopsies pre- and posttherapy.

      V. To evaluate changes in histone acetylation in peripheral blood cells and tumor biopsies
      pre- and post-therapy.

      VI. Initial comparison to vorinostat-induced PD-1 in lymphocytes, PD-L1 modulation.

      VII. Nanostring and 10 x sequencing and single cell immune phenotyping (on stored tissue for
      successful arms only).

      VIII. Impact of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition of response to pembrolizumab vs.
      pembrolizumab in biomarker enriched population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, vorinostat
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 days weekly, and tamoxifen PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and tamoxifen PO QD on days
      1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.

    <description>Will be defined as the proportion of participants randomized to that arm whose status is stable disease (SD) or better (complete response (CR), partial response (PR)). The observed ORR will be compared to the respective null (ineffective) rate using the decision rule provided by the Simon's two-stage design. In addition to calculating the ORR, we will calculate the corresponding one-sided 95% confidence interval by appropriately accounting for the Simon's two-stage design.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. Duration of stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. Will use median DOR (computed by the Kaplan-Meier estimator) to summarize. The respective confidence intervals will be computed as well.</description>
