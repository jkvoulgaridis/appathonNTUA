    <textblock>
      Investigation into the use of teriparatide in the treatment of stress fractures.

      Primary outcome is healing on MRI, secondary outcomes are pain, time spent in rehabilitation
      and future stress fractures. This study will help the investigators understand how to treat
      stress fractures in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Teriparatide is a drug that is designed to have a similar effect on the body as parathyroid
      hormone. Parathyroid hormone is made naturally in the body and is released in response to low
      calcium levels. It helps to maintain bone health and repair bone damage. Parathyroid hormone
      and medicines like teriparatide can strengthen bones and are often given to people with
      osteoporosis (a condition that weakens bones, making them more likely to break) to reduce the
      risk of fractures. Recent studies have also shown benefits in people with stress fracture
      injuries, a form of bone damage sometimes caused by repetitive exercise. The investigators
      want to know if teriparatide is also beneficial to healthy, younger people who have a stress
      fracture injury.

One cartridge of 2.4 mL of solution contains 600 micrograms of teriparatide (corresponding to 250 micrograms per mL).
Teriparatide, rhPTH(1-34), produced in E. coli, using recombinant DNA technology, is identical to the 34-N-terminal amino acid sequence of endogenous human parathyroid hormone.</description>
