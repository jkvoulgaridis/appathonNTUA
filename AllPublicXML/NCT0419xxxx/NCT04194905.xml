  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot study will investigate the bioavailability in fasting women of 2 tablet
      formulations containing Levonorgestrel 0.1 mg and Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg.

      The Pilot study will be performed at a single site with 10 subjects. Participants will take 2
      tablets of the test product and reference product in 2 periods and 2 sequences (either test
      after reference or reference after test). There will be a washout of at least 14 days between
      each study period.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of
      Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol of 2 tablet formulations with Levonorgestrel 0.1 mg and
      Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg and to demonstrate bioequivalence of both formulations in terms of
      rate and extent of absorption:

        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andr√≥maco S.A.

        -  Reference Product: Level [Trademark], product of Biolab Sanus Farmaceutica Ltda.

      The 90% confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus
      Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72 hours
      (AUC0-72), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl
      estradiol will be determined.

      Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 36 hours during each study
      period (for 12 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during which pharmacokinetic
      (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 16 blood samples will be taken up to 24 hours after the
      administration in each period. Participants will return to the site to provide additional
      blood samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose.

      The washout period between the two study periods will be at least 14 days. The samples from
      each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods of high performance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to quantify total Levonorgestrel
      and Ethinyl estradiol in plasma.

      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in women by
      collecting adverse events.
