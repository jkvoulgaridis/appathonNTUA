  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the causes of Sickle Cell kidney disease, as well as
      to collect and store samples and information about people with Sickle Cell Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease causes kidney injury over time, but it is not clear why some individuals
      have very significant chronic kidney disease and why some do not. The purpose of this
      research is to study whether having high levels of 'uric acid,' which is a naturally
      occurring molecule in the body that may increase kidney injury and systemic inflammation,
      accelerates the progression of chronic kidney disease over time. Researchers will measure the
      number of participants that have high uric acid levels at the beginning of the study, as well
      as the number of participants that develop new high levels throughout the study. The study
      will also try to determine what causes the high uric acid levels in some patients but not
      others. The results of this study could help understand kidney injury and uric acid in sickle
      cell disease better.
