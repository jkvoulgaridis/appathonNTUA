      This study is intended to evaluate:

        1. Any changes in the gut microbiome from baseline compared to end of study in both healthy
           (HIV-negative) subjects and HIV+ patients with or without chronic diarrhea, following
           one month of treatment with crofelemer (Mytesi), delayed release 125 mg tablets twice
           daily (BID) following one month of treatment.

        2. The safety and tolerability of crofelemer, (Mytesi) delayed release 125 mg tablets BID
           in healthy (HIV-negative) volunteers and HIV+ patients following one month of treatment.

      Mytesi ®(crofelemer) is an FDA-approved anti-diarrheal drug indicated for the symptomatic
      relief of non-infectious diarrhea in adult patients with HIV/AIDS on combination
      anti-retroviral therapy (CART). Crofelemer, a first-in-class intraluminally active,
      use-dependent chloride (Cl-) ion channel modulator that produces an antidiarrheal effect by
      reducing Cl- secretion and the accompanying high-volume fluid secretion into the GI lumen.

      This Phase 4 trial will explore the induced gut microbiome changes in comparison to a group
      of normal healthy volunteers also receiving crofelemer delayed release 125 mg tablets twice
      daily for 30 days.

      This is a non-randomized study. The study will enroll approximately 24 male or female
      subjects aged at least 18 years in three cohorts of approximately 8 subjects each.
