  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design testing the effects of an
      NAD+ precursor (NR) and exercise on VO2max and Si in Friedreich's Ataxia (FA).

      The primary objective of this research is to measure the effect of combination administration
      (NR + exercise) on aerobic capacity (VO2max) in FA. A key secondary objective is to measure
      the effect of combination administration (NR + exercise) on glucose homeostasis (Si) in FA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting 1 in 50,000
      individuals in the U.S. Currently, there is no approved treatment.

      There is a critical knowledge gap regarding the best ways to intervene to increase aerobic
      capacity (VO2max on exercise testing) in FA. Exercise is the most potent known stimulus for
      increasing muscle mass and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity,
      increasing VO2max, and increasing insulin sensitivity (Si), however, it has not been studied
      in FA. One adaptation seen in exercised muscles is an increase in muscle nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide (NAD+), a cofactor required for glycolytic and mitochondrial adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) production. In skeletal- and cardiac muscle-specific frataxin (FXN)
      knock-out animals, NAD+ precursors rescued cardiac function to near-normal, additionally
      highlighting its translational potential in FA. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a NAD+
      precursor currently available as a dietary supplement (Tru Niagen ®, ChromaDex, Irvine CA)
      that is expected to be safe and well-tolerated in adults and children. The central hypothesis
      is that exercise + NR will increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS and increase muscle
      mass to increase VO2max in FA. The investigators expect that exercise + NR will also increase
      Si in this cohort.

    <masking_description>The participants and the investigator team will be blinded as to the group assignment: NR vs Placebo. All collected data (e.g., questionnaires) will be coded, so initial analysis will be conducted without knowledge of the participant's group status.
While the assignment of participants to the exercise groups will not be blinded to the participant or majority of the study team, a designated blinded technician will perform the follow-up Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Testing. Follow-Up Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Testing will be performed by a dedicated blinded study team member, an exercise technician, who will not know if the participant was assigned to an arm including the exercise intervention.</masking_description>

On aerobic training days, subjects will be given instruction on a recumbent Catrike trainer, titrated such that they spend 20 minutes at their target heart rate as determined by baseline Exercise Stress Test (EST) (60-80% of their heart rate at peak VO2) and as measured by their wearable device.
On resistance training days, subjects will be given instructions to complete circuits of resistance exercises. Resistance training intensity (as determined by graded resistance bands) will be maintained at 60% of pre-training maximal voluntary contraction for each muscle group.</description>
