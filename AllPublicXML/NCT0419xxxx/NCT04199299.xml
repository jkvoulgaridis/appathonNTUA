  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some persons with intellectual disability or comprehensive cerebral palsy cannot communicate
      unequivocally how they are, how they react to situations and people, whether they are in pain
      or experience discomfort, anger or fear. Their modes of communication (sounds, grimacing etc)
      may be unintelligible or ambiguous to their caregivers.

      With the use of heart and/or respiration monitors the investigators aim to give these persons
      a means to communicate their immediate reactions or responses. The respiration monitor is
      meant to register sleep at night, so that the participants can communicate whether they have
      slept well or not the previous night.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart rate (HR) is considered to reflect a persons autonomic response to situations, whether
      external (what happens around us) or internal (pain or pleasure, joy or fear). Some persons
      with severe intellectual disability or comprehensive cerebral palsy or childhood autism
      cannot communicate unequivocally, either because they lack the cognitive prerequisites and
      language or because they lack control over their muscles used for speech.

      The investigators believe that these persons, through their heart rate, as registered with a
      commercially available chest belt or wrist watch, may communicate something about their well
      being and their reactions, preferences, aversions and fears.

      Many persons with intellectual disability, comprehensive cerebral palsy or childhood autism
      (the participants in this study) have sleep problems, but these may go unnoticed.
      Participants often have a fixed schedule for the day, and this is carried out irrespective of
      the shape they are in, e.g. irrespective of how well they have slept the night before. The
      challenges may then be too much for a sleep-deprived person, and frustration and even self
      harm and aggressive behavior may be the result. With the use of a respiration monitor that
      assesses sleep from the person's breathing pattern, the person in question may be able to
      communicate to her/his caregivers how the previous night's sleep was.

      Information about heart rate and sleep may contribute to better care and health services for
      persons who are unable to communicate unequivocally because of intellectual disability,
      autism and/or cerebral palsy.

The design is a before-and-after comparison with respect to whether the use of sensors has changed the caregivers' practice and their (perceived) understanding of the participant. The frequency of participants' self harm or aggressive behavior after as compared to before the introduction of pulse- and respiration monitors will also be charted.</description>

        Participants are persons with intellectual disability (ID) and/or cerebral palsy (CP) that
        render the participant unable to communicate unequivocally. Participants with ID will
        typically have severe (IQ score 20-35) or profound (IQ score &lt;20) ID. However, some may
        have moderate ID (IQ score 35-50) combined with autism of a degree that renders them unable
        to communicate unequivocally.

        Participants with CP typically have a severe variant that implies impaired control over
        muscles involved in communication (speech, gaze direction, gesticulation, pointing,
        mimic/grimacing), rendering them unable to communicate unequivocally. However, some
        participants with CP may also have ID, which contributes to the communication difficulties.
