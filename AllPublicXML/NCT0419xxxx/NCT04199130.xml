  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop a method to improve thinking difficulties in
      individuals who have experienced a traumatic brain injury and report experiencing
      difficulties in attention and concentration. This study aims to understand how cognitive
      rehabilitation of attention difficulties affects brain activity.

    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of two different types of cognitive rehabilitation
      in moderate-to-severe (m/s) traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors. More specifically
      comparisons will be made between Direct Attention Training administered via BrainHQ, and
      Metacognitive Strategy Training in the form of the evidence-based Goal Management Training
      (GMT) protocol.

      These interventions will be compared to the standard of care, to each other, and their
      combined effectiveness will be assessed. Groups will consist of randomized individuals with
      moderate-to-severe TBIs who experience attention deficits. Each treatment will be
      administered for 4 weeks and two intervention groups will be used to counterbalance treatment
      order. Group 1 will receive BrainHQ first followed by GMT, while Group 2 will receive GMT
      first followed by BrainHQ. In addition a third group will serve as a treatment-as-usual
      control group.

      Primary outcomes include measures of self-care, ability, adjustment and participation.
      Secondary outcomes include measures of cognition and brain function. And lastly, tertiary
      outcomes include measures of emotional and psychosocial functioning. These outcomes will be
      measures at baseline, following completion of the first 4 week treatment in both groups
      (Group 1 = BrainHQ while Group 2 = GMT), and following completion of the second 4 week
      treatment in both groups (Group 1 = GMT while Group 2 = BrainHQ).

    <description>BrainHQ is a web-based &quot;brain-training&quot; program. The investigators will assign participants to attention specific modules that they will complete at home with the goal of &quot;restoring&quot; attentional functions lost through injury via repetitive tasks of graded difficulty.</description>
