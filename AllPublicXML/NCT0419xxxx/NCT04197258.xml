  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Going back home following a stroke is a key step for the patient and his or her relatives.
      Due to the brutality of stroke and increasingly shorter in-hospital lengths of stay, patients
      and their families must adapt quickly to the patient's new health functioning and the new
      caregiving and support role for family members.

      Peer support could be an innovative and inexpensive approach to addressing these issues.
      Peer-helpers are patient-partners who put their experiential knowledge from life with the
      disease at the disposal of other patients to offer them social and emotional support in the
      management of the disease in connection with care, social and community structures. Group
      peer support programs face organizational challenges and fail to address the full range of
      patient needs for stroke home visits. Individualized and more flexible support could better
      meet the needs of patients. Our hypothesis is that individual peer support improves quality
      of life and patient empowerment during the discharge period compared to usual practice.

    <description>The feasibility of the intervention will be evaluated as success with a combined criteria including:
Recruitment and training of 2 peer helpers,
Support offered to 20 patients by the peer helpers during the intervention period defined by at least one meeting before and one contact after discharge per patient included in period after,
Good acceptability by patients, carers and peer helpers. These data will be collected by a qualitative approach associating semi-directive interviews, focus groups and participant observation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Peer support</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention studied is the psycho-social support by a peer-helper to the patients and their main informal caregiver during the return home following a stay in rehabilitation center for a stroke.
Peer support intervention will be based on evidence, Bandura's social learning and social support theory, and the results of our ongoing study of the needs of patients and their caregivers as a result of returning home (Stroke69). It will include a meeting before the discharge and a regular follow-up for 6 months (face-to-face meetings, virtual or by phone), adapted to the needs of the patient and his caregiver, taking into account the social environment and in connection with the devices existing sanitary and social.</description>
