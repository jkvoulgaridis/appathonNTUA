  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      In terms of doping, there is controversy regarding the beneficial effects of β2‐agonists like
      salmeterol on physical performance. Some studies show improvement with salmeterol
      administered orally, especially related to pulmonary function and muscle contractibility,
      while other works do not show such ergogenic effects of salmeterol by inhalation.

      Supratherapeutic use of salmeterol is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, but a
      maximum allowed urine concentration has not been determined.

      Urine concentrations of salmeterol are very low when administered at therapeutic doses, often
      below the lower limit of quantification. Some studies show that urine concentrations of
      α-hydroxy-salmeterol (the principal salmeterol metabolite) may be higher than those of the
      original drug. Thus, α-hydroxy-salmeterol might be a more suitable biomarker for detecting
      fraudulent use of this drug.

      Hypothesis:

      Inhaled administration of salmeterol in healthy subjects allows obtaining positive urine
      samples that will be used to identify analytical strategies for doping detection. Salmeterol
      concentrations and its metabolites (α‐hydroxy-salmeterol and others) can be measured in
      urine.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: To generate urine samples positive to salmeterol in order to be analyzed
      as control samples by anti-doping laboratories.

      Secondary objectives: To identify salmeterol metabolites (α‐hydroxy-salmeterol and others) in
      urine.

      Methods:

      Phase I, open, non-randomized, uncontrolled clinical trial, with a treatment condition
      (salmeterol) administered daily by inhalation to 6 subjects during 3 consecutive days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male volunteers aged between 18 and 45 years.

          -  Able to understand and accept the trial procedures and able to sign an informed
             consent.

          -  History and physical examination that demonstrate not presenting organic or
             psychiatric disorders.

          -  ECG, blood and urine tests performed at screening should be within normal limits.
             Minor or punctual variations of these limits of normality are admitted if, in the
             opinion of the Principal Investigator, they have no clinical significance, do not pose
             a risk to the subject and do not interfere with the evaluation of the product in
             study. These variations and their non-relevance will be justified in writing
             specifically.

          -  Body mass index (weight/size^2) between 19 and 26 kg/m2, and weight between 50 and 90
             kg. Subjects with BMI &gt;27 kg/m2 may be included at the discretion of the Principal
             Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet the inclusion criteria.

          -  History of allergy, idiosyncrasy, hypersensitivity or adverse reactions to the active
             substance or any of the excipients. History of serious adverse reactions to other
             medications.

             consumption of psychoactive drugs, drug abuse or addiction to other substances (except
             for nicotine). Smokers of more than 5 cigarettes/day will be excluded.

          -  Having participated in another clinical trial with medication in the three months
             prior to the start of the study.

          -  Having donated blood during the month prior to the start of the study.

             start of the study.

          -  Background or clinical evidence of cardiovascular, respiratory (especially asthma or
             Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), renal, hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal,
             hematological, neurological, dermatological or other acute or chronic diseases that,
             in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the collaborators designated by him,
             may pose a risk to the subjects, may interfere with the objectives of the study or may
             alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug.

          -  Have taken medication regularly in the month prior to the study sessions, with the

             the Principal Investigator or the collaborators designated by him, do not pose a risk
             to the subjects and do not interfere with the objectives of the study. Treatment with
             single doses of symptomatic medication in the week prior to the study sessions will
             not be exclusive if it is assumed that medication has been completely eliminated on
             the day of the experimental session.

          -  Consumption of more than 15 g of alcohol per day.

          -  Consumers of more than 3 coffees, teas, cola drinks and/or other stimulant drinks
             (xanthines) per day in the month prior to the start of the study.
