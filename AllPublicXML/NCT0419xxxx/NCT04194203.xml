    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab when given in combination
      with bevacizumab, investigator's choice of either paclitaxel or pemetrexed, and carboplatin
      compared with placebo given in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel or pemetrexed, and
      carboplatin in patients with chemotherapy-naive, Stage IV non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung
      Cancer (NSCLC). The study will be conducted in two phases: Induction Phase and Maintenance
      Phase.

             progression (during or after treatment) or were intolerant to treatment with one or
             more EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and osimertinib,
             or another EGFR TKI appropriate for the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Patients who
