      This study is an open-label, Phase Ib clinical study to evaluate recombinant human GM-CSF
      herpes simplex virus injection (OrienX010) in combination with recombinant humanized
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody injection (Treprizumab injection) as neoadjuvant treatment in
      patients with complete resectable stage III and IV (M1a) melanoma.

      This study is planned to enroll approximately 30 patients with stage III and IV melanoma
      (M1a) who meet protocol requirements.

      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human GM-CSF herpes simplex
      virus injection (OrienX010) in combination with recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal
      antibody injection (Treprizumab injection) as neoadjuvant treatment in the patients with
      complete resectable stage III and IV (M1a) melanoma.

    <description>This study consisted of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment, surgical, and adjuvant treatment. Neoadjuvant treatment period: OrienX010 in combination with Treprizumab injection. Treprizumab injection: 3 mg/kg, IV infusion: Once every 2 weeks (1 treatment cycle every 2 weeks) for 4 doses (4 cycles); OrienX010: Maximum injection volume 8 × 108 pfu, intratumoral injection: Once every 2 weeks (1 treatment cycle every 2 weeks) for 4 doses (4 cycles); Surgical treatment period: 2 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment (± 7 days), the investigator designed the surgical protocol of the melanoma radical surgery according to the patient's individual disease, and performed postoperative care according to the patient's condition.
Adjuvant treatment period: 3 weeks after operation (± 7 days), the patient was given Treprizumab injection. Treprizumab injection: 3 mg/kg intravenously given every 3 weeks (1 treatment cycle every 3 weeks) for up to 1 year.</description>
