      Cerebral stroke (CS) remains one of the key issues of modern society, being a predominant
      cause of deep and persistent disability of the population. Huge social and economic damage
      arising from cerebrovascular diseases raises the problem of improving medical care for
      strokes among the most relevant scientific and practical tasks of neurology Regulation of
      energy metabolism is considered a powerful tool for acute conditions relief, including those
      that occur due to acute impairment of cerebral blood flow. A number of adjuvant energy
      protector concomitant medications with systemic pharmacodynamic properties based on signaling
      (hormonal) and substrate mode of action of succinic acid and other mitochondrial substrates
      and co-factors was created for this A significant role in the rehabilitation of patients who
      underwent CS is assigned to the treatment of complications of care in the intensive care
      unit, the so-called post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which is a set of somatic,
      neurological, social and psychological consequences of periods in intensive care unit (ICU)
      conditions that bring limitations to the patient's daily activities In the Brain Institute
      Clinic (Yekaterinburg), the first results of the metabolic status monitoring during physical
      and cognitive exercise in patients with PICS were obtained. These results prove that control
      over metabolic state holds the promise of developing approaches to increasing exercise
      tolerance Taking into account the effectiveness of CFL in treatment of acute impairment of
      cerebral circulation and consequences of cerebrovascular diseases, on the one hand, and its
      classification as a metabotropic energy corrector, on the other hand, the evaluation of
      Cytoflavin® medication tolerability in the integrated program of neurorehabilitation of
      patients with PICS after ischemic stroke presents a significant interest.
