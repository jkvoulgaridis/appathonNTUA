  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is a major health problem affecting up to 15% of couples of reproductive age
      globally. For several years, it was assumed that most reproductive problems could be
      attributed to the female partner, but research in recent years has demonstrated that males
      were solely responsible for 20-30% of infertility cases and contributed to 50% of infertility
      cases overall. The term ''male infertility'' does not constitute a defined clinical syndrome,
      but rather a collection of different conditions exhibiting a variety of etiologies.

      It is far increasingly known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are of significant
      pathophysiological importance in the etiology of male infertility. ROS are highly reactive
      oxidizing agents belonging to the class of free radicals containing one or more unpaired
      electrons, which are continuously being generated through metabolic and pathophysiologic
      processes. It has been suggested that oxidants interfere with normal sperm function via
      membrane lipid peroxidation and fragmentation of nucleic acids, which result in sperm
      dysfunction. Due to the sperm cell membrane abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      and the capacity of sperm to generate ROS, human spermatozoa are highly susceptible to
      oxidative stress.

      Since growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress can be a primary cause of male
      infertility, non-enzymatic antioxidants play a significant protective role against oxidative
      damages and lipid peroxidation. In addition, micronutrients and antioxidants are often used
      with good results in men with idiopathic infertility.

      Keeping in view the main protection provided by seminal plasma antioxidants against oxidative
      damages, a previous study showed that the dietary management with an eight nutritional
      supplements' combination, similar to this study's product and containing antioxidants,
      achieved a significant improvement in sperm quality up to a completely normal semen analysis.
      Also, another study confirmed the hypothesis that the combination of individual nutritional
      supplements as described in literature showed significantly better results than the sum of
      the effects of single administration.
