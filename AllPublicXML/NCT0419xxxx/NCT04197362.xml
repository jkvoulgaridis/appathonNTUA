      This study aims to directly compare traditional everyday activity shoes (ASICS, Nike) with a
      shoe created to be flatter, less cushioned, and with less cradling of the foot (OESH shoe).

      This study addresses a common question in popular media: what attributes of traditional
      everyday activity shoes (Nike, New Balance, etc.) make a shoe better or worse. There have
      been several peer-reviewed studies aimed to answer this by calculating forces and torques at
      the ankles, knees, and hips while subjects wore shoes with different properties. Such
      characteristics include heel size, cushioning and side-to-side cradling of the foot.
      Interestingly, most studies have shown that the lack of a heel, less cushioning, and less
      cradling of the foot actually improve the biomechanics related to forces and torques, thus
      decreasing wear and tear on the cartilage and bones of the leg. Wear and tear on cartilage
      and bone may predispose patients to a bone condition called &quot;osteoarthritis&quot;, which is a
      disease where bones become damaged from rubbing on each other with breakdown of a cartilage
      &quot;cushion&quot;. This study thus aims to directly compare traditional everyday activity shoes
      (ASICS, Nike) with a shoe created to be flatter, less cushioned, and with less cradling of
      the foot (OESH shoe).

    <description>Subjects will be asked to walk across the gait laboratory floor at their self-selected walking speed. They will complete a 3-5 minute warm up period, as it was found to produce stable estimates of kinetic parameter mean values during treadmill activity. The positions of each marker will be recorded through the motion capture system. Ground reaction force will be obtained in real time from the gait laboratory force plates as marker dimensions are recorded. For walking data, two trials of 15 seconds each will be recorded. The second trial will be a redundancy in the setting of potential significant marker dropout.</description>
