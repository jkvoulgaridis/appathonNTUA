  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain may be associated with active discopathy. This subset of individuals
      are defined by a clinical and radiological syndrome with specific MRI signals, known as MODIC
      changes.

      Three types (I, II and III) of MODIC changes are described. Type I refers to the inflammatory
      reaction regarding the intervertebral-disc subchondral bone and adjacent vertebral-endplate
      subchondral bone. The natural evolution of this active discopathy will lead to sclerosis
      (type III) supposedly less painful. So far the underlying mechanism remains unclear and
      debated (mechanical, local infection, genetic). In the absence of international guidelines on
      the management on chronic low back pain with MC type 1, different therapeutic strategies have
      been described. The main goal is to accelerate the transition to MC type 2, which is
      supposedly less painful. The estimated time to expect a transition from type 1 to type 2 is
      at least 1 year.

      The mechanical hypothesis found its origin in the Modic et al. initial study, linking Modic
      changes (MC) types 1 and 2 to degenerative disc disease.

      The Histological analysis of patient suffering from active discopathy has shown signs of
      micro fractures regarding vertebral endplates. The local inflammatory reaction may be part of
      a repair process following the micro fracture. Based on this mechanical explanation an
      orthopaedic treatment with a lumbar brace may accelerate the healing, thus the transition
      from modic I to type II. This approach has been studied in a retrospective analysis on 62
      patients suffering from active discopathy (modic type I) who were prescribed a custom lumbar
      rigid brace for 3 months, at endpoint 80% of the patients treated described a reduction of at
      least 30% of their initial pain.

      This study aims to confirm the previous hypothesis, that lumbar and lumbosacral
      immobilisation by custom rigid brace can reduce the pain after being worn for 3 months.
      Secondary objective will be to assess the pain reduction at 6 months along with functional
      outcome at short (3 months) and mid (6months) term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 2 parallel group multicentre randomised controlled trial. Patients will
      undergo 3 consultations with the physician, based on the usual follow up for this pathology.
      During the first consultation the physician will check the inclusion criteria, medical
      history, clinical data relative to the different outcomes, patient reported outcome measures
      will be assessed as well and then the prosthetist will take the measurement to conceive the
      custom brace. Patients will then be re-examined during a 2nd consultation 3 month later to
      assess the main outcome (pain reduction) and other secondary outcome (proms). A third
      consultation will be organised 6 months later for secondary outcome (pain reduction and
      proms).

Patients must also be capable of giving a clear consent. Will not be included patients suffering from other types of Modic change, or any other cause of back pain such as spondylolisthesis, fracture, spondylitis, scoliosis, rheumatoid arthritis and also patient not willing to wear the brace for at least 3 months.

    <measure>Reduction of the pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Average change from baseline in the pain intensity measured on a Visual Analogical Scale (VAS) Visual analog scale (VAS) and its corresponding visual analog pain scale, is a psychometric scale that is generally used to conduct pain scale surveys to understand varying degrees of pain or discomfort experienced by a patient. The score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>

    <measure>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire measures in patients with low back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland-Morris Questionnaire is a self-administered disability measure in which greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers on a 24-point scale. The RMQ has been shown to yield reliable measurements, which are valid for inferring the level of disability, and to be sensitive to change over time for groups of patients with low back pain. Roland and Morris did not provide descriptions of the varying degrees of disability (eg, 40%-60% is severe disability). Clinical improvement over time can be graded based on the analysis of serial questionnaire scores. If, for example, at the beginning of treatment, a patient's score was 12 and, at the conclusion of treatment, their score was 2 (10 points of improvement), we would calculate an 83% (10/12 x 100) improvement</description>

    <measure>The fears and the faiths measured by questionnaire FABQ</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The FABQ can help predict those that have a high pain avoidance behavior. Clinically, these people may need to be supervised more than those that confront their pain. The FABQ contains 2 scales: a work scale (FABQ-W) composed of 7 items and a physical activity scale (FABQ-PA) composed of 4 items. The two scales are scored separately. Higher FABQ scores indicate elevated fear-avoidance beliefs. &quot;FABQ-W&quot; has a point score that ranges from 0-42 points. It can be calculated as follows: (Total points for items 6, 7, 9, 10 11, 12 and 15) = Work scale score. &quot;FABQ-PA&quot; can range from 0-24 points. Scores are calculated as follows: (Total points for items 2, 3, 4 and 5) = Physical activity scale score.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a valid and reliable self-rating scale that measures anxiety and depression in both hospital and community settings. HADS gives clinically meaningful results as a psychological screening tool and can assess the symptom severity and caseness of anxiety disorders and depression in patients with illness and the general population.
One questionnaire, comprising fourteen questions. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression.
Scoring : 0-7- normal, 8-10-borderling abnormal, 11-21-abnormal</description>

    <measure>Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophing plays an important role in chronic pain. It was found to be associated with intensified experiences of pain and depression, and often is associated with higher self-reported pain and disability. This type of pain catastrophizing is believed to be a precursor for fear-avoidance behaviors, which can result in a number of negative biopsychosocial consequences such as physical deconditioning, depression, as well as disability. It's a 13-item self-report scale to measure pain catastrophizing .Each item is rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). It is broken into three subscales being magnification, rumination, and helplessness</description>

Brace must be worn for 3 months. A thermal sensor chip will be placed in the brace to assess the observance. No physiotherapy will be prescribed during this period. Patient will attend to 3 consultations, day 0, 3 months and finally at 6 months later. These three consultations are part of usual care.</description>
