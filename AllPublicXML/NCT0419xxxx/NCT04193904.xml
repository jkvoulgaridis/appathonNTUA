  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety and preliminary
      efficacy of MRx0518 with preoperative hypofractionated radiation in 15 patients with
      resectable pancreatic cancer.

      Subjects will take MRx0518 daily for one week prior to the start of radiation therapy,
      throughout radiation and until surgical resection of the tumour.
