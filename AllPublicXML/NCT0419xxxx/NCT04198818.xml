        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide signed and dated informed consent prior to initiation of any study-related
             procedures.

          2. Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years.

          3. Phase I dose escalation stage: Patients who have been diagnosed with histologically or
             cytological documented, unresectable/metastatic tumors that are refractory or
             intolerant to standard therapy or for whom no curative standard therapy exists.

          4. For LCH/ECD: Eligible patients must have multifocal disease and the diagnosis must be
             confirmed by pathological evaluation of the affected tissue.

          5. Patients in the Phase I dose escalation portion of the trial may have measurable (per
             RECIST v1.1) or evaluable disease. Patients in the Phase I dose expansion and Phase II
             portions of the trial must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status≤1.

          7. Predicted life expectancy ≥ 3 months;

          8. Willing and able to participate in the trial and comply with all trial requirements;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Gastrointestinal condition which could impair absorption of study medication;

          2. Patients who have previously participated in clinical trials of ERK inhibitors drug;

          3. Any use of an investigational drug within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             shorter) prior to the first dose of HH2710
