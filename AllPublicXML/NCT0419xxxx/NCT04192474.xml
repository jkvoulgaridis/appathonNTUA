  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the new aScope 4 Cysto is used to see if this new single use, flexible
      cystoscope performs as well as other routinely used flexible cystoscopes. This study will be
      done in patients who come to the clinic for either a diagnosis of their urethra and bladder
      or for a small intervention. For an intervention a lesion or tumor is resected, a stent in
      the ureter is taken out, or an injection in the bladder wall is given. The flexible
      cystoscope is passed into the urethra and bladder for visual inspection of the bladder and
      urethra. It will give information on how well the structures of the urinary tract and bladder
      can be viewed including any abnormalities that are present. If an intervention is performed
      the aScope 4 Cysto will be used with an endoscopic accessory.

      Clinical Phase: pre-CE study

      Design: A prospective, multicenter, single- arm open-label clinical study on the performance
      and safety of Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia, a single-use, flexible cystoscope
      for flexible cystoscopy

      Population: Adult subjects (≥ 18 years) undergoing flexible cystoscopy for diagnostic or
      therapeutic purposes.

      Planned Sample Size: A total of 80 patients will result in a maximum (if the true proportion
      is 50 %) width (i.e. the difference between the point estimate and the upper, or lower, limit
      of the confidence interval) of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the binary variable
      &quot;Performance level acceptable&quot; to be 11%. This width is considered to be useful in the
      interpretations of the results from this part of the trial.

      Study duration: Screening, procedure and follow-up will take 14 days maximum. A follow-up
      telephone call at 7 days post procedure is performed to record any adverse events
      post-procedure.

      Planned Trial Period: 3 months

      Investigational Device: Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia. A pre-CE, single use
      cystoscope.
