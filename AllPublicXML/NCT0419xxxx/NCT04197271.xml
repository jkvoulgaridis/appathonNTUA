  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acutely symptomatic abdominal wall hernia can cause many symptoms and complications. They can
      be associated with levels of morbidity beyond that seen in emergency laparotomy. There is
      limited data to guide practice in this field. This observational cohort study will explore
      variation in practice around assessment, repair and outcomes of hernias treated in the
      emergency setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many different types of hernia, with the most common being in the groin or at the
      umbilicus. Hernias affect a significant proportion of the population and can vary from
      producing no symptoms at all, to causing a blockage to the bowel that requires urgent
      surgery. Hernias affect people of all ages and degrees of health, but become increasingly
      common with age. As our population ages and therefore becomes generally more unwell, the
      risks of surgery increase. Recent evidence suggests that emergency hernia repair is
      associated with worse outcomes than planned procedures. At present there are limited
      guidelines for the management of acutely symptomatic hernias and therefore practice varies
      between hospitals.

      This cohort study will capture information on patients treated in the UK for acutely
      symptomatic hernia, and will provide information on variation in assessment, and technical
      aspects of repair. It will also capture health utility data out to 90 days post discharge
      from hospital.
