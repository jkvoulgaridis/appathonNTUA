      The main purpose of this trial is to determine whether Chinese medicine (CM) for eliminating
      phlegm and clearing heat (EPACH) recipe continuously with nourishing Qi and activating blood
      circulation (NQABC) recipe, oral within 72 hours of symptom onset, improves the 15-day
      neurologicl deficits in participants with acute ischemic stroke.

    <textblock>
      Many years of clinical practice experience has found that Chinese medicine (CM) for EPACH
      recipe continuously with NQABC recipe can be beneficial to the recovery of neurological
      function in the early stage of ischemic stroke. However, there is lack of high-quality
      evidence of its efficacy for acute ischemic stroke currently. The primary hypothesis of this
      trial is that Chinese herbal therapeutic regimen of EPACH+NQABC combined with guideline-based
      standard treatment will improve the 15-day neurological deficits in patients with acute
      ischemic stroke (AIS). Totally 500 participants will be randomized to the integrative
      treatment group treated with EPACH + NQABC recipes granules in addition to guideline-based
      standard treatment or the control group with placebo and guideline-based standard treatment
      equally for 15 days. All patients will have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
      (NIHSS) entry score of 4-25. Patients in each group will be treated according to
      guideline-based standard treatment, but patients who have received or intend to undergo
      intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular interventions (including intravascular mechanical
      thrombectomy, arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty) are excluded. The primary outcome will be
      determined at 15 days, and all the participants will be followed up for 90 days.
