      A randomized, double-blind, single-dose, parallel-group study to compare the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and immunogenicity of LY01011 and Xgeva® in
      healthy adults

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, parallel-group clinical trial .

      The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetic similarity of single and subcutaneous
      injections of LY01011 or Xgeva® in healthy volunteers.

      The secondary objective are to compare the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and
      pharmacodynamics of single and subcutaneous injections of LY01011 or Xgeva® in healthy
      volunteers.
