  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is frequently used in the operating room and the intensive care
      settings. Although essential in many cases, mechanical ventilation can be responsible for
      ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The relationship between mechanical ventilation and
      VILI has been clearly demonstrated in animals and is highly suspected in humans. The putative
      mechanism responsible for VILI is excessive pulmonary strain or overdistension. Frequently
      observed in mechanically ventilated patients, the presence of a severe pre-existing pulmonary
      disease can increase the risk of overdistension. The development of a tool allowing early
      detection of pulmonary overdistension would represent a great asset in the prevention of VILI
      by allowing safer adjustments of mechanical ventilation parameters. Ultrasonographic imaging
      is a non-radiant, non-invasive technique already available in the intensive care setting.
      Already used for cardiac strain measurements, ultrasonography is a promising avenue to assess
      pulmonary strain.This study will aim to establish normal pleural strain values using
      ultrasonography in healthy volunteers.

      Purpose: The primary objective is to calculate 95% confidence intervals in pleural strain for
      a set of 5 inspired volumes at 4 predetermined lung areas in healthy volunteers.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  to modelize the relation between pleural strain and inspired volume

        -  to modelize the relation between pleural strain and global pulmonary volumetric strain

        -  to modelize the relation between pleural strain and maximal echo intensity change

        -  to compare the regional distribution pattern of pleural strain in healthy volunteers in
           dependent versus non-dependent areas.

      Hypothesis: Elastography using the Lagrangian speckle model estimator based on optical flow
      allows the determination of normal mean values and 95% confidence intervals of pleural strain
      (average Von Mises coefficient) in 4 predetermined lung areas for a set of 5 inspired volumes
      in healthy volunteers.

      Participants will have their functional residual capacity (FRC) measured by a nitrogen
      dilution technique. Subsequently, they will be instructed to breathe 5 different inspired
      volumes (6, 8, 10, 12 and 15 ml/kg predicted body weight). Tidal volumes will be measured
      using a spirometer. For each inspired volume, 3 respiratory cycles will be recorded at four
      predetermined anatomic sites: left and right 3rd intercoastal space at the mid-clavicular
      line, and left and right 8th intercoastal space at the posterior axillary line. For each
      image, the probe will be oriented perpendicularly to the ribs. A research, non-commercially
      available, non-invasive vascular elastography platform will be used to calculate the various
      strain parameters for all of the recorded cineloops. For each recorded clip, an experienced
      lung ultrasonographer will segment the pleura on a single reference image. From this image,
      an algorithm will define a region of interest which will be tracked throughout the rest of
      the images of the video sequence. Finally, the algorithm will calculate the various
      components of pleural strain.
