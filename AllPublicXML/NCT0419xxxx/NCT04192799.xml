  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At a national level, emergency departments (EDs) serve as the portal of hospital admission
      for 75% of hospitalized children. The remainder occur via direct admission, defined as
      admission to hospital without first receiving care in the hospital's ED. The overall goals of
      this research are to: (i) implement pediatric direct admission systems at 3 hospitals, (ii)
      compare the timeliness of healthcare delivery for children who are admitted directly and
      through emergency departments, (iii) determine which patient populations achieve the greatest
      benefits from direct admission, and (iv) identify barriers and facilitators of successful
      implementation.

      The Specific Aims of this research are to: (i) Determine the effect of a pediatric direct
      admission system on timeliness of healthcare provision (the investigator's primary outcome),
      family experience of care, and rates of clinical deterioration compared to hospital admission
      beginning in the ED; (ii) Identify the pediatric populations and conditions that experience
      the greatest benefits from direct admission; and (iii) Through interviews with key
      informants, identify barriers to and facilitators of implementing standardized direct
      admission processes.

      To achieve these Aims, a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial at three
      geographically diverse hospitals in the United States will be conducted, randomizing primary
      and urgent care practices in the hospitals' catchment area to cross over to the direct
      admission intervention at four time points. Linear models with random effects for clusters
      and time period fixed effects will be used to evaluate outcomes associated with the direct
      admission intervention. To examine for heterogeneity of treatment effects, interactions
      between direct admission and a priori-specified subgroups will be examined.
