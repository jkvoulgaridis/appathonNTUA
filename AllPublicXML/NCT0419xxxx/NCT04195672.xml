  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess correlation between Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Index
      values and external evaluation by Comfort Behaviour Scale during painful medical cares in
      sedated intubated children admitted in pediatric intensive care unit.

    <textblock>
      The assessment of pain in patient hospitalized in intensive care remains a challenge,
      especially for patients which are unable to communicate their pain intensity. Self-reported
      scales are widely used for children's pain assessment but cannot be used in sedated or
      non-communicable patients. The gold standard for pain evaluation in sedated-ventilated
      patient in pediatric intensive care unit is the Comfort Behaviour Scale (CBS). However, this
      method remains subjective, depending on training and ability to use this clinical tool by the
      examiner. The Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Evaluation (NIPE) is a non-invasive system based
      on the analysis variability in high frequency (&gt; 0.15 Hz) which reflects the parasympathetic
      activity related to respiratory fluctuations of heart rate. With a numerical index ranging
      from 0 to 100, NIPE values, measured continuously, has been developed to evaluate the degree
      of pain intensity. In this study, the hypothese is the NIPE could be used as an indicator of
      pain in sedated/intubated children under 3 years-old hospitalized in Pediatric intensive care
      unit.

      This study did not change the procedure of care before or after and had no impact on care.

    <description>During different procedures of care with the bed-side nurse, NIPE ware recorded. Monitoring started 15 minutes before care and continuously recorded until 10 minutes after the procedure. Pain assessment was evaluated by the CBS under 3 periods for each patient: 1- before any procedure (T1) representing the baseline, 2- during the procedure of care (T2), and 3- after the procedure (T3). Investigator who performed the CBS was blind to NIPE during the procedure recording.
