  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapy-led exercises is the first line treatment for patients with subacromial pain.
      However, current evidence report that most treatment programmes only show a short-term
      benefit. There seem to be a potential for enhancing the effectiveness of exercise
      interventions by improving adherence to self-managed exercises, but there is lack of
      knowledge about adherence to exercise programmes in shoulder pain. Before conducting a
      planned randomised controlled trial on the clinical effectiveness of an intervention focusing
      on adherence to a self-managed exercise strategy (the Ad-Shoulder intervention), it is
      necessary to run a feasibility study in order to establish whether such a resource-demanding
      trial is worthwhile. Feasibility studies are designed to answer the key question &quot;Can it
      work?&quot; The main objectives of the present study was to assess the feasibility in terms of
      recruitment capability, data collection procedures and acceptability of the Ad-Shoulder
      intervention in patients with subacromial pain receiving treatment in primary or secondary
      health care.

    <description>SPADI is a self-reported questionnaire for patients with shoulder pain. The questionnaire consists of 13 questions divided into two domains: pain (five items) and function (eight items) and scored on a numerical scale 0 (best) to 10 (worst) with a score range from 0 to 100 points</description>

    <measure>Patient Specific Function Scale (PSFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSFS is a patient specific outcome measure where the patient is asked to name three activities which the patient find challenging or are not able to do because of their shoulder pain. Patients rate their ability to complete the activities on a 11-point scale at a level experienced prior to injury or change in functional status. &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;unable to perform&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;able to perform at prior level&quot;.</description>

    <description>Pain intensity during the last week was measured using the NPRS (ranging from 0 = no pain, 10 = the most intense pain imaginable). Repeated measures: During a one week pre-treatment phase (A), 3 times. During the 12 week treatment phase (B): collected twice every week. During a one week post-treatment phase (A): 3 times</description>

Repeated measures: During a one week pre-treatment phase (A), 3 times. During the 12 week treatment phase (B): collected twice every week.

    <description>Generic health-related quality of life will be assessed by the EQ-5D. It evaluates 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, activities of daily living, pain, and anxiety and/or depression.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient rated perception of change at the follow-ups will be assessed on a Global Perceived Effect scale (GPE) at follow-up (52). The response alternatives were: 1 = &quot;completely recovered&quot;, 2 = &quot;much improved&quot;, 3 = &quot;slightly improved&quot;, 4 = &quot;no change&quot;, 5 = &quot;slightly worse&quot;, 6 = &quot;much worse&quot;, and 7 = &quot;worse than ever&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesiophobia will be assessed using one question: &quot;How much 'fear' do you have that these complaints would be increased by physical activity? (scores range from 0 = no fear, to 10 = very much fear).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity (self-reported)</measure>

    <measure>Physical activity (accelerometer)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To objectively measure physical activity an accelerometer (AX3, 3-axis Logging Accelerometer) was used. This accelerometer provides information about movement and will enable us to objectively measure the amount of general physical activity (minutes of moderate activity). The patients will be measured for three consecutive days at baseline, at 6 weeks and at 3 months to assess changes between the three time points (Week 0, Week 6 and 3 months.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a personalised supported self-management intervention which emphasises dynamic, progressively loaded exercises for the shoulder. The intervention consisted of 1-5 individual sessions provided over 3 months, with a duration of 1 hour for the first session and 45 minutes for the following. The participants will have the opportunity to contact the physiotherapist by phone, text message or e-mail for advice during the treatment period (12 weeks). The personalised supported self-management intervention will be based on the components of the self-management framework, provided by Lorig and Holman (2003). The five self-management skills and the operationalization of these will be described when publishing the study. For specific content reporting of the self managed exercises we will follow the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template.</description>
