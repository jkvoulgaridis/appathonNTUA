  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, study of BP1001-A in participants with advanced or recurrent
      solid tumors. The dose escalation phase will determine the safety and the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of BP1001-A as a single agent. After the MTD or
      MAD of BP1001-A is established, the dose expansion phase will commence and determine the
      safety, toxicity and response of BP1001-A in combination with paclitaxel.

          4. For the dose expansion phase, participants must have recurrent or persistent
             epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, fallopian tube or endometrial tumor

          5. Endometrial cancer patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are
             eligible: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma not

             exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI)

         13. Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least two
             weeks prior to BP1001-A treatment. Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is
             permitted; stable regimens of hormonal therapy (i.e. for prostate cancer (e.g.
             leuprolide, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist), ovarian or breast cancer
             are not exclusionary

         14. Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents,
