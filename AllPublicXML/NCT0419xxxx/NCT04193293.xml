      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label Phase 1b/2 study designed to evaluate
      safety and tolerability and preliminary efficacy of duvelisib in combination with
      pembrolizumab in subjects with R/M HNSCC who are eligible for pembrolizumab monotherapy based
      on the current pembrolizumab prescribing information.
