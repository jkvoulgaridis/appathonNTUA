  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Old age, less body weight and deteriorated renal function are significant clinical factors
      for the outcomes of atrial fibrillation- so called 'fragile'- and these are common risk
      factors in osteoporosis and fracture. Therefore, in real world, these risk factors and
      co-morbidities are commonly considered when it comes to prescribe anticoagulant in atrial
      fibrillation patients. Recent study even reported that comorbid atrial fibrillation in
      patients with osteoporosis might be associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and
      death after fracture. Because there have been very few data about the effectiveness/safety of
      anticoagulant among non-valvular atrial fibrillation with prior osteoporosis/fracture, this
      study is planned to provide real-world evidences for this specific type of non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation patients.

  <why_stopped>
    Interaction term analysis result was not significant and thus comparative effectiveness for
    primary and secondary outcomes could not be considered per protocol.
