    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors are increasingly drawing much attention in the therapeutic
      development for cancer treatment. However, many cancer patients do not respond to treatments
      with immune checkpoint inhibitors, partly because of the lack of tumor-infiltrating effector
      T cells. DC vaccine may prime patients for treatments with immune checkpoint inhibitors by
      inducing effector T-cell infiltration into the tumors and immune checkpoint signals. The
      combination of DC vaccine and an immune checkpoint inhibitor may function synergistically to
      induce more effective antitumor immune responses, and clinical trials to test the combination
      are currently needed.
