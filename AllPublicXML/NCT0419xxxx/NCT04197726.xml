  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if the consumption of one sbeIIa/b white bread with high resistant
      starch content will result in a lower blood glucose response and increased satiety compared
      with reference white bread. All participants will be asked to consume once the sbeIIa/b white
      bread and the reference white bread during different visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an attempt to increase dietary fibre intake, research has focused on developing
      wheat-based food products with novel fibres and starches to complement fibre intake from
      whole grain foods. Resistant starch is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine
      and may be fermented in the large intestine by the microbiota. Resistant starch is a type of
      dietary fibre and it is normally found in wheat-based foods made from refined flour but only
      in small amounts. White bread made from sbeIIa/b wheat, which has high levels of resistant
      starch (a type of fibre), is showing promise in modulating blood glucose response and
      increasing satiety compared with conventional white bread.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether consumption of sbeIIa/b white bread at
      breakfast, gives rise to a lower postprandial blood glucose response compared with
      consumption of a reference white bread in healthy individuals.

      Additional aims of the study include: determining whether consumption of sbeIIa/b white bread
      by healthy subjects, gives rise to a lower glucose concentration in interstitial fluid, as
      measured by a Continuous Glucose Monitoring system (CGM), compared with consumption of
      control white bread; and exploring satiety and energy intake changes in healthy individuals
      following consumption of sbeIIa/b white bread at breakfast, compared with consumption of
      control white bread.
