  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Craniosacral Therapy (CST) is a non-manipulative, very gentle manual treatment method.
      Although the mechanisms of action have not yet been investigated sufficiently, initial
      clinical trials support CST efficacy/effectiveness in chronic pain disorders such as back
      pain, neck pain, and fibromyalgia. In clinical practice, therapists also report pain
      alleviating effects of CST self-help techniques, offered to patients within a group concept.
      Yet, the effectiveness of teaching CST self-help techniques to medical laypersons has not yet
      been scientifically investigated.

      Therefore, this study aims at collecting quantifiable data on the effectiveness and safety of
      a CST self-help group concept, developed for patients with chronic non-specific low back
      pain. The intervention group will receive 24 lessons of education and practice in CST
      self-help techniques over 12 weeks, while the control group will receive the same amount of
      self-help (education and practice) in progressive muscle relaxation. Six and 12 months after
      randomization, longer-term effects will be investigated.

    <masking_description>The investigator who will perform the group assignment will have no contact to the study participants. The outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Patients will partly be blinded to the group intervention: The will be told that they will receive one of two self-help therapies - one that focus on the relaxation of fasciae and the other that focus on the relaxation of muscles. The statistician who will perform the analyses will kept blind to the group intervention by renaming groups with numbers.</masking_description>
