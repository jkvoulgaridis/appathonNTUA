      Surveillance and early detection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with
      minimally-invasive Cytosponge™ cell collection device coupled with molecular biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to identify molecular abnormalities at each developmental stage of
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, high-grade
      intraepithelial neoplasia, and early squamous cell carcinoma) in order to establish new
      molecular biomarkers with potential for early detection and surveillance of the disease using
      the minimally-invasive Cytosponge™ cell collection device. Firstly, tissue samples after
      endoscopic treatment (endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection) for
      squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and early squamous cell carcinoma will be analyzed with
      the use of the next-generation sequencing to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers.
      Afterward, patients with- and at risk- of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma will be
      recruited to undergo a diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies (the gold standard) and Cytosponge
      procedure. The diagnostic accuracy of Cytosponge coupled with molecular biomarkers will be
      evaluated to compare with the gold standard.

    <description>RNA-seq expression analysis will be used to measure the abundance of the previously indetified biomarkers of squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, including genes TP53, NFE2L2, MLL2, ZNF750, NOTCH1, TFNAIP3, and CHN1. The study will include these biomarkers, but will not be limited to them.</description>

    <description>This part of the study will have an active prospective recruitment of patients. Recruitment will involve two patient populations:
Patients with ESCC
Patients at high risk for ESCC
Following inclusion in the study, subjects will be asked to complete a behavior questionnaire, have blood collected, and undergo a Cytosponge™ procedure followed by diagnostic gastroscopy using advanced imaging with biopsies. During gastroscopy, additional tissue samples will be collected for research purposes. These samples, along with cytological specimens from the Cytosponge™, will be analyzed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers in the diagnosis of LG-IEN, HG-IEN, and ESCC.</description>

    <description>The Cytosponge™ is a minimally-invasive sampling device consisting of a polyurethane sponge compressed in a cellophane capsule attached to a string. When swallowed, the capsule dissolves in the stomach, releasing the cell collection sponge that expands to 3 cm in diameter. Next, a nurse or qualified medical technician retrieves the sponge by pulling back on the string and retracting it through the mouth. During extraction, the rough texture on the surface of the sponge collects epithelial cells in the cardia and along the entire length of the esophagus. Cytosponge™ has excellent safety profile and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA) in the UK.</description>
