  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of siltuximab and how well it
      works in combination with spartalizumab in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as siltuximab and
      spartalizumab, interfere with the ability of tumors cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose for the combination of spartalizumab and
      siltuximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the toxicity profile of the combination of the recommended phase II dose of
      spartalizumab and siltuximab.

      II. Evaluate the activity of the combination of spartalizumab and siltuximab in previously
      treated patients with pancreatic cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the combination on the immune profile in the serum and in tumor
      biopsies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of siltuximab.

      Participants receive spartalizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and siltuximab
      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150
      days, then every 12 weeks thereafter.

    <description>Maximal tolerated dose (MTD )is defined as the dose at which less than one-third of the subjects experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 6 weeks of treatment. A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as definitely at least possibly related to study treatment treatment related that occurs within the first 6 weeks.
