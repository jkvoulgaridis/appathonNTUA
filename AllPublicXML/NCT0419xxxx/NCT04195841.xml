  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a human, prospective, parallel, randomised controlled clinical trial
      conducted to check the interproximal bone loss of Z shaped incision over conventional
      sulcular H shaped incision.The trial is in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria, 2010.

    <textblock>
      Twenty healthy individuals satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for
      the study. A detailed, thorough medical and dental history was obtained and each patient was
      subjected to comprehensive clinical and radiological examination. All patients were informed
      about the nature of the study, the surgical procedure involved, potential benefits and risks
      associated with the surgical procedure and written informed consent were obtained from all
      patients. In the test group patients Z shaped incision was done to place implants and H
      shaped sulcular incision was placed in control group.

      The clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline,24 hours,7days, three
      months and six months postoperatively.

    <description>After local anaesthesia, a mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated at the edentulous ridge with two horizontal incisions placed with a no MB 69 blade, 1-2 mm away from the papilla of the teeth adjacent to the edentulous space following the mesial and distal contour of the teeth. The extend of the incisions should be up to the proximal line angles of the adjacent teeth. These two horizontal incisions are then connected by an oblique incision from the disto-buccal to mesio lingual point angles. A periosteal elevator is used to elevate a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap buccally and lingually to the level of the mucogingival junction, exposing the alveolar ridge of the implant surgical sites.
Endosseous implant placement is done followed by simple interrupted resorbable sutures</description>
