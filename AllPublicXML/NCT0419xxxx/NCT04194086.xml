      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and Population Pharmacokinetics of
      Oral Posaconazole in Children with leukemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posaconazole as a new triazole antifungal agent with broad spectrum coverage, was recommended
      for prophylaxis of invasive fungal disease in adults. Some studies have demonstrated the
      relationship between posaconazole plasma concentration and efficacy and few data have been
      published in children with leukemia.The purpose of this study is to describe the off-label
      use of posaconazole oral suspensions in children;to figure out the relationship between
      concentration and clinical outcomes/ adverse events;to identify factors that influence plasma
      concentration.
