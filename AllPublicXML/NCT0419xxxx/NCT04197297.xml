  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A biomarker is a measurable indicator of the severity or presence of some disease state. In
      this study, brain metastases patients who will be receiving radiation treatment, will undergo
      CT (Computed Tomography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans prior to and after
      radiation treatment to measure these biomarkers. This is a single-center phase II study to
      validate the predictive abilities of biomarkers, in terms of determining how patients will
      respond to radiation treatment.

    <textblock>
      Advances in medical imaging can provide useful information to guide and look at the response
      to treatment. Previous studies suggest early changes in the tumor after radiation treatment
      may be detectable using special MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and CT (Computed
      Tomography) scans. A biomarker is a measureable indicator of the severity or presence of some
      disease state. Previous studies suggest that the change in several imaging biomarkers can
      predict who will respond to radiation treatment. In this study, patients will undergo CT and
      MRI scans prior to and after radiation treatment to measure these biomarkers. The purpose of
      this study is to validate the predictive abilities of biomarkers in terms of determining how
      patients will respond to radiation treatment. This is a single-center phase II study, which
      will be conducted at the Princess Margaret Cancer Center. The study will be enrolling up to a
      total of 90 patients who will be receiving radiation treatment for brain metastases. Patients
      will be asked to participate within this study for 2 years.
