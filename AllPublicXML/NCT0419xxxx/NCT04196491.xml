  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1, single arm study intended to determine the
      optimal target dose and safety of bb2121 in subjects with HR (R-ISS Stage III per IMWG
      criteria) NDMM. Subjects should have received 3 Cycles of standard induction therapy prior to
      undergoing leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of
      the drug product (bb2121). Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive
      fourth cycle of induction therapy followed by lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide prior to bb2121 infusion. Maintenance therapy is recommended for all
      subjects who have received bb2121 infusion and should be initiated upon adequate bone marrow
      recovery or from 90-day post-bb2121 infusion, whichever is later.
