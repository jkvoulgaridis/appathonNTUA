      Although there are some studies investigating the physical activity levels of children with
      autism in the literature, no comprehensive study investigating the relationship between
      posture and physical fitness parameters, family anxiety level and quality of life of
      individuals with autism who have continued physical activity program has not been found. The
      aim of our study is to compare postural disorders and physical fitness parameters, family
      anxiety level and quality of life between individuals with autism and healthy individuals
      attending physical activity program.

        Autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and
        challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range
        from highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant
        support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in some cases, live
        entirely independently.
