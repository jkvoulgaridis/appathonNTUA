  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of compression bandaging
      with fractional ablative carbon dioxide laser (FACL) compared to compression and standard
      dressings alone for healing of post-operative wounds of the leg.

      This is a randomized, SMART design, clinical trial. Approximately 80 participants will be
      randomized to initially receive compression bandages or standard wound dressings after
      surgery on the lower leg. After 4 weeks, the group assigned to compression bandages will be
      further randomized to either continue with the compression bandages only or continue with the
      compression bandages and also receive (FACL). The study is designed as an 6-month study. This
      study was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedure.

      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be considered for enrollment.
