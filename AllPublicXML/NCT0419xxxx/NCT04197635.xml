      This study will be a double-blind multicenter randomized study (1:1) to evaluate the effect
      of dapagliflozin 10 mg per day or placebo on short-term functional capacity evaluated through
      changes in peak oxygen consumption. This trial will include patients with type 2 diabetes and
      stable symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Efficacy endpoints
      will be evaluated at 3 time points: 1) baseline (before dapagliflozin/placebo
      administration), 2) 30 days after randomization, and, 3) 90 days after randomization. An
      intermediate clinical visit will be performed one week after study initiation.

      Pre-and post-treatment evaluations (at baseline, 30 and 90 days) will include clinical
      assessment, cardiopulmonary exercise stress test, echocardiography, 6-minute walk test
      (6MWT), and quality of life indicators (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire
      -MLHFQ).

      The investigators postulate that dapagliflozin 10 mg/day improves short-term functional
      capacity of patients with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic HFrEF through multifactorial
      mechanisms, such as diuretic effect and improvement in myocardial energetic efficiency.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be a double-blind multicenter randomized study (1:1) to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg per day or placebo on short-term functional capacity evaluated through changes in peak oxygen consumption The patients will be randomized to receive dapagliflozin or placebo. Once the inclusion criteria are fulfilled and the informed consent signed, patients will be randomized, and efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at 3 time points: 1) baseline (before dapagliflozin/placebo administration), 2) 30 days after randomization, and, 3) 90 days after randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>After providing informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned, with a remote, web-based computer-generated block randomization procedure in an allocation 1:1 ratio, to either receive dapagliflozin 10 mg per day or placebo (one tablet a day orally). This system will allow the maintenance of the randomization codes and the opening of them if necessary. Investigators and patients will be blinded to treatment allocations.
Knowing that no treatment crossings between both groups are expected, there is no need of planning washing periods.</masking_description>
