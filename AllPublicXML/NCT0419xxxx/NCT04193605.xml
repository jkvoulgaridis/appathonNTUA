  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator propose to culturally adapt the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MSBR)
      intervention for Black/African American women living with HIV (WLWH) to reduce stress and
      enhance HIV self-care behaviors and viral load (VL) suppression, which has the potential to
      attenuate prominent racial and gender disparities experienced by Black WLWH in the US.
      Specifically, the investigator aims to 1) culturally adapt the MBSR intervention for Black
      WLWH using ADAPT-ITT; 2) pre-pilot the adapted intervention via an open non-randomized pilot
      study to further refine the culturally adapted intervention; and 3) conduct a 2-armed
      randomized pilot test of the behavioral intervention compared to standard of care to assess
      the feasibility and acceptability the adapted MBSR intervention for Black WLWH. The
      investigator hypothesis that the adapted intervention will be feasible and acceptable to
      member of the target population.

    <description>The traditional MBSR intervention consists of the following: (1) a series of eight weekly session of 2.5 to 3 hours; (2) a silent retreat during the sixth week; (3) daily home assignments including formal and informal mindfulness practices; and (4) didactic presentations on stress and the consequences of stress. We are culturally tailoring the intervention with the goal of maintain fidelity.</description>

    <ipd_description>UAB maintains the following universal data sharing policy for all investigators:
Data will be made available, in accordance with the NIH Data Sharing Policy (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing) to all researchers in both the private and public sector free or for a nominal charge and with minimal restriction. In some cases the institution may determine that the public and the research community are better served by a licensing program whether or not patents have been filed. This may be relevant, for example, if a tool is best distributed under license to guarantee reagent availability and quality.
As a means of sharing knowledge, NIH encourages grantees to arrange for publication of NIH-supported original research in primary scientific journals. We therefore will strive to publish our findings in a timely manner and acknowledge that the research was supported by the NIH.</ipd_description>
