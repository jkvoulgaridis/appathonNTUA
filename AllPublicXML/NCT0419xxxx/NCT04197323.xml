          3. Meet the diagnostic criteria of lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliteran (lower
             extremity ASO) (according to the definition of the 2015 Chinese lower extremity
             arteriosclerosis obliteran diagnosis and treatment guidelines), which are: age&gt; 40
             years; have clinical manifestations of lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliteran ;
             Weakness or disappearance of distal arterial pulsation in ischemic limbs;

          4. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.9;

          5. Fontaine stage II or III. For subjects with Fontaine stage II, intermittent

             and at least 2 tests with difference of ≤25% (comparison based on the first
             measurement value, the second measurement is performed after the subject is fully
             rested the next day and after);

          6. Imaging examinations such as color Doppler ultrasound, CTA, MRA, or DSA within 1 month

          2. Combining a history of stroke or cerebral hemorrhage, the judgment of researchers will
             affect the safety evaluation of efficacy;

          3. Patients diagnosed or suspected of having pulmonary edema, pulmonary infiltration, or
             interstitial pneumonia through clinical or related examinations, or those with severe
             chronic obstructive ventilation disorder or respiratory insufficiency;

          8. Poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg or diastolic blood
             pressure ≥110 mmHg);

             months;

         12. There are other diseases that significantly affect the walking distance, such as lower
             extremity joint disease, spinal disease, neuropathyt;

         13. Patients with inflammatory vascular diseases, such as multiple arteritis, peripheral
             edema, thrombo-occlusive vasculitis, etc .;
