  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the roles the cerebellum, basal ganglia,
      and thalamus play in motor learning. Patients undergoing High Intensity Focused Ultrasound
      (HIFU) treatment will be receiving an ablation procedure to their thalamus as a part of their
      medical procedure. Participation in this study will include completing a behavioral task
      before and after the procedure to see how motor learning task performance differs with and
      without the thalamus. Similarly, patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment
      will have an electrode implanted in their thalamus as a part of their medical procedures.
      Participation in this study will include completing the motor learning task performance &quot;on&quot;
      and &quot;off&quot; thalamic electrical stimulation.
