  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SALOON-HTN is a cross-sectional, descriptive, non-interventional, multicenter survey aiming
      to screen high blood pressure by measuring blood pressure in barbershops.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The survey is a screening project for hypertension, which will enroll subjects at the
      barbershops. The Metline Township (located at Bizerte Town, in the north of Tunisia) will be
      the geographical area of population enrollment. Barbershops hairdressers will be trained by a
      medical staff to measure the blood pressure by an ambulatory device.

      All subjects willing to participate in the survey will be asked to measure their blood
      pressure by after at least 5 minutes rest. Three measures will be performed by the
      Hairdressers, with an interval of 3 minutes between each measure. The mean of the last two
      measures will be considered. If the mean blood pressure level exceeds 135/85 mmHg the subject
      will be sent to a physician of his choice.
