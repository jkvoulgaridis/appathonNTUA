  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized controlled study was undertaken to compare the postoperative
      analgesic effect between ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block and intercostal
      nerve block after single port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with primary spontaneous
      pneumothorax.

      Post-thoracotomy pain is one of the most notorious postsurgical pains that one can
      experience. The pain is known to last for an extensive period of time with significantly high
      intensity.

      In field of thoracic surgery, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has been played an
      important role in alleviating the postoperative pain. Furthermore, single-port thoracoscopic
      surgery, which reduces the number of surgical incision, is increasingly carried out by many
      institutions world widely.

      In field of anesthesiology, various attempts to alleviate post-thoracotomy pain have been
      tried along advancement of thoracic surgical techniques. It began with postoperative
      medication of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids and progressed into
      implementations such as local analgesia, thoracic epidural block, paravertebral block,
      intercostal nerve block, interpleural block and serratus anterior plane block.

      Many analgesic methods have been applied to alleviate postoperative pain in patients who have
      undergone thoracoscopic surgeries. However, there are no prospective randomized controlled
      studies between intercostal nerve block and serratus anterior plane block in single port
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgeries. The main purpose of this study is to compare and
      analyze the effects between conventional intercostal nerve block and newly introduced
      serratus anterior plane block in primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients who have undergone
      single port video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection. This prospective study will
      discover the efficacy and differences between two methods.
