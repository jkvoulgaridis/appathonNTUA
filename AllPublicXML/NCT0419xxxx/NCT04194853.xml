      This study intends to determine the Effects of Electromyographic biofeedback on performance
      of vastus medialis oblique muscle in knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded randomized controlled trial, will be conducted at Railway General
      Hospital.Rawalpindi.

      (EMG) biofeedback as an adjunct therapy to standard exercise regime for increasing muscle
      strength ,this study is planned to determine the effects of electromyographic biofeedback on
      performance and thickness of vastus medialis oblique muscle, knee pain and on lower extremity
      function in patients with Knee Osteoarthritis. The sample size was calculated to be n=34
      through Open Epi tool version 3, with 95 % confidence interval (CI), and power 80%.

      After the completion of therapeutic protocols, the participants will be assessed with the
      help of Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), WOMAC, Lequesne questionnaire , 1 Repetition
      maximum( RM) and with MSK ultrasound

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is used to assess pain. It scores ranges from 0-10, 0 means No pain and 10 means Severe pain. Patient will be asked to verbally report the pain score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>1 Repetition Maximum</measure>
    <time_frame>Post 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, 1 RM Is used to assess maximum muscle strength. Patient is asked to extend knee against maximum resistance once.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vastus medialis Oblique(VMO) Thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Post 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, Musculoskeletal ultrasound will be used to measure maximum thickness of VMO muscle. Assessment will be done by a Consultant radiologist using a 7-12 MHz probe</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, WOMAC is used to assess the functional status. The questionnaire includes five questions about pain severity (0-20), two items on joint stiffness (0-8), and 17 questions on functional limitations of the patient (0-68). Each item is scored on a scale of 0-4, and the greater the score, the worse the pain and function. The total score of the subjects from this index was reported from a total of 96.</description>

    <description>Hot Pack will be applied before session for general relaxation for 10 minutes. Knee isometric exercises will be performed via an EMG Biofeedback device; patients in the EMG BF group will receive visual and auditory feedback.Knee isometrics will be performed with 5 seconds hold. Then, the muscle will be relaxed for 10 seconds and the cycle repeated for a total of 15 minutes. (20 reps, 3 sets) Session will be performed thrice a week for six weeks.</description>

    <description>Hot Pack will be applied before session for general relaxation 10 minutes. In the control group, the active electrode will not be connected, so subjects will not receive any feedback from the device. Knee isometrics perform with 5 seconds hold. Then, the muscle will be relaxed for 10 seconds and the cycle repeated for a total of 15 minutes. (20 reps, 3 sets)Session will be performed thrice a week for six weeks.</description>
