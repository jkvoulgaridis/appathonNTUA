      The purpose of the Chinese Essential Tremor Registry (CETR) is to develop a database of
      patients with Essential tremor in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders and affects approximately
      1% of the population worldwide. Twin and family history studies show a high heritability for
      essential tremor. The molecular genetic determinants of essential tremor are unknown. Some
      mutations have been found in ET families but have not been validated in others. The
      pathophysiological basis of ET remains unknown. In 2017, a task force of the International
      Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society proposed a new formal definition of essential tremor
      as a syndrome of isolated tremor of both upper limbs with a duration of at least 3 years,
      with or without tremor in other locations, such as head, larynx (voice tremor), or lower
      limbs. Defining essential tremor as a syndrome and not as a single disease, while
      concomitantly narrowing its phenotypic scope to increase its homogeneity, recognizes that
      there are multiple possible causes, which may facilitate progress in understanding the
      pathogenesis. Investigators aim to establish a database of longitudinal recruited ET cohort,
      and characterize the clinical feature, genetic basis, environmental factors and their
      interactions among different ET subtypes in China, identify natural history of a
      highly-presentative Chinese ET cohort and to discern major milestones in the disease process
      which indicates disease progression.

      Data were collected at baseline. Information about detailed disease history, level of
      education, significant chronic comorbidities, physical examination, medication history,
      family history, living habits and toxic exposure history, which include smoking, drinking
      tea, alcoholic consumption, drinking coffee, exposure to pesticide or occupational solvent,
      history of carbon monoxide poisoning and recurrent head trauma will be recorded at baseline.
      For each evaluation, the same questionnaires will be conducted. A standardized neurological
      assessment according to the recommendation of Consensus on the construction of clinical
      database of Parkinson's disease and movement disorders in China.

      The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) includes both performance and
      Activities of Daily Living (ADL) subscales. It is conducted for the clinical measurement of
      ET severity and tremor's impact on ADL. The non-motor symptoms are evaluated by Non-motor
      Symptom Scale (NMSS).Functional constipation was diagnosed by the Rome III diagnostic
      criteria. Excessive daytime sleepiness was evaluated by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).
      Probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (p-RBD) was diagnosed by rapid eye
      movement sleep behavior questionnaire-Hongkong (RBDQ-HK). Restless leg syndrome (RLS) was
      diagnosed with the Cambridge Hopkins Restless Leg syndrome questionnaire (CH-RLSq). Cognitive
      assessment was used the previously validated scale, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).
      Olfaction test was carried out by Hyposmia Rating Scale (HRS), a proportion of patients was
      also ascertained by Sniffin's Sticks. Depression was diagnosed by Hamilton Depression Scale
      (HAMD).DNA samples extracted from peripheral blood and all the ET patients will be examed by
      Whole Exome Sequencing or Whole-genome sequencing. All the participants are scanned by
      structural MRI to exclude obvious intracranial lesions and other metabolic disorders, etc.

    <measure>The tremor's impact on activities of daily living and clinical measurement of ET severity are evaluated by The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>TETRAS consists of two subscales. The first one, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Subscale contains 12 self-scored items, rating tremor's impact on ADL in a 0-4 Likert-type scale. Total score varies from 0-48. Higher score indicates a bigger impact on activities of daily living. The second part is the Performance Subscale, and is rated by clinicians'examination. The subscale is formed by 9 items that rate action tremor in the head, face, voice, limbs, and trunk from 0 to 4. Total score varies from 0-64. Higher score indicates severer tremor. For most items, the scores are defined only by whole numbers, but 0.5 increments may be used if you believe the rating is between two whole number ratings and cannot be reconciled to a whole number. Each 0.5 increment in rating is specifically defined for the assessment of upper limb postural and kinetic tremor and the dot approximation task (items 4 and 8).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The non-motor symptoms are evaluated by Non-motor Symptom Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale includes 30 items which is divided into 9 domains. Total score varies from 0-360. Higher score indicates severer symptoms. Domain 1 evaluates cardiovascular system symptoms. Score of domain 1 varies from 0-24. Domain 2 evaluates sleep condition. Score of domain 2 varies from 0-48. Domain 3 evaluates cognitive function. Score of domain 3 varies from 0-72. Domain 4 evaluates illusion. Score of domain 4 varies from 0-36. Domain 5 evaluates attention and memory. Score of domain 5 varies from 0-36. Domain 6 evaluates gastrointestinal symptoms. Score of domain 6 varies from 0-36. Domain 7 evaluates urinary symptoms. Score of domain 7 varies from 0-36. Domain 8 evaluate sensory symptoms. Score of domain 8 varies from 0-24. Domain 9 evaluates other non-motor symptoms. Score of domain 9 varies from 0-48.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive condition is assessed by Mini Mental State Examination.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale includes 30 items. Score of all the questions will be summed. All items were rated on a 2-point scale (0-1), with a minimal score of 0, and maximum total score of 30. A higher score demonstrates more better cognitive condition. The definition of cognitive disorder differs in education level. For illiteracy, presence of cognitive impairment is defined as MMSE score. For those only receive elementary education, the cut-off value is 20. For other patients, presence of cognitive impairment was defined as MMSE scores less than 25.</description>

    <measure>Olfaction test was measured by Hyposmia Rating Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale includes 6 items. Score of all the questions will be summed. All items were rated on a 4-point scale (1-4), with a minimal score of 6, and maximum total score of 24. A higher score demonstrates more worse sense of olfaction. The cutoff value HRS is 22.5.</description>

    <measure>Depression was diagnosed by Hamilton and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale includes 17 items. Score of all the questions will be summed. Total score ranges from0-53. A higher score demonstrates more severer depression. The study participants were defined to be not depressed (scores 0-6), to have minor depression (scores 7-14), or to have major depression (scores above 14) at the different visits during follow-up.</description>

    <description>This scale includes 8 items. Score of all the questions will be summed. All items were rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), with a minimal score of 0, and maximum total score of 24. A higher score demonstrates more severe excessive daytime sleepiness. Participants were classified as showing excessive daytime sleepiness if their total score ≥10.</description>

    <description>This scale includes 13 items. Score of all the questions will be summed. Total score of the answers ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores reflect severer rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
