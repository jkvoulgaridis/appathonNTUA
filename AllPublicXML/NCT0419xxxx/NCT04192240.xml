  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Are there differences in immediate changes following STS and stepping training with or
           without using external feedback in ambulatory patients with stroke?

        2. Does STS and stepping training using of external feedback immediately change functional
           ability of ambulatory patients with stroke?

        3. Does STS and stepping training without external feedback immediately change the
           functional ability of ambulatory patients with stroke?

        4. How does the amount of LLSA on the affected leg during STS and stepping in ambulatory
           patients with stroke as compare to the data from healthy individuals?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are patients with stroke, the age of over 40 years to 74 years, both males and
      females who are able to walk independently at least 10 meters. Most of them will be recruited
      from the Srinagarind hospital and communities in the Northeast area of Thailand. Subjects
      have to participate in STS and stepping training with and without using the external feedback
      for 1 time/condition with a wash-out period for 2 weeks (crossover design). The outcomes will
      be measured in terms of the amount of LLSA on the affected side during STS and stepping,
      walking speed, level walking symmetry, dynamic balance control.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare immediate effects of amount and duration of
      LLSA of STS and stepping training with and without the use of external feedback in ambulatory
      patients with stroke. Secondary objective of study are to compare immediate changes after STS
      and stepping training with the use of external feedback relating to amount of LLSA in
      ambulatory patients with stroke, to compare immediate changes after STS and stepping training
      without the use of external feedback relating to amount of LLSA in ambulatory patients with
      stroke and to investigate amount of LLSA of the affected leg during STS and stepping in
      ambulatory patients with stroke as compare to healthy individuals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of lower limb support ability (LLSA) by digital load cell</measure>
    <time_frame>before training and immediately after complete training program in one session</time_frame>
    <description>LLSA was assessed using digital load cells of the VWTM without turning on the displayed section.
For the LLSA during STS, the subjects sat on the adjustable chair with placing their feet on two separated digital load cells. Then, they were instructed to stand up with the attempt to adequately control LLSA of each lower extremity.
For the LLSA during stepping, subjects will stand in a step stance position with placing the affected leg on the load cells of VWTM and the non-affected leg slightly backward outside the load cells. Then they were instructed to step the non-affected leg forward and backward with the attempt to adequately shift their body-weight onto the affected leg as much as possible.
The tests were performed for 5 trials, in which the first 2 trials served as practice trials, and the average outcomes over the other 3 trials were used in data analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of walking speed by 10 meter-walk test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>before training and immediately after complete training program in one session</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects stood at the starting point of a 10-meter walkway with their feet behind the line. Then, they were instructed to walk at a preferred or comfortable speed along a straight line without any break to the endpoint with or without a walking device. Moreover, they were instructed to walk at the fastest speed. During walking, subjects were filmed while they walk along the middle 4-meter of the walkway using the digital camera with a frame rate of 60 Hz. The data were further analyzed for step length, stride length and cadence to convert for a walking speed using the method of manual digitization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of dynamic balance control by Timed up and go test (TUGT)</measure>
    <time_frame>before training and immediately after complete training program in one session</time_frame>
    <description>The test was executed by the subjects sat on a standard armchair with their back upright 90 degrees against the backrest of the chair and their feet placed flat on the floor at 10 cm behind the knees. Then, they were required to stand up from the chair, walk 3 m, turned around a traffic cone, walked back to sit down on the chair at a preferred speed and safe manner with or without a walking device. The test was recorded the time taken in seconds from the command &quot;Go&quot; until the subject's back touch the backrest of the chair.</description>
