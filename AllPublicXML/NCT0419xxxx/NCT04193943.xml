    <textblock>
      Evaluate the accuracy, in the diagnosis of critical illness myopathy and / or neuropathy, of
      the simplified peroneal nerve test performed by a neurophysiopathology technician or by a
      neurophysiopathology doctor (as the gold standard) compared to the exam performed by an
      intensivist.
