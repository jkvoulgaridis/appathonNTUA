  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that masculinizing top surgery (e.g., mastectomy and chest
      masculinization) leads to an improvement in self-report chest dysphoria, gender dysphoria,
      and gender congruence in assigned-female-at-birth, transgender and non-binary youth and young
      adults. This is a prospective, observational study that will enroll assigned-female-at-birth,
      transmasculine spectrum individuals age 13 to 25 years old who are or are not undergoing top
      surgery. Participants will complete a set of standard of care questionnaires regarding their
      chest dysphoria (e.g., distress about the chest), gender dysphoria (e.g., distress about a
      gender identity that does not match assigned sex), and gender congruence (e.g., degree to
      which an individual feels they are living in their authentic appearance and gender identity).
      They will complete this same set of questionnaires either three months after their top
      surgery or three months after the initial set of surveys.
