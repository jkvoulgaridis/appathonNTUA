  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urological malignancies such as prostate cancer and renal cell cancer in Korean population
      have been increased due to the aged population and the westernized lifestyles. With the
      advancement of sequencing technologies, use of genetic mutation profiles in cancer detection
      and progression has been increased. However, use of circulating tumor DNA in urological
      malignances have been limited and few studies have been reported. Therefore, we tried to
      evaluate the usefulness of circulating tumor DNA in detection and monitoring of urological
      malignancies in Korean population. This study aims to use circulating tumor DNA in plasma and
      urine for the diagnosis, disease progression monitoring and therapeutic response evaluation.
      This study plan includes building big databases for circulating tumor DNA of urological
      malignancies in Korean population and to develop optimized circulating tumor DNA platform.
