  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether disruptions in the skin barrier of parents
      can contribute to the development of food allergies in their offspring. The study team will
      compare the superficial skin layers of mothers and fathers who do not have children with
      diagnosed food allergies to the skin layers of parents who do have children with diagnosed
      food allergy. The study will include a questionnaire, noninvasive superficial skin testing
      with skin tapping and transepidermal water loss measurements, and a blood draw.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an already well-established link between atopic dermatitis (AD), or eczema, and the
      development of food allergies. More specifically, it is believed that sensitizations to food
      can occur through low-dose cutaneous sensitization via a disrupted skin barrier. The
      strongest genetic contributor to eczema is the FLG loss-of-function or missense mutation,
      which is associated with increased transepidermal water loss and increased skin permeability
      (1). In a recent study exploring the risk of maternal transmission of allergic risk, it was
      found that children of FLG-carrier mothers had a 1.5 increased AD risk, specifically when
      these mothers had allergic sensitization (elevated allergen-specific IgE antibody plasma
      levels) but independent of their own FLG mutation status (10). This information may suggest
      that an interrupted skin barrier in mothers may serve as an environmental risk factor for the
      development of food allergies in their offspring.

      The purpose of our study is to evaluate the skin characteristics and FLG gene mutation status
      of parents of known food allergic pediatric patients. The researchers hypothesize that
      parents of food allergic patients will have more significant disruptions in their skin
      barrier function than parents of children who do not suffer from food allergies.

      In order to evaluate skin barrier disruptions in these subjects, two noninvasive methods will
      be performed including skin tape stripping, a total of 30 strips per subject, and
      transepidermal water loss measurements using a small device. Both methods are relatively
      painless and cause minimal risk to the participant. In order to evaluated FLG gene mutation
      status, blood draw will also be performed. Subjects will undergo a focused physical exam and
      also be requested to fill out a detailed questionnaire. The researchers will obtain
      additional offspring peanut allergy clinical characteristics from the medical records. All
      data collection will occur over 1-2 visits, averaging an anticipated 1 hour in total
      duration.

    <description>The researchers will identify patients or study subjects aged 1-18 who have been diagnosed with peanut allergy based on skin prick testing, serologic testing, and/or history of reaction. They will then contact mothers or fathers of these patients/subjects who are 18 and older and enroll those who do not themselves have a history of food allergy, with a goal of 40 subjects per group.
The researchers will perform a very limited physical exam followed by skin tape stripping (30 strips) for lipid profile and protein expression, and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements every 5 strips. They will obtain blood work to define FLG mutation and vitamin D status. Questionnaires on their background, other concurrent atopic and nonatopic diseases, and exposures, will also be collected.</description>

With every 5 tape strips collected, transepidermal water loss measurements will be performed.</description>

    <description>A small device will be used to measure transepidermal water loss (TEWL), which is the quantity of water that passes from inside the body through the skin to the surrounding atmosphere via diffusion and evaporation process. The device, a probe, is simply placed against the skin surface making superficial contact and kept there for a few seconds until the measurement terminates. This will be performed at baseline and after every 5 tape strips.</description>

        Peanut allergic patients/subjects will be identified via the NJH EMR or database. Parents
        may be approached by listed study staff at the beginning or end of their scheduled NJH
        visit and asked about their food allergy history and interest in enrollment. Alternatively,
        this may be done over the phone. Thereafter, eligibility will be determined using the
        listed inclusion and exclusion criteria.
