  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well a donor stem cell transplant, treosulfan, fludarabine,
      and total-body irradiation work in treating patients with blood cancers (hematological
      malignancies). Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell
      transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming
      cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from
      rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into
      the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white
      blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune
      cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (HIGH DOSE TREOSULFAN): Patients receive high dose treosulfan intravenously (IV) over
      120 minutes on days -6 to -4 and fludarabine IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -2. Patients
      then undergo total-body irradiation on day -1 and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation on day 0. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days
      3-4. Beginning on day 5, patients receive cyclosporine IV twice daily (BID) over 1-2 hours or
      orally (PO) (after 3 months, in the absence of GVHD, cyclosporine tapering will start by
      5-10% per week, until drug withdrawal at 6 months post-transplant). Beginning on day 5,
      patients also receive mycophenolate sodium PO three times daily (TID) or mycophenolate
      mofetil IV or PO TID until day 35 (may be continued if active GVHD is present). Beginning on
      day 5, patients also receive filgrastim until the absolute neutrophil count is &gt; 1,000/uL for
      3 consecutive days.

      ARM B (LOW DOSE TREOSULFAN): Patients receive low dose treosulfan IV over 120 minutes on days
      -6 to -4 and fludarabine IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -2. Patients then undergo
      total-body irradiation and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and receive
      cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate sodium or mycophenolate mofetil, and filgrastim
      as in Arm A.

      After completion of transplant, patients are followed up at 28, 56, 84, 365, and 730 days.

          -  DONOR: Age &gt;= 12 years

          -  DONOR: Weight &gt;= 40 Kg

          -  DONOR: Ability of donors younger than 18 years of age to undergo apheresis without use
             of a vascular access device. Vein check must be performed and verified by an apheresis
             nurse prior to arrival at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA)

          -  DONOR: Donor must meet selection criteria as defined by the Foundation of the
             Accreditation of Cell Therapy (FACT) and will be screened per the American Association
             of Blood Banks (AABB) guidelines

          -  DONOR: In case of more available haploidentical donors, selection criteria should
             include, in this order:

               -  For cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative recipients, a CMV seronegative donor

               -  Red blood cell compatibility

                    -  Red blood cell (RBC) cross match compatible

                    -  Minor ABO incompatibility

                    -  Major ABO incompatibility

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of liver synthetic dysfunction or severe cirrhosis will be
             excluded

          -  Active, uncontrolled, life-threatening viral, bacterial or fungal infection requiring
             treatment at time of conditioning regiment administration and transplantation

          -  Presence of a malignancy other than the one for which the transplant is being
             performed, with an expected survival less than 75% at 5 years

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Known hypersensitivity to treosulfan, fludarabine or cyclophosphamide

          -  Dosing with another investigational agent within 30 days prior to entry in the study

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement not clearing with intrathecal
             chemotherapy and/or cranial radiation prior to initiation of conditioning (day -6)

          -  DONOR: Since detection of anti-donor-specific-antigen antibodies (anti-DSA) is
             associated with higher graft rejection rate, patients will be screened for anti-DSA
             pre-transplant, and in case of positivity, the donor will be excluded
