      Investigators will develop and pilot test a culturally tailored, trauma-informed smartphone
      app, called LinkPositively, for Black WLHA affected by interpersonal violence. Core
      components of LinkPositively include: a) Virtual Peer Navigation that includes phone and text
      check-ins and 4 weekly one-on-one video sessions to build skills to cope with barriers and
      navigate care; b) Social Networking platform to receive peer support; c) Educational and
      Self-care database with healthy living and self-care tips; d) GPS-enabled Resource Locator
      for HIV care and ancillary support service agencies; and e) ART self-monitoring and reminder
      system. The study will be conducted in 2 phases with corresponding aims. In Phase 1 (Aim 1),
      4 focus groups with Black WLHA with experiences of interpersonal violence, one focus group
      with peer navigators, and 4-6 key informant interviews with providers will be conducted to
      determine which app features, content, and functions are most likely to support downloading,
      initiating use, and sustaining engagement over time. Aim 1 will culminate in usability
      testing by Black WLHA affected by interpersonal violence (n=8), to finalize intervention
      components and procedures. In Phase 2 (Aim 2), investigators will pilot test LinkPositively
      to assess feasibility and acceptability and determine preliminary effects of the intervention
      on HIV care outcomes (i.e., retention in care, ART adherence, viral suppression) and
      mechanism of change variables (i.e., social support, self-efficacy). Through a randomized
      control trial (RCT), participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention arm
      (n=40) or control arm (Ryan White standard of care, n=40), with follow-up at 3- and 6-
      months. This study will benefit the advancement of HIV prevention science by harnessing
      technology to promote engagement in HIV care, while improving social support through peers
      and social networking-all under the auspices of being trauma-informed for Black WLHA with
      experiences of interpersonal violence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the US, Black women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) are less likely to be engaged in care,
      adherent to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and virally suppressed compared to White WLHA.
      Black women are also disproportionately affected by interpersonal violence - physical,
      sexual, and/or psychological abuse by a current or former intimate partner or non-intimate
      partner - which may co-occur with poor mental health and/or substance use, further
      contributing to ART non-adherence, lower CD4 counts, and reduced viral suppression. Peer
      Navigation, while highlighted as a successful model of care in improving HIV care outcomes,
      requires resources that HIV service agencies often lack. A scalable and sustainable solution
      is the use of mobile health (mHealth) smartphone applications (&quot;apps&quot;). Although there has
      been an increase in mHealth interventions developed for HIV prevention and care among at-risk
      and HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) and youth, investigators are unaware of any
      to improve retention in care, ART adherence, and viral suppression among Black WLHA, nor any
      mHealth interventions that are responsive to Black women's experiences with interpersonal
      violence. To address this gap, investigators will develop and pilot test a culturally
      tailored, trauma-informed smartphone app, called LinkPositively, for Black WLHA affected by
      interpersonal violence. Core components of LinkPositively include: a) Virtual Peer Navigation
      that includes phone and text check-ins and 4 weekly one-on-one video sessions to build skills
      to cope with barriers and navigate care; b) Social Networking platform to receive peer
      support; c) Educational and Self-care database with healthy living and self-care tips; d)
      GPS-enabled Resource Locator for HIV care and ancillary support service agencies; and e) ART
      self-monitoring and reminder system. Guided by the Theory of Triadic Influences and Syndemic
      Theory, the study will be conducted in 2 phases with corresponding aims. In Aim 1, 4 focus
      groups with Black WLHA with experiences of interpersonal violence, one focus group with peer
      navigators, and 4-6 key informant interviews with providers will be conducted to determine
      which app features, content, and functions are most likely to support downloading, initiating
      use, and sustaining engagement over time. Aim 1 will culminate in usability testing by Black
      WLHA affected by interpersonal violence (n=5), to finalize intervention components and
      procedures. In Aim 2, investigators will pilot test LinkPositively to assess feasibility and
      acceptability and determine preliminary effects of the intervention on HIV care outcomes
      (i.e., retention in care, ART adherence, viral suppression) and mechanism of change variables
      (i.e., social support, self-efficacy). Participants will be randomly assigned to either the
      intervention (n=40) or control (Ryan White standard of care, n=40) arm, with follow-up at 3-
      and 6- months. This study will benefit the advancement of HIV prevention science by
      harnessing technology to promote engagement in HIV care, while improving social support
      through peers and social networking - all under the auspices of being trauma-informed for
      Black WLHA with experiences of interpersonal violence.

    <description>Women assigned to the control arm will receive self-directed (non-Virtual Peer Navigator (PN) supported) treatment as usual at the HIV care service provider of choice following the Ryan White standard of care (i.e., referrals to physical, dental and mental health services; case management; and ancillary services. Annual assessments (e.g., updates on insurance, housing, referrals needed, behavioral assessment [e.g., depression, substance use]) are conducted by a case manager. For women who have fallen out of care and re-engage care, case management begins with an interview and assessment of current needs. Goals are set to create an individual care plan related to medical care, housing, and other resources, as needed. Referrals are made to appropriate services (e.g., primary care, housing, benefits counseling, food, support services) based on the intake assessment. It is important to note that the case management approach is self-guided versus intensive virtual PN assistance.</description>

    <description>Women assigned to the LinkPositively intervention arm will have access to all four components of the LinkPositively app. Women will be scheduled for a session with staff to inform them of their assigned virtual Peer Navigator (PN). Staff will train participants on how to download the app, explain the five components, using each component, and contacting their PN. Within the first week after, virtual PNs will complete a one-on-one, in-person or phone intake session with the participant, based on the participant's preference. During this intake session, the PN will conduct a participant needs assessment to connect her to HIV medical care via local health clinics and identify other areas of need, services of need, and assisted referrals (domestic violence services, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, housing and legal support, etc.). PNs will provide trauma-informed emotional and informational support, including guidance on accessing information about referred services.</description>
