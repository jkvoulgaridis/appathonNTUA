  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is set up due to regulatory purposes and to collect routine clinical data of the
      mobile-bearing implant univation XM. The study is designed as a prospective follow-up study
      with a historic patient cohort who have been treated with the product under investigation two
      years ago. This design is selected to quicker realize follow-up data as patients have already
      been treated in the past.

      As the mobile version of the implant is not widely used, the study will be set up as a
      monocentric study in France. The clinical hypothesis of the study is that patients who are
      treated with the product under investigation have a similar outcome and survival rate in
      comparison to other established unicondylar knee systems on the market. Comparison for the
      later evaluation will be taken out of recent orthopaedic registries.

    <description>Postoperative Development of knee joint function measured with the Knee Society Score (KSS). The KSS is composed of two subgroups &quot;Knee Score&quot; and &quot;Function Score&quot;; both parts have a maximum score of 100, where higher values represent better results.</description>

    <measure>Development of Oxford Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>in the postoperative course, up to 5 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A patient-reported outcome instrument which contains 12 questions on activities of daily living that assess function and residual pain in patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) arthroplasty. Oxford Knee Score has a maximum of 48 points indicating satisfactory knee function</description>

    <measure>Intraoperative/surgery Data</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical and intraoperative data collected will include the date and duration of the surgery, selected implants and sizes, blood loss and implant descriptions. Surgical duration is to be measured from the time of incision to the time of skin closure, skin-to-skin. All potential Adverse Events will be collected during the surgical procedure and/or from the surgical record and will be documented on the intra-operative Evaluation Form.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>in the postoperative course, up to 5 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome and function of a knee prosthesis is influenced by the postoperative alignment of the leg and the orientation in reference to the axis. Incorrect positioning can lead to an increased implant wear and functional limitations; The aim of a postoperative alignment within 3° varus to 3° valgus will be assessed using long leg x-rays up to 5 years after surgery</description>

    <measure>Rate of Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>in the postoperative course, up to 5 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>As part of the follow-up examination, any upcoming (serious) adverse device events or effects related or not related to the product under investigation, will be documented in the dedicated Case Report Forms. Recorded complications will be categorized and analyzed in order to assess the safety of the univation XM prosthesis</description>
