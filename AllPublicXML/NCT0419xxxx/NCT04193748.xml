      This study was conducted to estimate the hypothesis that the Pomegranate Extracts have no
      role in management of oral lichen planus

    <textblock>
      Lichen planus is a common chronic mucocutaneous disease of uncertain origin that has been
      shown to affect 0.5% to 2.2% of various populations. The treatment options for OLP are
      numerous and include topical and systemic agents. Steroids were found effective in management
      of OLP with contraindicated use in some systemic diseases and with multiple side effects with
      its prolonged use. Pomegranates have been known for hundreds of years for their multiple
      health benefits, including anti-inflammatory activity. The recent surge indicates that
      pomegranates and their extracts may serve as natural alternatives to drugs which can offer a
      possible management of OLP decreasing pain and discomfort associated with this chronic
      condition.The aim of this study was the evaluation of the effect of topical pomegranate
      extracts in management of oral lichen planus lesions (OLP).
