  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the incidence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is on the
      rise globally, how to improve the intrauterine environment of the offspring and prevent
      obesity and metabolic diseases from the early life has become a medical research. Since 2012,
      journals such as Nature and Science have reported that intestinal micro-ecological
      environments composed of intestinal microbes and their interactions are involved in human
      body and energy metabolism, and a variety of metabolic diseases including obesity and type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The incidence is closely related. Although intestinal microbes have
      an important impact on human health, the research on intestinal microecology during pregnancy
      is still in its infancy. The current research is still unclear about the relationship between
      intestinal microecology and pregnancy outcomes and whether it can be a potential target for
      regulating maternal metabolism and fetal intrauterine environment. Therefore, this study aims
      to regulate overweight/obese pregnant women by using prebiotic-containing dairy products to
      explore the effects of interventions targeting intestinal microbes on glucose and lipid
      metabolism, insulin resistance and risk of GDM in overweight/obese pregnant women. In order
      to improve the intrauterine environment and reduce the risk of fetal diseases. It is of great
      significance and value to improve the quality of the birth population in China and to
      alleviate the medical economic burden caused by obesity and metabolic diseases.
