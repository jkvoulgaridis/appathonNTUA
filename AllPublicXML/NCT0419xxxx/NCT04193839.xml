  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric prospective pre and post-intervention study, aiming at analyzing the
      efficacy of the Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) plus Bar Code Medication
      Administration (BCMA) as compared to paper order entry in reducing medication erros (MEs) in
      the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medication errors are a burden to the health care system. The neonatal population, in
      particular the infants admitted to the NICU, are at higher risk of MEs as compared to the
      adult and pediatric population. Moreover adverse events (ADEs) occur more frequently and may
      be particularly severe in neonates.

      Several strategies have been tried in order to decrease the incidence of MEs in the NICU.
      Among these, some studies investigated the effectiveness of CPOE in reducing MEs in
      hospitalised patients. However, results have been inconsistent. So far, no study investigated
      the association of CPOE + BCMA in neonates.

      The investigators designed a monocentric prospective pre and post-intervention observational
      study to investigate the efficacy of the CPOE plus BCMA as compared to paper order entry in
      reducing MEs in the NICU population.

    <description>Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) refers to the process of providers entering and sending treatment instructions - including medication, laboratory, and radiology orders - via a computer application rather than paper, fax, or telephone. The bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) is a system that consists of a bar code reader, a portable or desktop computer with wireless connection, a computer server, and some software. Before the administration of medications to the patients the patient unique barcode identification is scanned in order to verify the patient's identity.</description>
