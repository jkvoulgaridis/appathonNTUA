  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many descriptive studies in the literature on health behaviors of university
      youth.However, there are a limited number of model-based interventional studies explaining
      the development of positive health behaviors of students in the university period.In this
      context, this study &quot;Applied to University Students The aim of this study will be to
      determine the Impact of Health Promotion Program on Developing Healthy Nutrition and Physical
      Activity Behaviors.This study was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study to
      determine the effect of the health promotion program applied to university students on the
      development of healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. The general population of the
      study will be composed of students enrolled in a formal education program at Istanbul Medipol
      University between January and September 2019.

      The study population will consist of students with a body mass index between 25-35 kg / m², a
      mean nutritional behavior score of 2 or less, no regular physical activity, and no
      musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, metabolic or other systemic problems that prevent
      exercise.The sample size was calculated by power analysis. In the calculation, 0,80 power
      value, 0,05 error level, 0,60 'relationship is predicted, sampling 45 students to the
      experiment, 45 students to the control group was found to be appropriate. Experimental and
      control groups will be appointed by making probable selection from the study universe. In the
      study process, 10 substitutes were selected considering that there could be subjects who
      could leave the research. After all; 55 people in the experimental group and 55 people in the
      control group were selected by sampling. The sample consisted of 110 students.

      1. In order to identify the risky students in the study universe, a stand will be opened in
           the most crowded area and the most frequently used area of the campus.

        2. As a result of the screening, body mass indexes are between 25-35 kg / m², nutritional
           behavior score is 2 or less, do not perform regular physical activity and do not have
           problems related to musculoskeletal system, cardiopulmonary system, metabolic system and
           other systems. Students will be admitted to the study universe.

        3. Assignment will be made to the experimental and control groups by making probable
           selection from the study population.

        4. Measurements of physical and cognitive variables of experimental and control groups will
           be made.

        5. Health Promotion Modeled Health Promotion Program (Annex-1) will be applied to the
           experimental group. Health promotion program; The Web-based Health Promotion Program
           includes individual counseling and reminder practices. The content of the Web Based
           Health Promotion Program is given in Annex-2. The control group will be given
           educational brochures to develop healthy eating and physical activity behaviors.

        6. Measurements of physical and cognitive variables of experimental and control groups at
           1st, 3rd and 6th months will be made.

        7. The data will be analyzed and evaluated statistically.

        8. Report will be written.
