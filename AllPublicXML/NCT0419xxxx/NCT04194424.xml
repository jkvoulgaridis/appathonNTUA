  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project aims at evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a multi-disciplinary
      weight loss program, using an innovative and simple dietary intervention at the American
      University of Beirut Medical Center (AUB-MC). Such intervention is expected to enhance
      patients' compliance and adherence to lifestyle changes. In addition, the program includes
      supervised exercise sessions and behavioral therapy. Therefore, our project proposes an
      evidence based approach to close the obesity treatment gaps.

          -  Pregnant obese patients

          -  Patients with pacemakers
