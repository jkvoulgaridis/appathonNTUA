  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the different profiles of patients with early
      caries consulting at the Lille CHU and to analyse the characteristics associated with the
      severity of the pathology. The data will be collected using a simple clinical examination of
      the child and a survey of the parent using a questionnaire. The typology of patients with
      early caries will be analysed according to the predefined variables collected using the
      questionnaire via a main component analysis in order to study the links between these
      variables. At the same time, a hierarchical classification analysis will be carried out to
      study the existence of homogeneous sub-groups of individuals in regard to the early caries.
      These sub-groups will be described
