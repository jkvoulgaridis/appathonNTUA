  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nationwide cohort study on real-world patients (n≈30,000) surviving a first
      myocardial infarction (MI) 2006-2013 and alive to attend a routine 1-year follow-up.
      Associations between Socioeconomic Status (SES) and secondary preventive actions (SPAs)
      throughout the first year is studied and assessed as possible mechanisms underlying the
      increased risk of a first recurrent hard cardiocvascular (CV) outcome, recurrent
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (rASCVD), in patients with low Socioeconomic Status
      during long-term follow-up (2006-2018).
