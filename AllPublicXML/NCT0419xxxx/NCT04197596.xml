  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BK cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) manufactured with the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy Cytokine Capture
      System will be safe and effective in decreasing specific viral load in children, adolescents
      and young adults (CAYA) with refractory BK infection post Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Transplantation (AlloHSCT) or with primary immunodeficiencies (PID).
