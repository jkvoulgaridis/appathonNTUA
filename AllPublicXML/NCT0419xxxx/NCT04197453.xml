  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      cvMOBIUS is a North American registry of patients with ASCVD aimed at understanding patterns
      of care in ASCVD while evaluating the real world effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate the effectiveness of proprotein convertase
      subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (PCSK9i) to reduce cardiovascular events among
      subjects presenting with a recent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event in
      real-world practice. A total of 8500 patients with a recent cardiovascular event who are
      likely to be eligible for non-statin lipid lowering therapy will be enrolled and followed
      prospectively for five years. In addition, the study will assess longitudinal patterns of
      lipid control, clinical outcomes, and LLT including statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors
      in adults with an ASCVD event and/or revascularization. This study will also compare the
      clinical characteristics and outcomes of subjects enrolled in both arms of the registry to
      understand the strengths and limitations of data harvested directly from electronic health
      record (EHR) systems as compared with prospectively collected information.
