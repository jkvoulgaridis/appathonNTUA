      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fasting time and blood glucose levels
      on postoperative agitations in pediatric patients who will undergo outpatient surgery.

    <textblock>
      Emergence delirium is a very important clinic phenomenon, characterized by irritability and
      severe restlessness in children recovering from anesthesia; it may cause injury to the child
      recovering from anesthesia or to surgical site and may also lead to parents, who witness
      emergence delirium to question the quality of anesthesia. Postoperative agitaitons, has been
      noted with the newer, less soluble inhaled agents and emergence delirium has become a serious
      problem, taken care in postanesthesia care unit for anesthesiologists. Preoperative anxiety,
      premedication, anesthetic drugs, pain, type of surgery and emergence in a foreign environment
      are the factors which take part in the development of emergence delirium. Emotional and less
      social children, the children with anxious parents, children undergoing upper airway surgery
      are under risk. Detection of children at risk, the use of appropriate adjuvant drugs, strict
      control of postoperative pain, and accompanying parents to their children in the recovery
      room are currently the primary measures to prevent recovery agitation. Further studies are
      required to discover underlying causes and management of emergence delirium.

      In this study pre-and postoperative blood glucose values, preoperative fasting times and
      hemodynamic values of 200 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-2
      patients will be recorded. At the end of the operation, patients will be evaluated with
      Modified Aldrete Sedation Scale, FLACC Pain Rating Scale and PAED Agitation Scale. The
      results obtained will be evaluated with statistical methods and the relationship between
      preoperative fasting time and blood glucose levels and postoperative agitations will be
      investigated.
