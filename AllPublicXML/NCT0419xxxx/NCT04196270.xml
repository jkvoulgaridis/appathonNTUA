  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind dose-finding trial is based on a biased coin up-and-down sequential design,
      where the volume of local anesthetic administered to each patient depends on the response
      from the previous one. The TQL block is performed preoperatively, and the first patient
      recruited receives 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.75%. In case of block failure, the next patient
      will receive a higher volume (defined as the previous volume with an increment of 2 mL).
      Given a successful block for the first patient, the next patient will be randomized to either
      a lower volume (defined as the previous volume with a reduction of 2 mL) or the same volume
      as the previous patient. The respective probabilities being b=0.11 for a reduced volume and
      1-b=0.89 for the same volume. Block success is defined as patient reported numeric rated
      scale (NRS) pain (NRS value ≤ 3 (0-10/10)), 30 minutes after arrival in the post anesthesia
      care unit (PACU). The NRS pain value is our primary and only outcome in the evaluation of the
      block. A minimum of 25 eligible patients are needed to achieve precise estimation of MEV90
      with narrow 95% confidence intervals derived by bootstrapping. Following inclusion of 25
      patients early termination is considered when interim analysis shows sufficiently
      stabilization of MEV90 estimate. The final sample size is not known a priori, but a maximum
      of 40 patients will be enrolled in the trial.

    <intervention_model_description>The biased coin up-and-down sequential design (BCD) should be considered for direct determination of higher quantiles (ED90 and ED95) which provide useful clinical knowledge. The BCD was developed in the field of pharmacology and toxicology and was formulated by Durham et al. in 1997. In the BCD, volume assignment is carried out in a sequential and interactive method, which avoids that patients are randomized to doses with toxicity risk and seeks to concentrate treatments around the suitable doses.</intervention_model_description>
