  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of the SONIC trial represented a significant advance in the management of
      patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease by demonstrating the superiority of the
      combination of an alpha TNF anti-TNF with immunosuppressive therapy in naive patients
      (infliximab and azathioprine) compared to monotherapy in terms of clinical and endoscopic
      remission (40% versus 22%, p = 0.017). The benefit of this combination therapy is both
      pharmacological (addition, or even synergy of the two treatments) and immunological
      (reduction of the risk of immunization to biotherapy).

      Data on the use of immunosuppressive methotrexate treatment are divergent. Indeed, a previous
      randomized trial suggested that the combination of anti-TNF alpha including infliximab and
      methotrexate was no more effective than anti-TNF alpha monotherapy in patients with Crohn's
      disease. However, the superiority of this combination has been clearly demonstrated over
      monotherapy in rheumatology for a long time.

      In practice, more and more practitioners are prescribing this combination (antiTNF and MTX)
      in IBD patients because of tolerance problems, particularly to azathioprine or in patients
      with a dual expression of their disease, both digestive and joint.

      The interest of my thesis work is therefore to be able to clarify these grey areas and to be
      able to modify or comfort therapeutic choices in practice.

      Data will be extracted from medical records (age, gender, smoking status, date of diagnosis
      of chronic inflammatory disease, date of first prescription of antiTNF alpha either
      infliximab or adalimumab, date of start and end of immunosuppressive azathioprine/6MP and/or
      metrotrexate, mode of administration of per os or SC/IV treatment, efficacy based on
      validated clinical scores HBI-PDAI-Mayo, tolerance). A collection will be made on the
      University Hospital from a computer workstation. An analysis will then be carried out to
      write the publication secondarily. The data retention period will be one year from November
      2019 to November 2020 depending on the duration of this thesis work, which is estimated at
      one year.

      Expected results and prospects : &quot; Methotrexate-associated antiTNF alpha combination therapy
      is as effective and safe as traditional azathioprine combination therapy in patients with
      IBD. The positive results may in practice lead to changes in our practices and give first
      priority to this combination therapy with methotrexate. &quot;
