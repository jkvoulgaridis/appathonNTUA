      GÖTHA- The early arthritis and psoriasis study of Region Västra Götaland, Sweden - is a
      longitudinal observational study, which will prospectively and in parallel follow patients
      with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA, N=1000), psoriatic arthritis (PsA, N=500) and
      undifferentiated arthritis (N=100), together with patients with psoriasis (N=500). The study
      will also recruit healthy controls from the general population (N=3000).

      The aims of the study are to define predictors for disease course and severity, treatment
      response, comorbidities, health related quality of life (HRQoL) and health economy.

      The study is a collaboration between the department of Rheumatology and the department of
      Dermatology at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, and the departments of
      Rheumatology at the hospitals of Alingsås, Borås, Uddevalla and Skövde, in the west of
      Sweden.

      All patients with newly diagnosed RA, PsA and undifferentiated arthritis at the Rheumatology
      centers are eligible for inclusion. Patients with psoriasis will be recruited from the
      Department of dermatology at Sahlgrenska University Hospital.

      The patients will be examined at baseline and at one, three, five and ten years. The
      assessments will include physical examination with evaluation of joints, entheses and skin
      and validated questionnaires regarding medical history, comorbidities, lifestyle, disease
      activity, bodily function, socioeconomic factors and HRQoL. Blood samples will be collected.
      The patients with arthritis will also undergo radiography of the lung, hands and feet, and
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) of hands and feet.
