    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of adavosertib when given together
      with olaparib in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the
      body (advanced) with selected mutations. Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA
      mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells
      can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Giving olaparib and adavosertib one after
      the other may shrink or stabilize advanced solid tumors as successfully as using them
      together, with fewer side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of olaparib in sequential treatment with
      adavosertib (AZD1775).

      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of this
      sequential schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors in a post-poly adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) population.

      III. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of the sequential treatment of olaparib and
      AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess putative predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to the sequential
      treatment of olaparib and AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.

      II. To evaluate a novel experimental trial design involving sequential dosing of olaparib and
      AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib.

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 and 15-19 of each cycle
      and adavosertib PO once daily (QD) on days 8-12 and 22-26 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for up to 2 years.

          -  Subjects must have RECIST measureable disease and a tumor that is safely accessible
             for biopsy and must be willing to undergo biopsy

          -  Subjects must have received at least one line of systemic therapy in the
             advanced/metastatic setting. Subjects with diseases without known effective options,
             and subject who have declined standard or care therapy prior to study introduction are
             also eligible

          -  Any prior palliative radiation therapy must have been completed at least 14 days prior
             to the start of study drugs, and patients must have recovered from any acute adverse
             effects prior to the start of study treatment

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV1/2 antibody-positive) patients may
             participate if they meet all the following eligibility requirements:

               -  They must be on an anti-retroviral regimen with evidence of at least two
                  undetectable viral loads within the past 6 months on this same regimen; the most

                  past 2 years, unless it was deemed related to the cancer and/or
                  chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. For patients who have received
                  chemotherapy in the past 6 months, a CD4 count &lt; 250 cells/ul during chemotherapy
                  is permitted as long as viral loads were undetectable during this same
                  chemotherapy

               -  They must have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count &gt;= 250 cells/uL within

                    -  Viral load and CD4 count every 12 weeks (q12w)

                    -  If CD4 count drops to less than 200 cells/ul while on study, initiate viral
                       load test. If viral load proves undetectable at this time, continue CD4 and
                       viral load checks every 8 weeks (q8w). If 2 consecutive viral load tests are
                       undetectable, revert to q12w testing for CD4 and viral load testing

                    -  If an opportunistic infection occurs with a CD4 count of &lt; 200 cells/ul,
                       hold study treatment. Initiate treatment of the infection and continue to
                       hold study treatment; once clinically stable, CD4 count is &gt; 200 cells/ul

             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression within
             28 days

          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that
             immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during

             pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male
             patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of
             childbearing potential. Male patients should not donate sperm throughout the period of
             taking study drugs and for 3 months following the last dose of study drugs.

             than 6 months are allowed entry into the study and may continue at the discretion of
             the investigator

          -  Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers/inhibitors:

               -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole,
                  telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or
                  cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or
                  moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem,
                  fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib
                  is 2 weeks

               -  Concomitant use of known strong (e.g., phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin,
                  rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort)
                  or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required
                  washout period prior to starting study treatment is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or
                  phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents

          -  Major surgical procedures =&lt; 28 days of beginning study treatment, or minor surgical
             procedures =&lt; 7 days. Patients must have recovered from any of the effects of any
             major surgery. No waiting period required following port-a-cath placement or other
             central venous access placement

          -  Known malignant central nervous system (CNS) disease other than neurologically stable,
             treated brain metastases - defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression or
             hemorrhage for at least 2 weeks after treatment (including brain radiotherapy). Must
             be off any systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of brain metastases for at least
             14 days prior to enrollment. Subjects with brain metastases must have completed
             treatment, either surgery or radiation, and be stable for at least 28 days off steroid
             prior to screening. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating there is no
             current evidence or progressive brain metastases is required in subjects with previous
             brain metastasis. Patients with breast tissue expanders may have brain computed
             tomography (CT) for assessment

          -  Patients with either previous or current myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid
             leukemia (AML) or features suggestive of MDS/AML and excluded because olaparib and
             AZD1775 are agents with the potential to induce anemia

          -  AZD1775 should not be given to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes
             (TdP) unless all risk factors that contributed to TdP have been corrected

          -  Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months:

               -  Unstable angina pectoris

               -  Acute myocardial infarction

               -  Congestive heart failure &gt;= class 2 (as defined by New York Heart Association
                  [NYHA])

               -  Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication

               -  Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with chronic
                  rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities
                  are eligible)

          -  Participants with a mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;= 480 msec at study
             entry, as calculated by the Frederica formula (QTcF) by institutional standards
             obtained from an electrocardiogram (ECG) or congenital long QT syndrome. (Note: if one
             ECG demonstrates a QTcF &gt; 480 msec, then a mean QTcF of =&lt; 480 msec obtained from 3
             ECGs 2-5 minutes apart is required at study entry

          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations, or other psychological, familial,
             sociological, or geographical conditions that would limit compliance with study
             requirements
