  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled pilot trial evaluating the effect of tropisetron on prevention of
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients after cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a common complication during postoperative
      period，especially in elderly patients. It is characterized by cognitive decline, inattention
      and abnormal mental status following surgery. The presence of postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction is independently associated with poor recovery, increased hospital length of stay
      and increased mortality.

      Tropisetron is a 5-HT3A receptor antagonist and is widely used to treat postoperative nausea
      and vomiting. Previous studies found that tropisetron has positive effect on cognitive
      function.

      We have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if
      tropisetron has a positive effect on postoperative coginitive function in patients after
      cardiac surgery. Several assessements which are related to delirium, cognitive function,
      sleep and functional status, blood sample collection and EEG recordings will be involved in
      the trial. Moreover, we have assumed a few long-term follow-ups.

      Given the complexity of the trial, we have decided to implement a pilot trial to assess the
      feasibility and provide vital data for future formal trial.

    <measure>Postoperative Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 7 days after surgery</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep diary and subjective sleep quality scores（Visual Analogue Scale） will be used to assess postoperative sleep quality of patients within 7 days after surgery.
Chinese version of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) will be used to assess sleep quality and disturbances. Nineteen individual items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. The total score is between 0 and 21. The total score ≤ 5 indicates good sleep quality，&gt; 5 indicates poor sleep quality. PSQI will be recorded at different points of time as follows：
1 day before surgery
