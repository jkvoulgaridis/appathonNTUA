  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancer in Hong Kong. In 2018, CRC accounted for
      17.4%, 5,780 cases, of the total new cancers. CRC claimed 2,279 lives (15.8%) making it the
      second most deadly killer in the population.

      Since 2010, the Cancer Expert Working Group (CEWG) has recommended that asymptomatic
      average-risk individuals aged 50 to 75 years should consider one of the screening methods:
      fecal occult blood test (FOBT) every one to two years; OR flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5
      years; OR colonoscopy every 10 years. However, it poses great challenges for large scale CRC
      screening using colonoscopy, such as bowel preparation difficulties, complications of
      procedure and poor compliance.

      ColoClear® is intended for use as an adjunctive screening test for the detection of
      colorectal neoplasia associated DNA markers and for the presence of occult hemoglobin in
      human stool. It has the potential of increasing the sensitivity of detecting CRC as compared
      to FOBT or faecal immunochemical test (FIT), which detects the presence of hemoglobin in
      stool alone. A positive result may indicate the presence of colorectal cancer or
      pre-malignant colorectal neoplasia. ColoClear® is not intended as a replacement for
      diagnostic colonoscopy. A positive result in ColoClear®, as with any screening test, should
      be followed by colonoscopy. ColoClear® is intended for colorectal cancer screening in average
      risk individuals: adults of either sex, 40 years or older, who are at high risk for
      colorectal cancer.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of ColoClear test in
      early screening of colorectal cancer in Hong Kong. Other outcomes to analyze include, but are
      not limited to the point estimate of the sensitivity of ColoClear for the detection of
      advanced adenoma (AA) in Hong Kong.
