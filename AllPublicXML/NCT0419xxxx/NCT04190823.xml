    <measure>Maximum Tolerated dose of RC98</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The dose level in which &gt;= 2 out of 6 patients have dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD is defined as the previous dose level.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate(ORR)</measure>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
