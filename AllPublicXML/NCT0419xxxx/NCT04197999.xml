  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is being conducted to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the
      effect the body has on the drug), and pharmacodynamics (the effect the drug has on the body)
      of GMI-1359 when given with standard-of-care treatment to subjects with HR+ metastatic breast
      cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed HR+ metastatic breast cancer, currently stable or minimally
             progressive on current endocrine-based therapy.

          -  Continuing on current endocrine-based therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, selective
             estrogen receptor degrader, or selective estrogen receptor modulator; and must be
             medically eligible to remain on this therapy during the treatment period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled acute life-threatening bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Concurrent treatment with any cytotoxic chemotherapy agent or other targeted therapies
             including HER2 targeting therapies

          -  Currently receiving, or less than 28 days since ending treatment on another
             investigational drug.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease.

          -  Abnormal liver function.

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, or other condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, is likely to interfere with trial completion, assessments, or
             interpretation of trial results, or otherwise would make the subject an inappropriate
             subject for this trial.
