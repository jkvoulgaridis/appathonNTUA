      Evaluate the short term outcomes of feminizing genitoplasty including
      vaginoplasty,clitroplasty, labioplasty and urethroplasty in children with disorders of sex
      development as regarding cosmetic and functional aspects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disorders of sex development (DSD) are a wide range of congenital conditions characterized by
      incongruent development of the components involved in sex differentiation including
      chromosomes, gonads, brain and anatomic sex.Sex assignment is a critical aspect in management
      of DSD and it is determined by investigations, genital appearance, fertility potential and
      cultural practices and pressurs. It is recommended that genital surgery for a child raised as
      a female considered only in cases of severe virilization (Prader 3-5) and that surgery for
      the clitoris not be performed for reasons of cosmesis only.Feminizing genital reconstruction
      has evolved considerably over the past decades as a result of improved understanding of
      anatomy , modification of surgical procedures and audit of outcomes. For patients with
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) with severe virilization raised as a female , it is
      recommended that clitorial and perineal reconstruction be considered in infancy and those
      with a low vaginal confluence undergo vaginoplasty at an early age , the appropriate timing
      for those with higher vaginal confluence is still less certain. Cosmetic outcomes after
      genitoplasty are variable. Most studies have detected only functional and cosmetic outcomes
      rated by the physician, but satisfaction ratings may differ between physicians and patients
      or their parents . The present prospective , interventional study aimed to describe the
      frequency of sex assignment and types of surgery performed in a cohort of patients with
      moderate to severe genital ambiguity and also evaluate surgical outcomes of feminizing
      genitoplasty in these patients .
