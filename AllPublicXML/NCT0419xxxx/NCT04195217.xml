  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of art-therapeutic management on a
      patient with cancer, during chemotherapy treatment, on the reduction of physical or
      psychological symptoms.

      Art therapy is a non-drug approach that can help some patients cope with the consequences of
      cancer beyond the care provided.

      The common psychosocial difficulties experienced by cancer patients are pain, fatigue,
      depression, anxiety, drowsiness. In sum, the well-being and quality of life of the patient
      throughout the illness.

      The main objective is to evaluate the impact of art therapy, as a supportive care, on
      improving the well-being felt after a session of cancer treatments (chemotherapy,
      immunotherapy, ...), during 6 sessions( around 24 days between 2 sessions) , at patients with
      a cancer pathology using two questionnaires, one on the evaluation of symptoms (ESAS), the
      other on the quality of life (FACT-G).

      Patients will be randomized into the following groups:

        -  Group 1: Art therapy as supportive care in 6 consecutive sessions of cancer treatments
           with or without additional supportive care

        -  Group 2: 6 consecutive sessions of cancer treatments with or without additional
           supportive care.

      Symptom assessment with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) is done before and
      after each treatment session for each patient.

      The FACT-G questionnaire on the quality of life at the beginning and the end of the care for
      the two groups (group benefiting from the art-therapy and group not benefiting from the
      art-therapy) and a questionnaire on the contribution of art therapy, at the end of care, for
      the participants of the art-therapy group.

    <description>The aim is to evaluate the impact of art therapy as a supportive care on the improvement of the well-being felt after a session of cancer treatments (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, ...), during 6 sessions, in patients having a cancerous pathology.
The primary endpoint is the 6-session average of the difference between the ESAS score associated with the patient's well-being symptom (a symptom of &quot;feeling good&quot; on the ESAS assessment), obtained before and after the treatment session.
The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (SESA) is a 9-item symptom rating scale. The quote goes from 0 to 10. A score close to zero means a better result. The comparison of the mean differences between the ESAS score before and after each of the six cancer treatment sessions according to the two randomization groups will be performed using a generalized linear model.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the impact of the 6 sessions of art-therapy, as supportive care in onco-therapy, on the evolution of the quality of life.
Secondary endpoint 3 is the difference in total FACT-G quality of life score score between inclusion and the end of the 6 sessions of cancer treatment.
This questionnaire contains 27 items constructed on a Likert scale with 5 coded response modes: 0 &quot;Not at all&quot; / 1 &quot;A little&quot; / 2 &quot;Moderately&quot; / 3 &quot;A lot&quot; / 4 &quot;Enormously&quot;.
A score is calculated by dimension. These scores range from 0 to 28 where 0 represents a low level of well-being and 28 a high level of well-being. This score corresponds to the sum of the raw scores obtained for each dimension, and varies from 0 (low level) to 108 (good level of general well-being).</description>

The workshop runs from 30 minutes to 2:30. It can be cut by doctors and nurses interventions during medical care. The limit of care is set at 2:30 for reasons of concentration of the patient, organization of the service but the patient is an actor of his care, and chooses when the session ends.
