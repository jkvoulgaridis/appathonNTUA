  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 1 study to determine the safety and tolebility of oral ABSK021 in
      patients with advanced solid tumor as well as the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral
      ABSK021. Preliminary antitumor activity will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will start with a dose escalation part of single-agent ABSK021 administered in
      repeated 28-day cycles in patients with advanced solid for safety and tolerability. The
      expansion part of oral ABSK021 at recommended dose of expansion (RDE) will be followed for
      further evaluating safety and tolerability among selected tumor types. Preliminary antitumor
      activity will also be assessed.

    <description>Dose escalation of oral ABSK021 with a starting dose of 25mg once daily will be guided by&quot;3+3&quot; escalation rules based on safety data until an MTD has been identified or a RDE. For each dose, patients will first receive a single dose ABSK021 tablet(s) by mouth at Day -3 and be followed by a 3-day off as a run-in period to access the safety and PK of single-dose. Then, patients will continuously receive ABSK021 once daily (QD) in repeated 28-day cycles.</description>
