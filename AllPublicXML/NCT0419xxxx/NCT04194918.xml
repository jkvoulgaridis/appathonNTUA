  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well Flexiquit+ helps young adult smokers who identify as a
      sexual and/or gender minority to quit or cut down on smoking. Flexiquit+ is an avatar-led,
      web-based intervention that can help smokers quit or cut back on how much they smoke
      cigarettes and/or vape, reducing their chances of developing tobacco-related health
      conditions.

      OUTLINE:

      Individuals will be recruited to use the Flexiquit+ program consisting of 6 sessions, each
      lasting approximately 25 minutes. Participants will also receive text messages providing
      motivational messages and review information discussed in the program. At the end of the
      intervention, participants will receive an email with all of the session handouts.

      Participants are followed up with at 2 months.
