      Importance: Improvement of the QoL after bariatric surgery is an important outcome of the
      treatment. The investigators believe that assessment of distant QoL results, could provide
      new insight into effectiveness of most popular bariatric procedures.

      Objective: The investigators aim to analyze the bariatric surgery effect on the long term
      QoL, considering the type of surgery.

      Design: A cohort study including patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Setting: One academic
      referral center. Exposures: Patients undergo Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy or Laparoscopic
      Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass . Surgical technique is standardized and consistent in the whole
      study group.

      Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome is the change of QoL after bariatric surgery. It
      is assessed in three different time points: pre-surgery, first follow up (1 year after
      surgery) and second follow-up (10 years after surgery). The investigators use two licensed
      and standardized questionnaires: (Short Form Health Survey) and MA-QoLQII (Moorehead-Ardelt
      Quality of Life Questionnaire II).

    <description>To assess the quality of life of included patients the investigators used licensed and standardized questionnaire, which is designed for medical purposes: SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey). It is scale with minimal value being 0 and maximal value being 100 scale. Higher score means better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life measured as a Moorehead-Ardelt Quality of Life Questionnaire II score.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the quality of life of included patients the investigators used licensed and standardized questionnaire, which is designed for medical purposes: MA-QoLQII (Moorehead-Ardelt Quality of Life Questionnaire II). The MA-QoLQII questionnaire has six dimensions. The MA II questionnaire is used as a part of the Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) and assesses the patients subjective impression of quality of life in the areas of general self-esteem, physical activity, social contacts, satisfaction concerning work, pleasure related to sexuality and focus on eating behavior. Each item is scored from−0.5 to +0.5. The total score consists of the sum of the six dimensions with a range of −3 to +3. A total score of 1.1 to 2 is considered &quot;good&quot;, above 2.1 is&quot;very good&quot;.</description>

        Initially the investigators included 65 patients undergoing surgical treatment for morbid
        obesity [39 females (60%) and 26 males (40%)]. Mean age was 42.75 years. Overall, 34
        patients underwent LSG (52.3%) and 31 patients underwent LRYGB (47.7%). Mean initial body
        weight was 146.2 kg, mean BMI before surgery was 50.44 kg/m2.
