      Feasibility study to investigate the utility of a simple, home-based, exercise intervention
      during and after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy but prior to surgery for esophageal and gastric
      adenocarcinoma.

      The principle aim of this study is to test the feasibility of utilising a home-based
      'prehabilitation' exercise regimen in oesophago-gastric patients during preoperative
      chemotherapy and the period leading up to surgical resection. The investigators also hope to
      explore secondary outcomes of such a regimen, such as maintenance of fitness, the incidence
      of sarcopenia, muscle function and the outcomes of therapy. The investigators will explore
      the added value of blood-borne frailty biomarkers to objectively measure changes in
      physiology during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This will be tested using CPET, CT
      measured sarcopenia, grip strength and a small panel of biomarkers as secondary outcome and
      exploratory measures. Thus the main question is: 'Will patients participate in a home-based
      exercise programme during and after NAC for oesophago-gastric cancer?'

    <description>Exercise intervention consists of walking monitored by wearing a pedometer device. After a baseline measurement of participant's walking activity is done, increase in step count from baseline step count is prescribed. This increase in step count is achieved by walking or jogging at moderate intensity for a target of 30 minutes per day, each day. Participants are also encouraged to perform other physical if they wish and are able to. Patients are regularly contacted by a member of the research team on a weekly basis and given an option to maintain or to increase their step count further. The same approach is used after each week of the intervention. Strengthening exercises will form a further part of the exercise intervention. They are performed every day, 7 days a week. Patients are supplied with resistance bands with handles. They are educated on how to perform two repetitions of 5 simple exercises, each for 1 minute duration.</description>
