      The objective of this study is to verify the safety and efficacy of the investigational
      device (ELX1805J) for the treatment of ischemic heart disease due to de novo, native coronary
      artery lesions

      The Bioadaptor RCT Study is a prospective, 2:1 randomized study of parallel designed, that
      will enroll up to 474 patients requiring treatment of up to two de novo coronary lesions of ≤
      24 mm in length in vessels of ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter.

      One or two designated target lesions, located in separate epicardial vessels (RCA, LCX or
      LAD), and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be treated with the ELX1805J (DynamX
      Bioadaptor) or Resolute Onyx stent

      The primary safety endpoint is Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at 12 months. TLF is a composite
      endpoint defined as cardiac death, target vessel MI, and clinically-indicated target lesion
      revascularization

      Additional secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints will be evaluated at 30 days, 6 and
      12 months and 2-5 years.

      Using visual assessment, the target lesion must measure ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter and
      ≤ 24 mm in length able to be covered by a single ELX1805J or Resolute Onyx stent including 2
      mm of healthy vessel on either side of the planned treatment area.

      The patient will be eligible for device implantation only after satisfactory lesion
      pre-dilatation defined as: ≥ TIMI 2 flow, and no dissection greater than Grade B (NHLBI) able
      to be covered with a single device
