    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer afflicts 27,000 Americans annually and carries a dismal prognosis. One reason
      for poor outcomes is late diagnosis, as the majority of gastric cancers in the United States
      are diagnosed at a relatively advanced stage where curative resection is unlikely. Gastric
      intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is a precancerous change of the stomach which increases risk for
      subsequent gastric cancer multiple-fold.

      The Gastric Precancerous Conditions Study (GAPS) is an observational study with two
      over-arching objectives: 1) improve the non-invasive identification of patients with GIM, and
      2) develop biological markers to predict the subset of GIM which will progress onto gastric
      cancer.

      To achieve Aim 1, a case-control study (N=300 pairs) matching cases of GIM with
      age-/gender-matched controls will be recruited form the population of subjects undergoing
      clinically-indicated endoscopy. Determination of gastric pathology will be made by two,
      independent gastrointestinal pathologists. At time of endoscopy, a detailed clinical
      questionnaire is administered by face-to-face interview. Saliva and blood is collected prior
      to endoscopy. At time of endoscopy, protocoled clinical biopsies (per Revised Sydney
      Protocol) as well as additional research specimens are collected. Scoring of GIM will be
      performed based on the Operative Link for GIM scoring system.

      To achieve Aim 2, patients with histologically-confirmed GIM (N=300) will be followed
      longitudinally. Biennial endoscopic surveillance will be performed, with repeat biopsies,
      specimen collection, and histologic scoring. Progression of GIM will be defined as upstaging
      of GIM score, or development of either dysplasia or carcinoma on any biopsy.

    <description>Progression will be assessed using the Operative Link for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia (Reference 1). This score reflects both the histologic severity as well as anatomic location of intestinal metaplasia. Scores range from 0 (no metaplasia) to 4 (severe metaplasia). It is believed that higher scores portend a higher risk for progression to cancer.</description>
