      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-dose study to investigate the plasma PK of
      KW-6356 and its major metabolite, after a single oral dose of KW-6356, in subjects with mild
      or moderate hepatic impairment and in healthy adults

    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 4
      weeks prior to dose administration. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical
      research unit (CRU) before the initiation of investigational medicinal product (IMP)
      administration (Check-in/Day -1) and administered of KW-6356 orally on Day 1 after an 8-hour
      fast. Those subjects who complete all the scheduled observations/examinations and are
      determined to have no clinical abnormalities requiring further hospitalization by the
      Investigator, will be discharged from the study site on Day 4. Discharged subjects will then
      visit the CRU on the scheduled visit Days 5, 6, 7, 8 for PK sample collections and safety
      assessments on Day 12 to complete the End of Study (EOS) visit. The duration of
      hospitalization will be 5 days: 4 nights from Day -1 to Day 4.

        All Subjects:

          1. Individuals who provide freely given written consent for participating in the study.

          2. Men and women aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years at the date of providing informed consent.

          3. Subjects with a BMI in the range 18.0 to 40.0 kg/m2.

          4. Females will not be pregnant or lactating, and females of childbearing potential and
             males will agree to use contraception.

          5. Able to comprehend and willing to sign an ICF and to abide by the study restrictions.

             Subjects with Hepatic Impairment:

          6. Subjects must meet the criteria for mild or moderate hepatic impairment based on CP
             classification. Subjects will be classified at Screening based on CP score and
             classification will be repeated at Check-in. If the hepatic function classification
             for the subject is not the same at the 2 timepoints, enrollment of the subject into a
             hepatic category group will be based on the CP score at Screening.

          7. Subjects have stable hepatic function with a diagnosis of chronic disease of &gt; 6
             months, defined as no clinically significant change in disease status within the 60
             days prior to the Screening visit or 90 days prior to drug administration on Day 1
             (whichever is longer), as documented by the subject's recent medical history.

          8. Subjects are on a stable medication dose(s) and/or treatment regimen(s) for treatment
             of hepatic impairment during the 30 days preceding the first dose of IMP. Drugs known
             to be moderate-to-potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 enzyme will not be
             allowed. Subjects requiring medications that are moderate-to-potent inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 may have these medications discontinued for purposes of
             qualifying for at least 30 days prior to dosing day for this study. Adjustments may be
             made if deemed medically safe and also acceptable to the Sponsor and Medical Monitor.

          9. Subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment may have medical findings consistent
             with their hepatic dysfunction, as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, 12-lead ECG, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations
             at Screening and Check-in. Subjects with abnormal findings considered not clinically
             significant by the Investigator will be eligible. Vital signs between the following
             ranges and stable (measured in a supine position after a minimum of 5 minutes supine):

               1. Systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 and ≤ 160 mmHg

               2. Diastolic blood pressure ≥ 50 and ≤ 95 mmHg

               3. Pulse rate ≥ 45 and ≤ 100 bpm

             (AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase [γ-GTP], alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin,
             albumin [Alb], and PT) at Screening and Check-in. In good health, determined by no
             clinically significant findings from medical history, physical examination, 12-lead
             ECG, vital signs measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations (congenital
             nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia [eg, suspicion of Gilbert's syndrome based on total
             and direct bilirubin] is not acceptable) at Screening and Check-in as assessed by the
             Investigator. Vital signs between the following ranges and stable (measured in a
             supine position after a minimum of 5 minutes supine):

               1. Systolic blood pressure ≥ 95 and ≤ 150 mmHg mmHg

               2. Diastolic blood pressure ≥ 50 and ≤ 90 mmHg
