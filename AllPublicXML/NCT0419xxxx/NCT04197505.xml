  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to (1) determine whether thermal imaging can be used
      during an acute trauma patient's secondary or tertiary survey to identify injury sites with
      an underlying fracture, and to (2) investigate whether thermal imaging can predict those
      patients whose fractures will result in a non-union.

      Human subjects will be enrolled into the study from NYU Langone Health and Bellevue Hospital
      Center. When orthopaedic surgery is consulted for management of a fracture, the patient will
      be offered enrollment into the study. The collected data will be assigned a letter and number
      associated for references with the patient's age, type of fracture, and time since original
      injury to thermal imaging scan. If any patient receives a thermal imaging scan at their
      initial injury evaluation, then he or she will also receive thermal imaging scans at all
      follow-up appointments to track changes in temperature over the healing process. No obtunded
      or unresponsive patients will be enrolled into the study. The goal will be to have to thirty
      patients enrolled into both acute fracture and non-union arms of the proposal for a total of
      sixty subjects. Age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status, medical history, and surgical history
      will be recorded for future confounding analysis.

    <description>The FLIR E95 thermal imaging camera will be used to obtain a temperature evaluation of the injury site. The extremity with the underlying fracture will have a higher temperature reading when compared to the contralateral extremity without a fracture. Thermal imaging was selected for the proposed work due to its feasibility and potential to be a useful tool in the acute trauma setting. A thermal imaging camera detects infrared radiation and converts it to visible light. The FLIR E95 utilizes a class two laser with an output power below 1mW and this laser is considered safe without a skin or materials burn hazard unless a person deliberately stares into the beam</description>

    <description>Using the FLIR E95 thermal imaging camera, to monitor progression of fracture healing and identify patients proceeding towards a non-union. A fracture proceeding towards a non-union will have a persistently higher local temperature compared to an appropriately healing fracture. Thermal imaging was selected for the proposed work due to its feasibility and potential to be a useful tool in the acute trauma setting. A thermal imaging camera detects infrared radiation and converts it to visible light. The FLIR E95 utilizes a class two laser with an output power below 1mW and this laser is considered safe without a skin or materials burn hazard unless a person deliberately stares into the beam</description>

    <description>The FLIR E95 camera will be used for the study. The injured extremity will be scanned with the thermal camera and a second scan will be performed on the non-injured extremity to provide an internal control for any differences in room temperature and humidity. Prior to scanning, both the injured and non-injured extremity will remain uncovered for 10 minutes, about the length of an average office visit, and the areas to be scanned will remain free from contact by the patient or interviewer during this time period. The camera will be held 2 feet away from the extremity at a 90º angle to limit reading contamination from objects other than the patient.</description>

    <description>Video will be recorded during the thermal reading for later computer analysis. The following variables will be analyzed: (1) the difference between the mean temperature between the injured and healthy extremities, (2) the difference between the maximum temperatures of both the injured and healthy extremities (ΔTmax), and (3) the difference between the area covered by each isotherm in both the injured and uninjured extremities (Δpix). FLIR software tools and MATLAB software will be used for the analysis.</description>
