  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a curriculum about professionalism on
      stress response during a critical situation in anesthesiology residents. Residents in
      anesthesiology will complete a training program on professionalism during their first
      postgraduate year. They will go through a standardized simulated scenario where they have to
      manage an intra-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest and then meet the patient's family. Stress
      response will be assessed and compared to a control group that did not receive the training
      program.
