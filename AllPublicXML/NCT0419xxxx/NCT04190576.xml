  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a human, prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial conducted to
      explore the outcome of a minimally invasive ridge augmentation technique with and without low
      level laser therapy. The trial is in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting
      Trials (CONSORT) criteria, 2010.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty healthy individuals satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for
      the study. A detailed, thorough medical and dental history was obtained and each patient was
      subjected to comprehensive clinical and radiological examination. All patients were informed
      about the nature of the study, the surgical procedure involved, potential benefits and risks
      associated with the surgical procedure and written informed consent were obtained from all
      patients.

      All the patients were treated with subperiosteal minimally invasive aesthetic ridge
      augmentation technique. the test group of ten were given low level laser therapy as an
      adjunct. The clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and six months
      postoperatively.
