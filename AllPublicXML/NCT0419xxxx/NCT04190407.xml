    <textblock>
      In pediatric patients with no vascular access, anesthesia induction is usually achieved with
      sevoflurane. The aim of investigators to evaluate the optimum intravenous access time and the
      corresponding bispectral index (BIS) value in pediatric surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing anesthesia induction must have at least one vascular access opened for
      administration of intravenous drugs and fluid. In pediatric patients, fear of needles and
      anxiety about pain can cause discomfort. For this reason, inhalational anesthetics are
      commonly used for anesthesia induction in children. An ideal inhalational anesthetic agent
      should have a smooth and fast onset, little irritation to the respiratory tract, and no
      undesirable side effects. Sevoflurane meets almost all these criteria, so it is commonly used
      for anesthesia induction in pediatric patients.

      Studies related to the induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane have mostly focused on the
      ease of LMA insertion, the recovery characteristics, the hemodynamic variabilities,
      comparison of high and low initial sevoflurane concentrations, and cost comparisons between
      fixed 8% versus incremental techniques. However, after loss of consciousness, children
      subjected to early intravenous cannulation during sevoflurane induction can display movement,
      breath holding, coughing, and even laryngospasm. Only limited data are available in the
      literature regarding intravenous access time at anesthesia induction. The aim of the present
      study was to evaluate the bispectral index (BIS) values and sevoflurane concentrations during
      induction of anesthesia and to determine the optimum intravenous access time in pediatric
      patients.
