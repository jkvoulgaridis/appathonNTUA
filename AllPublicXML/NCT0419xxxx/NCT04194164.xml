  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methods are needed to help decrease interdialytic weight gains in hemodialysis patients. One
      potential method for accomplishing this goal is to develop an app for smartphones that allow
      patients to track their fluid intake throughout the course of the day. NCT 03759847 was
      designed to test the safety and efficacy of this app. In this protocol, part of the same IRB
      number, patients with large interdialytic fluid gains (3.5% or greater) will use the app to
      to determine the association between the interdialytic weight gain and the fluid consumed as
      recorded by use of the app for each interdialytic period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this full scale study, the app will be used to try and influence fluid intake behavior in
      those patients who are identified to have large fluid weight gains, as defined by a greater
      than 4% increase in interdialytic weight.

      There will be two parts to the full scale trial. In the first part of the full scale study,
      denoted as the active phase, which will last for two months, study participants will be
      encouraged to use the app on a daily basis and will meet with the study coordinator on weeks
      1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 to further assist the participant in decreasing fluid intake between
      dialysis sessions. In the second portion of the study, denoted as the passive phase, which
      will last for six months, the patient will use the app and meet with the study coordinator
      only when requested by the patient. The number of these sessions will be recorded. At the end
      of the six month passive phase, the participant will meet for the last time with the study
      coordinator. During each study visit, subjects will be asked to transfer the data from the
      App to the study coordinator via the data export function of the app.
