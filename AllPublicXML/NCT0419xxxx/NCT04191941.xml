  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, early phase I study, to determine the safety and efficacy
      of Novel CAR-T cell therapy in Hematological Malignancy treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Novel CAR-T contains either a scFv plus a PD-L1 blocker, or two scFvs, in a cytokine
      complex based outer memberane structure, this kind of structure enables the CAR-T cells to
      simultaneously target one or two targets on the tumor cell surface and enhance CAR-T cell
      persistence in tumor microenvironment，as well as stimulating innate T/NK cell activation and
      expansion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All subjects must personally sign and date the consent form before initiating any
             study specific procedures or activities;

          2. All subjects must be able to comply with all the scheduled procedures in the study;

          3. Clear diagnosis of hematological malignancy, including B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
             B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma.

          4. Fufill one or more of the following criteria: Relapsed after most recent therapy;
             Progressive disease in standard chemotherapy; Disease progression or relapsed after
             ASCT;

          5. At least one clear indicator for hematological malignancy monitoring;

          6. Aged ＜70 years;

          7. Expected survival ≥12 weeks;

          8. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of≤3;

          9. Systematic usage of immunosuppressive drug or corticosteroid must have been stopped
             for more than 4 weeks;

         10. All other treatment induced adverse events must have been resolved to

             ≤grade 1;

         11. Laboratory tests must fulfill the following criteria: ANC ≥ 1000/uL, HGB&gt;70g/L,
             Platelet count ≥ 50,000/uL, Creatinine clearance ≤1.5 ULN, Serum ALT/AST ≤2.5 ULN,
             Total bilirubin ≤1.5 ULN (except in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is hardly to control
             (defined by investigator);

          2. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system metastasis, intracranial metastasis,
             and cancer cells found in cerebrospinal fluid are not recommended to participate in
             this study. Symptom free or post-treatment stable disease or disappearance of lesions
             should not be excluded. The specific selection is ultimately determined by the
             investigator;

          7. Subjects need systematic usage of immunosuppressive drug;

          8. Planed operation, history of other related disease, or any other related laboratory
             tests restrict patients for the study;
