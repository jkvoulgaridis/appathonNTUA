  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency (ID) remains the most common global nutrient deficiency, with young women at
      high risk. Iron supplements are first line treatment for ID but absorption is often low.
      Dietary components that could increase iron absorption would be valuable, but there are few
      effective enhancers of non-heme iron absorption. Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) is a safe and
      widely-used prebiotic.

      An iron stable isotope study in infants reported that 7.5 g of GOS improved iron absorption
      from 5 mg iron from a mixture of ferrous fumarate and sodium iron EDTA. In a recent iron
      absorption study in adult women with low iron stores in our lab we found that 15 g of GOS
      given with FeFum (14 mg of elemental iron) acutely increased iron absorption when given with
      water (+61%) and a meal (+28%).

      For prevention of anemia among non-pregnant women, the WHO recommends intermittent (once,
      twice or three times a week) oral iron supplementation with 60 mg of elemental iron. This has
      been shown to be effective, safe and acceptable for improving hemoglobin concentrations in
      women and lowering their risk of anemia. If GOS also improves iron absorption from a higher
      dose of iron is unclear. With this study we therefore aim to investigate if consumption of a
      single oral dose of 7 g or 15 g GOS increases iron absorption from single 100 mg oral iron
      doses, a common amount found in supplements on the market for treatment of iron deficiency,
      given as ferrous fumarate in Swiss iron depleted women.

      Iron deficiency (ID) remains the most common global nutrient deficiency, with young women at
      high risk. Iron supplements are first line treatment for ID but absorption is often low.
      Dietary components that could increase iron absorption would be valuable, but there are few
      effective enhancers of non-heme iron absorption.

      Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), a safe and widely-used prebiotic, are a mixture of glucose-
      and galactose-based di- and oligosaccharides of varying structure and may be more selectively
      utilized by Bifidobacterium spp. than other prebiotics. GOS has GRAS status in the USA and is
      widely added to commercial infant formula. Prebiotics are potential enhancers of iron
      absorption, via several mechanisms: a) increasing gastric residence time allowing for greater
      iron dissolution; b) stimulating enterocyte gene expression of proteins involved in iron
      absorption; c) stimulating enterocyte proliferation providing a greater surface for iron
      absorption; and d) stimulating SCFA production by gut commensal bacteria, decreasing distal
      gut luminal pH and increasing iron dissolution.

      An iron stable isotope study in infants reported that 7.5 g of GOS improved iron absorption
      from 5 mg iron from a mixture of ferrous fumarate and sodium iron EDTA. In a recent iron
