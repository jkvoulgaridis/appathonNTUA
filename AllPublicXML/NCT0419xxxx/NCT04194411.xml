  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is one of the most common complications after cardiac surgeries, incidence of which
      is 20~70%. Causes and pathophysiology of delirium has not been elucidated yet, however,
      inflammatory response of the nervous system, imbalance of neurotransmitters and
      ischemia-reperfusion injury of brain tissue are thought to play a big role.

      'Neurofilament light (Nfl)' and 'Tau' are proteins that comprise neurons, which are released
      into blood during acute brain injury. Increased serum concentrations of these markers are
      acknowledged to be associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with acute brain
      injury. These proteins are also closely linked to degenerative changes in the nervous system
      and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the increase in blood levels of
      'Nfl' and 'Tau' may be related to the development of delirium.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the association between 'Nfl' and 'Tau', serum
      markers of damage of the nervous system, and the development of delirium after cardiac
      surgery.

      1. Assessment of cognitive function and delirium Before the day before surgery, K-MMSE
           (Korean version of Mini-Mental State Exam) is conducted to check the subjects' baseline
           cognitive function.

           From the postoperative day 0 to 7, CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the
           Intensive Care Unit) for mechanically ventilated patients, or 3D-CAM (3-minute
           diagnostic assessment for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method) for extubated
           patients is performed twice a day to assess whether delirium occurs. Records of the
           nurses are also checked.

        2. Measurement of the serum levels of Nfl and Tau Serum concentrations of Nfl and Tau are
           measured after anesthetic induction, and at postoperative 6 hours
