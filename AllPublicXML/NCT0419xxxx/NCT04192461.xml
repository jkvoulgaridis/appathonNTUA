      Introduction: The concept of immediate implant placement has become popular due to reduced
      trauma and reduced overall treatment time. Removal of molar teeth provides a challenging and
      intriguing dilemma due to multiple root morphology. In cases of extraction and immediate
      placement of implants in the molar region, removal of the inter-radicular septum should be
      avoided to attain initial implant stability at the time of placement, and prevent slipping of
      the implant into the extraction socket. Following this technique prevents the slippage of the
      implant and allows the implant to be guided into the inter-radicular septum.

      Objectives: To assess the accuracy of implant placement using the remaining roots of
      multi-radicular mandibular molars, evaluate bone density around implants and implant
      stability in fresh extracted site.

      Materials and Methods: A prospective study was done on 10 patients with badly destructed
      mandibular molars. The technique of implant insertion consisted of a progressive preparation
      of the implant site using the anatomy of the root of the multi-radicular mandibular molars to
      be extracted as a reference and as an aid to engage the inter-radicular septum.

    <description>Immediate postoperative and a preoperative conebeam CT will be done. The preoperative and postoperative scans will then be over¬lapped using a dedicated algorithm, which will allow the comparison of the virtually planned and the actual implant positions. Three deviation parameters between each planned and placed implant will be measured. All measurements will be performed using Mimics Innovation Suite 19 ™ software (Materialise Mimics software 3D Medical Imaging, Belgium).
For analyzing the accuracy, the planned position of the implant will be compared with the actual position of the implant after insertion. Several measuring points will be measured:
Horizontal deviation at coronal side of the implant.
Horizontal deviation at apex of the implant.
Angular deviation.</description>
