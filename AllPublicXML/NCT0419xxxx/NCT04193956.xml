  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-center, prospective continuously accruing longitudinal cohort study in patients
      with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) or metastatic melanoma eligible for standard
      anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. The data from this prospective longitudinal cohort will be used
      in the POINTING (towards patient -tailored cancer immunotherapy supported by a multifaceted
      predictive signature composed of integrative omics and molecular imaging) KWF
      Kankerbestrijding project (WP4). The goal of this project is to develop a multifaceted
      predictive signature, by using new techniques on tumor characteristics before and during
      treatment with immune therapy. To do so, researchers will use the 'omics' approach. By
      combining molecular omics comprising genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics with radiomics and
      molecular imaging a set of factors will arise which can accurately predict the outcome of the
      treatment.

      Participants in this cohort will undergo tumor biopsies, venous blood sampling and feces
      sampling before, during and at the end of standard anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. Also, data
      derived form routine procedures performed for standard-of-care anti-PD-1 treatment (ao
      laboratory assessments, CT and FDG-PET) will be collected.

    <description>The aim of this clinical cohort is to develop and validate multifaceted predictive signatures for PD-1 antibody effects with relevant components of integrative omics (histology, immunohistochemistry, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics and/or molecular imaging), which predict, which patients have a ≤ 5% chance of responding to anti-PD-1 antibody treatment.</description>

    <description>As secondary aim, the relation between multifaceted signatures composed by relevant components of integrative omics (histology, immunohistochemistry, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics and/or molecular imaging) and toxicity of PD-1 antibody treatment will be assessed. Toxicity will be scored according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.</description>

        Patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma or metastatic NSCLC, who are eligible
        to receive anti-PD-1 antibody treatment as monotherapy or in combination with other
        checkpoint inhibitors.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytological documented locally advanced or metastatic melanoma or
             NSCLC.

          2. Patients must be eligible for standard treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment
             (monotherapy or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors).

          3. Age ≥18 years.

          4. Measurable disease, as defined by standard RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions
             should not be counted as target lesions.

          5. Metastatic or locally advanced lesion(s) of which a histological biopsy can safely be
             obtained according to standard clinical care procedures.

          6. Ability to comply with protocol.

          7. Signed Informed Consent form.

             exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death treated with expected
             curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or
             squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent or
             ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent).

          2. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to
             prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor
             necrosis factor agents) within 2 weeks prior to study inclusion.

               -  Patients who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant
                  medications may be enrolled.

               -  The use of inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
                  mineralocorticoids (e.g. fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic
                  hypotension, and low-dose supplemental corticosteroids for adrenocortical
                  insufficiency are allowed.
