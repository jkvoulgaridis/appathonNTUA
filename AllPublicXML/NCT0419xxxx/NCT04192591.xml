    <description>Non-inferiority of overall subject success at the 24-Month visit vs. the 24-month visit in IDE trial. An individual subject will be considered a success if they meet all of the following conditions at the 24-month follow-up visit:
Clinically significant improvement of neurogenic claudication symptoms as determined by meeting at least two of three domains of the ZCQ
≥ 0.5-point improvement in physical function
≥ 0.5-point improvement in symptom severity
≤ 2.5 point on patient satisfaction domain
No reoperations, removals, revisions, or supplemental fixation at the index level(s)
No major implant or procedure-related complications
no dislodgement, migration, or device deformation
no new or persistent worsened neurological deficit at the index level†
no unhealed spinous process fractures † Defined as a serious adverse event wherein there is any new/worsening of motor or sensory function at 12 months, compared to baseline, which persists to 24 months</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  45 years of age or older when written informed consent is obtained

          -  Persistent leg/buttock/groin pain, with or without back pain that is consistently
             relieved by flexion activities (example: sitting or bending over a shopping cart).

          -  Diagnosis of degenerative spinal stenosis of the lumbar spine, defined as the
             narrowing of the midline sagittal spinal canal (central) and/or narrowing between the
             facet superior articulating process (SAP), the posterior vertebral margin (lateral
             access), and the nerve root canal (foraminal).

          -  Subject signed a valid, IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF) provided in English.

          -  Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are able to understand
             this clinical investigation, cooperate with the investigational procedures and are
             willing to return for all the required post-treatment follow-ups.

          -  Able to independently read and complete all questionnaires and assessments provided in
             English

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Axial back pain only.

          -  Fixed motor deficit in lower extremity(ies) due to LSS.

          -  Has any pain-related diagnosis, medical/psychological condition or external factors
             that, in the investigator's medical judgment, might confound reporting of study
             outcomes (e.g. history of pelvic pain, anginal pain, chronic migraine, involved in
             litigation, workmen's compensation, spinal tumor)

          -  Participating (or intends to participate) in another drug or device clinical trial
             that may influence the data that will be collected for this study
