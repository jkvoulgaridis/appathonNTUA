    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the possible applications of DUS during
      the maturation and postoperative follow-up of vascular access, with particular emphasis to
      establish a relationship between doppler Ultrasound parameters including:

        1. Flow volume.

        2. Outflow vein diameter.

        3. Outflow vein depth.

        4. Resistive index.

        Sample size was calculated using Epi-Info 7 software. According to the results of previous
        study conducted at renal dialysis unit of Assiut university hospital (7) the most common
        complication occurred in haemodialysis access (A-V fistula) was infected A-V access
        (23.8%). Based on this prevalence the minimum required sample size for current study is 84
        patients.

        Following assumptions were used to calculate this sample:

        Target population size = 120 (as number of new haemodialysis patients is 100-120 each
        year).

        N.B: in this study we will include all eligible cases at renal dialysis unit of Assiut
        university i.e., patients of last year (total coverage sample)
