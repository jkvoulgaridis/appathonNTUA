  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human intestine is colonized with a complex microbial community and forms a super
      organism with the human body. Intestinal microorganisms include more than 1,000 kinds of
      bacterias, and their flora is very complex and functions are very diverse. The intestinal
      flora affects the body's nutrition, immunity and metabolism through interaction with the
      human body and the external environment, and is closely related to multiple systems. When the
      flora structure and function are changed, it will lead to the occurrence of various diseases
      or increase the risk of disease. In recent years, the role of intestinal microbes in
      tumorigenesis and development, as well as the role of diagnosis and treatment have been paid
      more and more attention. Abnormal intestinal flora can not only promote tumorigenesis, but
      also affect radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy effects. It is worth noting that the huge
      impact of the intestinal flora on immunotherapy suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors
      can maximize the efficacy by protecting the balance and diversity of the intestinal
      microecology. Therefore, in this study, quantitative analysis of the diversity and abundance
      of intestinal, urinary tract flora, and urine components before and after adjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients with gastric and bowel cancer was performed. The link between
      treatment efficacy and prognosis.
