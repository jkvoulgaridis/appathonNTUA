  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study conducted on a population with an aortic endoprosthesis in the
      context of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The study's objective is to standardize the
      ultrasound methodology in the monitoring of aortic endoprosthesis in immediate post-operative
      care by comparing the results with CT-scan (gold standard). To improve ultrasound
      methodology, the investigators propose to use the VESMA protocol for ultrasound diameter
      measurement at four incidences. In addition, the use of ultrasonic contrast agents increases
      the accuracy of vascular structures, the quality of the ultrasound blood flow image and the
      duration of signal enhancement. This makes it possible to visualize small gauge vessels and
      those with slow flows. In this way, the investigators could improve the ultrasound technique
      for measuring aneurysm bag diameters and endoleak detection. Moreover, the toxicity of
      iodinated contrast agents is the third cause of acute renal failure in hospitalized patients
      and is all the more frequent when the investigators increase injections. Improving the
      quality of ultrasound investigations for the monitoring of aortic endoprosthesis would
      therefore allow us to reduce the number of CT-scan performed in this population and thus
      reduce irradiation and the injection of nephrotoxic products. Thereby, the investigators
      would like to integrate the technique into the systematic follow-up of patients who have
      benefited from the placement of an aortic endoprosthesis by replacing the CT-scan.

    <description>During this unique visit they will benefit from 2 imaging exams performed by two different operators:
Echo-doppler without &quot;standard method&quot; contrast injection (common practice)
An echo-doppler with Sonovue® ultrasound injection &quot;Ultra_evar method&quot; (2.5 ml bolus 2-3 seconds) During this examination, the endoprosthesis and the aneurysm sac will be scanned according to the 4 incidences described above in order to objective whether or not there is a endoleak.
The patient then performs the control CT-scan prior to discharge from hospital.
The results of the medical imaging exams will be communicated to them before the hospital discharge, once the CT-scan has been performed.
A cross-review of the studies will be performed later.</description>
