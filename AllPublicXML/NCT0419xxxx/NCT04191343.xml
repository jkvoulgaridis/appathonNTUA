    <textblock>
      This is an open, single-arm, single-center, prospective phase II clinical study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of first-line tripletrumab combined with GEMOX chemotherapy in
      patients with advanced biliary tract tumors.

      Selected patients will receive the following treatment:

      Triplel monoclonal antibody (240mg, intravenous drip, d1, q3w);Combined with gemcitabine
      (1000mg/m2, intravenous drip, d1, d8, q3w) and oxaliplatin (100mg/m2, intravenous drip, d1,
      q3w) until the disease progresses or an intolerable adverse reaction occurs (the maximum
      treatment time is 2 years).
