      Observational clinical study, national, multicentric, prospective, non-comparative, with
      medical device, under application consistent with CE marking, for the evaluation of
      Papilocare® effectivness in the normalization of cervix cytological abnormalities caused by
      HPV.

      300 patients will be included in approximately 50 Spanish sites. The study comprehend a
      maximum of 3 visits. At visit 1, patient's writted informed consent will be collected,
      patient's selection critera will be checked, and patient's medial history data will be
      collected. At visit 2, 6 months after the first visit, the primary and secondary objectives
      will be evaluated. For those patients who finish treatment after 6 months, this will be the
      final visit. Only in that cases where, by usual clinical practice, the doctor indicates
      patient should continue under treatment, visit 3, wich will take place 12 months after
      streatment stars, will be the last visit for the patient under study.

    <description>The percentage of patients with normalization of the cytology with concordant colposcopy, at 6 months, and at 12 months if applicable, has been established as the main variable of the study, in order to assess the degree of normalization of cytological alterations.
Colposcopy concordant with normalized cytology results will be considered those colposcopic findings classified as normal, non-specific or as abnormal grade 1 (minor) according to the definition of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Federation of Cervical and Colposcopic Pathology (IFCPC). accepted at the Rio World Congress, July 5, 2011.</description>

        The main objective of the study is to evaluate the degree of normalization of cytological
        abnormalities of the cervix caused by HPV. For this purpose, women over 25 years old with
        positive HPV with lesions in the cervical mucosa, and concordant colposcopic image have
        been chosen as the target population.

        No exceptional measures are planned for the recruitment of patients in this study.
