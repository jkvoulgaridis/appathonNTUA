    <description>The HemoCare™ Hemodialysis System is intended for hemodialysis treatment, including short daily and nocturnal hemodialysis, of renal failure patients. The HemoCare™ Hemodialysis System is intended for use in chronic dialysis facilities, self‐care dialysis facilities, or the home setting. All treatments must be prescribed by a physician and administered by a trained operator. Treatments must be performed under the supervision or assistance of a medical professional or a care partner who has been trained and deemed competent in the use of the device by the prescribing physician.</description>
