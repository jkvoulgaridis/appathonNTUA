  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, single center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      BCMA/CD19 CAR-T cells in patients with BCMA+，CD19+ relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD19 has been extensively evaluated as a therapeutic target for relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma by chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy,this is a single arm,
      open-label, single center study to preliminary explore the safety, tolerability and cellular
      pharmacokinetics of Anti-BCMA and Anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma.
