      Introduction: Scientific papers on the womens's experiences of pregnancy loss aftercare in
      the emergency department show that how announcement is made and how much caregivers show
      empathy to women, help women to face this difficult moment. However, in most studies, women
      say they did not have enough information nor support from the medical teams.

      Diagnosis of miscarriage in the emergency department is the routine for the caregiver but is
      often experienced by the woman as the loss of a child.

      This study has for goal to bring to light the discrepancy between the caregivers's experience
      and the women's experience :the given information, the time for consultation, the empathy.

      Methods : 2 months after the diagnosis of miscarriage in the emergency room, patients receive
      a phone call with explanations about the project. If the patient gives her consent, she
      receives a computer questionnaire by email (questions about : reasons for coming to the
      emergency room, circumstances of announcement, information given in the emergency room,
      satisfaction with the careâ€¦) In parallel, caregivers have to complete a questionnaire about
      the same parameters.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate womens's experiences of pregnancy loss
      aftercare in the emergency department of Montpellier Hospital.

      The second objective is to assess the discrepancy between the patient's experience and the
      caregivers' experience in this situation with the aim of suggesting improvement.
