  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis which is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain, is an acute
      inflammation of appendix vermiformis. Appendectomy operations can be performed as
      laparoscopic and open surgery. Addition of opioids to intrathecal local anesthetics to
      improve the quality of preoperative analgesia is an increasingly used method in recent years.
      The aim of this study is to compare bupivacaine-fentanyl and bupivacaine-alfentanil which are
      used intrathecally to create motor and sensory block. 50 volunteer patients who were
      diagnosed as appendicitis by laboratory tests and clinical diagnostic methods in general
      surgery clinic and classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification I-II
      (ASA Class I-II) aged between 20-60 years scheduled for laparoscopic appendectomy operation,
      were included in this study. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups, Group I and
      Group II. Patients received spinal anesthesia with either 10 mg heavy bupivacaine (2 cc)+25
      mcg fentanyl (0.5 cc) intrathecally (Group I, n=25) or 10 mg heavy bupivacaine (2 cc)+250 mcg
      alfentanil (0.5 cc) intrathecally (Group II, n=25).
