  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators decided to assess the prognostic value of NLRP3 inﬂammasome level in early
      after heart valve replacement surgery and whether it was related to postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction. Study population included 90 subjects. Neuropsychological tests were
      administrated one day before surgery and seven days after surgery. Before induction of
      anesthesia, before the end of the operation, 7 days after the operation, peripheral venous
      blood was sampled to measure IL-1B, IL-18 and NLRP3 inflammatory protein expression in
      peripheral blood monocytes. Analyze the data and draw conclusions.

      90 consecutive patients scheduled for mitral valve replacement or aortic valve replacement
      under moderate hypothermic CPB gave written informed consent and were enrolled in this study.

      In the operating room, patients received routine monitoring. Systemic arterial blood pressure
      was measured via radial artery catheterization. After induction of anesthesia, a central
      venous catheter was inserted for monitoring central venous pressure (CVP) and fluid
      management. Baseline readings of hemodynamics were taken every 5 to 10 min after radial
      artery cannulation was completed.

      Induction of anesthesia was performed with target-controlled infusion of propofol. All
      patients received an infused scheme of several steps that started from a target plasma
      concentration (Cp) of 0.5 mg/mL that was increased stepwise by 0.5 mg/mL until the patient
      fell asleep and maintain BIS at 40-60. The interval between each step was 3 min. After loss
      of consciousness, cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) and fentanyl (10-15 mg/kg) were infused in all
      groups. The trachea was intubated and the lungs were ventilated with oxygenenriched air
      (fraction of inspired oxygen 0.6) to an end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of 35 to 45
      mmHg. The propofol target Cp was adjusted according to BIS. Intermittent IV boluses of
      fentanyl (10-15 mg/kg) were administered according to blood pressure and heart rate (HR) at
      the following time points: before the skin incision, before the onset of CPB, and after
      separation from CPB, for a total dose of 40 to 50 mg/kg. All patients received infusion of
      cisatracurium at 0.1 mg/kg/h throughout the surgery.

      Surgery was conducted on all patients via a standard median sternotomy approach. Porcine
      heparin was administered at a dose of 300 IU/kg and supplemented when required to maintain an
      activated coagulation time of at least 480 s during CPB. Heparin was neutralized with 1 mg of
      protamine/100 IU of heparin administered after separation from CPB. Body temperature was
      cooled to 30℃-32℃ on CPB (moderate hypothermia). All patients were treated with an
      intermittent antegrade infusion of cooled high-potassium blood cardioplegia during continuous
      aortic cross-clamping (ACC) using a nonpulsatile flow rate of 1.8 to 2.8 L/min/m2 and a
      membrane oxygenator to keep the mixed venous saturation at more than 75% during CPB.
      Phenylephrine (bolus, 20-100 mg) or epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg/min) or both were used to restore
      systemic vascular resistance, and MAP was maintained at a target range of 60 to 80 mmHg.
      Patients were warmed to a bladder temperature of 36.5℃ before separation from CPB, with the
      highest temperature not exceeding 37℃. Blood remaining in the CPB circuit and from the
      surgical field was collected in a cell-saving device. After centrifuging and washing, it was
      infused to the patient within 4 hours after CPB. Hematocrit was maintained at more than 25%,
      with the addition of blood as necessary. Insulin therapy was initiated during the surgery to
      treat serum blood glucose levels higher than 150 mg/dL. Hemodynamic (pre- or post-CPB)
      management aimed to keep MAP at 60 to 100 mmHg. Hypertension was treated with an additional
      bolus dose of fentanyl (0.2-0.3 mg) or with nitroglycerin (0.1-0.5 mg/kg/min or with both).
      Hypotension was treated with fluid intake (including crystalloids, colloids, and blood
      products) or vasoactive drug administration (phenylephrine IV, 20-100 mg or concomitant use
      of epinephrine, o 0.1 mg/min). The vasoactive drug dosage, fluid intake, and output (urine
      and blood loss) were recorded when the surgery was finished.

      As the surgeons began to close the skin, a 0.08 mg/kg bolus dose of midazolam was given
      intravenously and the infusion of propofol was stopped. After the surgery, all patients were
      admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). The patients were extubated when they
      were able to sustain adequate spontaneous respiration and required minimal oxygen support, as
      reflected by normal arterial blood gas levels. The patients then were discharged from the ICU
      when they were hemodynamically stable with blood gas variables within the normal range and
      when they did not need inotropic or oxygen support. The tracheal extubation time and the
      length of the ICU stay were recorded. For all patients, hemodynamic measurements were made
      and recorded at the following times: Before induction of anesthesia, before skin incision,
      after sternotomy, at the cessation of CPB (CPB-cessation), and at 1 (Post-CPB 1 h), 2
      (Post-CPB 2 h), and 4 (Post-CPB 4 h) hours after CPB. At pre-incision, CPB-cessation,
      Post-CPB 2 h, and PostCPB 4 h, the radial arterial blood was sampled for blood gas analysis,
      as well as blood glucose and lactic acid analyses. Before induction of anesthesia, at the end
      of the operation, 7 days after the operation, peripheral venous blood was sampled to measure
      IL-1B, IL-18 and NLRP3 inflammatory protein expression in peripheral blood monocytes.

      Neuropsychological tests were administrated one day before surgery and seven days after
      surgery for all patients in a quiet place of the general wards. Neuropsychological tests
      included seven tests with nine subscales. Specific tests used were as follows: MMSE, Trail
      Making (A/B), Stroop Color- Word, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, WAIS Digit Symbol
      Substitution Test, WAIS Digit Span, Verbal fluency test. Two psychologists carried out these
      tests. During the study phase, testing was performed and scored in a standardized manner in
      order to minimize inter-examiner difference. Repeat assessments for each patient were
      conducted by the same examiner. Parallel forms of tests were used in a randomized manner in
      sequential testing in order to minimize practice effect. Performance on each test was
      compared with cognitive test data of control subjects. A low test score was defined when the
      score was ≥ 2 SD lower than control subjects. For tests in which a higher score indicates
      decrement in performance, a score ≥ 2 SD higher than control subjects was considered as &quot;low
      test score.&quot; Patients were defined as having preoperative cognitive impairment if they had
      low test scores on two or more tests.

      For patients, preoperative scores were compared with postoperative test results, subtracted
      the average practice effect from these changes, and then divided the result by the
      control-subject SD to obtain a Z score for each test. The test results were adjusted so that
      a positive Z score indicated deterioration from the baseline test. The Z scores of all tests
      in an individual patient were then summarized and divided by the SD for this sum of Z scores
      in the control subjects, creating a combined Z score. A patient was defined as having POCD
      when two Z scores in individual tests or the combined Z score were 1.96 or more.

      Statistical analysis A continuous outcome was expressed as the mean ± SE, while a categorical
      outcome was expressed as percentages or frequencies. Differences in continuous and
      categorical outcomes were tested using the one-way analysis of variance and Chi square
      analysis, respectively. The unpaired Student t test, paired T test, analysis of variance and
      Pearson correlation analysis were performed on normally distributed data. Case-control
      differences in nominal data were evaluated with the Chi square test. Multivariate Cox
      regression analysis was done for predictors of adverse events. The NLRP3 level, IL-1B, IL-18
      and neurobehavioral scores were compared using ROC curves. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for
      correlation with POCD. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 21.0 (IBM Inc.) and
      P &lt; 0.05 was considered signifcant.
