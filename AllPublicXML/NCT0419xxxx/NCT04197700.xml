  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a pragmatic, prospective, single-centre, unit-based cluster crossover,
      open-label registry trial. The cardiac surgical intensive care unit (CSICU) will be cluster
      assigned to alternating MAP targets in 6-month blocks in a sequence. Additional sites across
      Alberta may be added, as necessary.

      Personalized Arm: The target MAP will be defined as +10% of the resting MAP. Resting MAP will
      be defined in priority order using one of the following MAP measurements:

        -  Pre-operative anesthesia or surgical consultation;

        -  Other physician outpatient consultation (e.g. cardiology, family physician, internist)
           within 30 days of surgery;

        -  Inpatient measurement the night before surgery;

        -  Pre-anesthetic MAP

      The lower and upper safety limits of personalized MAP targets will be 50mmHg and &lt;90mmHg,
      respectively.

      Protocolized Arm: The target MAP will be defined as 65 +/- 5mmHg. Pharmacologic and fluid
      treatment decisions will be at the discretion of the most responsible physician.

      In both study arms, the blood pressure control period will extend from anesthetic induction
      until 12 hours after admission to the CSICU. As an additional safety metric, the
      anesthesiologist will be encouraged to utilize clinically-driven cerebral saturation
      monitoring to identify potential hypoperfusion. In cases with low bilateral saturations where
      the anesthesiologist feels low MAP may be the putative mechanism, the investigators will
      request that MAPs be raised in 5mmHg increments. Following completion of the study protocol,
      the MAP and/or systolic blood pressure targets will be at the discretion of the most
      responsible physician.

Pre-operative anesthesia or surgical consultation;
Other physician outpatient consultation (e.g. cardiology, family physician, internist) within 30 days of surgery;
Inpatient measurement the night before surgery;
Pre-anesthetic MAP
The order of the measurements prioritizes outpatient MAPs given that temporary pre-operative discontinuation of anti-hypertensive agents could potentially raise, while fasting and/or fluid restriction pre-operatively could potentially lower resting blood pressure.39 The lower and upper safety limits of personalized MAP targets will be 50mmHg and &lt;90mmHg, respectively.</description>
