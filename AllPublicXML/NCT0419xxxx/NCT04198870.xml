    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the clinical outcome of
      MitraClip™ device versus open surgical repair in patients with severe primary MR who are at
      moderate surgical risk and whose mitral valve has been determined to be suitable for
      correction by MV repair surgery by the cardiac surgeon on the local site heart team.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has severe (Grade III or greater per the ASE criteria, which includes severity
             grades of 3+ and 4+) primary MR (mixed etiology is acceptable provided the principal
             mechanism of action is a degenerative mitral valve) as assessed by the ECL.

          -  The cardiac surgeon of the Site Heart Team (consisting of at least one
             interventionalist, and one cardiac surgeon) and the EC have confirmed that the
             patient's mitral valve anatomy is suitable for percutaneous repair with the MitraClip™
             device with high certainty of achieving MR ≤ mild

          -  Subject is symptomatic (NYHA Class II/III/IV) or asymptomatic with LVEF ≤ 60%,
             pulmonary artery pressure systolic pressure &gt; 50 mmHg, or LVESD &gt; 40 mm.

          -  Subject is at least 75 years of age. If younger than 75 years, then the subject should
             have:

          -  Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Predicted Risk of Mortality (PROM) Repair Score ≥
             2%, OR

          -  Presence of other comorbidities which may introduce a potential surgery-specific
             impediment.

          -  Subject provides written informed consent.

          -  Subject is ≥ 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is currently participating in another clinical investigation

          -  Presence of other anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other medical, social, or
             psychological conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the
             subject's ability to participate in the clinical investigation or to comply with
             follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the clinical
             investigation results.

          -  Subject's mitral valve anatomy is such that it is not repairable by the cardiac
             surgeon on the local site heart team

          -  Subject has ischemic or non-ischemic secondary MR

          -  Subject has valve anatomy which precludes the primary MitraClip™ device operator from
             reducing MR to mild or less

          -  Concomitant severe tricuspid valve regurgitation

          -  Ejection fraction &lt;30%

          -  Severe mitral annular calcification

          -  Acute myocardial infarction in the past 12 weeks

          -  Need for cardiac surgery to correct pulmonary valve disease, aortic valve disease, or
             tricuspid valve disease.

          -  Subjects who have concurrent coronary artery disease may be included provided the
             subjects are eligible for both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary
             artery bypass surgery. Patients randomized to the device group, must undergo PCI
             before the MitraClip™ device procedure. Patients randomized to the surgical (control)
             arm may undergo coronary artery revascularization during mitral valve repair surgery.

          -  Surgical procedure performed in the past 30 days

          -  Femoral vein cannot accommodate a 24 F catheter or presence of IVC filter would
             interfere with the catheter or ipsilateral DVT

          -  Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is contraindicated.

          -  Hemodynamic instability: systolic pressure ≤ 90 mmHg without afterload reduction,
             cardiogenic shock or the need for inotropic support or IABP

          -  Need for emergency surgery for any reason

          -  Prior mitral valve surgery, valvuloplasty, mechanical prosthetic valve or VAD

          -  Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve

          -  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

          -  Renal insufficiency (Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL)

          -  Active infections requiring current antibiotic therapy

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant.
