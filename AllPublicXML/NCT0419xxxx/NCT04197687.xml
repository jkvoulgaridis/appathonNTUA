    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well TPIV100 and sargramostim work in treating patients with
      HER2 positive, stage II-III breast cancer that has remained after chemotherapy and surgery.
      It also studies why some HER2 positive breast cancer patients respond better to chemotherapy
      in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. TPIV100 is a type of vaccine made from HER2
      peptide that may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that
      express HER2. Sargramostim increases the number of white blood cells in the body following
      chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and is used to alert the immune system. It is not
      yet known if TPIV100 and sargramostim will work better in treating patients with HER2
      positive, stage II-III breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate invasive disease free survival (iDFS) of multi-epitope HER2 vaccine versus
      (vs.) placebo in combination with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TTT-DM1) in patients with stage
      II-III HER2 positive (+) breast cancer (BC) with residual disease post-neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the safety of multi-epitope HER2 vaccine given concurrently with
      ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) maintenance therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate immunogenicity of multi-epitope HER2 vaccine in combination with T-DM1
      maintenance therapy.

      II. To evaluate the immune-related tissue and blood biomarkers for complete pathological
      response in patients with stage II-III HER2+ BC receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine host immune factors which are critical to prevent disease recurrence in HER2+
      BC patients.

      Ia. To determine if the development of T cell immunity, as assessed by IFN-gamma
      enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot), to HER2 correlates with improved iDFS.

      Ib. To determine the distribution of the helper T cell response among helper T cell
      differentiation states.

      Ic. To determine if augmenting CD4 helper T cell immunity augments HER2-specific antibody
      immunity induced by trastuzumab.

      Id. To determine if human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes are associated with antibody
      responses before and after neoadjuvant therapy and vaccination.

      Ie. To determine gene expression levels in tumors from patients who did not achieve complete
      pathological response (pCR) that are associated with recurrence.

      II. To determine tumor intrinsic genotyping and phenotyping features associated with
      therapeutic failure to HER2 immune-based approaches.

      IIa. To determine whether HER2 monoclonal antibody therapy induces HER2 loss and modulation
      of HER2-specific adaptive immune responses.

      IIb. To determine loss-of-function mutations in breast tumor that associate with lack of pCR
      and lack of immune response to HER2+ neoadjuvant treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      pCR AFTER NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY AND SURGERY: Patients receive standard of care maintenance
      therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NO pCR AFTER NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY AND SURGERY: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care maintenance therapy with trastuzumab emtansine and
      receive TPIV100 intradermally (ID) and sargramostim ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then receive two additional booster injections of TPIV100 ID and sargramostim ID at
      3 and 12 months after completion of trastuzumab emtansine maintenance therapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care maintenance therapy with trastuzumab emtansine and
      receive placebo ID and sargramostim ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive
      two additional booster injections of placebo ID and sargramostim ID at 3 and 12 months after
      completion of trastuzumab emtansine maintenance therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients with pCR are followed up at 30 days and 24
      months. Patients with no pCR followed up at 30 days and at 3, 4, 12, 13, and 24 months. All
      patients are then followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years.

    <time_frame>From time of randomization to recurrence, invasive breast cancer or death, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>iDFS will be defined from the time of randomization to ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, death attributable to any cause, including breast cancer, non-breast cancer, or unknown cause, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or second primary non-breast invasive cancer. Will be based on stratified log-rank test at one-sided 0.01 level in an intention-to-treat population, where the stratification is by the randomization stratification factors. The Cox proportional hazards model will be used to adjust for the trial stratification factors (hormone receptor, human leukocyte antigen A classification, status and clinical stage). Subgroup analyses of iDFS will also be performed by stratification factors and other baseline characteristics, with the caveat that statistical power for these subgroup analyses may be limited.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0 and defined as adverse events that are classified as either unrelated, unlikely to be related, possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study treatment. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed by primary disease site to determine toxicity patterns. Frequency tables will be generated to summarize the occurrence of treatment-related AE's by treatment arms. Comparisons of the rates of individual AE's will be done using tests of proportions such as Fisher's exact test or Chi-squared test. Additional analysis will use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test with study stratification factors.</description>

    <description>Will be defined as a 2-fold or greater increase in HER2-specific antibody concentration from pre-treatment levels at any point during treatment or HER2-specific antibodies above the lower limit of detection at any point during treatment if pre-treatment levels were non-detectable. Antibody response frequency at the post-treatment initiation time points will be compared among arms using a chi-squared test. Antibody response magnitude at the post-treatment initiation time point will be compared among arms using an analysis of variance F-test followed by Tukey pairwise comparisons between pairs of arms. Likelihood of antibody response at the post-treatment initiation time point will be compared among arms using logistic regression (the dependent variable is antibody response [yes/no] at the post-treatment initiation time point; the independent variables are the antibody response [yes/no] at the pre-treatment time point and a categorical variable capturing arm).</description>
