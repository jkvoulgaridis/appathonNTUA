  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of SIT in
      teaching medical students to perform in high-fidelity simulation settings similar to those
      they may experience in their practice.

      This is a study examining stress inoculation training and its potential role in medical
      education. The medical field exposes students and providers to various stressful situations
      each and every day. Various organizations including military organizations have introduced
      concepts of stress inoculation training (SIT) to help learners manage these situations to
      produce optimal performance.

    <measure>Change in anxiety - visual analog</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in anxiety will be assessed using the Visual Anxiety Scale (VAS/VAS-A), a widely used scale that has been validated in multiple settings to detect changes in anxiety level. A 10cm line will be drawn on the screen and participants will be asked to rate their level of anxiety by clicking somewhere on the line - the leftmost portion coinciding with no anxiety, the rightmost portion coinciding with extreme anxiety. Each millimeter to the right of the initial start of the line counts as 1 point out of 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in state-trait anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 6 (STAI-6) will be used to measure state-trait anxiety. The STAI-6 is a validated 6-question form of the STAI-Y, a commonly used and validated measure of anxiety.</description>
