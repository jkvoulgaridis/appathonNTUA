  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the feasibility of a web-based computerized cognitive training protocol
      to healthy older adults. The training protocol will occur in two phases. In the first phase,
      participants will be randomly allocated in one type of training, and in the second phase all
      participants will receive the same training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research demonstrated the relevance in training cognitive abilities that typically
      decline with age, such as those associated with executive control (e.g., abstract thinking,
      selective and divided attention, planning, task-switching and inhibitory control). The aim of
      the present study is to investigate the feasibility of a web-based computerized cognitive
      training based on executive control to cognitively healthy older adults. The participants
      will undergo the web-training in a daily type situation of meal preparation (i.e., Breakfast
      Task). The training protocol will occur in two phases. In the first phase of the protocol,
      participants will be randomized in two different training conditions: Table Setting (TS) or
      Cooking (CO). In the second phase, all participants will undergo a complex training condition
      combining TS and CO in a multi-tasking fashion (Emphasis Change approach). In addition,
      participants will undergo web-based cognitive evaluations at pre-training, between-training
      phases, and at post-training. This approach will allow us to understand (1) how different
      previous training experience impact on multi-tasking context, and (2) if Emphasis Change
      training is an effective approach to improve cognitive performance in a multi-task daily type
      context. If feasible, the investigators protocol will allow training older adults in critical
      cognitive skills for daily life situations. The web-based training is an advancement since it
      can be delivered at-home, remotely supervised, and is easily scalable. Recently, remote
      interventions have been particularly relevant to OA due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may
      limit in-person research participation.

    <description>Change in cooking time (milliseconds) in each food type. In the computerized task, participants are asked to cook different food types. Scores reflect the average absolute values of the difference between the required and actual cooking time of each item. Lowers scores (closest to zero) represent a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks (during the intervention), within one week after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The participants are asked to identify targets and ignore distracting visual information under different conditions.

    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks (during the intervention), within one week after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with a computer screen of 9 boxes. The boxes light up in a pre-fixed sequence and participants are asked to click on the boxes in the same order they were lit. The sequence length starts at level = 2 boxes and can increase to up to level 9. One point is giving for each correct response. Higher values represent better performance (min 0; max of 16 points).</description>
