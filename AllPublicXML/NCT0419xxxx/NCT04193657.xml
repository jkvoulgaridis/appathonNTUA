      1. Multicentre pilot study (n=90) which aims to study a prevalent population of elderly or
           frail patients with mCRPC whom are often excluded from clinical trial participation.
           (Data is sorely needed in this population)

        2. The study aims to determine:

             1. if symptom monitoring (daily) is feasible using telephone or electronic means of
                communications in the elderly or frail patient with mCRPC

             2. The time course/pattern of symptoms important to quality of life for patients
                undergoing chemotherapy, abi/enza, or Radium 223

             3. If changes in physical activity (quantified by fitbit) predict for changes to ESAS
                in men undergoing treatment d) Qualitatively assess the supportive care needs of
                older/frail men with mCRPC

      Study Aim:

      The previous multi-centre observational study (TOPCOP), funded by Prostate Cancer Canada,
      demonstrated important declines in multiple areas of quality of life, and fatigue and
      functional decline which were common issues that often limited further treatment. Emerging
      data from other settings demonstrate that (a) close monitoring of symptoms may reduce
      treatment toxicity and improve survival; (b) improving physical activity and targeting pain
      and sleep may improve fatigue and function. Whether these are feasible in the setting of
      older or frail men with mCRPC is unclear. Incorporating what the investigators have learned
      from TOPCOP and emerging supportive oncology literature, our main aim is to examine the
      emergence of key symptoms (fatigue, pain, insomnia) and explore whether reductions in daily
      physical activity are early indicators of toxicity over one treatment cycle (3-4 weeks) and
      therefore targetable in a subsequent intervention study.

      Study Design:

      This is a prospective multicentre observational study. The investigators will enroll
      English-speaking men with mCRPC who are either age 75 or older or age 60-74 and frail using
      (a) chemotherapy; (b) abiraterone or enzalutamide; (c) Radium.

      Daily telephone-based brief symptom screening will be done with the Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment Scale (ESAS). Daily monitoring of physical activity (step counts) will be done
      with commercial smartphone apps or a Fitbit device. Moderate or higher symptoms (&gt;3/10) on
      ESAS or a decrease in daily step count of 15% or more triggers more detailed telephone-based
      toxicity assessment and measures of pain, sleep, and fatigue as appropriate. The study
      duration is 3 weeks (1 cycle of chemotherapy) or 4 weeks (abiraterone/enzalutamide/radium).
      Qualitative interviews will be done to explore challenges with treatment tolerability and
      adherence.
