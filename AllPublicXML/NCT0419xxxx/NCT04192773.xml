    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory pilot open-label study to identify the signal changes on fMRI of
      patients with tinnitus and with temporary suppression of the tinnitus with IV lidocaine.
      Patients will include those with hearing loss (both unilateral and bilateral) and tinnitus,
      subjects with normal hearing and tinnitus, and control subjects with normal hearing and no
      tinnitus. Eligible subjects will have functional and subjective data collected at baseline,
      receive an IV lidocaine infusion, and have functional and subjective data collected
      post-infusion for comparison and identification of involved neural networks.

      A total of 40 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Ten study volunteers will be enrolled
      in each of the following four groups:

        1. - Normal hearing (NH) without tinnitus (T-)

        2. - Normal hearing (NH) with tinnitus (T+)

        3. - Unilateral hearing loss (uHL) and ipsilateral unilateral tinnitus (uT+)

        4. - Bilateral hearing loss (bHL) and bilateral tinnitus (bT+)

      Application of the study treatment may occur at the initial Screening Visit (pending all
      eligibility requirements can be confirmed) or at Visit 1. The first visit (not including IV
      lidocaine infusion) should take no more than 3 hours. The investigators will assess patient
      eligibility and obtain a baseline MRI, audiometry with high frequency, and middle ear muscle
      reflexes. Three questionnaires (THI, TFI, VAS) will also be given prior to IV lidocaine
      infusion to assess patients' perception of their tinnitus.

      The patient visit and baseline screening may take up to 8 hours total. Patients may have
      completed the screening/baseline visit on a prior day, in which case the visit should take no
      more than 5 hours. At the screening/baseline visit, patient will be asked to complete three
      questionnaires; have an audiogram with high frequency and middle ear reflexes; a pregnancy
      test if the patient is a woman of childbearing age, and a baseline MRI to assess brain
      activity. We will also obtain a baseline EKG to evaluate the patient's heart and blood draw
      to check liver and kidney function. At the infusion visit, patients will receive IV lidocaine
      infusion for 30 minutes (500mg maximal dose) and an fMRI of the brain. After the infusion,
      the investigators will draw some blood samples to test for serum lidocaine levels, perform
      another audiogram with high frequency and middle ear reflexes, and administer the same three
      questionnaires (THI, TFI, VAS). The investigators will follow-up with patients via email 30
      (±7) days after the infusion visit for any adverse event and ask them to complete the three
      questionnaires (THI, TFI, VAS).

    <time_frame>60 MINUTES</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will scan the patient in fMRI prior to IV lidocaine administration. After the infusion, patient will get another fMRI scan to assess any neural changes in the primary auditory cortex and associated salience, limbic and cognitive regions.</description>

    <measure>Change in subjective assessment of tinnitus via Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire from baseline to post-infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 MINUTES</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given the questionnaire at baseline to evaluate their tinnitus. The purpose of this questionnaire is to identify difficulties that patients may be experiencing because of their tinnitus. The patients can choose to answer &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, and &quot;no&quot; to these questions. The higher scores mean worse outcome. The same questionnaire will be given after the infusion to compare questionnaire responses.</description>

    <measure>Change in subjective assessment of tinnitus via Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) questionnaire from baseline to post-infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 MINUTES</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given the questionnaire at baseline to evaluate their tinnitus. Multiple questions probing how the patient's tinnitus has affected different social aspects of their lives are evaluated on the scale of 0 to 10. The higher scores indicate a worse outcome. The same questionnaire will be given after the infusion to compare questionnaire responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective assessment of tinnitus via Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaire from baseline to post-infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 MINUTES</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given the questionnaire at baseline to evaluate their tinnitus. The scale evaluates tinnitus loudness, annoyance felt by the patient due to the tinnitus, distress experienced by the patient, and his/her ability to cope with tinnitus. The scale is 10cm long, labeled with 'min' on the left side and 'max' on the right side. Higher scores on the first three categories mean worse outcomes and lower score on the ability to cope means worse outcome. The same questionnaire will be given after the infusion to compare questionnaire responses.</description>

    <description>1000mg/hour IV lidocaine administered for up to 30 minutes (500mg max). Patients will be continuously monitored by a nurse every 5 (±2) minutes to check specifically for vital signs (BP, HR, and RR), patient tinnitus levels, and reports of side effects.
The infusion is continued until any of the following criteria are met: 1) the patient has completed the 30-minute infusion; 2) the patient reports intolerable or concerning side effect, such as dizziness, nausea, or vomiting; 3) the patient experiences bradycardia &lt;50 and a drop of systolic blood pressure (BP) more than 20 mmHg and diastolic pressure more than 10 mmHg during the infusion; 4) the patient reports that tinnitus is resolved, or 5) the patient wishes to stop the study.
Serum lidocaine levels will be drawn by a research nurse upon completion of MRI. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, the Tinnitus Functional Index, and the Visual Analog Scale will be administered after IV infusion.</description>
