  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions are a leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide
      and for the last decade they have also been the most common cause of sickness absence and
      disability pension in Norway.

      Although most sickness absence is short-termed, a small proportion of people with MSK
      conditions are on long-term sick leave, contributing to large cost due to disbursement of
      benefits, productivity loss and extensive use of health care. There is growing evidence that
      long-term sickness absence is harmful to mental and physical health, with a reduced
      probability of return to work (RtW) with prolonged sickness absence. Thus, focusing on early
      RtW in people on sick leave due to MSK conditions is important to reduce the burden on both
      the individual and the society. However, to provide interventions to reduce the duration of
      sickness absence to all people on sick leave would require enormous resources. By targeting
      those at risk of long-term sickness absence, resources may be used differently, e.g. more
      resource-saving. By using information on modifiable risk factors from simple risk assessment
      tools, health care providers and other stakeholders may facilitate RtW in a better way.

      The overall purposes of this project are 1) to identify the most accurate screening tool to
      identify people at a high risk of prolonged sickness absence due to a MSK condition, and 2)
      to investigate severity of MSK health, health-related quality-of-life, health care
      consumption, and costs across different risk profiles in people on sick leave due to MSK
      conditions. We will use registered data on sickness absence from 1 year before to 1 year
      after inclusion in the study.

      Main aims are:

        -  To compare the predictive ability of the STarT MSK tool and the ÖMPSQ-SF, and other
           established risk factors for long-term sickness absence (e.g. symptoms of depression and
           emotional distress, low motivation for returning to work, low self-efficacy, work
           expectancies) for identifying prolonged sickness absence at 6- and 12-months follow-up
           due to MSK conditions

        -  To develop a prognostic model to predict risk of prolonged sickness absence at 12-month
           follow-up in people with MSK conditions

        -  To assess predictors for high costs (productivity loss and health care use) at 6- and
           12-months follow-up in people on sick leave due to MSK conditions

      The study will also include additional methodological and descriptive aims.

      Prior to the data collection we translated and culturally adapted the Keele STarT MSK and
      MSK-HQ following the Beaton guidelines.

      The study is conducted within the Norwegian Welfare and Labor Administration (NAV) system in
      collaboration with OsloMet - Oslo Metropolitan University. Data on sickness absence from the
      NAV registry will be retrieved prospectively in the period from study inclusion to 12 months
      follow-up, and retrospectively 12 months prior to inclusion in the study.

      Previous studies show that 30-40% of people with MSK conditions have not RtW after 3 to 12
      months. In order to conduct analyses including 15- 20 predictor variables, we aim at
      including 500-600 people on sick leave due to MSK conditions. As the main outcomes are
      collected through registries, we do not expect any dropouts.
