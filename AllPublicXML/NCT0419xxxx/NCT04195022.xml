  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical cavities, which involve more than two surfaces, one being buccal or lingual/palatal,
      are a challenge for restorative dentistry, since the risk of restorative failure is related
      to the number of surfaces involved. Thus, the purpose of this umbrella project is to conduct
      a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy and patient-centered outcomes of
      a chemically activated composite alkasite resin in atypical deciduous molar lesions. Primary
      molars of children aged 4 to 7 years with at least one atypical cavitary lesion in primary
      molars will be selected for the RCT. The selected teeth will be randomly divided into:
      Alkasite chemically activated composite resin and Bulk fill composite resin. Clinical and
      radiographic follow-up of the lesions will be performed for 6 and 12 months. The
      effectiveness of the treatments will be evaluated by the longevity of the restorative
      procedures and paralysis of the lesions. Patient-centered outcomes will also be evaluated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with special needs will be excluded, with general health conditions that may
