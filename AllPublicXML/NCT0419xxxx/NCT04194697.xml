      The primary objective of this study is to explore the effect of an exercise program combining
      aerobic and resistance exercises provided by mobile healthcare applications (hereinafter
      referred to as &quot;app&quot;) on the body composition of subjects in the program in comparison with
      subjects without the exercise program.
