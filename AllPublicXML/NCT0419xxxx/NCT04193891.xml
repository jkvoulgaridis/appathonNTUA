  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The modified Atkins diet, a form of ketogenic therapy in which individuals severely restrict
      their carbohydrate intake and subsequently enter ketosis, has begun to be used as an
      adjunctive treatment in adults with intractable epilepsy who are not surgical candidates. In
      this study, the investigators examine the effect of ketogenic dietary therapy on sleep, as
      sleep deprivation is one of the most common seizure triggers and seizures themselves have
      been found to affect sleep quality. This pilot study will enroll twenty participants, ten of
      whom are initiating ketogenic dietary therapy and ten participants who are being treated with
      standard anti-seizure drug therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty participants, 10 participants on the modified Atkins diet and 10 control participants,
      will be enrolled in the study. All participants will fill out validated sleep questionnaires
      and complete sleep and seizure diaries. Furthermore, all participants will wear actigraphy
      watches prior to ketogenic dietary therapy initiation as well as four to six weeks after
      being on the diet. For control participants, the actigraphy will be completed at two time
      points to mimic that of the participants in the dietary therapy group. For the home sleep
      studies for the subset of participants, these will be completed at similar time intervals as
      that of the actigraphy. Adherence to the diet will be monitored according to standard medical
      management; for any participant on the diet, he or she will keep track of food intake and
      track ketones, which will be submitted at the four to six week follow-up visit.

    <measure>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>before entering the study, 4-6 weeks after being on the diet (or 4-6 weeks after enrollment for control subjects)</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a survey where participants score their chance of dozing (0-3, where 0 is 'would never doze', 1 is 'slight chance of dozing', 2 is 'moderate chance of dozing', and 3 is 'high chance of dozing') in 8 different situations. The total range in scores is 0-24 where higher scores indicate higher chances of dozing.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>before entering the study, 4-6 weeks after being on the diet (or 4-6 weeks after enrollment for control subjects)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index measures participant quality of sleep in each of 7 domains over the last month: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. The total possible range of scores is 0-21 with 0 indicating no difficulties and 21 indicating severe difficulties.</description>

    <time_frame>before entering the study, 4-6 weeks after being on the diet (or 4-6 weeks after enrollment for control subjects)</time_frame>
    <description>The Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire is a 19-item survey that measures participant tendency toward being a 'morning' or 'evening' person. The total possible range of scores is 16-86 with scores of 41 and below indicating 'evening' types, scores between 42-58 being 'intermediate' types, and scores of 59 and above 'morning' types.</description>

    <description>The ketogenic diet, where individuals restrict their carbohydrate intake and significantly increase their intake of fats, was initially primarily used in children with severe epilepsy, often due to genetic syndromes. Recently, with the advent of slightly less restrictive forms of ketogenic dietary therapy (e.g. the modified Atkins diet), it has begun to be used in adults with intractable seizures who are not surgical candidates.</description>
