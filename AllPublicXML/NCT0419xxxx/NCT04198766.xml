    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, non-randomized, 4-part Phase 1 trial to determine the
      safety profile and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of INBRX 106 administered as a single agent or in combination with the anti-PD-1
      checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) pembrolizumab (Keytruda).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Select Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females aged â‰¥18 years.

          -  Parts 1 and 3 (dose escalation): Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non
             resectable solid tumors, whose disease has progressed despite all standard therapies
             or for whom no further standard or clinically acceptable therapy exists.

          -  Part 2 (single-agent expansion cohort): Subjects with NSCLC, melanoma, HNSCC, G/GEA,
             RCC, or TCC, with locally advanced or metastatic, non-resectable disease, which has
             progressed despite all standard therapies or for whom no standard or clinically
             acceptable therapy exists.

          -  Part 4 (pembrolizumab combination expansion cohorts): Subjects with melanoma, HNSCC,
             G/GEA, RCC, or TCC (Cohort F1) or NSCLC (Cohorts F2 and F3), with locally advanced or
             metastatic, non resectable disease, which has progressed despite all standard
             therapies or for whom no standard or clinically acceptable therapy exists.

          -  All subjects with non-squamous NSCLC must have documentation of absence of tumor
             activating EGFR mutations and absence of ALK gene rearrangements.

             defined in protocol apply.

             pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac condition, including myocardial infarction,
             uncontrolled angina, cerebrovascular accident, or other acute uncontrolled heart
             disease &lt; 3 months; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%; New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure; or uncontrolled
             hypertension. Active, hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism within 3 months
             prior to enrollment on this trial.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment on this trial.

          -  Anti-infectious drug treatments (i.e., antibiotics) within 4 weeks prior to the first
             dose of study drug.
