  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of recovery is an important outcome measure in anaesthesia, whilst there are
      validated tools for this in surgery and regional anesthesia there are no fully validated
      tools for obstetrics anaesthesia. The aim of this study is to use the Obstetric Quality of
      Recovery (ObsQoR) score across multiple centres to assess correlation to length of stay and
      variation for different types of operative and non- operative delivery.

      An observational survey based study, for 3 consecutive week days, chosen by the local
      investigating team during a two-week period across multiple centres.

        -  Local investigators will complete the survey with each patient who has received
           anaesthetic intervention from an anaesthetist, 1 day, around 24hrs after delivery in
           line with their routine anaesthetic follow up.

        -  At 30 days, a telephone survey will be conducted with each patient to repeat the ObsQoR
           survey and ask key questions regarding functional recovery and activities of daily
           living post delivery.

      In addition for a small number of sites, elective caesarean delivery patients will have blood
      taken at the point of anaesthesia and 24 hours post delivery to assess the immune function
      and any changes which may predict poorer outcome in these women.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>• Correlation of ObsQoR with length of hospital stay (LOS) in hours following delivery across multiple centres, particularly ObsQoR score and prediction of prolonged LOS (&gt;1.5 SD) and readmission to hospital.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>During the study the total length of stay in hours will be calculated for participating patients. This will be correlated with the score from the ObsQoR survey tool. In addition the readmission status of the patient will be asked at the subsequent survey combined with the patient's health care record to correlate with the ObsQoR tool score. Where the ObsQoR score is measured between 0-100 and LOS will be in hours. Readmission will be a binary outcome measure</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>• The relationship between ObsQoR and patient-reported ready for discharge. This will concurrently be determined to account for institutional, non-medical maternal factors neonatal factors that may delay discharge and impact LOS.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be surveyed using the ObsQoR tool and also asked regarding when they felt they were ready for discharge to take into account the multitude of factors which may impact on the overall length of stay.
