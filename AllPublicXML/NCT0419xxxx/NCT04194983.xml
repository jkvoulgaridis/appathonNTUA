  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether dairy or plant based fats combined with fish
      oils can alter skeletal muscle mitochondrial, physical, and cognitive function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical and cognitive function decline as we get older and this may be due to changes within
      the mitochondria, organelles that regulate energy production in our cells. The ability of the
      mitochondria to produce energy can be affected by diet, and the composition of lipids in the
      cell is an important factor in determining how effective our mitochondria are. Dairy and
      plant based lipids differ in composition and therefore may differ in their ability to affect
      mitochondrial function when combined with fish oils (FO). The primary objective of this study
      is to determine whether supplementation with dairy or plant based fats combined with fish
      oils can alter skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Additional exploratory objectives are
      1) skeletal muscle and physical function and 2) cognitive function.

    <masking_description>After subjects have successfully completed the screening, they will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio, using a 4-code system, to one of the two interventions (intervention or control). The intervention and control will each be individually coded with a randomly generated 3 letter coding system with 2 codes allocated to intervention product and the other 2 codes allocated to the control product. sachets will be generated by the product manufacturer and the corresponding blinding label will be added to the sachets, prior to shipment to the study sites. The un-blinding-key will be sent to the project leaders in sealed envelopes. In this way, both the participants and principle investigator will be blinded throughout the study.</masking_description>
