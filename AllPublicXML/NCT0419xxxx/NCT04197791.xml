  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) refers to various diseases that occur idiopathic or secondary
      to some causes, commonly affecting the lung parenchyma, and present with varying degrees of
      inflammation and fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) progressing with progressive
      shortness of breath causes a decrease in exercise capacity and quality of life, restrictive
      changes in pulmonary function tests and a decrease in diffusion capacity. It has been
      reported that core stabilization exercises improve respiratory function, respiratory muscle
      strength and functional capacity in healthy individuals and some disease groups. It has also
      been reported that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applied to lower extremity,
      upper extremity and back or quadriceps muscles reduces dynamic hyperinflation and dyspnea
      during exercise and increases exercise capacity in COPD patients.No studies have been
      performed using core stabilization exercises and NMES in IPF patients. It can be assumed that
      this therapeutic intervention may also be useful in IPF.

      Our study was planned to investigate the efficacy of core stabilization exercises and NMES in
      patients with IPF.

      Stable idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis will be included in the study from the Istanbul Yedikule
      Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Training and Research Hospital. Patients will be
      randomized into 2 groups; Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) and Core Stabilization
      Exercises Training Group (n: 18): 2 days per week for 6 weeks duration. The demographic
      measurements, respiratory function test, respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea, 6 minutes
      walking test, quality of life, depression and clinical characteristics and physical fitness
      of the patients will be recorded. The following parameters will be evaluated before and after
      the training of the patients in the two groups.

    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale is a self-administered questionnaire with 9 items (questions) investigating the severity of fatigue in different situations during the past week. Respondents answer using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. ''1'' indicates strong disagreement with the statement, while ''7'' indicates strong agreement. Total score is calculated by deriving an arithmetic mean. FSS scores range from 0-63. A score of 36 or higher generally indicates severe fatigue.</description>

    <description>Functional mobility was measured with Timed up and go test [TUGT] (sec). The patient sitting on chair stood up with the instruction of physiotherapist and walked 3 meters as fast as possible, walked back to the chair and sat down again. The total duration was recorded in seconds. Lower time reflects better functional mobility. TUGT was performed with 3 repetitions.</description>
