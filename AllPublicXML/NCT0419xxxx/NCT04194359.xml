  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sintilimab (R&amp;D code: IBI308) is a recombinant human-derived IgG4 type PD-1 monoclonal
      antibody. PD-1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy has synergistic effect to further enhance
      anti-tumor immunity. This study is a phase III clinical study of a three-week regimen of
      sintilimab combined with the XELOX+ bevacizumab for RAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer
      patients who had not received any treatment before. The purpose of this study is to explore
      the efficacy of sintilimab combined with XELOX + bevacizumab as first line therapy.

          -  ECOG 0 to 1

          -  Life expectancy is at least 12 weeks

          -  Hematological examination absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;1.5×109/L, hemoglobin&gt;8g/dL
             and platelet&gt;100×109/L (according to the normal value of clinical trial center)

          -  Prothrombin time (PT) &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal value and normal
             thromboplastin time (APTT) &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal value

          -  Laboratory examination, serum creatinine is less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper
             limit of the normal reference range (if serum creatinine is elevated, 24 hours of
             urine must be collected, except for 24 hours creatinine clearance &gt; 50ml/min)

          -  When there is no liver metastasis, ALT or AST is less than or equal to 2.5 times the
             upper limit of the normal value reference range, serum total bilirubin is less than or
             equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal value reference range; for patients
             with liver metastasis, ALT or AST is less than or equal to 5 times the upper limit of
             the normal value reference range, serum total bilirubin is less than or equal to 3

             to exist.

        There are active infections that require systemic treatment.

          -  It is possible to confuse the test results, the medical history or disease evidence,
             the treatment or laboratory value abnormalities that hinder the subject's full
             participation in the study, or the investigator believes that participating in the
             study is not in the best interests of the subject.

          -  There are known mental or substance abuse disorders that may have an impact on
             compliance with test requirements.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or who are expected to be pregnant
             during the planned trial period (from 120 days after screening visits to 120 days
             after the last dose of study treatment, or 180 days after the last dose of study
             treatment), or Male subjects whose spouse is pregnant.

          -  A history of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibody) is
