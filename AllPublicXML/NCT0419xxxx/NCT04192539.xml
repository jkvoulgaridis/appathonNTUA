  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum taurine results in this study showed that, besides CRC biomarkers; it is most
      attractive, more precious and more accurate early biomarker for early detecting of any
      malignant change which may led to CRC by other mean it is the most sensitive and more
      specific tumor marker for CRC. As a result, we can recommend measuring its level regularly
      with other prognostic tumor biomarkers and screening examination for all people with
      abdominal and gastrointestinal problems and for precancerous patients as a pre-early
      biomarker for colorectal carcinoma. So, it needs further studies to confirm that observations
      on large scale of population as it obvious the small sample size in early stage and lack data
      due to limited financial resources and it needs more efforts to collect first and
      precancerous stages patients.

      Two-hundred and fifty Egyptian patients (males and females) who attended National Cancer
      Institute, Cairo university; most of them were referred from private clinics and
      non-specialized hospitals, complain with abdominal troubles and gastrointestinal problems and
      bleeding per rectum, after full investigation, clinical examination, biochemical analysis,
      screening examination according to their cases (Ultra sound, CT or endoscopy either rectal or
      colonoscopy) and histopathological examination, we choose 'after their approval' one-hundred
      patients and six which diagnosed as CRC patients aged (19-69 years old) and excluded the
      others from participated in these studies because they diagnosed as non-colonic diseases
      like; Irritable colon, Gastroenteritis, Pancreatitis, Liver flexure or Chronic cholecystitis.
      According to Histopathological architecture, we divided patients to:

        1. Inflammatory group number=7.

        2. Benign tumor group number=8 which was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively.

        3. Malignant tumor group number=91 Lastly, ten health volunteers were enrolled as a frank
           control. For all included subjects, the measured biochemical analysis were CBC, ALT,
           AST, Albumin, Total Bilirubin, Creatinine, Blood urea, Sodium, Potassium, CEA, CA19.9
           and Taurine.
