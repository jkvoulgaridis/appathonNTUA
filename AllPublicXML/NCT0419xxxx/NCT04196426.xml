  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is an important public health problem in Vietnam, with one in ten Vietnamese
      women suffering from it. There is enough evidence demonstrating that low calcium intake is
      one of the risk factors for osteoporosis among Asian women in general and Vietnamese women in
      specific. It is reported that the intake of calcium among Vietnamese women is under 400
      mg/day, which is less than the daily recommendation of 1,000 mg/day by the Vietnam National
      Institute of Nutrition, even though calcium-rich foods are largely available in Vietnam.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to promote dietary calcium intake among Vietnamese
      women aged 30-65 years through implementing a nutrition education intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vietnamese women aged 30-65 years without medical problems that could interfere with the
      calcium consumption, such as kidney stone, kidney and liver diseases. The women will be
      excluded if they are blinded, deaf, or have general learning disability.

      Outcomes of the study are dietary calcium intake, calcium knowledge, and osteoporosis health
      belief. A quantitative questionnaire is being used to collect these data.

    <measure>Dietary calcium intake</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The dietary calcium intake (mg/day) will be assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, which consisted of 36 food items contributing to the total calcium intake. The total calcium intake of each participant will be the sum of calcium intake from all food items in the food frequency questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutrition knowledge related to osteoporosis and calcium</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The nutrition knowledge related to osteoporosis and calcium will be collected using a questionnaire that participants can answer by pencil. The knowledge included 11 question items. Participants received 1 point if answering correctly and 0 point if answering incorrectly. Total knowledge score ranged from 0 (minimum) to 11 points (maximum).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Osteoporosis health beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Osteoporosis health beliefs will be collected using an osteoporosis health belief likert scale. The scale consisted of 6 subscales, including perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, health motivation, and self-efficacy. Each sub-scale of the health beliefs scale has 6 statements with 5 answering options, from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (coded as 1) to &quot;strongly agree&quot; (coded as 5). Possible scores for each sub scale ranged from 6-30, with higher score indicating higher perception.</description>

    <description>The nutrition education group receive the intervention first, which include 2 nutrition lessons about osteoporosis and calcium and calcium rich foods. The 2 lessons are delivered in one week for 2 hours each lesson. After this week, participants in the intervention group receive handouts about osteoporosis and calcium once a week for a period of 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>After the intervention group finish their intervention (5 weeks period), post data collection will be administered in both nutrition education and delayed nutrition education group. After this post data collection, the delayed nutrition education group receive the same intervention.</description>

    <description>The intervention is designed and developed based on the Intervention Mapping Process and the Health Belief Model. Topics of the intervention include: the importance of osteoporosis and risk factors, role of calcium in bone health and controlling the disease, calcium recommendations and sources, role of vitamin D and physical activity in calcium absorption and bone health, and how to identify calcium-rich foods in the locality and prepare meals with local calcium-rich foods. A recipe booklet containing recipes using local calcium-rich foods will be given to the participants after the end of the two nutrition lessons. Interactive activities are incorporated in each lesson to encourage the participation of participants.</description>
