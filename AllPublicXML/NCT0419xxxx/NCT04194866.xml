  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common postoperative complication in patients
      aged 65 and above. It refers to the cognitive function changes such as memory decline and
      attention loss after anesthesia and surgery. In serious cases, people may also experience
      personality changes and decline in social behavior ability, which will develop into
      irreversible cognitive impairment.Some studies reported that 25.8% of elderly patients
      presented POCD one week after non-cardiac surgery, and the incidence at 3 months after
      surgery was still 9.9%, which could increase the mortality in the first year after surgery.In
      recent years, studies have also proved that POCD is associated with patients' inability to
      perform their original jobs after non-cardiac surgery.Postoperative cognitive dysfunction
      seriously affects the clinical outcome, in addition to medical costs and other issues will
      bring an impact on the society and family.With the aging of the population, how to prevent
      cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients is a major challenge for perioperative
      management.There is a certain correlation between circadian rhythm and the dosage of general
      anesthesia, and postoperative sleep disturbance may be related to the effect of anesthesia
      and surgery on circadian rhythm.Preoperative sleep deprivation is known to be an independent
      risk factor for postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), but the circadian mechanisms
      involved after general anesthesia are not yet clear

MMSE(Mini-mental state examination) is a simple test assessing several categories, such as orientation to time and place, short term memory, recall, attention, calculation, language and visuo-spatial abilities. Scores ranging from 30 to 24 usually indicate normal cognitive function, while lower scores suggest the presence of cognitive impairment: mild from 23 to 19, moderate from 18 to 10 and severe from 9 to 0</description>
