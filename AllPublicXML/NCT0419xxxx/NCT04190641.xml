  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the new aScope 4 Cysto is used to see how well it visualizes the lower urinary
      tract, and if this new flexible cystoscope performs as well as other routinely used
      cystoscopes. This study will be done in patients who have been diagnosed with bladder lesions
      and who will undergo surgery via the urethra to remove these lesions. The surgery is done
      under general anesthesia. After being brought under anesthesia and before removal of the
      lesion(s), the new flexible cystoscope is tested. The cystoscope will be used to visualize
      the urethra and bladder. Data will be collected on the number of the lesions that can be seen
      using the new cystoscope. During the planned surgery a resectoscope or rigid cystoscope will
      be used to confirm the number of lesions. The data will be used to show how well the
      cystoscope visualizes the lesions in comparison with routinely used cystoscopes. It will give
      information on how well the structures of the urinary tract and bladder can be viewed
      including any abnormalities that are present.Data will also be collected on the handling of
      the cystoscope: how well the cystoscope moves into the lower urinary tract, and how well it
      can be navigated through the lower urinary tract.

      Clinical Phase: pre-CE study

      Design: A non-randomized confirmatory study on the visualization performance of the Ambu®
      aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia in 42 fully evaluable, adults subjects aimed at
      identification of known pathological findings (papillary bladder or small resectable lesion)
      detected with Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia and subsequently during a repeat
      procedure using a reusable rigid scope or resectoscope at the time of planned transurethral
      resection of bladder tumours (TURBT).

      Population: Adult subjects (≥ 18 years) in the OR undergoing planned transurethral resection
      of bladder tumors TURBT

      Planned sample size: A total of 42 patients will result in a maximum (if the true proportion
      is 50 %) width of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the binary variable &quot;Confirmed&quot;
      to be 15%. This width is considered to be useful in the interpretations of the results from
      this investigation.

      Study duration: Screening, procedure and follow-up will take 15 days maximum

      Follow-up duration: Follow-up immediately after procedure

      Investigational Device: Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia Pre-CE, single use
      cystoscope.

    <description>The performance level of Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia, compared to current standard practice with re-usable cystoscopes, is defined as proportion of patients with one or more papillary bladder lesion or small resectable lesion (diagnosed a maximum of one month prior to resection) detected with the Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia (prior to planned transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT)) and confirmed with the rigid cystoscope during TURBT.</description>
