  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this this randomized controlled study is to determine whether a pudendal
      nerve block at the time of vaginal surgery is associated with improved postoperative pain
      control and decrease opioid consumption compared to a sham pudendal nerve block in patients
      undergoing vaginal surgery.
