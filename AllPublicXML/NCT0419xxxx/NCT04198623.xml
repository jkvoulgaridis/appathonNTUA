  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of monoclonal antibodies (MA) either alone or as part of chemoimmunotherapy in
      oncology, benign and malignant hematology is expanding. Of the 17 therapeutic MAs approved in
      2017 by FDA, 50% of them are indicated for hematologic and oncologic condition. With
      increasing number of approved agents, therapeutic MAs have become one of the fastest growing
      areas in the management of benign and malignant hematologic condition. Advancement of
      recombinant technology allows development of partially or fully humanized new agents. Despite
      this, they still carry significant risk of immune and non-immune mediated adverse events.
      Most of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody related adverse events (MCAAE) The severity of
      reaction is variable, ranging from mild involvement of single organ to severe and
      life-threatening reactions requiring hospitalization or even resulting in death.

      Even for mild infusion reactions, where re-initiation of infusion is possible, there is
      resultant delay in delivery of infusions, distress to patients, and additional utilization of
      health care resources.

      Due to unpredictability of standard infusion reaction (SIR), efforts have been focused on
      premedication to decreasing the incidence and severity of infusion reaction. Most
      institutions have protocols using corticosteroid, acetaminophen and antihistamine as part of
      their premedication protocols. This has reduced but not eliminated standard infusion
      reactions. Most recently, mast cell stabilizers are being added to standard protocols to
      further reduce the incidence and severity of standard infusion reactions with variable
      anecdotal success without formal study. Of all the monoclonal antibodies, only Daratumumab
      has been evaluated using this strategy.

      This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of mast cell stabilizer Montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10
      mg in decreasing the SIR in patients receiving therapeutic MAs either alone or as part of
      chemoimmunotherapy in hematologic condition. The MAs being studied includes: Blinatumomab
      (BLINCYTO, Amgen Inc.), Daratumumab (DARZALEX, Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Elotuzumab (EMPLICIT,
      Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), Gemtuzumab (MYLOTARG, Pfizer Inc.), Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA,
      Genentech USA, Inc.), and Rituximab (RITUXAN, Genentech US); The investigators postulate that
      10 mg of Montelukast, when given in addition to standard premedication, will lead to decrease
      in incidence of MA associated SIR, shorter infusion time and decrease use of additional
      health care resources

      Study design:

      This is a Phase II single arm open label study evaluating 10 mg Montelukast given at least 2
      hours prior to infusion of monoclonal antibody in addition to standard premedication.
      Monoclonal antibodies being evaluated include those commonly used to treat hematologic and
      oncologic malignancies like (Blinatumomab, Daratumumab, Elotuzumab, Gemtuzumab, Obinutuzumab,
      and Rituximab).

      Arms/Intervention; Study subjects will be given 10 mg of Montelukast to be orally
      self-administered at least 2 hours prior to beginning of chemotherapy section Standard
      premedication will be administered according to institution protocol
