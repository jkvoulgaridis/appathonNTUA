  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 20th century brought a dynamic development of new technologies, including virtual reality
      (VR). VR is an artificial image generated by IT technologies. It is most often associated
      with entertainment, but has a much wider application in other fields. The aim of the study is
      to assess the influence of the application of immersive virtual reality during an exercise
      capacity test on a bicycle ergometer.

      Scientists suggests that there are four types of virtual reality: immersive virtual reality,
      desktop virtual reality (i.e., low-cost homebrew virtual reality), projection virtual
      reality, and simulation virtual reality. The sense of presence or immersion is a critical
      feature distinguishing virtual reality from other types of computer applications. It seems
      interesting whether immersion in virtual reality can influence the assessment of exercise
      capacity. The aim of the study is to assess the influence of the application of immersive
      virtual reality during an exercise capacity test on a bicycle ergometer. It is assumed that
      an exercise capacity test on a cycloergometer will be performed in a traditional form and in
      a virtual reality.

    <description>Based on Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing the oxygen uptake will be calculated in the metabolic equivalent (MET). MET is the resting oxygen uptake in a sitting position and equals 3.5 ml/kg/min. The oxygen uptake max will be also calculated be the following formula: oxygen consumption = (1.8 x kg.m.min-1) / bodymass + (7.0)</description>

    <description>Patients will be assessed by symptom-limited maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following a 25W, tree-minute stage, beginning at 25W (healthy volunteers will start the test with a load of 50W). For both sexes and arms, participants will be instructed during the test to remain at the frequency between 60 to 80 rotations per minute (rpm). Heart rate (HR) will be continuously recorded using a monitor Polar H10.</description>

VR HTC Vive Pro goggles along with VR health care (aerobic exercise) VR Cycling software will be used for stimulation throughout the duration of the test. The HTC Vive Tracker device will be also use to link images in virtual reality with the pedal speed.</description>
