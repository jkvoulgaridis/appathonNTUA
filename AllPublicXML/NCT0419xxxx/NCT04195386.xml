  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical cavities, which involve more than two surfaces being one of them vestibular or
      lingual/palatine, are a challenge for restorative dentistry, since the risk of failure of the
      restorations are related to the number of surfaces involved. Thus, the objective of this
      project is to conduct a randomized clinical trial in order to evaluate the efficacy and
      patient-centered outcomes of a chemically-activated alkasite composite resin in atypical
      lesions of deciduous molars. Deciduous molars of children between 4 and 7 years of age with
      at least one atypical cavity lesion in deciduous molars will be selected for the ECR. The
      selected teeth will be randomly divided into two groups: Chemically activated composite resin
      Alkasite and resin-Modified glass ionomer cement. Clinical and radiographic follow-up of the
      lesions will be performed for 6 and 12 months. The efficacy of the treatments will be
      evaluated by the longevity of the restoring procedures and the arrestment of the caries
      lesions. Patient-centered outcomes will also be evaluated.
