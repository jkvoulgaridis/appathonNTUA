    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) - a form of non-invasive brain stimulation - to improve language
      functioning in individuals who have the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia
      (PPA-L) - a slowly progressive impairment of language, characterized by difficulties with
      word-finding, sentence repetition and sentence comprehension.

    <textblock>
      This study is an open label pilot study that aims to recruit 10 individuals with diagnosed
      logopenic primary progressive aphasia (PPA-L) to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of
      using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to improve language functioning in
      this disorder. rTMS is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation that uses rapid magnetic
      pulses applied over the scalp to activate neurons in a specified target location of the
      brain.

      A variety of language tests will be administered to participants prior to rTMS treatment as
      well as following 30 sessions of daily rTMS. Additionally, language testing will be performed
      during the first session of rTMS treatment in order to assess the effect of simultaneous rTMS
      administration on language function. Performance on the pre- and post-treatment tests will be
      compared to determine the effect of rTMS treatment on language abilities.

      Treatment will consist of daily sessions of high frequency (10 Hz) rTMS applied over the left
      temporal gyrus. Patients will receive one session of rTMS per day for 30 consecutive
      weekdays. Each session will take approximately 45 minutes to complete.

      As a pilot study, this research will be used to evaluate the effect size and the feasibility
      of a more definitive project in the future. Both patient response and tolerability to rTMS
      will be analyzed.
