  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective:

      To compare the effects craniocervical and cervicothoracic extension training versus deep
      cervical flexor training, both combined with conventional treatment, on Health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL), disability, endurance, perceived pain, active range of motion of the
      cervical spine and intake of drugs in subjects with non-specific chronic neck pain,
      referenced by the control group.

      Methods:

      The research will be done from December 2019 to July 2020 at the Recoletas Burgos Hospital.

      Fifty-four volunteers with non-specific chronic neck pain, recruited at the hospital, will be
      randomly assigned, using sealed envelopes, to 1 of the three groups.

      The first two experimental groups will be named Group A and Group B and each of them will go
      to the Rehabilitation Service for 4 weeks to perform the exercises under the supervision of
      the physiotherapist. This process will occur along with the conventional treatment (infrared
      heat, massage and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). These groups will differ
      between them in the muscles they will mainly train through training. The group A will perform
      a neck extensor muscles training and group B a deep cervical flexor muscles training. After
      these 4 weeks, these exercises will be performed by them on a daily routine which will be
      prescribed for 5 months at home.

      On the control group (group C), no intervention will be performed due to the fact that they
      will be still on the waiting list.

      Pain, disability, endurance, active range of motion (AROM) of the cervical spine and drug
      intake will be measured in pre-treatment, at 4 weeks (post-treatment), at 3 months and 6
      months after the start of the study, while demographic variables (height, weight and age)
      will only be measured at the baseline and HRQoL only beginning and at the end of the study.

    <description>During the first month, the participants of the experimental groups will come at Rehabilitation Service to do the exercises individually and supervised by the physiotherapist and to received the conventional treatment (10 minutes of infrared heat, 10 minutes of massage and 15 minutes of TENS). The last five months, they will perform daily home exercises.
A-group: the degrees respect to the floor in wich each participant can hold the craniocervical extension and the cervicothoracic extension during 5 seconds will bo measured with the BDI.
B-group: Using an air-filled pressure sensor placed behind the neck, the physiotherapist will identify the target level that the patient can hold steadily a craniocervical flexion (CCF) for 5 seconds in a controlled manner. They will train following the protocol described by Jull et al.
Of each of this exercises, they will perform 10 isometric contractions, at the corresponding degrees or target level, of 10 seconds with a rest of 3-5 seconds.</description>
