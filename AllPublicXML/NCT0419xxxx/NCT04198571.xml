      MULTINATIONAL Retrospective Chart Review Study to Assess the Characteristics, Treatment
      Outcomes and Resource Use Among Adult Patients Hospitalized for Community-Acquired Pneumonia
      (CAP) or Complicated Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (cSSTI) Treated with Zinforo®

      The overall study aim is to provide real world evidence (RWE) on the characteristics,
      clinical management, treatment outcomes and healthcare resource use of adult patients aged 18
      years and older admitted to the hospital for CAP or cSSTI who received Zinforo® in a usual
      care setting in Europe and Latin America on or before 31-May-2019.
