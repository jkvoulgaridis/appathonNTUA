  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to devise instrumented insoles capable of accurately measuring
      gait at each footfall, over multiple hours in any environment. To achieve high accuracy, the
      investigators will develop a new learning-based calibration framework. Features will be
      tested in controlled lab settings 39 during a single visit in people with SMA (13), DMD (13)
      and healthy controls (13) and in 15 participants in real-life environments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are genetic disorders
      that often result in progressive weakness and impaired function. Results from this study will
      help characterize how gait is affected in SMA and DMD. This novel device can serve as a more
      affordable and versatile measurement instrument for neuromuscular disorders that affect gait
      and balance. All participants will be observed and measured while wearing the instrumented
      insoles in the lab and in real-life environments.

    <measure>Validation of Instrumented Insoles: Six Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To measure spatial parameters, kinetic parameters, temporal parameters, and metrics of cumulative activity in order to compare against the gold standard instrumented walkway participants will complete the Six Minute Walk Test. This test is an objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity, measures the maximum distance a person can walk in six minutes over a 25 meter course. This will be performed in a corridor and include the instrumented walkway.</description>

    <measure>Validation of Instrumented Insoles: 10 Meter Walk/Run</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To measure spatial parameters, kinetic parameters, temporal parameters, and metrics of cumulative activity in order to compare against the gold standard instrumented walkway, participants will walk, or run if able to, for 10 meters on the instrumented walkway.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Validation of Instrumented Insoles: Time Up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To measure spatial parameters, kinetic parameters, temporal parameters, and metrics of cumulative activity in order to compare against the gold standard instrumented walkway, participants will complete the TUG test. This test is designed to test mobility after a person stands up from a seated position. This will be completed on the instrumented walkway.</description>

    <measure>Validation of Instrumented Insoles: Circle Walking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To measure spatial parameters, kinetic parameters, temporal parameters, and metrics of cumulative activity in order to compare against the gold standard instrumented walkway participants will be asked to walk a series of half-circles on the instrumented walkway.</description>

    <measure>Free-living Testing of Instrumented Insoles</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>To determine spatial parameters, kinetic parameters, temporal parameters, and metrics of cumulative activity using instrumented insoles, 5 participants with SMA, 5 participants with DMD, and 5 healthy controls will be asked to wear the insoles along with a validated activity tracker. Participants will be asked to wear the insoles during a visit to the lab, and then for one week at home in a real-life environment. Participants will be asked to wear the insoles and activity tracker for at least 4 hours per day when at home.</description>
