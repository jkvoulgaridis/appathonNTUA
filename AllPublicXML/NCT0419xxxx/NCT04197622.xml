  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in
      the renal tubules, thus increasing the excretion of water.

      The use of hydrochlorothiazide in athletes is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Its
      fraudulent administration can lead to significant acute weight losses (body water reduction)
      and can mask the use of other doping substances, since it increases the urine volume and
      alters its pH (false negatives).

      The main degradation product of hydrochlorothiazide is
      4-amino-6-chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide (ACB). ACB is detectable in urine for a longer time
      and in a greater concentration than hydrochlorothiazide. This suggests that ACB may be an
      important marker for the detection of hydrochlorothiazide doping.

      Hypothesis:

      The oral administration of 12,5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide in healthy subjects allows
      generating detectable concentrations of the drug in urine. Positive urine samples will enable
      to identify analytical strategies for doping control.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: To measure the concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide in urine for
      anti-doping control samples.

      Secondary objectives: To identify hydrochlorothiazide metabolites in urine. To explore the
      time window in which the drug or its metabolites can be detected in urine after
      administration. To assess safety and tolerability of the drug used.

      Methods:

      Phase I, open, non-randomized clinical trial, with a treatment condition
      (hydrochlorothiazide) administered in a single oral dose to 3 subjects.

             a risk to the subject and do not interfere with the evaluation of the product in
             study. These variations and their non-relevance will be justified in writing
             specifically.

          -  Body mass index (weight/size^2) between 19 and 26 kg/m2, and weight between 50 and 90
             kg. Subjects with BMI &gt;26 kg/m2 may be included at the discretion of the Principal
             Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet the inclusion criteria.

          -  History of allergy, idiosyncrasy, hypersensitivity or adverse reactions to the active

          -  Having participated in another clinical trial with medication in the three months
             prior to the start of the study.

          -  Having donated blood during the month prior to the start of the study.

             start of the study.

          -  Background or clinical evidence of cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic,
             endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, dermatological or other
             acute or chronic diseases that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the
             collaborators designated by him, may pose a risk to the subjects, may interfere with
             the objectives of the study or may alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug.
