  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation is an emerging global health concern. Currently, there are over 1.6
      million amputees in the U.S. and around 6000 new amputations are recorded per annum in the
      UK. These numbers are expected to double by 2050 due to the increasing aging population and
      the adverse health issues such as diabetes, representing a significant, growing problem in
      western society. A lower limb amputation results in the loss of the biological joint
      structures such as the ankle and knee, along with the associated musculature. In order to
      overcome these physical losses, many lower limb amputees are provided with a prosthetic limb
      that enable them to participate in activities of daily living. The design and function of
      these prosthetic limbs varies widely, with some being very basic, non-articulating,
      semi-rigid structures while other more advanced components are computer controlled or
      incorporate robotic function. Lower limb amputees have been shown to fall more often when
      compared to age matched individuals without lower limb amputation. This has been reported to
      be partly a result of a less stable walking pattern. Given that the prosthetic limb provided
      and it's functional capability is a large component of how well a lower limb amputee is able
      to walk, it is important to understand what the effects of and potential benefits are from
      using more advanced prosthetic devices, such as micro-processor controlled knee joints and
      articulating ankle joints.

      Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of combining more
      advanced prosthetic ankle-foot and knee components on the biomechanics of activities of daily
      living in individuals with above knee amputation.

      Study Background Lower limb amputation is an emerging global health concern. Currently, there
      are over 1.6 million amputees in the U.S. and around 6000 new amputations are recorded per
      annum in the UK. These numbers are expected to double by 2050 due to the increasing aging
      population and the adverse health issues such as diabetes, representing a significant,
      growing problem in western society. A lower limb amputation results in the loss of the
      biological joint structures such as the ankle and knee, along with the associated
      musculature. In order to overcome these physical losses, many lower limb amputees are
      provided with a prosthetic limb that enable them to participate in activities of daily
      living. The design and function of these prosthetic limbs varies widely, with some being very
      basic non-articulating semi-rigid structures while other more advanced components are
      computer controlled and function robotically. Advanced ankle components have been shown to
      provide lower limb amputees with a number of benefits including increased walking speed,
      improved symmetry between legs and increased forward progression. In addition,
      micro-processor controlled knee components, recently made available through the NHS via NHS
      England Clinical commissioning, have shown a number of benefits. These benefits are stated as
      being 'â€¦enhanced stability and stumble recovery, which improves fall management and reduces
      the incidence of falls. This supports the increases in self-reported improved individual
      mobility and independence. MPKs also improve controlled sitting and standing, walking gait
      symmetry, stair decent, controlled step over step descent down a slope, reduced energy
      expenditure, and given different modes for different activities an ability to manage
      obstacles more easily'. Given that the prosthetic limb provided and their functional
      capability is a large component of how well a lower limb amputee is able to walk, it is
      important to understand what the effects of and potential benefits are from using more
      advanced prosthetic devices, such as micro-processor controlled knee joints. Also, as these
      components are used in conjunction with ankle-foot devices, it is important to know what the
      optimal combination may be to gain the most benefits from both prosthetic components.

      Study Aim The aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of combining more
      advanced prosthetic ankle-foot and knee components on the biomechanics of activities of daily
      living in individuals with above knee amputation.

        The study aims to recruit two groups of participants, one group of individuals with
        unilateral transfemoral amputation (TFA) and a group of otherwise healthy control
        participants (CRTL). Both groups are required to satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria
        and provide written informed consent in order to participate.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Transfemoral amputation: Individuals who have had unilateral transfemoral amputation.

          2. Demographics: Adult, community-dwelling individuals above the age of 18 in order to
             provide written informed consent for themselves.

          3. Mental Capacity: Ability to comprehend and understand communication and instruction in
             English in order to consent and safely participate in study as assessed verbally.

          4. Mobility level: Prospective participants must be able to negotiate obstacles such as
             ramps and stairs thus displaying a level of mobility commensurate with a medicare K3
             functional classification level.

          5. Endurance Capacity: Able to walk continuously for periods of up to two minutes at a
             time in order to complete the clinical walking tests.

          6. Vision: Good (corrected) vision to safely walk in well-lit areas.

          7. Cardiovascular Health: No self-reported unresolved cardiovascular complaints to avoid
             any cardiovascular complications when performing activities of daily living.

          8. Able to travel: Data collection will take place at Nottingham Trent University,
             Clifton Campus.

        For the otherwise healthy control (CTRL) group, the same criteria apply, with the exception
        of those pertaining specifically to amputation status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pain: Experience undue musculo-skeletal pain during walking that causes individual to
             stop and not be able to continue when walking at a self-selected speed.

          2. Disease/Illness: Unable and/or unsafe to carry out tasks due to disease/illness such
             as rheumatoid arthritis.

          3. Injury: Current neuromuscular, musculoskeletal injury.

          4. Falls: Falls regularly (&gt;1 a month) as determined using the PROFANE fall definition.
             Excludes recreational, sporting or occupational falls outside of this definition.

          5. Residuum health: Presence of significant blisters, wounds and rash which prevent
             prosthesis, sock and liner to be worn comfortably.

          6. Residuum stability: Observing substantial changes to the physical condition of the
             lower limb that requires medical attention as judged by the participant, and if after
             consenting and participating in the study, individuals are referred to mobility
             services due to a degradation of the physical condition of either lower limb.

          7. Unable to follow instruction or cognitive deficits: Risk of further injury whilst
             completing tasks incorrectly.

          8. Not able to understand written and verbal English: All communication will be in
             English as the University does not provide translation services.

          9. For the otherwise healthy control (CTRL) group, the same criteria apply, with the
             exception of those pertaining specifically to amputation status.
