      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of using
      intra-procedural intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) for WATCHMAN FLX Device implants in
      subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of stroke.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is of legal age to participate in the study per the laws of their
             respective geography;

          2. The subject has documented paroxysmal, persistent, permanent or long-term/longstanding
             persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation (i.e., the subject does not have mitral
             stenosis or a mechanical heart valve);the subject has not been diagnosed with
             rheumatic mitral valvular heart disease);

          3. The subject is deemed by the treating physician to be suitable for the protocol
             defined pharmacologic regimens;

          4. The subject has a calculated CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater;

          5. The subject is able to undergo ICE examinations;The subject is able to undergo
             ICE(which will be used during the index procedure) and TEE (which will be performed at
             45 days and may also be performed at baseline);

          6. The subject is able to understand and willing to provide written informed consent to
             participate in the trial;

          7. The subject is able and willing to return for required follow-up visits and
             examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly interfere with the current study, except when the subject is
             participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry
             with no associated treatments. Each instance must be brought to the attention of the
             sponsor to determine eligibility, regardless of type of co-enrollment being proposed;

          2. The subject requires long-term anticoagulation therapy for reasons other than
             AF-related stroke risk reduction, for example due to an underlying hypercoaguable
             state (i.e., even if the device is implanted, the subjects would not be eligible to
             discontinue OAC due to other medical conditions requiring chronic warfarin therapy);

          3. The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an ASD/PFO device;

          4. The subject has an implanted mechanical valve prosthesis in any position;

          5. The subject currently or has had any documented history of, New York Heart Association
             Class IV Congestive Heart Failure;

          6. The subject is of childbearing potential and is or plans to become pregnant during the
             time of the study (method of assessment upon study physician's discretion).
