  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of the study drug, GDC-0084, in combination with radiation
      therapy in people who have solid tumor brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. All
      participants will have cancer with a PIK3CA mutation. The researchers will test increasing
      doses of GDC-0084 to find the highest dose that causes few or mild side effects in
      participants. The study will also try to find out if the combination of the study drug with
      radiation is effective against participants' cancer.

    <description>Four dose levels will be examined and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified.
The standard 3+3 dose-escalation scheme for this study is as follows. Patients will be accrued to the study in cohorts of 3. For any given dose an initial cohort of 3 patients will be treated at that dose.The dose level will be escalated if none of the 3 exhibits any dose limiting toxicity (DLT).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancies harboring PIK3CA mutations which
             include mutations in any of the following genes: PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, PIK3CG,

          -  Brain metastases and/or leptomeningeal metastases involving the brain demonstrated by
             MR imaging of the brain. For patients with brain metastases, measurable lesion by
             RANO-BM is required28. Patients with spine leptomeningeal metastases are eligible for
             the study if they have leptomeningeal metastases of the brain demonstrated by MRI
             imaging of the brain.
