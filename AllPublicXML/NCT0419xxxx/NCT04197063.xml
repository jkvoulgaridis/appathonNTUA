  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This present study is an evaluation of de-identified data collected previously during a
      randomized controlled study (RCT). The objective of the original RCT titled &quot;Sugar-Sweetened
      Beverage (SSB) Portion Limit Dining Lab RCT&quot; was to examine the impact of limiting the
      portion size of SSB to 16 oz in a laboratory dining setting. The RCT was designed to assess
      the impact of limiting the size of SSB offered on a restaurant menu and the availability of
      free fills on beverage and food purchases, consumption and caloric intake at the test meal
      and subsequent meals (over a 24-hour period).

      Briefly, the data for this evaluation were collected from adults recruited from the Boston /
      Cambridge area to participate in an RCT conducted at an eating behavior lab at the Landmark
      Center (Lab). Participants were masked to the purpose of the study and were randomized to one
      of four conditions. To conceal the purpose of the study, participants were asked to
      participate in a pseudo-focus group pretending to conduct consumer research on restaurant
      preferences. Participants were asked not to eat after 3 pm prior to the 5:30 pm focus group.
      Participants were seated at individual dining tables and were asked to order and purchase
      dinner from a restaurant menu and consumed the meal while in the restaurant Lab. After the
      focus group, participants completed electronic questionnaires (e.g., demographic information,
      eating behaviors, and perceptions of the meal). Participants returned to the Lab the
      following day to complete a brief dietary recall interview. After they completed the study
      procedures, they were debriefed about the purpose of the study and provided the opportunity
      to withdraw from the study.

      The current evaluation will be conducted under an IRB-approved, apriori, statistical analysis
      plan using the data collected during the Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Portion limit Dining
      Lab RCT.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total calories food and beverages ordered from the study restaurant menu at the test dinner meal</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after Day 1 test dinner meal</time_frame>
    <description>Total calories ordered will be computed by summing the calories of each menu item selected for the test dinner meal.
The calorie content for all food and drinks will be based on the nutritional information, posted on the restaurant's website for each menu item.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total calories from food and drink consumed during the test the dinner meal</measure>
    <time_frame>24-hours post-Day 1 test dinner meal</time_frame>
    <description>Calories consumed will be measured by weighing all food items before and after the test dinner meal using a digital scale accurate up to +0.1 grams. The weight of each plate/cup collected after the meal will be subtracted from the weight of each plate/cup prior to being served. The weight of the food in conjunction with the caloric density of each item will be combined to calculate the total caloric intake for each participant at the test dinner meal.</description>
