  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparison of second generation supraglottic airway devices about anesthesiologist,
      endoscopist and patient, which used for gastrointestinal procedures. The investigators
      believe that the endoscope will be easier to reach by the part of GLT extending to the
      esophagus, but the structural stiffness of this part may damage the esophageal mucosa. On the
      other hand, since the endoscopic canal of the LMA® Gastro ends at the upper end of the
      esophagus, it may be more difficult to orient the endoscope to the esophagus, but it may be
      superior in terms of ventilation efficiency. Therefore these two device worth for comparing.

      Supraglottic airway (SGA) devices are produced for avoiding endotracheal intubation for
      anesthesic interventions. Second generation SGA's like GLT and LMA® Gastro airway are using
      for endoscopic biliopancreatic procedures. Both of them have an airway canal and endoscopic
      canal. Although they can use for same reason, their designs are different. So, their airway
      securities, endoscopic manipulations and complications, would be different.

      This study planned as single blind. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical
      status 1-2 100 patients which will be take endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ERCP) included. The study starts after randomization and ends after discharge from the
      recovery room. All patients will be monitorised for hemodynamic parameters. Depth of
      anesthesia will be provided by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. After anesthesia induction
      SGA will placed by an experienced anesthesiologist. Bilateral chest movements and
      auscultation, capnogram graphy and oropharyngeal leak pressure test will be used for
      confirmation of placement. After procedure endoscopist will take pictures of esophagus and
      hypopharynx. After extubation and sufficient consciousness and breathing of patient, patients
      will be transferred to post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU). Vital parameters will continue to
      monitoring in PACU. Patients will be discharge as usual with an Aldrete score ≥ 9.

      Data will be collected during the procedure and in recovery room. Data will be stored in
      electronic database without mention to patient's name.
