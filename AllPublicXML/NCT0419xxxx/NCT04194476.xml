  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the validity of Nova StatStrip® blood glucose monitoring test
      system including the Nova StatStrip® glucose hospital meter and test strips in measuring
      Chinese neonatal capillary blood glucose levels by evaluating how the results compare to
      those obtained from laboratory hexokinase method. The study results will be the basis for the
      regulatory submission and registration of the Nova StatStrip® glucose hospital meter and test
      strips in testing the neonatal capillary whole blood specimens to the China Food and Drug
      Administration (CFDA).

      Good clinical practice indicates that the performance of a point-of-care glucose monitoring
      test system be validated before clinical use. It is therefore important to perform a method
      comparison study to determine how the results obtained from a type of glucose monitoring test
      system compare to those from a laboratory hexokinase method.

    <description>We'll use a drop of heel-stick blood to test blood glucose on the glucose meter. About 200-300 ul of blood from the same stick site will be collected, centrifuged to get plasma for testing of glucose level in a laboratory biochemistry analyzer.</description>
