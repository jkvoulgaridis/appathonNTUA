    <textblock>
      This research study will explore the safety and efficacy of the drug, pirfenidone, in
      patients with a diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) who have an associated
      interstitial lung disease (ILD) over a planned period of 56 weeks.

    <textblock>
      An open-label clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of administering
      pirfeniodne for 52 weeks to subjects with HPS-ILD. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria
      without contraindications for the study will be provided pirfenidone 2403 mg/day. Efficacy
      will be evaluated through interval testing of pulmonary function tests, patient reported
      outcomes, adverse events and survival. Safety will be assessed by determining adverse events,
      hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality.

             requiring drug therapy

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might be significantly
             exacerbated by the known side effects associated with the administration of
             pirfenidone

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use two adequate methods of contraception, including at
             least one method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year, during the 52 weeks of
             treatment.

               1. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (â¥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).

               2. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year include
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established and proper use of
                  hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine
                  devices, and copper intrauterine devices.

               3. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

          -  For men who are not surgically sterile: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from
             donating sperm, as defined below:

               1. With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a
                  failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 118
                  days after the last dose of pirfenidone.

               2. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.

          -  Investigational therapy, defined as any drug that has not been approved for marketing
             for any indication in the country of the participating site including pirfenidone, at
             the time of Screening

          -  History of alcohol or substance abuse in the past 2 years, at the time of Screening

          -  Family or personal history of long QT syndrome

          -  Any of the following liver function test criteria above specified limits:

               1. Total bilirubin above the upper limit of normal (ULN), excluding patients with
                  Gilbert's syndrome; aspartate or alanine aminotransferase (AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT)
                  &gt;3 Ã ULN; alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 Ã ULN

               2. Creatinine clearance (CrCl &lt;30) mL/min, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault
                  formula

               3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with a QTcB interval &gt;500 msec at Screening

          -  Prior use of pirfenidone or known hypersensitivity to any of the components of study
             treatment

          -  Use of any of the following therapies within 28 days before Screening:

               1. Investigational therapy, defined as any drug that has not been approved for
                  marketing for any indication in the country of the participating site

               2. Fluvoxamine

               3. Sildenafil (daily use). Note: intermittent use for erectile dysfunction is
                  allowed
