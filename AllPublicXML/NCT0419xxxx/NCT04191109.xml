  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study aiming to describe an intensive rehabilitation program for
      stroke patients in an inpatient rehabilitation facility, measuring the time and reporting
      activities performed during the therapy sessions (physiotherapy, occupational and speech
      language therapy). Indeed, functional and cognitive outcomes will be reported, and data about
      feasibility and safety of the rehabilitation program will also be recorded.

      This is an observational descriptive study that will be performed in an inpatient intensive
      rehabilitation unit. Stroke patients admitted in our neuro-rehabilitation unit who follow the
      inclusion criteria, will be invited to participate. The main objective of the study is to
      register the time spent in different activities during therapy session performed in the
      intensive rehabilitation program. At the end of each session a sum of the minutes spent in
      each activity will be performed and at the end of the rehabilitation program the average of
      time spent in each therapy will be calculated. Indeed, throughout these data the total amount
      of time spent on rehabilitation (hours and minutes) will be obtained. Secondary objectives
      are to report changes on functional, cognitive and health status outcomes during different
      time-frames. This outcomes will be assessed at baseline (admission on neuro-rehabilitation
      unit), at discharge of rehabilitation unit (average of 30 days after stroke), at 3 months and
      6 months after stroke. Safety and Feasibility of the program will also de recorded.
      Feasibility will be assessed by adherence to the prescribed program, including the register
      of the following parameters: attendance rate (number of planned sessions attended), training
      session modification (dose reduction or early termination of the individual session) and
      reasons for training interruption (2 or more days without training session) as fatigue,
      dizziness, fever… Safety will be assessed registering any adverse event related to rehab (ie.
      episodes of falls,..)

    <measure>Body Structure and Function: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment-upper limb (FMA-UL) will assess arm impairment. (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975).</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission on rehabilitation unit - Average 30 days after stroke (discharge of rehabilitation unit) - 3 months and 6 months after stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the measurement of arm impairment. Performance is rated on a three point ordinal scale from 0 to 2, with a maximum score of 66, a higher score indicates minimal or no impairment.</description>

    <measure>Body Structure and Function: Western Aphasia Bedside (WAB) is used to assess the language function of adults with stroke. (Risser, AH et al, 1985)</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission on rehabilitation unit - Average 30 days after stroke (discharge of rehabilitation unit) - 3 months and 6 months after stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Changes on WAB will be used to measure language skills.

    <time_frame>Admission on rehabilitation unit - Average 30 days after stroke (discharge of rehabilitation unit) - 3 months and 6 months after stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Changes on MOCA will be used to detect the cognitive impairments. MOCA is a brief cognitive screening with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting middle cognitive impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Structure and Function: Anxiety and Depression that will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety Depression scale (HADS) (Aben I et al., 2002).</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission on rehabilitation unit - Average 30 days after stroke (discharge of rehabilitation unit) - 3 months and 6 months after stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Changes on psychological distress in stroke patients. HADS consists in in 14 items, which can be divided into two subscales of seven items each: the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and the depression subscale (HADS-D). The respondent rates each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (absence) - 3 (extreme presence). The total score is out of 42 (21 per subscale).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Structure and Function: Apathy will be assessed throughout the Apathy Evaluation Scale. (Marin RS et al. 1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission on rehabilitation unit - Average 30 days after stroke (discharge of rehabilitation unit) - 3 months and 6 months after stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Changes on apathy in stroke patients. Thuis is a tool that quantifies and characterise apathy in adult patients. The AES, which uses 18 specific items to quantify apathy within a scoring range of 18 to 72.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Structure and Function: Limb strength will assessed using the Motricity Index Motricity Index (MI) (Collin C et al.1990).</measure>
