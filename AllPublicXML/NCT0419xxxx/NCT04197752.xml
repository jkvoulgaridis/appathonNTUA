  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a health problem throughout the world and has increasingly become a widespread
      epidemic all over the world and also in Turkey. Anesthesia management of obese patients is
      challenging because of difficult airway, increased drug doses, co-morbidities, loss of
      anatomical landmarks and difficulties in positioning.

      Neuroaxial and peripheral nerve blocks are widely used in anesthesia practice in both obese
      and non-obese patients undergoing different surgical operations.

      In this prospective observational study, the investigators plan to enroll all patients that
      are applied neuroaxial or peripheral blocks during the study period. The aim of this study is
      to compare the differences and difficulties of regional anesthesia/analgesia techniques in
      obese and non-obese patients.

      Obesity is a health problem throughout the world and has increasingly become a widespread
      epidemic all over the world and also in Turkey. Anesthesia management of obese patients is
      challenging because of difficult airway, increased drug doses, co-morbidities, loss of
      anatomical landmarks and difficulties in positioning.

      On the other hand, neuroaxial and peripheral nerve blocks are widely used in anesthesia
      practice in both obese and non-obese patients undergoing different surgical operations.

      In this prospective observational study, the investigators plan to enroll all patients that
      are applied neuroaxial or peripheral blocks during the study period. The difficulty of block
      performance, its relationship with experience, the requirement of changing hands with more
      experienced clinician, the requirement of changing patient position, regional anesthesia
      approach or needle (size and length), the requirement of adding rescue block, block success,
      performance duration, the number of needle direction (multiple attempts), the requirement of
      changing anesthesia or analgesia technique (conversion to general anesthesia), the
      requirement of adding another block monitorisation technique, adverse effect/complication,
      patient satisfaction and patient's request for a similar technique next time are all recorded
      both in obese and non-obese patients.
