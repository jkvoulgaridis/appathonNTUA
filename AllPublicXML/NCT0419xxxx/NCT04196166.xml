  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;routine&quot; pre-operative tests in healthy orthopaedic patients undergoing intermediate/
      major surgery are not justified. In this study of 670 healthy orthopedic patients with 7610
      preoperative tests, investigators found that surgical plan was influenced in &lt;1% of patients.
      Surgeons should be sensitized to reconsider this practice particularly with limited
      resources.

      Background: Routine preoperative tests in healthy patients not only cause extra anxiety, but
      may delay treatment without influencing surgical plan. This has worse impact in
      resource-constrained settings where fee for service rather than health insurance is the usual
      norm. Investigators aim to determine if &quot;routine&quot; pre-operative tests are justified in
      healthy orthopedic patients.

      Methods: Investigators conducted a non-commercialized, non-funded matched case control study
      in tertiary care university hospital and a level-1 trauma centre for healthy patients
      (ASA-1&amp;2) admitted from January 2014-December 2016 for elective orthopedic intermediate and
      major procedures. Cases (patient who had a change in his/her surgical plan after admission)
      and controls were selected independently of the exposure of interest then matched randomly to
      cases on age, gender and procedure type. Primary exposure was the routine preoperative lab
      tests, as defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologist, which included 13 blood tests.
      Analysis was done using Principle Component Analysis and Conditional logistic regression at
      univariate and multivariable levels reporting matched adjusted Odds Ratios. The data will
      bereported in line with STROBE criteria.
