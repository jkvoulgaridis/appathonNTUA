      This is a multicentre, comparator-group, open-label, controlled, nonrandomised clinical study
      to compare the SPECT findings after a single IV administration of DaTSCAN™ ioflupane (123I)
      injection for patients with a clinical diagnosis of PS (SDD; specifically, patients with PD
      [SDD], MSA [SDD] or PSP [SDD]) as compared with patients with a clinical diagnosis of ET (no
      SDD) and age-matched healthy controls.

    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>A semi-quantitative analysis of the striatal uptake ratios in specific regions of interest (ROIs; i.e., left and right striatum, caudate, and putamen) of DaTSCAN™ SPECT images will be performed with DaTQUANT™.</description>
