  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effect of acupuncture, with usual care (lifestyle management)
      for weight control, with BMI (Body Mass index) as main outcome along with improvement of
      reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in overweight and obese women with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6 to 18% of all women and is the most common female
      endocrine and metabolic disorder during the reproductive years. PCOS is characterized by
      anovulation, hyperandrogenism and metabolic dysfunction.Obesity is ~40% higher in women with
      PCOS than in healthy women. Overweight results in irregular cycles, insulin resistance and
      infertility. Acupuncture is assumed to reduce weight The overall hypothesis is that if the
      Body mass index (BMI) decreased, ovulation can be induced, hyperandrogenism decreased, and
      insulin sensitivity improved in these women. Although several treatment strategies have shown
      efficacy, importantly, there is a need for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) to
      strengthen the evidence base for clinical and policy decision-making. Therefore, the
      investigators aim to compare the effect of acupuncture, with usual care (lifestyle
      management) for weight loss, and improvement and prevention of reproductive and metabolic
      dysfunction in overweight and obese women with PCOS.

    <description>In the control acupuncture protocol, 2 needles were inserted superficially to a depth of less than 5 mm, 1 in each shoulder and 1 in each upper arm at nonacupuncture and non-meridian points, and then, 4 needles were attached to electrodes and the stimulator was turned on to mimic the active acupuncture but with zero intensity, no electrical stimulation. They also received the treatment for 30 minutes three times a week and a maximum of 48 treatments.</description>

All participants will get a step-counter for daily use and physical exercise diary for daily reporting of exercise: number of steps, type of activity, intensity and time (minutes). Once a week each participant receive a SMS in which they report the activity during the week.</description>
