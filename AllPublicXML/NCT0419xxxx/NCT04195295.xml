    <textblock>
      The prospective study is a interventional study to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of
      periosteal pedicle as grafting technique and egg shell derived nano hydroxyapatite as
      regenerative graft material for regeneration of intrabony defects.

      30 Patients visiting the outpatient Department of Periodontology Krishnadevaraya College of
      Dental Sciences and Hospital, Bangalore will be enrolled for 6 month folllow up study based
      on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients age ranged from 25 to 55 years. Patients
      with chronic periodontitis, with presence of intrabony defects with ≥6mm probing depth (PD),
      2 or 3 wall defects are included in the study.

      The patients are allocated to three goups through computer generated randomisation as:

      Group A (n=10) - Egg shell derived nano hydroxyapatite (EnHA) graft and periosteal pedicle as
      barrier membrane.

      Group B (n=10) - Only EnHA as graft. Group C (n=10) - An open flap debridement procedure
      only.

    <description>In group A, the full thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated, which will be extended apically to expose sufficient amount of periosteum.
Periosteal membrane will be separated from the full thickness mucoperiosteal flap and released by one vertical incision mesially and one horizontal incision apically.
Posteriorly, the periosteum remained attached with the mucoperiosteal flap, so that blood supply could be maintained in the reflected periosteum.
Then the graft material will be packed into the defect.
Then periosteal membrane will be turned over the intrabony defect in such a way that the defect was completely covered by the periosteal membrane</description>

    <description>full thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be raised, entire granulation tissue will be removed from the defects, the pocket epithelium was curetted from the inner surface of the flap, and the roots were thoroughly scaled and planed by means of manual and ultrasonic instruments. Then the operative area will be irrigated with sterile saline. After that, the mucoperiosteal flaps will be sutured.</description>
