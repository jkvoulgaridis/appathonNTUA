  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes an evaluation of the CyberRwanda program, a digital health tool
      designed with and for adolescents in Rwanda, with a focus on successful futures, broadly, and
      family planning and reproductive health, more specifically. CyberRwanda is a tablet-based
      system that provides information on family planning and reproductive health through a set of
      vignettes. The program also allows users to order and purchase contraceptives, with pick up
      at nearby participating pharmacies. The program will be implemented in schools in six
      districts in Rwanda. The investigators will conduct a 3-arm, cluster, randomized controlled
      trial to evaluate the impact of CyberRwanda on three primary outcomes: uptake of a
      contraceptive method, initiation of childbearing, and HIV testing. The investigators will
      compare two implementation models (facilitated and self-service) to a control arm at the
      school (cluster) level. The study will enroll 60 schools (20 per arm) and 100 students per
      school, and follow students for 24 months.

    <description>Schools that are randomized to this arm will be exposed to all of the components in the self-service version in addition to the following:
-Peer facilitation of the CyberRwanda platform at the school-based cyber clubs that will house an online tablet with the educational components of CyberRwanda with a facilitator.</description>

    <description>Schools that are randomized to this arm will be exposed to the following components of the intervention:
Availability of the fully functional online CyberRwanda web portal through school-based cyber clubs;
SMS-based ordering of contraceptives and SMS-based FAQs Online (through web portal on computer or smartphone) ordering of contraceptives;
Facility finder: A list of the closest health centers and pharmacies where youth can get contraceptives and other FPRH services;
Promotion of the CyberRwanda program through school launch events; and
Access to Youth Centers (1 per district) that will house tablets with the fully functional online CyberRwanda web portal</description>

    <intervention_name>CyberRwanda</intervention_name>
    <description>The CyberRwanda intervention consists of three primary components: 1. Guide to Teen Success: The CyberRwanda curriculum empowers youth to learn about FPRH and employment skills and to set goals for their futures through age-appropriate, interactive, digital and printed stories and activities. 2. Ask Mutoni / Ask Ntwali: The Q&amp;A platform answers questions and provides referrals to local youth-friendly services through 'Mutoni' and 'Ntwali,' virtual peer educators who provide evidence-based, teen-friendly information and signposting to clinics. 3. Youth can directly purchase health products, including menstrual hygiene and contraceptive products (emergency contraception, condoms, and oral contraceptive pills) online and via SMS. The online and SMS clinic finder tool links youth clients to clinics for longer-acting methods. All participating pharmacies will be trained using the custom digital training game that supports them to give unbiased, nonjudgmental information and services.</description>
