      Rationale: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequently reported postoperative
      complication, occurring in up to one-third of patients. Its development causes a substantial
      increase in the clinical and economic burden of pancreatic surgery. Nowadays, the primary
      goal of a surgical department is the reduction of the SSI rate, based on a cautious approach
      to the prescription of the antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) to avoid the spread of multi-drug
      resistant (MDR) bacteria. An antimicrobial stewardship program and a patient-tailored
      antibiotic prophylaxis could be an optimal strategy to reduce the impact of infectious
      complications after pancreatic surgery. However, few data are available regarding this topic.

      Objective: To evaluate the useful of an antimicrobial stewardship program and a
      patient-tailored antibiotic prophylaxis in the reduction of the occurrence of SSI and the
      inappropriate use of key antibiotics in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.

      Study design: A time series study will be conducted. The antimicrobial stewardship program is
      shared between three national high-volume centers of pancreatic surgery. Statistical
      significance and effect size were calculated by segmented regression analysis of interrupted
      time series of drug use, SSI rate, and costs for 3 years before and after the introduction of
      the program.

      Study population: Patients with an indication for elective pancreatic surgery.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is the reduction of SSI rate. Secondary
      outcomes are the reduction of the use of the key antibiotics (such as piperacillin/tazobactam
      and carbapenems), the microbial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae, and the reduction of the treatment costs

      A multicenter time series with segmented regression analysis will be conducted at three
      national high-volume centers of pancreatic surgery: The General and Pancreatic Surgery
      Department, Pancreas Institute, of Verona, the Oncological and Robotic General Surgery,
      Careggi University of Florence, and the Department of Surgery, University Campus Bio-Medico
      of Rome. All patients visited at the General and Pancreatic Surgery Department, Pancreas
      Institute, of Verona, the Oncological and Robotic General Surgery, Careggi Hospital,
      University of Florence, and the Department of Surgery, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome
      and scheduled for pancreatic resection will be enrolled. The patients will be submitted to
      the routinely diagnostic preoperative procedures, including the RS culture, two weeks before
      surgery. All patients enrolled will receive a preoperative clinical visit two weeks before
      surgery. During the patient's interview, the surgeon will collect the medical history,
      exposing the clinical and surgical perioperative pathways. The patient is also submitted to
      the routinely preoperative lab tests, including the RS. The study design is based on evidence
      collected by previous studies of the group and after a systematic review of the literature.
      The ASP has been shown to effectively reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and optimize the
      treatment of infectious diseases. To be successful, multiple aspects should be considered in
      the ASP. Initially, the infection control specialists will follow the routine activity of
      each department in order to define what could immediately be improved. Internal antibiotic
      prophylaxis and therapy guidelines will be defined and shared between groups. The RS,
      collected at the preoperative testing, is evaluated by the infection control specialist. In
      case of identification of MDR bacteria, each patient will receive a tailored AP based on the
      antibiograms of the RS. In any case, the infection control specialist will choose the best
      solution for the patient avoiding the key antibiotics.
