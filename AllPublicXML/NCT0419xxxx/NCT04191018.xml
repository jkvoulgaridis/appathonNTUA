  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C remains a public health issue because up to 70 million people are
      chronically infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide. Presence of advanced
      fibrosis/cirrhosis might be associated with liver-related complications, such as
      hepatocellular carcinoma and oesophageal varices bleeding. Oesophageal varices (OV) might be
      present in up to 40% of patients with liver cirrhosis have and the mortality rates from
      bleeding might be up to 20% per episode. Early diagnosis of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis
      associated with hepatitis C treatment are key features for preventive and therapeutic
      measures to reduce liver-related mortality in HCV-infected patients.

      Liver elastography is a high accurate non-invasive test for diagnosis of advanced
      fibrosis/cirrhosis. Few different methods of liver elastography are currently available:
      transient elastography by Fibroscan and ultrasound elastography by point-shear wave (p-SWE)
      and 2D-shear wave (2D-SWE). Gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) has been considered the gold
      standard for screening or surveillance of esophageal varices. More recently, international
      guidelines have been recommending the use of non-invasive methods to indicate or avoid OV
      screening: Baveno VI guidelines proposed that compensated cirrhotic patients with a liver
      stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography &lt;20kPa and a platelet count &gt;150,000/μL
      can avoid screening endoscopy. The use of direct-acting agents (DAAs) has revolutionized the
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C with high effectiveness shown using all-oral interferon-free
      regimens. HCV cure, sustained virological response (SVR), has been associated with lower
      rates of liver-related complications, increase in quality of life and decrease in
      waiting-list registrations for liver transplantation in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
      Preliminary studies have been reporting significant regression liver stiffness after SVR.
      However, it is unclear whether SVR might decrease portal hypertension leading to OV
      regression and a reduced risk of variceal bleeding. In addition, the use of non-invasive
      methods to avoid OV screening must be validated in HCV patients after SVR. The aims of this
      cross-sectional study with prospective inclusion of patients will be: (i) to evaluate the
      impact of SVR in portal hypertension in HCV patients with advanced fibrosis/liver cirrhosis
      treated by interferon-free regimens and (ii) to validate non-invasive methods to avoid OV
      screening by GIE
