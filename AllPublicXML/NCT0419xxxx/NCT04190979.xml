      Pre-market, single-arm, prospective, open-label, multi-center clinical trial aimed at
      assessing the safety and the performance of the Medyria TrackCath system in patients above
      the age of 18 years who have been diagnosed with aneurysms in the thoracoabdominal (TAAA) or
      abdominal (AAA) aorta and require endovascular intervention.

      The TrackCath System is a non-implantable disposable device, intended to measure real-time
      changes in the Blood Flow Velocity and to provide a pathway for delivering third-party
      guidewires and/or catheters.

      Following patient consent, data is collected until discharge.

      To reach 80% power, a total number of 32 patients (minimum 42 target orifices) is scheduled,
      including a minimum of 8 roll-in patients for the training phase, which comprises at least
      two successful cases per center.

    <description>The TrackCath System is a non-implantable device and consists of the TrackCath Catheter and the TrackCath Equipment. It is designed to support the successful positioning of third-party guidewires and catheters in the arterial vasculature to detect and cannulate side branches during endovascular aneurysm repair procedures through the measurement of real-time blood flow velocity changes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has signed and understood the approved Informed Consent form and is able to
             meet the proposed study proceedings (CIP).

          -  Patient is ≥18 years of age

          -  Need for standard or complex EVAR of AAA according to the relevant guidelines:
