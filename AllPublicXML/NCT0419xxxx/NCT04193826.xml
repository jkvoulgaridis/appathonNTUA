  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single center, open-label, single arm, study to evaluate the safety and
      technical performance of the CLAAS system for closure of the left atrial appendage.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate feasibility of ICE as primary imaging
      modality for device success in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation at increased
      risk for stroke and systemic embolism who are recommended for oral anticoagulation (OAC)
      therapy but have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacological alternative to OAC.
      TEE will be used to confirm the ICE evaluation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female aged ≥18 years

          2. Documented non-valvular AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent)

          3. High risk of stroke or systemic embolism, defined as a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2

          4. The patient is recommended for oral anticoagulation therapy (OAC), but has an
             appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to chronic oral
             anticoagulation

          5. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol-specified medication
             regimen and follow-up evaluations

          6. The patient (or legally authorized representative) has been informed of the nature of
             the study, agrees to its provisions, and has provided written informed consent
             approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee (EC)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year
             following the index procedure. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test (per site standard test) within 7 days prior to index
             procedure.

          2. Anatomic conditions that would prevent performance of an LAA occlusion procedure
             (e.g., prior atrial septal defect [ASD] or patent foramen ovale [PFO], surgical repair
             or implanted closure device, or obliterated or ligated left atrial appendage)

          3. Atrial fibrillation that is defined by a single occurrence or that is transient or
             reversible (e.g., secondary thyroid disorders, acute alcohol intoxication, trauma,
             recent major surgical procedures)

          4. Patients with a medical condition (other than atrial fibrillation) that mandates
             chronic oral anticoagulation (e.g., history of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis or
             pulmonary embolism, or mechanical heart valve)

          5. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or patients in whom antiplatelet and/or
             anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated

          6. Active infection with bacteremia

             ipsilateral stroke or TIA) or known asymptomatic carotid artery disease (diameter
             stenosis of &gt;70%)

          8. Recent (within 30 days of index procedure) or planned (within 60 days post-procedure)
             cardiac or non-cardiac interventional or surgical procedure

          9. Recent (within 90 days of index procedure) stroke, transient ischemic attack

         11. Vascular access precluding delivery of implant with catheter-based system

         12. Severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV)

         13. Prior cardiac transplant, history of mitral valve replacement or transcatheter mitral
             valve intervention, or any mechanical valve implant

         14. Renal insufficiency, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30
             mL/min/1.73 m2 (by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation), or dialysis at
             the time of screening

         15. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, or white blood cell count
             &lt;3,000 cells/mm3

         16. Patient has a known allergy, hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,
             clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, or device materials (e.g., nickel, titanium,
             gold), or the patient has contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated

         17. Current participation in another investigational drug or device study that interferes
             with this study

         18. Patient is a prisoner

         19. Known other medical illness or known history of substance abuse that may cause
             non-compliance with the protocol or protocol-specified medication regimen, confound
             the data interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy of less than 1 year

         20. Patient has a condition which precludes adequate transesophageal echocardiographic
             (TEE) assessment
