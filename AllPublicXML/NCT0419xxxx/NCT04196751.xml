  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical supervision (CS) is a pragmatic approach, which enables nurses to work together; it
      can create a positive nursing environment, reduce stress, and increase clinical skills
      through peer support. Previous research has demonstrated its positive effects on nurses
      wellbeing, sense of coherence, and professional accountability. However, there is lack of
      evidence for its influence on cultural sensitivity.

      The Qatar National Health Strategy (Ministry of Public Health, 2018) and the Qatar National
      Mental Health Strategy (Supreme Council of Health, Qatar, 2013) have both given significant
      importance on building the health workforce capacity to meet the growing needs of the
      population. Aligning with these strategies, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Mental Health
      Service's Executive Committee has taken a decision to implement clinical supervision to
      develop a supporting framework to strengthen the professional skills of the nursing
      workforce. In order to implement it efficiently, guidelines and education curriculum have
      been developed. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of CS. In addition,
      investigators will also explore the impact of clinical supervision on the work-related
      strain, sense of coherence, cultural sensitivity and the impact on patient care. A
      longitudinal approach will be adopted using pre and post-testing. The required power sample
      size is calculated to be 136 nurses. Enrolled participants will receive an educational
      programme regarding clinical supervision and will be requested to choose a supervisor based
      on their learning requirements. Through the clinical supervision process, supervisee
      self-reflection, facilitated by the supervisor. The supervisor will, in addition, enable
      opportunities for professional growth by the sharing of skills and knowledge in relation to
      particular clinical challenges. In addition, they will also provide opportunities for
      emotional restoration through the exploration of stressful issues that have occurred in the
      workplace.

      Participants will be scheduled to engage in one to one sessions with their supervisor once a
      month for an hour. The study will be conducted for 18 months (2 months for baseline data
      collection, 2 months for educational preparation, 12 months of intervention and lastly 2
      months for post-intervention data collection) from the date of the participant's enrollment.
      The outcome measures include the sense of coherence, work-related strain, cultural
      sensitivity, the total number of nurse instigated Occurrence, Variance and Accident (OVA)
      initiated during the course of this study and the efficacy of clinical supervision sessions.
      Data will be collected before education sessions are delivered (baseline), at 6th month and
      at the 12th month. The investigators will use the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
      (SPSS) and STATA for analysis. The study may identify an effective way of reducing
      work-related strain and enhancing the sense of coherence, cultural sensitivity, and quality
      of patient care.

    <description>The literature suggests that work-related stress and injuries are more common among nurses. Clinical supervision aims to provide support to nurses and guide them to identify their learning needs, improve their knowledge and skills to deal with complex situations and subsequently may reduce work-related strain. To assess the effectiveness of clinical supervision on the work-related strain, investigators will use the Work-Related Strain Inventory (WRSI). It consists of 18 statements designed to measure the feelings of psychological strain in occupational settings. The possible scores for the WRSI range from 18-72, the higher the score, the stronger the feelings of experiencing work-related strain. Data on WRSI will be collected at baseline (before Clinical Supervision sessions), at 6th and 12th month after the first clinical supervision session. The change in the mean scores will be assessed using an appropriate statistical test.</description>

    <measure>Sense of Coherence</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, and then at 6th month and 12th month after the first clinical supervision session</time_frame>
    <description>A high sense of coherence is a pre-requisite for successful adaptation to a stressful situation- which leads to better health and wellbeing. Investigators will use a short form with 13 items of Sense of Coherence. These 13 items comprise three components: comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. The respondents indicate agreement or disagreement on a seven category semantic differential scale with two anchoring responses tailored to the content of each item. Five items (1,2,3,5, and 7) needs to be reversed before summing the total scores. The total score can range from 13 to 91, and a higher score indicates higher Sense Of Coherence. Data on SOC will be collected at baseline (before intervention), at 6th and 12th month after the first clinical supervision session. The change in the mean scores will be assessed using an appropriate statistical test.</description>

    <measure>Intercultural Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, and then at 6th month and 12th month after the first clinical supervision session</time_frame>
    <description>The majority of the nursing workforce in Qatar is of expatriates. Studies show that migrant nurses often face language barriers, cultural diversity, and lack of trust and mutual respect. In this study, investigators are anticipating that supervisee and supervisor may be from different cultures. It is expected that this may promote mutual respect and cultural sensitivity. Intercultural Sensitivity Scale (ICS) will be used to assess cultural sensitivity. The ICS is subdivided into five subscales, and these are Interaction Engagement, Respect for Cultural Differences, Interaction Confidence, Interaction Enjoyment and Interaction attentiveness. A high score indicated higher Intercultural Sensitivity. Data on ICS will be collected at baseline, at 6th and 12th months after the first session of clinical supervision. The change in the mean scores will be assessed.</description>

    <description>Clinical supervision is widely accepted as being a good thing, but until now, this has been more a statement of faith rather than fact. Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26) will be used to understand the key elements of clinical supervision from the supervisees' perspective. The Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale is designed to establish its true merits once and for all. Investigators using the MCSS with 26 items with six subscales on the five-point Likert scale ranging from '0-strongly disagree' to '4-strongly agree' with a higher score indicating effectiveness. This version is widely tested in a number of studies. The six subscales are: importance/value of clinical supervision, finding the time, trust/rapport, supervisor advise/support, improved care/skills, reflection. Data using MCSS-26 will be collected at the end of the 12th month after the first Clinical Supervision session record date.</description>

    <measure>Correlation between baseline work-related strain, intercultural sensitivity and sense of coherence.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from the date of enrollment in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators are aiming to find the correlation between baseline work-related strain, cultural sensitivity and sense of coherence. Total scores of scales and subscales will be explored for the correlation. If the data follows normal deviation, Pearson correlation coefficient will be used. If data follows the non-normal deviation, then the Spearman Correlation coefficient will be used. The test will be used to find the correlation between baseline work-related strain, cultural sensitivity and sense of coherence.</description>

    <description>After enrollment and baseline data collection, all participants will be invited to attend training on clinical supervision. Education will be delivered in three phases. 1-Orientation to the clinical supervision model / Preparation before Implementation. 2-Integration of theory into practice/Process of supervision and 3-Skill advancement for supervisors. After training all participants will be encouraged to choose a supervisor, identify objectives for skill development. They will be advised to meet their supervisor once a month for 60 minutes. In this session, both the supervisor and supervisee will be working together to achieve the stated goals. The supervisor will assist the supervisees in prioritizing their focus if the list is extensive. Only the recorded attendance will be used for research purpose. No other content or records of the clinical supervision sessions will be used for research. Data will be collected at baseline, 6th &amp; 12th month with pre-specified tools.</description>
