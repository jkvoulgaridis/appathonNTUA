  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin is innervated by a network of nociceptive sensory neurons (nociceptors) whose
      primary function is the transmission of pain and pruritus signals to the central nervous
      system. Their role in atopic dermatitis (AD), characterized by an exacerbated type 2 immune
      response, is only partially understood. Nevertheless, large amounts of neuropeptides,
      including substance P (SP), are found in the serum of patients, their level being correlated
      with the clinical severity of AD. Mast cells (MC) are part of the cells of the immune system
      residing in the skin. MCs have neuro-receptors of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptors
      family (MRGPR) and in particular MRGPRX2 (the receptor for cationic molecules [including SP]
      for MCs) through which they could communicate in a privileged way. with the nociceptors.
      Preliminary data obtained in mice show that its mouse orthologue &quot;MrgprB2&quot; is absolutely
      necessary for the development of type 2 immunity and the pathological characteristics of a
      preclinical &quot;DA-like&quot; model (manuscript in preparation). The investigators therefore
      hypothesize that the activation of MCs expressing MRGPRX2 by nociceptors producing SP plays a
      key role in the development of type 2 inflammation in AD in humans.

    <description>2 skin biopsies on a lesion area selected according to the inclusion criteria (2 punchs of 4 mm) for each experimental group.
The first half of whole cutaneous biopsies (n = 25) will be studied using biphotonic microscopy. This will be performed on whole biopsies in 3-D according to the protocol developed in the laboratory.
The second half of whole skin biopsies (n = 25) will be studied using the technique of single-cell RNA seq.
The skin controls skin-free subjects will be obtained from skin reduction surgery (abdominoplasty) to subjects who have agreed to the use of their skin sample.</description>
