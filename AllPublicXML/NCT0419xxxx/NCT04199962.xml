      This is a prospective cohort study using gene expression to study patients with infection and
      sepsis from pneumonia.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study using single cell transcriptomic profiling and plasma DNA
      tissue mapping on patients with pneumonia with or without sepsis. The major application of
      the investigator's study would be the discovery of gene expressions in different leucocytes
      and plasma DNA associated with each type of organ dysfunction in sepsis. These include
      cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, neurological and haematological dysfunction.
      This would help prediction, diagnosis and development of therapies to treat sepsis. Leucocyte
      single cell transcriptome and plasma DNA tissue mapping may addresses the limitations of
      current evidence in 3 ways: (1) differentiate patients with uncomplicated pneumonia versus
      pneumonia with associated sepsis, (2) correlation with types and severity of organ
      dysfunction and (3) identifying molecular phenotypes of sepsis.
