        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a

             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood pressure (BP), Pulse rate (PR)

          -  Female partner is surgically sterilised (including hysterectomy)

             and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory) Sperm donation is not allowed from the
             time point of drug administration until 30 days thereafter.

               -  ALT (alanine transaminase), AST (aspartate transaminase), or serum creatinine
                  exceed upper limit of normal range at screening, confirmed by a repeat test

               -  Orthostatic hypotension during orthostatic testing at Day -3, that the
                  investigator considers to be of clinical relevance (only applicable for
