    <measure>Pain level comparison after root canal treatment with two different irrigation methods:The five-face pain scale chart at 8th hours</measure>
    <time_frame>8th hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain levels according to the five-face scale were recorded numerically as no pain (0), mild pain (1), moderate pain (2), severe pain (3), or very severe pain (4). All participants and their parents were informed by a blind researcher about filling out the five-face pain scale chart. To achieve standardization, pain levels were recorded by the participants under the same parent's guidance at each time interval.</description>
