  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to assess the relative bioavailability of 2 different abediterol
      nebulised formulations (test) and the dry powder formulation (reference). The study results
      will provide information on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile following use of the 3 devices
      to be used in further clinical development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, 4-period, single-dose, single-center, crossover
      study with a William's design in healthy subjects (males).

      The study will comprise:

        1. A screening period of maximum 28 days;

        2. Four treatment periods during which subjects will be resident prior to the evening meal
           the night before dosing with abediterol (Day -1) until at least 48 hours following
           dosing for collection of PK samples; discharged on the morning of Day 3; and

        3. A final safety post-treatment visit within 14 days after the last administration of
           abediterol.

      There will be a minimum washout period of 14 days between each treatment period.

      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 12 weeks.

    The decision to terminate has been taken by the Sponsor. The decision is not due to safety
    concerns but reflects business prioritizations of the company.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             conditions (e.g., including Gilbert's syndrome, gallstone and cholecystectomy) known
