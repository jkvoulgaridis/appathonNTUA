  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the effects of concurrent training program on
      physical-functional fitness, physical activity level, endothelial function, blood pressure,
      biochemical markers of cardiovascular risk and bone metabolism, density and microstructure
      and quality of life of post-bariatric patients (Study 1). To compare the bone and muscle
      changes in post-bariatric patients by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery with non-bariatric
      controls, as well as to correlate these health indicators with surgery time and weight loss
      (Study 2).

      Randomized controlled trial (Study 1) will feature post-bariatric patients in outpatient care
      at the Policlinica Piquet Carneiro. After recruitment, patients will be randomized into 2
      groups: training group (TG) and control group (CG). The patients allocated to TG will
      perform, for 6 months, a aerobic and resistance exercises program. The sessions of physical
      training will be 3 times a week and will include 20 min of walking and 40 min of resistance
      exercises involving large muscle groups, with 8-12 repetitions in load corresponding to
      70-85% of 1 repetition maximum (RM). The CG will not perform physical exercises during the
      experiment period. The outcomes will be assessed by dual energy X-ray emission densitometry
      (DXA); high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), 1 RM and
      cardiopulmonary exercise test; biochemical analysis (blood lipid profile, blood glucose and
      biomarkers of bone formation and absorption and calcium metabolism); venous occlusion
      plethysmography and nailfold videocapillaroscopy; blood pressure measurement; accelerometry;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire and 36-Item Short-form Health Survey. The
      cross-sectional study (Study 2) will have 2 groups: post-bariatric patients group (BG) and
      control group (CG) - non-bariatric controls. Outcomes will be assessed by DXA; HR-pQCT;
      handgrip strength and biochemical analysis (blood lipid profile, blood glucose and biomarkers
      of bone formation and absorption and calcium metabolism).
