  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because the diagnostic criteria for prostate cancer are different in the peripheral and the
      transition zone, prostate segmentation is needed for any computer-aided diagnosis system
      aimed at characterizing prostate lesions on magnetic resonance (MR) images. Manual
      segmentation is time consuming and may differ between radiologists with different expertise.
      We developed and trained a convolutional neural network algorithm for segmenting the whole
      prostate, the transition zone and the anterior fibromuscular stroma on T2-weighted images of
      787 MRIs from an existing prospective radiological pathological correlation database
      containing prostate MRI of patients treated by prostatectomy between 2008 and 2014 (CLARA-P
      database).

      The purpose of this study is to validate this algorithm on an independent cohort of patients.

    <description>The Mean Mesh Distance corresponds to the Average Boundary Distance (ABD) for each point of the reference segmentation. The distance to the closest point of the compared segmentation is first computed. Then the average of all these distances is computed and gives the ABD.
The Mean Mesh Distance between the contours of the whole prostate made by the algorithm and each radiologist will be used as primary outcome measure.</description>

    <intervention_name>Comparison of prostate multi-zone segmentation obtained with an automatic deep learning-based algorithm and two expert radiologists</intervention_name>
    <description>The algorithm is used to perform a multizone segmentation of the prostate including delineation of : the whole prostate contours, the transition zone contours, the anterior fibromuscular stroma.
The contours is independently corrected by 2 radiologists. The corrected contours of the different zones will be stored and for each zone 6 different metrics will be used to evaluate the difference between the initial and corrected contours:
Mean Mesh Distance: Average Boundary Distance (ABD) for each point of the reference segmentation. The distance to the closest point of the compared segmentation is first computed. Then the average of all these distances is computed and gives the ABD
General Hausdorff distance (HD)
95% percentile (P) of the HD and the 95th (P) of the asymmetric HD distribution
95% HD modified (HD95_1): different approach by first computing the 95th (P) of the asymmetric HD then taking the maximum
Dice coefficient
