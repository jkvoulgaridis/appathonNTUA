    <textblock>
      Hepatitis b virus infection remains a serious public health problem in China.
      Nucleotide/nucleoside analogues are used for anti-virus treatment in these patients.
      Entecavir, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and Tenofovir Alafenamide are first line drug in
      China. But there still lacks of data of Tenofovir Alafenamide in treatment of hepatitis b
      virus related compensated cirrhosis. This study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and
      safety of three types of nucleotide/nucleoside analogues in treatment of hepatitis b virus
      related compensated cirrhosis.
