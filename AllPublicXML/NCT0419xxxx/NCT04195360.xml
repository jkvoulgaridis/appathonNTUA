      Incidence and pathophysiologic hemodynamics of orthostatic intolerance and orthostatic
      hypotension in patients undergoing UKA
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In today's multimodal fast-track perioperative care program (ERAS) early mobilization is an
      essential cornerstone, and is known to prevent postoperative morbidity and lower length of
      stay in the hospital. Intact orthostatic blood pressure regulation is necessary to complete
      mobilization, and postoperative orthostatic hypotension (OH), defined as a drop in systolic
      arterial pressure (SAP) &gt; 20 mmHg or a drop &gt;10 mmHg in diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and
      orthostatic intolerance (OI), characterized by dizziness, nausea, feeling warm and syncope
      related to orthostatic challenge, are well-known reasons for delayed early mobilization,
      prolonged bedrest and delayed ambulation.

      Former studies have been accessing the postoperative incidence in THA-patients (22%-40%),
      TKA-patients(36%), colorectal patients(53%), abdominal and cardiothoracic surgery
      patients(40%), radical prostatectomy patients (50%). One study have been accessing the
      postoperative incidence of OI in mastectomy patients and found an incidence of 4%, and
      thereby indicating that postoperative OI is not an issue in minor surgery.

      This study is the first, to our acknowledgement, which accesses the postoperative incidence
      of OI/OH in UKA-patients.
