  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will investigate the effects of Nic's Ketogenic diet, comprised of 70% fat,
      5% carbohydrate, and 25% protein on middle-aged males and females with mid-range elevated
      LDL. With the mixed evidence on the causative effect of LDL cholesterol on increased
      cardiovascular health risk, further studies are warranted to examine the relation of elevated
      LDL and other biomarkers of cardiovascular health in response to a lifestyle intervention.
      Furthermore, this study will investigate weight loss and body composition changes with
      adherence to this dietary intervention over a 140-day period. In this study the efficacy of
      Nic's Ketogenic diet on weight loss and biomarkers of cardiovascular health will be examined.
