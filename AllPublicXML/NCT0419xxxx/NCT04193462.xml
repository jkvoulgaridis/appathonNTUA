  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A short term dyadic psychotherapy intervention for mothers with Post-Partum depression and
      their babies in the first year of life was developed. The investigators believe that
      following dyadic intervention mothers will show improvement in depressive symptoms, the
      quality of the mother-child relationship will improve, and maternal and infant's oxytocin
      levels will rise.

      Subjects: 60 Mothers will be interviewed and diagnosed as suffering from Post-Partum-
      depression (PPD) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, IV
      version (DSM-IV), enrolling within 3-8 months postpartum. Mothers will be recruited through
      social media networks. Additional 40 mothers, 3-8 months postpartum will be assessed and
      diagnosed as not suffering from PPD or any other psychiatric psychopathology.

      Procedure: The baseline assessment will be conducted at the infant's home. A parent-infant
      interaction will be videotaped and salivary oxytocin samples will be collected from the
      infant and from the mother.

      The women in the PPD group will participate in 8 weeks of dyadic psychotherapy (DP) combining
      video feedback, or a psycho-educational treatment regarding child development (randomize
      selection will be made). During the 8-week treatment, salivary oxytocin samples will be
      collected from the infants and from the mother at the beginning and the end of each session.

      Another assessment will be conducted at the infant's home, at the end of the treatment. As in
      the baseline condition, this assessment will include videotaped parent-infant interaction, as
      well as salivary oxytocin samples collection from the mother and from the infant.
      Parent-infant interaction will be filmed and assessed using the CIB Manual (Feldman, 1998)
      and the synchrony coding system.

      Healthy mothers will undergo the same baseline assessment and a second assessment within 2-3
      months, and won't get any treatment.

    <description>Mothers and infants will be treated with dyadic psychotherapy focused on interactions, emphasizing eye contact, body language, empathy, and social reciprocity. Dyadic psychotherapy will be administered one time a week during the 8-week trial period, at the subject's home. Each session, approximately 90 minutes long, will include videotaping mother-infant interaction, watching the last session's interaction as a part of video-feedback technique, and discussing main issues in the mother-infant relationship. In addition, each session will begin and end with a- 5-minute episode of affectionate touch and gaze synchrony between the mother and her infant. During the whole therapy-trial, the therapist will also use cognitive-behavioral approach to address the mother's perception of her infant and of herself as a mother.</description>
