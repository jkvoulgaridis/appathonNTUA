  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to analyse the efficacy of the NAT-FM multicomponent
      treatment program as coadjuvant of treatment-as-usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone.

      In this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), in addition to evaluating the clinical effects of
      NAT-FM treatment in the short- and long-term, the research team will seek to identify
      relevant moderators and mediators of clinical change.

      -  This is a two-arm RCT focused on the safety and potential efficacy of the multicomponent
           program NAT-FM as coadjuvant of treatment-as-usual (TAU) vs. TAU alone.

        -  NAT-FM combines Classical Structural Assessment (CSA) and Ecological Momentary
           Assessment (EMA) to obtain more reliable information about the dynamics of the variables
           to be evaluated, to record the affective and cognitive impact of each activity, and to
           explore its potential delivery in real-world clinical practice.

        -  The main hypothesis is that improvement on functional impairment of patients with
           fibromyalgia can be achieved by the direct intervention on mechanisms such as
           self-efficacy and pain catastrophizing.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQR comprises three dimensions: physical dysfunction (scores from 0 to 30), overall impact (scores from 0 to 20), and intensity of the symptoms (scores from 0 to 50) is used to measure the impact generated by FM during the last week. It consists of 21 items, which are answered on a numerical rating scale of 11 points (from 0 to 10). Total scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting greater deterioration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>TSK-11 is used to assess fear of pain and movement. It consists of 11 items, which are answered on a Likert scale of 4 points. Total scores of each scale range from 11 to 44, where higher scores indicate a greater fear of pain and movement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is used to quantify the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. It consists of two dimensions (anxiety and depression) of 7 items each responding on a Likert scale of 4 points. Total scores of each scale (HADS-A and HADS-D) range from 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>PCS is used to evaluate catastrophic thoughts associated with pain. It consists of three dimensions (rumination, magnification, and helplessness) of 13 items in total, which are answered on a Likert scale of 5 points. Total scores on each scale range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more catastrophic thoughts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSS is used to evaluate the stress perceived by people during the last month. This study will use a 4 item version. The response format of this scale is 5-point Likert type. Total scores range from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personal Perceived Competence Scale (PPCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>PPCS is used to measure perceived competence. It consists of 8 items that are answered on a 6-point Likert scale. Total scores of each scale range from 8 to 48, with higher scores indicating greater perceived competence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>RSES is used to measure self-esteem. It consists of 10 items that are answered on a Likert scale of 4 points. Total scores of each scale range from 10 to 40, where higher scores indicate higher self-esteem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>CERQ is used to assess individual differences in the cognitive regulation of emotions. The instrument measures nine 2-item dimensions (self-blame, blaming others, acceptance, refocusing on planning, positive refocusing, rumination, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, and catastrophizing). This study will use the short version of 18 items. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Total scores for each dimension range from 2 to 10, with the highest scores indicating the specific cognitive strategy most used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>PANAS is used to evaluate positive and negative affect. It consists of two dimensions (positive affect and negative affect) of 10 items each answered on a Likert scale of 5 points. Total scores of each scale range from 10 to 50, where higher scores indicate a greater presence of the specific affectivity.</description>
