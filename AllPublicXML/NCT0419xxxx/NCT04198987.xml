  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to assess whether the use of simple sugars given as a daily dietary
      supplement can improve the health of children with congenital disorders of glycosylation
      (CDG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to collect data from patients diagnosed with congenital disorders
      of glycosylation and taking a simple sugar supplement. The study team wants to expand the
      evidence on the beneficial effects of this treatment in clinical practice.

    <description>To assess the effects of oral monosaccharide supplementation for each participant, changes in participant growth parameters, as well as blood sugar levels, coagulation parameters, liver function, and other measures of organ system function (as appropriate for the specific type of CDG) will be correlated with biomarkers derived from participant blood and urine samples obtained at key time points and then compared to standard normative ranges of data for each measure.</description>
