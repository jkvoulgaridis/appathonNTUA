    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common symptom and a leading concern in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) and often persists despite clinical and endoscopic remission.

      This study evaluates the metabolomic profile of fatigued patients with IBD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, there is only one non-published study using metabolomics in quiescent IBD patients
      with and without fatigue.

      The investogators designed this study to examine if there are metabolomics factors associated
      to fatigue in IBD patients.

      This study was performed with plasma samples from IBD patients recruited in a previous study
      after informed consent. (1) IBD outpatients attending the Hospital de Sabadell
      Gastroenterology Day-care unit were consecutively included for analytical monitoring of
      immunosuppressant treatment or infliximab infusion.

      The investigators recorded demographic data, IBD classification according to the Montreal
      classification, and history of drug administration. In addition, clinical activity of the
      disease was measured using the Harvey-Bradshaw score for Crohn's disease (CD) and the
      modified Mayo score for ulcerative colitis (UC). The &quot;Functional Assessment of chronic
      Illness Therapy-Fatigue&quot; (FACIT-F) was used to assess fatigue.
