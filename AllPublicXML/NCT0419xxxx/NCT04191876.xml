  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence is a challenge in all of medicine and is associated with multiple
      negative outcomes. Strategies to better measure and enhance adherence to medication are
      urgent and necessary to minimize unwanted health outcomes, hospitalizations, poorer quality
      of life and excessive costs for individuals, insurers and caregivers. Recently, behavioral
      economics-based approaches have emerged as a promising tool to address this unmet need, but
      its effectiveness in oral antipsychotic treatment remains to be assessed. For this project,
      investigators will use an app that offers financial incentives to increase compliance for
      patients with chronic diseases. Investigators intend to enroll 25 patients in a pilot project
      to assess feasibility of offering financial incentives to improve medication adherence in
      severe mental illness.
