    <description>The primary outcome included assessment of the performance of IUC as a predictive tool for possible residual malignancy after primary TURBT. Thereafter, sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) and overall accuracy of IUC as a preliminary step before repeat TURBT will be determined.</description>

    <description>Forty-eight hours after primary TURBT, IUC was retrieved and patients were scheduled for repeat TURBT 2 to 6 weeks later according to the predetermined protocol. The primary outcome was to determine the role of positive IUC to predict positive biopsy findings on repeat TURBT.</description>
