      Non-randomized monocentric open cohort study vs historical comparative group testing the
      efficacy of a multimodal prehabilitation program (based on physical activity, nutritional
      support and mental preparation) for unfit patients based on nutrition, physical activity and
      mental preparation in reducing postoperative complications in elective major surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prehabilitation programs essentially based on physical activity improvement may reduce
      postoperative complications after major surgery. We hypothesize that a multimodal program
      based on physical activity, nutritional support and mental preparation may not only improve
      postoperative recovery and reduce costs but also improve health status beyond postoperative
      period.

      Non-randomized monocentric open cohort study vs historical comparative group testing the
      efficacy of a multimodal prehabilitation program for unfit patients based on nutrition,
      physical activity and mental preparation in reducing postoperative complications in elective
      major surgery.

      Other outcomes will be measured : length of hospital stay, hospital readmissions, direct
      costs, health status at 1 and 6 months.

      Moreover, the feasibility and adherence of Paprika program will be evaluated. Inter-data
      centres relating to the implementation of the same prehabilitation program will be compared
      with the consortium Paprika (Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Cologne, University
      of Gdansk)
