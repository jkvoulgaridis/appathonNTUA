  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to investigate neural
      correlates of bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) associated with
      upper limb rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients. For this purpose, patients included
      will be submitted to 10 sessions with active or sham bihemispheric tDCS associated with
      intensive and individualized rehabilitation. Neuroimage will be employed before and after the
      intervention to investigate neural correlates of expected changes in motor function.

    <description>Stimulation will be applied for 20 minutes by a DC stimulator (NeuroConn, Germany). During each stimulation section, a pair of saline-soaked sponge electrodes (surface 24 cm²) will be placed over C3 and C4, according to the International 10-20 EEG system. Stimulation intensity will be 2 mA with current ramping up and down of 10 seconds each. The stimulation will be followed by 40 minutes of upper limb rehabilitation. Experimental sessions will be repeated five times per week to complete 10 sessions.</description>

    <description>Sham stimulation will be applied for 20 minutes by a DC stimulator (NeuroConn, Germany). During each sham stimulation section, a pair of saline-soaked sponge electrodes (surface 24 cm²) will be placed over C3 and C4, according to the International 10-20 EEG system. The anode will be placed to the affected hemisphere, while the cathode will be positioned over the unaffected hemisphere. Sham tDCS will be performed by ramping current flow for the first 10 seconds of stimulation, but switching the stimulator off automatically after 30 seconds. The sham stimulation will be followed by 40 minutes of upper limb rehabilitation. Experimental sessions will be repeated five times per week to complete 10 sessions.</description>
