  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking accounts for approximately 30% of total cancer deaths each year. Even though former
      studies show that persons with a cancer diagnosis are less likely to smoke than the general
      population up to 50% of people who smoke and have lung cancer do not stop smoking after their
      diagnosis or frequently relapse after smoking cessation. Continued smoking leads to increased
      all-cause mortality, increased cancer-specific mortality, and decreased quality of life. It
      is well-known that cancer patients are interested in smoking cessation therefore smoking
      cessation interventions play an important role in the management of people with cancer.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive smoking cessation interventions on
      cancer patients in real life. The project provides new knowledge about smokers diagnosed with
      cancer.

      This prospective register-based cohort study including smokers attending an intensive smoking
      cessation intervention (the Gold Standard Programme (GSP)) from 2006-2017 in Denmark. The GSP
      is a manualised, patient education programme taught by specially trained staff, including
      pharmacologic strategies.

    <description>The intervention comprises 5-6 meetings during six weeks, and can be held in group or as an individual intervention. It is based on counselling and a clearly structured manual-based patient education programme taught by specially trained staff, and contains individual counselling on nicotine replacement therapy or other medical support, according to the level of dependence measured by the Fagerstr√∂m test score. The first two weeks cover teaching sessions on: ambivalence and motivation, pros and cons of continuous smoking versus cessation, and a quit date is set between the 2. and 3. week. The last 3 sessions cover: risk situations, withdrawal symptoms and medical support for withdrawal symptoms, relapse prevention and how to handle a completely smoke-free life.</description>
