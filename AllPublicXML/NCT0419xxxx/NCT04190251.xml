  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monocentric, randomised, controlled and open study. Subjects will be included prospectively
      and consecutively and randomly assigned into two groups. Intervention group A will benefit a
      medication adherence support program during 12 months while intervention group B during 6
      months only. Adherence will be monitored using an Electronic Monitoring system (EM, named
      MEMS®; Aardex Ltd.) during 24 months. At each pharmacy visit, the pharmacist will conduct a
      semi-structured interview in 15 minutes based on Fisher's sociocognitive model with the
      patients. A summary of the interview and the adherence graph will be send to the patient'
      health professionals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to usual care, patients are included in a medication adherence support program
      combining an Electronic Monitoring system (EM, named MEMS®; Aardex Ltd) and motivational
      semi-structured interviews. This programm is held by the Unisanté's community pharmacists*,
      in coordination with medical and nurse staff , to support medication adherence and to promote
      the continuity of care. For patients not speaking french, english, or italian, the interviews
      will be done with a interpreter.

      The medication adherence data will be analysed in both groups along with clinical data
      obtained through draw samples regularly prescribed by the physician.

      *Since the 1st January 2019, the Policlinique Médicale Universitaire became Unisanté,
      University Center for Primary Care and Public Health (Lausanne, Switzerland).
