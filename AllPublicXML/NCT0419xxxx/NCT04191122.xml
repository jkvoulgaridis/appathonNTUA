  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Self-harm (SH) is any act of intentional self-injury or self-poisoning, with or
      without the intention to die. People who SH are at high risk for future suicide and often
      suffer considerable emotional distress. Depression is common among people who SH and may be
      an underlying driver of self-harm behaviour. Treating depression in people who SH has the
      potential to reduce the risk of further SH and suicide. Self-harm is often repeated, and risk
      of repetition is highest immediately after an act of self-harm. Readily accessible brief
      talking therapies show promise in helping people who SH, but further evaluation of these
      approaches is needed. The Community Outpatient Psychological Engagement Service for Self-Harm
      (COPESS) is a brief talking therapy intervention for depression and self-harm. This
      intervention was shown to be feasible and acceptable in hospital emergency department
      settings, but accessibility was limited; thus, the investigators wish to develop and test a
      community-based version of this intervention. The COPESS project moves this therapy into a
      community setting, thereby increasing the number of people who can be helped, especially
      those in hard-to-reach groups and from disadvantaged areas.

      Aim: To assess the feasibility of conducting a trial of the COPESS intervention in a
      community setting, for people with depression who self-harm, in relation to participant
      recruitment and retention. Therapy, acceptability and safety of the intervention will also be
      assessed.

      Methods: Using a Single Blind Randomised Control Trial (RCT) design, the investigators will
      recruit a sample of n=60 participants with a history of SH within the last six months, who
      are also currently depressed. Recruitment will take place via GP practices for patients who:
      1) seek consultation for self-harm; 2) have consulted for self-harm in the previous 6 months
      (determined by GPs' search of their own data-systems); or 3) self-refer via their GP.
      Following baseline assessment participants will be randomly allocated to either receive
      COPESS plus Treatment as Usual [TAU; n = 30)] or TAU alone (n=30). Follow-up assessments will
      take place at one, two and three months. Recruitment rates, attrition and data completeness
      will be monitored. Qualitative interviews with participants and stakeholders will further
      investigate feasibility.

      Design A mixed-method evaluation of a single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) will
      determine the acceptability and safety of the COPES intervention, in preparation for a future
      large-scale trial of the efficacy of COPES for depression in people who SH. People who have
      depression and SH in the community will be randomised to receive either COPES plus
      treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone.

      Recruitment rates and power calculations This study is intended as a preliminary evaluation
      of the feasibility of conducting a future large-scale RCT of the COPES intervention. As, the
      investigators are not conducting any hypothesis testing of effectiveness, or estimation of
      prevalence (other than attrition) a formal power calculation is not appropriate. A
      recruitment target of n=60 (n=30 per trial arm) will be used. This is a common and realistic
      recruitment target for feasibility trials, and will allow adequate precision in estimating
      rates relevant to trial outcomes (e.g. attrition, adverse events). This will allow an overall
      attrition rate of 30% to be estimated with 95% confidence intervals of +/- 12% or, 16% for a
      single arm. This sample size is adequate for estimating relevant analysis parameters, such as
      the standard deviation of effects, which are needed for determining the feasibility of a
      later efficacy trial. To avoid high attrition rates, the investigators will keep participants
      engaged via text and/or telephone reminders. The previous pilot of HOPE within the ED
      achieved an average recruitment of nine eligible referrals each month. Sixty-one percent of
      participants engaged with the therapy and attended at least one session. Rates of attendance
      for SH at GP practices and walk-in centres in the Liverpool area have been estimated at 70
      per month. Based on these figures a recruitment rate of 3 to 4 participants each month with a
      goal of n=60 participants overall is achievable.

      Research Sites The research will take place in Liverpool, in the North West of England. The
      North West has particularly high rates of SH. Between April 2011 and March 2014, there were
      16,405 presentations for deliberate SH to emergency departments within Merseyside and
      Cheshire. Liverpool local authority had one of the highest number of attendances for SH in
      this area (15%, n = 2,489). Therefore, Liverpool provides a good location for undertaking
      work on SH.

      Recruitment of GP Practices Lead GPs and/or practice managers at practices identified as
      suitable for inclusion in the COPES study will be invited to take part in writing. Invitation
      packs will be given by GPs and followed up by a telephone/skype/face time/face-to-face
      contact from a member of the research team to ascertain level of interest, and if
      appropriate, to arrange a meeting to discuss the study in more detail. The Clinical Research
      Network (CRN) will assist with recruitment of GP practices and have provided a letter of
      support (see Appendix B). Clinicians will be briefed on the COPES trial and provided with
      guidance on referring patients in to the study. To assist recruitment, clinicians will be
      provided with a brief screening checklist to help identify patients where depression-linked
      SH may be a concern.

    <intervention_model_description>COPES is a brief (4 + 1 sessions, 50 minutes) psychotherapy based on psychodynamic and cognitive analytic principles that was developed to help those struggling with SH and depression. COPES is designed to be brief and accessible and involves working collaboratively with a client to try and identify patterns or conflicts in emotional experiences and interpersonal relationships, linked to depressed mood and acts of SH. The therapist works with the client to build a shared map or understanding of these experiences. A goal of therapy is to work towards a small number of specific &quot;exits&quot;, representing helpful steps the client might make to improve their difficulties. Therapy would take place either in the participant's home or in a community setting (e.g. health centre or clinic) depending on preference.
Safety for the therapist and/or mobility for the patient will be reviewed throughout the recruitment period. Participants in the COPES arm of the trial will also receive TAU.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomized to receive COPES plus TAU or TAU via a random sequence generation computer algorithm within STATA to generate (stratified) randomised (block) allocations. Randomisation will be carried out by the study statistician using an independent computerised randomisation system with a randomly sized block design with block sizes of 2, 4 and 6. The study population will be stratified for those receiving TAU and those receiving COPES plus TAU. Researchers completing study assessments will be masked to treatment allocation, facilitated by briefing members of the research team and participants on the need to avoid disclosure of treatment details. The trial will follow an Intent-To-Treat (ITT) protocol. Attrition and reasons for drop-out will be recorded where possible. Guidance will be sought from the patient advisory group on how to manage and minimise attrition over the study period.</masking_description>

    <description>The Adverse Experiences in Psychotherapy (AEP) self-report measure will identify adverse experiences liable to occur within psychological therapy. Safety will be assessed as part of routine monitoring of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). Hospitalisation for any reason, medically serious acts of SH and suicidal crises (defined as participant having a plan and intent to make an imminent suicide attempt) will be regarded as SAEs. Where these occur, a review will take place to assess the plausibility of the SAE being due to the intervention. The occurrence of SAE and the results of the review process will be documented. In cases where SAE are potentially linked to the trial, withdrawal of participants, halting or terminating the trial will be considered as required.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive Treatment-as usual (TAU), defined as the standard care provided to individuals struggling with self-harm (SH) as detailed within the 'Managing SH in primary care' NICE guidelines. These include: an initial comprehensive psychosocial assessment of skills and risks; co-production of a care and risk management care plan, which should include harm reduction plans, the need for between 3 and 12 sessions of psychological intervention as well as treatment for associated mental health conditions. Primary care practices in the control arm will be asked to provide information on what constitutes TAU within their organisation. This trial may enhance TAU as researchers will provide details of NICE guidance to GP practices that may not currently be following these guidelines. We will collect data regarding the acceptability of TAU for SH offered by GPs within both treatment arms.</description>
