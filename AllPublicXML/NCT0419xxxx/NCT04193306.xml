    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) represents the leading cause of late morbidity and
      mortality in heart transplant recipients as the second most frequent cause of all deaths at 3
      years. In distinction from general coronary atherosclerosis, CAV affects diffusely the entire
      coronary vasculature with marked intimal proliferation and concentric vascular thickening and
      fibrosis. It was demonstrated that most of the intimal thickening due to CAV occurs during
      the first year after transplantation. Furthermore, the severity of the CAV appears to
      correlate with lipid abnormalities and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
      is very common after transplantation with nadir of LDL levels occurring at 6 months.

      Because of drug-drug interactions, heart transplant recipients cannot be treated with
      adequate doses of statins to achieve desirable reduction of LDL-C levels (reduction ˂ 60% of
      LDL-C). The use of alternative lipid-lowering drugs including bile acid sequestrates,
      fibrates, nicotinic acid or ezetimibe is not recommended in post-transplant scenario.
      Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) increase availability has
      emerged as a novel drug tool for LDL-C lowering, capable to lower LDL-C by more than 60% even
      in statin-treated patients with very good safety profile.

      Although heart transplant recipients fulfill approved indication and standard clinical
      guidelines of a PCSK9 inhibitor, alirocumab, there are no available data on use of PCSK9
      inhibitor in post-transplant situation.

      The purpose of the ACAV study is to clarify efficacy and safety of alirocumab compared to
      placebo administered during the first year after transplantation in heart transplant
      recipients in addition to background atorvastatin therapy. Except lipid profile, optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) will be performed as the objective efficacy endpoint to examine
      thickness and lumen of coronary vessels. It is expected that inhibition of PCSK9 in heart
      transplant recipient will dramatically improve post-transplant lipoprotein levels and perhaps
      slow down development of CAV in the most critical period of the first year after
      transplantation.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective, phase IV trial with
      parallel design. 126 of new cardiac transplant recipients are planned to be enrolled in two
      sites: 1) Transplant Centre at Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague,
      Czech Republic, and 2) St Anne`s University Hospital (FNUSA) - Centre of Cardiovascular and
      Transplant Surgery (CKTCH) in Brno, Czech Republic. Screening data will be reviewed to
      determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. Screening period could last up to four
      weeks. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either alirocumab 150 mg every 2 weeks or
      placebo between month 1 and month 12 after transplantation (study treatment will start after
      the first surveillance cardiac catheterization approximately one month after heart
      transplantation and it will be completed after the second surveillance cardiac
      catheterization approximately 12 months after heart transplantation). Furthermore, all
      subjects will be on a background statin treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg daily. After
      Screening and Baseline visit, 5 visits are planned during the treatment period (4, 8, 20, 34
      and 48 weeks after baseline) and follow-up visit is planned 60 weeks after baseline. Maximal
      expected duration of subject participation will be 15 months.
