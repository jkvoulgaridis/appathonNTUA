  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major deep burns (&gt;20% body surface, involving deep skin layers) and associated severe
      inflammatory reaction and their complication are one of the biggest challenge of intensive
      care. Haemoadsorption therapy, including the CytoSorb treatment is a promising novel
      therapeutic approach, but only case-studies are available in the literature yet. Based on
      data from septic shock patient treatment the investigators hypothesize that CytoSorb is
      beneficial in early treatment of burns. The investigators aim to conduct a
      randomised-controlled study to assess the clinical effectiveness (based on score systems
      including MODS, SOFA, APACHE II, KDIGO, ABSI), 7 and 28 days survival, intensive care length
      of stay, length of mechanical ventilation, resuscitation fluid need and ino/vasopressor drug
      doses and the presence and severity of organ dysfunctions, particularly renal dysfunction.
      The investigatora plan to conduct basic research to elucidate the pathophysiological
      background of clinical effect, including the measurement of inflammatory and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines, presence and severity of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation,
      protein oxidation, reduced/oxidised glutathion levels) and organ dysfunction markers (kidney
      injury molecule -1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, cystatin-C, uromodulin).
