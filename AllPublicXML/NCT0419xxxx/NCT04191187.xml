  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase II trial of HLA-haploidentical related hematopoietic cells
      transplant (Haplo-HCT) using reduced intensity conditioning (fludarabine and melphalan and
      total body irradiation). Peripheral blood is the donor graft source. This study is designed
      to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) at 18 months post-transplant.

             12 months are eligible after at least two prior therapies. Patients with bulky disease
             should be considered for debulking chemotherapy before transplant. Patients with
             refractory disease are eligible, unless bulky disease and an estimated tumor doubling
             time of less than one month.

          -  Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is eligible after initial therapy if chemotherapy sensitive

          -  Adequate organ function as defined per protocol

          -  Sexually active females of child bearing potential and males with partners of child
             bearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control during study treatment
