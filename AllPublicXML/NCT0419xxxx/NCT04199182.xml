  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent among military Veterans and is more than
      just a psychological condition; PTSD has profound negative impacts on health, function, and
      quality of life. Older Veterans are the largest patient population served by the Veterans
      Health Administration (VHA), and many have lived with PTSD for 40+ years. Veterans with PTSD
      engage in low levels of physical activity and spend much of their time in sedentary
      activities, adding to their risk of physical disability. The benefits of exercise on mental
      health and physical well-being in older adults are well-substantiated, but the effects of
      exercise training on late-life PTSD symptoms is a new area of study. This study is designed
      to examine the effects of 6 months of supervised exercise training on PTSD symptoms and
      PTSD-related conditions (e.g., functional impairment, sleep) in 188 older Veterans with PTSD.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms over the previous month will be assessed with the CAPS-5 clinical interview. Total symptom severity score and symptom cluster severity scores will be calculated. Scores range from 0 to 80, with higher scores reflecting more sever PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Six-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Performance-based measure of aerobic endurance. Participants are instructed to walk along a measured course for 6 minutes. The distance walked in 6 minutes (feet) is the outcome of this assessment. There is no maximum value for this test, but the minimum value could be 0 (unable to walk any distance).</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a self-report tool for assessing sleep quality and disturbance. Scores on the PSQI range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality.</description>
