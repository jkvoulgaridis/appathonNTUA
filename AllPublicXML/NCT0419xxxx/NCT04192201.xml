  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to actively monitor patients with multiple pulmonary
      Ground-glass Nodules (GGNs), in order to provide evidence for multiple GGNs treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple pulmonary GGNs are very commonly identified particularly as increasing numbers of CT
      scans are performed as part of routine lung cancer screening. At the same time, the ideal
      solution for these cases continues to be debated. This aim of this study is to learn more
      about the effects of multiple factors on outcome of multiple pulmonary GGNs, such as
      patients' clinical characteristics, CT features and different pathological types.
      Furthermore, the optimal timing of surgery and the effect of different surgical choices on
      the prognosis of patients with multiple GGNs will be investigated.
