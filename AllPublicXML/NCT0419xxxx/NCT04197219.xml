  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if adding the experimental medication, axitinib, to
      usual treatment with pembrolizumab will work better than pembrolizumab alone. The study team
      will look at overall safety and side effects of the combination of axitinib and pembrolizumab
      to see how well it is tolerated. Researchers will also want to take some research blood
      samples to explore what effects the combination of treatment has on participants' cells and
      immune system and to see if there are things in participants' blood that can predict a
      response or resistance to the combined treatment.

      This is a Phase 2, open label study of pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib in adult
      women with recurrent endometrial cancer with deficient mismatch repair system. Twenty-six
      participants in total will be enrolled into the study. All participants enrolled will receive
      pembrolizumab as standard of care combined with axitinib.

      Axitinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment in certain
      participants with advanced renal cell cancer but is considered investigational (experimental)
      in this study. However, it is not FDA approved for recurrent endometrial cancer. Axitinib is
      a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is thought to work by blocking tumor
      vasculature and decreasing the blood supply to the tumor. Also it has been shown to improve
      the function of immune cells within the tumor which may enable them to kill the tumor.

      Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy that is FDA approved to treat participants with recurrent
      endometrial cancer with deficient mismatch repair system (dMMR). dMMR means having genetic
      changes within the tumor that make it unstable and potentially able to benefit from
      immunotherapy. Pembrolizumab works by improving the function of the immune cells enabling
      them to kill cancer cells.

      Axitinib given in combination with pembrolizumab has not been tested for endometrial cancer.
      In this study the combination of axitinib and pembrolizumab is experimental because it is not
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
