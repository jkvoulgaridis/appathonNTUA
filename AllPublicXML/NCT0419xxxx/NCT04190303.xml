  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with suspected brain infections pose major challenges to low and middle
      income countries, including their disproportionately high burden, diverse causes with
      inadequate surveillance, requirement for invasive and expensive tests, and the difficulty of
      management without a clear diagnosis. This is all compounded by resource and system
      constraints. Few studies have attempted to improve the care of these people in
      resource-limited settings.

      Aim: This study sets out to improve the diagnosis and early management of people with
      suspected acute (&lt;28 days of symptoms) brain infections in low and middle income countries,
      using a coordinated thematic approach.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be proportion of people with suspected acute brain
      infection receiving a diagnosis. Secondary outcomes will include mortality, length of stay in
      hospital, quality of life, degree of disability, and proportion having a lumbar puncture
      test.

      Participants: Children and adults with features consistent with an acute brain infection,
      including meningitis and encephalitis, will be recruited at a variety of hospitals in Brazil,
      India and Malawi.

      Study procedures: An assessment of current practice and capabilities at each hospital,
      including patient and sample journey observations and interviews with healthcare staff, will
      identify barriers to optimal care. Using this, a sustainable pragmatic multi-component
      intervention will be produced, with components modifiable to each hospital's needs. Outcomes
      will be reassessed post-intervention.
