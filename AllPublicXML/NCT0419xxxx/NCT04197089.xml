  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be 50 women or men diagnosed with urothelial cancer candidates to
      undergo cystectomy as part of their antitumor treatment. The main objective of the study is
      to determine the biological effect of Vitamin D on tumor tissue phenotype; for thus, all
      subjects enrolled in the study will take Vitamin D supplementation 4 weeks prior undergoing
      surgery. Urothelial tissue will be obtained from the surgical procedure and will be studied
      for the Vitamin D effect on cancer cell, compared with that urothelial tissue biopsy obtained
      in the moment of cancer diagnosis.

      The study will enroll 50 patients (older than 18 and younger than 80 years old), recently
      diagnosed with urothelial cancer and candidates to undergo radical cystectomy or
      nephroureterectomy.

      At the baseline visit, a blood sample will be obtained for 25OH-VitD analysis and all
      subjects will receive first dose of 10.000 IU Vitamin D. Depending of basal plasmatic Vitamin
      D value, patients will be stratified in either 10.000 IU treatment (25OH-VitD ≥ 20 ng/ml) or
      either 50.000 UI treatment dose (25OH-VitD &lt; 20 ng/ml). Treatment will consist of 4 doses
      taken weekly before their scheduled cystectomy. Last study follow-up visit will be 4 weeks
      post-surgery. Urothelial tumor tissue collected on surgery will be used to evaluate the
      expression of tumor differentiation and Vitamin D markers, using genomics and proteomics
      approaches. Blood sample will also be collect throughout the study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of Vitamin D in plasma and the expression of Vitamin D target genes in
      peripheral blood leukocytes.
