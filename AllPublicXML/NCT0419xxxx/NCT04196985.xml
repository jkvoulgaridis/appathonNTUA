      Comparing FDG PET/CT and FDG PET/MRI in the diagnostic accuracy of detecting local recurrence
      12 weeks after the end of CRT in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Forty to
      sixty patients aged more than 18 years who have a histologically confirmed HNSCC and have
      received chemoradiation therapy will be recruited for the study. The patients will be scanned
      with both PET/CT and PET/MRI 12 weeks after the end of CRT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since recurrence of HNSCC occurs in up to 50 percent of cases in the first two years
      following treatments and the recurrent diseases are less responsive to new treatments,
      detecting local/regional recurrence at an earlier time is crucial in order to provide salvage
      treatments. The primary objective of this prospective study is to compare the diagnostic
      accuracy of FDG PET/CT to FDG PET/MRI in the detection of local recurrence 12 weeks after the
      end of chemoradiation treatment in HNSCC patients. The hypothesis is that PET/MRI might be
      able to diagnose locoregional recurrence earlier and more accurately which would lead to a
      better outcome for the patient. If it is proven correct, it would be possible to optimize the
      use of PET/MRI imaging on selected patients who are likely to benefit clearly from the use of
      that modality.

      Forty to sixty patients aged more than 18 years who have a histologically confirmed HNSCC and
      have received chemoradiation therapy will be recruited for the study. The patients will be
      scanned with both FDG-PET/CT and FDG-PET/MRI 12 weeks after the end of CRT.

      The study will start in January 2020 pending all mandatory authorizations have been obtained.
      All study participants will be consented, and the estimated time for completing the PET scans
      of 30 patients will take 10 to 12 months. The results will be reported in international
      peer-reviewed high-impact journals.
