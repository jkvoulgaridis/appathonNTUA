      Objective: This study is designed to evaluate the short-term efficacy of photobiomodulation
      for improving pain and function in patients that will undergo total knee replacement and
      decrease in morphine consumption and adverse effects of opioids. Methods: thirty four
      patients of both genders that will undergo total knee replacement will participate in this
      randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial. They will be randomly allocated into two
      groups: Photobiomodulation group 1 with 18 patients and placebo group with 18 patients and
      group 3 control without device . Photobiomodulation will be performed twice during 48h, using
      adivice Light-Aid da BrightPhotomedicine- Brasil, com LED de Arsenieto, Gálio and Alumínio
      (AsGaAl) of 850 nm device 3B class, measured and calibrated previously .Five points were
      irradiated on the knee. The placebo group will be treated with the same laser device, but
      will not be turned on. All patients will receive treatment sessions of photobiomodulation
      after 24h and 48 h after peripheral nerve blockade (femoral nerve block and nerve supply),
      applied in 5 points for 5 minutes (300 seconds) close to the incision (that will be protected
      by transparent film) and repeated every 24h after totaling 2 applications. Patients will be
      assessed for duration of surgery and anesthesia, assessment of the pain, time to first rescue
      analgesia request, physical examination, dosimetry of photobiomodulation and amount of
      morphine consumption using PCA 24h and 48 hours after nerve blockade after surgery. In
      addition, adverse effects , sedation, paresthesias, motor blockade, nausea and vomiting will
      be assessed ever 6h during 48h.

      thirty-four patients treated at the Institute of Orthopedics and Traumatology, University of
      São Paulo School of Medicine Hospital das Clínicas (IOT-HC-FMUSP), already identified with
      knee OA awaiting TKA; the thirty-four selected patients will be divided into two groups with
      17 patients in each group:

        -  Photobiomodulation + PCA Group (G1): patients in the PO of knee arthroplasty surgery
           treated with the photobiomodulation device turned on, 24h and 48h after peripheral nerve
           block (femoral nerve and obturator nerve) .With conventional analgesia and with the
           device of PCA.

        -  Placebo + PCA group (G2): patients in the postoperative period of knee arthroplasty
           surgery treated with the photobiomodulation device switched off at 24h and 48h after
           peripheral nerve block (femoral nerve and obturator nerve). With conventional analgesia
           and with the PCA device.

      All patients will undergo photobiomodulation treatment sessions after 24h and 48h of
      peripheral nerve block (femoral and adductor nerve block), applied in two regions: in the
      femoral nerve region for 4 minutes (240 seconds) and near the surgical incision (protected
      with clear film) for 2 minutes (120 seconds) and repeated every 24 hours after, totaling 2
      applications in 2 regions (see table 1). Patients will be systematically evaluated with
      identification, duration of surgery and duration of anesthesia, pain assessment, time of
      first analgesic rescue request, physical examination, photobiomodulation dosimetry and amount
      of PCA bolus requested every 6h within within 48 hours after nerve block after knee
      arthroplasty surgery. In addition to assessing and quantifying adverse effects (motor block,
      sedation, nausea and vomiting). All pain assessments (VAS) and rescue number requests will be
      performed by &quot;blinded examiners&quot;, ie professionals who will not be aware of the group to
      which the patient will belong.
