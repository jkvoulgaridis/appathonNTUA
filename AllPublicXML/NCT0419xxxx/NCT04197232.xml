      The goal of the study is to evaluate the effects on the offspring and therefore the safety of
      using biologic agents during pregnancy and their eventual consequences on children. The
      effects considered are divided into peri-partum and more long-term effects. Demonstration of
      safety in children born from mothers who received biologics during pregnancy will pave the
      way of their use in other women affected by autoimmune diseases unresponsive to standard
      treatment.

      Biologic agents are a group of genetically engineered drugs that target the immune system and
      have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They act by interfering with cytokine
      function or production, inhibiting the &quot;second signal&quot; required for T-cell activation or by
      depleting B-cells. They are used for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases including
      Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), some types of
      vasculitis and many more. Many of these pathologies occur in young women during child-bearing
      years and so it is important for these drugs to not only be safe to use for the patient but
      also during pregnancy for fetus and child. Many studies are conducted on their safety for the
      patients but few studies are present on the safety of use during pregnancy. There are even
      fewer studies that follow up for long term effects on the children outside of the perinatal
      period.
