  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn more about the hormones that muscles make during
      exercise, and if those hormones are associated with type 2 diabetes risk in adults who are
      overweight or obese. Participants will undergo exercise testing on an upright bicycle, with
      blood samples taken for muscle hormones before and after exercise. The hypothesis is that
      adults with overweight/obesity and insulin resistance will have an impaired muscle hormone
      profile in response to exercise compared to adults with overweight/obesity who are not
      insulin resistant.

    <description>CPET studies will be performed in the Cardiovascular Performance Program exercise lab at MGH. Subjects will undergo CPET on an upright cycle ergometer with continual measurement of metabolic gas exchange via a commercially available metabolic cart as well as heart rate and blood pressure. Exercise will proceed according to a maximal effort clinical protocol. Subjects will then undergo a standardized 30-min work load on the upright cycle ergometer based on the results of the maximal effort clinical protocol.</description>
