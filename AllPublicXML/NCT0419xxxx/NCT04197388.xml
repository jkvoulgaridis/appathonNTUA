  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare condition characterised by high blood pressure in
      the lungs and results in breathlessness and reduced exercise capacity for patients. Previous
      research has shown weakness in respiratory muscles in these patients that may contribute
      towards their symptoms. Despite advances in medical therapy, the condition still results in a
      significant symptom burden.

      Inspiratory muscle training is a non-invasive intervention involving a device that provides
      resistance to the muscles of inspiration and increases their strength.

      This study will investigate the benefit of inspiratory muscle training in patients with
      pulmonary arterial hypertension who are stable on medical therapy for three months. This will
      be performed as an outpatient and they will then be reviewed following this with assessment
      of exercise capacity, breathing capacity (spirometry), quality of life, and assessment of
      neural respiratory drive (the signals from the brain to the muscles controlling breathing).

      The study will be based at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital and patients will be
      recruited from outpatients who are already under the care of the Scottish Pulmonary Vascular
      Unit.
