  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to test the hypothesis that multi-omics studies can identify Heart Failure
      profiles at risk of adverse outcomes and evaluate a telemonitoring intervention in the
      optimization of guideline‐directed medical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the US, the estimated prevalence of Heart Failure (HF) is 6.2 million and increasing. The
      mortality approaches 50% within 5 years of diagnosis and HF is the main cause of
      hospitalization among patients over 65 years of age. Information on molecular states may
      enhance understanding of causes and pathophysiological processes, improve risk prediction,
      identify new therapeutic targets, and improve subclassification for targeted therapy.
      Time-dependent phenomapping has been used to identify clinical and genomic differences in a
      longitudinal fashion, which provides a mechanistic link underlying pathophysiology of the
      disease and associated outcomes. Studies including high-throughput molecular approaches
      (multi-omics) along with time-dependent phenomapping would likely be even more powerful. The
      overarching hypothesis of the study is that the integration of Multi-Omics studies with
      clinical variables can be implemented to identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes. To
      test this hypothesis we propose: (1) Longitudinal profiling based on clinical data; (2)
      Longitudinal Multi-Omics Profiling; and (3) randomized of a telemonitoring intervention
      (Sensor Profiling) and the effectiveness in the optimization of guideline‐directed medical
      therapy. To achieve these aims we propose to: (1) recruit a cohort of 1000 participants; (2)
      perform cardiovascular clinical characterization from electronic medical records; (3) perform
      multi-omics studies and (4) randomization of a telemonitoring intervention in the
      optimization of guideline‐directed medical therapy. Proving these hypotheses would identify
      different meaningful clinical groups of patients within a cohort of patients with similar
      clinical conditions, health care providers would have a better understanding of the
      heterogeneity of the disease and the need for different preventive and therapeutic approaches
      in the context of precision medicine.
