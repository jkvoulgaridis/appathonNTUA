  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients remain at risk for pump thrombus and
      thromboembolic events through multiple mechanisms. The HeartWare® Ventricular Assist System
      (HVAD®, HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) includes a novel speed modulation feature called
      Lavare™ cycle. The Lavare™ Cycle is aimed to promote washing of left ventricle to decrease
      blood stasis and subsequent risk of thrombus formation, ingestion and/or expulsion. No prior
      study has prospectively evaluated the impact of Lavare™ cycle on patient outcomes in a
      randomized fashion. We intend to assess effects of Lavare™ Cycle among patients receiving
      HVAD LVAD in this randomized controlled pilot project.

      Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients remain at risk for pump thrombus and
      thromboembolic events through multiple mechanisms. The HeartWare® Ventricular Assist System
      (HVAD®, HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) includes a novel speed modulation feature called
      Lavare™ cycle. It consists of 3 phases: phase 1 - a 200 rpm decrease from baseline speed for
      2 seconds, phase 2 - a 100 rpm increase from baseline for 1 second and phase 3 - return of
      speed to baseline; this cycle repeats itself once every minute.

      The LavareTM Cycle is aimed to promote washing of left ventricle to decrease blood stasis and
      subsequent risk of thrombus formation, ingestion and/or expulsion. In a post-hoc analysis of
      ReVOLVE registry, which includes 248 patients implanted with the HVAD following Conformité
      Européenne Mark in nine centers in Europe and Australia, no adverse impact on survival was
      observed with Lavare™ cycle. Additionally, lower risk of stroke, sepsis and right heart
      failure was observed among those with Lavare™ cycle in the above-mentioned study. However, no
      prior study has prospectively evaluated the impact of Lavare™ cycle on patient outcomes in a
      randomized fashion. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, we intend to assess the
      role of Lavare™ cycle in pump related complications.
