  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinico-biochemical study was carried out to estimate the levels of Fetuin A and
      MMP7 in serum of systemically healthy subjects in periodontal health and disease and to
      evaluate the impact of periodontal interventional therapy (scaling and root planing) on the
      same.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty sex-matched subjects (30 males and 30 females) belonging to a common age group (30-39
      yrs) were enrolled for the study to eliminate bias from confounding factors. They were
      divided into three groups consisting of 20 subjects in each group based on the clinical and
      radiological parameters; Periodontally healthy (Group I), Chronic gingivitis (Group II) and
      chronic periodontitis ( Group IIIa) from whom serum samples were collected. The Group IIIb
      further comprised of the subjects from Group IIIa, who had received non-surgical periodontal
      therapy (scaling and root planing). Serum samples were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks
      post therapy. Fetuin A and MMP-7 concentration was determined from serum samples of patients
      using ELISA. The results of our study depicted that Fetuin A concentration negatively
      correlates, whereas, MMP7 positively correlates with the extent of periodontal inflammation.
      Further, Periodontal therapy demonstrated a significant increase in serum Fetuin A and
      decrease in MMP 7 levels establishing the influence of periodontal therapy in stabilizing
      their levels.

    <description>Procedure/Surgery: non surgical periodontal therapy and root planing (SRP) was performed in two to four appointments lasting approximately 60 minutes each under local anaesthesia (2% lignocaine hydrochloride with 1:2,00,000 adrenaline) using area specific Gracey periodontal curettes and an ultrasonic device. The treatment was concluded in 3 months. Within the duration of the study, all subjects received supportive therapy, which included professional plaque control and reinstruction of oral hygiene.</description>
