  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary school teachers play an essential role in early detection and proper treatment of
      school children suffering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There are
      indications that teachers may not have enough knowledge about this disorder. Training
      programs can help to improve the knowledge of teachers about ADHD.
