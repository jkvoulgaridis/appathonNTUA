  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a weight loss program (M3F) in
      maintaining long-term weight loss (at least 5% of initial body weight loss at 72 weeks),
      compared to a low carbohydrates diet (low-carb diet) in obese adult subjects.
