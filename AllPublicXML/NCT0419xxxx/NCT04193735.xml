    <textblock>
      This study will explore the potential for a standardized MRI scan after a liquid meal to be
      used in diagnosis of the rare but debilitating chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) have problems digesting their food
      properly, due to a problem in their gut nerves or muscle. There are not many good tests to
      assess how a patient's stomach and bowels are working. Finding out more is the first step in
      developing a standardized clinical test using MRI to provide a faster diagnosis than is
      currently possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans allow the investigators to see
      inside the abdomen. Scans are not painful or harmful and are therefore ideal for repeated
      measurements. By scanning participants both before and after a test drink the investigators
      can see exactly how their digestion is working.

      The investigators are inviting 16 people who are at least 16 years old, 8 who have CIPO and 8
      with chronic constipation, so the investigators can compare the images. Participants will
      come in for one half day of scanning. The investigators will take a total of 8 scans of their
      abdomens, every half hour. Participants will also fill in symptom questionnaires at every
      scan, for example if they feel bloated or have any abdominal pain. Each scan will take about
      15 minutes and will require short breath holds. Participants will be able to get out of the
      scanner at any time point if they feel the need to.

      Participants will arrive fasted in the morning and will receive a test drink (a milk-based
      drink used as an oral nutritional supplement) right after the first scan. All participants
      will be asked to pause some of their usual medication that has a direct influence on
      digestion for 24h before the scan day and during the ~4h of the study.

      The primary outcome is peak small bowel motility, which the investigators hypothesize to be
      less active in people with CIPO. Other outcomes include gastric volume, small bowel water
      content and distribution, peak gastric motility, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak small gut motility after a test liquid meal</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3.5 hours after meal, measured every half hour</time_frame>
    <description>Investigating whether people with CIPO have a lower peak small gut motility after a test drink than people who do not have CIPO. Small gut motility will be assessed with a standardised method on CineMRI, based on power spectrum analysis of voxel‐signal changes with time (the outcome will be reported in arbitrary units). The primary outcome is peak small gut motility since a delay in motility (linked to one specific time point) would not be sufficient to explain the difference between CIPO and controls.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric emptying rate (ml/min) after a test liquid meal</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3.5 hours after meal, measured every half hour</time_frame>
    <description>Investigating whether people with CIPO have slower gastric emptying after a test drink than people who do not have CIPO. The gastric emptying rate is determined by measuring the gastric volume every half hour after the standardised meal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Small bowel water volume (ml) after a test liquid meal</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3.5 hours after meal, measured every half hour</time_frame>
    <description>Investigating whether people with CIPO have a greater volume of small bowel water after a test drink than people who do not have CIPO. Small bowel water content is determined from a heavily T2-weighted scan. The intensity threshold for free water will be set using each participant's spinal fluid, and only small bowel contents having an intensity equal to or greater than this value will be measured as small bowel free water volume.</description>

    <description>Investigating whether people with CIPO have a reduced gastric motility after a test drink than people who do not have CIPO.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Sufficient level of English language to understand study information and respond to
             symptom questionnaires

          -  CASES: a clinical diagnosis of primary or secondary Chronic Intestinal
             Pseudo-Obstruction, excluding adhesional obstruction. PICs will be asked to send
             clinical documentation that the diagnosis has been confirmed on crosssectional
             imaging.

          -  CONTROLS: a Chronic constipation disorder diagnosed according to Rome IV criteria for
             functional constipation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or
             opioid-induced constipation (diagnostic criteria as listed in Lacy et al 2016)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to tolerate 400 ml liquid challenge meal (oral or through established
             gastrostomy; according to self-assessment)

          -  Contra-indication to MRI scanning, such as metal implants, pacemaker etc

          -  Pregnancy declared by candidate (no formal testing)

          -  Inability to stop short-acting medications likely to alter small bowel motility, such
             as antiemetics, fast release opioids, laxatives, and anti-diarrhoeals, on the day
             before the study (24h before baseline scan; i.e. a total of circa 30h) as well as
             antibiotics for three days before the study. This only applies to long-term
             antibiotics commonly given for dysbiosis (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). A
             short course of antibiotics given for acute infections will not be interrupted but the
             study day will be delayed until the course is finished. Patches, long acting
             formulations such as slow release medication or depot injection medication will be
             allowed to continue

          -  Inability to omit parenteral nutrition for 12 hours before the fasting MRI scan (~16h
             total)

          -  Medical comorbidity that means subject will not be able to undergo multiple scans e.g.
             severe respiratory disorder limiting time lying flat; severe musculoskeletal disorder
             limiting mobility

          -  Previous small bowel resection (excluding ileostomy, insertion of venting tube or
             percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, appendectomy or cholecystectomy). Patients who
             have had a colectomy for their CIPO will be eligible.

          -  Other gastrointestinal disorder likely to alter small bowel function e.g. uncontrolled
             coeliac disease, Crohn's disease. A diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
             will not be a reason for exclusion. PICs will be asked to supply information on
             resections and comorbidities for CIPO participants.
