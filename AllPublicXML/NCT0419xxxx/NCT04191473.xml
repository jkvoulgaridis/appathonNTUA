  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in
      women.There are about 14 million cases of colonoscopy in the United States every year. In
      recent years, the incidence of colorectal cancer in China has risen sharply, becoming a
      serious threat to people's health.For small(≤ 9mm) lesions, endoscopic biopsy forceps and
      cold snare polypectomy can be used to remove.For larger lesions, especially laterally
      spreading tumor,endoscopic mucosal resection is a classic method of treatment.With the
      increasing diameter of the lesion size(&gt; 20mm),we also need to adopt endoscopic piecemeal
      mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection.

      As IT, Hook knife, BB, and other devices appear constantly, foreign researchers recently
      adopted a variation of conventional EMR（CEMR）, namely endoscopic mucosal resection with
      circumferential precutting(EMR - P).The technology is superior to conventional EMR for 10 to
      20 mm polyps.Moreover, preliminary studies suggest that it has good safety and efficacy, and
      may be a better method for treatment of 10-20mm polyps under colonoscopy.

      This clinical trial is being conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of two methods of
      polypectomy, CEMR and EMR-P, for 10-20mm colorectal polyps.

    <description>After submucosal injection, we use ESD knife or the tip of the entrapment device to loop around the lesion, and then overlapped the loop tangent with the entrapment device. After tightening the entrapment device, all the tumor tissues were confirmed to enter the entrapment device, and the tissues were removed.</description>
