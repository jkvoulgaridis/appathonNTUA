  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this exploratory research project are to customize, deploy and evaluate the
      preliminary efficacy of a socially assistive robot as a novel approach to motivate and
      encourage optimal, long-term use of new magnification devices for reading in individuals with
      vision loss. The goals are to promote patient acceptance, adherence and skills reinforcement
      to achieve proficiency in the use of the magnifier, in order to attempt to reduce visual
      disability while performing important daily activities, such as reading tasks. This is a high
      priority given the increasing prevalence of low vision, paucity of low vision rehabilitation
      providers, and barriers related to access to care, such as transportation and geography, all
      of which motivate the development of this complementary approach for the provision of
      additional support at home by the socially assistive robot.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with any level of vision loss due to any ocular disease,

          -  age 18 and older,

          -  received a magnification device(s) (i.e., hand-held optical magnifiers, portable
             electronic video magnifiers, some stand magnifiers and CCTVs) from the UCLA Vision
             Rehabilitation Center.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  schedules not permitting participation in planned study sessions or visits (including
             planning to move or take extended vacation during study period),

          -  inability to understand study procedures or communicate responses to visual stimuli in
             a consistent manner (cognitive impairment as per TICS),

          -  substance abuse,

          -  significant hearing loss (unable to hear communication by phone or from robot),

          -  significant medical condition likely to limit participation or lifespan,

          -  their magnifier device has features that would not work in conjunction with the beacon
             sensors: (1) hands-free and do not have a place where the patient's hand is holding
             the device during use (therefore, they would not register a significant change in
             temperature), and/or (2) no surface area of at least 1&quot;x1&quot; to which the beacon sensor
             could be attached without interfering with the device.
