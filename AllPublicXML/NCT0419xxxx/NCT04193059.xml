  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single center, phase III clinical trial comparing the efficacy
      and safety of four cycles of epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide followed by four
      cycles of docetaxel (EC*4-T*4) verses 6 cycles of weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin
      (PCb*6) in the adjuvant chemotherapy of non-triple negative breast cancer patients. The study
      is divided in to 2 branches: PANSY-1 and PANSY-2. PANSY-1 is a study of hormone receptor
      (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative patients with ≥4
      positive lymph node, while PANSY-2 is a study of HER2-positive patients with ≥1 positive
      lymph node.

      PANSY-1 will be comparing the efficacy and safety of four cycles of epirubicin combined with
      cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel (EC-T) verses six cycles of paclitaxel
      combined with carboplatin (PCb).

      PANSY-2 will be comparing the efficacy and safety of four cycles of epirubicin combined with
      cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel with trastuzumab (EC-TH) verses six
      cycles of paclitaxel combined with carboplatin and trastuzumab (PCbH); both followed by 1
      year adjuvant trastuzumab.

      After pertuzumab became legally available in China, participants of PANSY-2 may choose to
      receive trastuzumab and pertuzumab dual targeted therapy, thus comparing the efficacy and
      safety of four cycles of epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of
      docetaxel with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (EC-THP) verses six cycles of paclitaxel combined
      with carboplatin, trastuzumab and pertuzumab (PCbHP); both followed by 1 year adjuvant
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

      With the inclusion of pertuzumab in China's medical insurance in January 2020, study
      protocols were revised to include dual targeted therapy for HER2-positive participants.
