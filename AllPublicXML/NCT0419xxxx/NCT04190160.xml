  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work is aimed at improving the quality of life of older patients affected by type 2
      diabetes. The investigators will try to amiliorate the complexity of hypogliceamic treatment
      in a little group of older patients with type 2 diabetes reducing the number of pills and/or
      insulin administration using a single daily dose of a fixed combination of insulin degludec
      and liraglutide. This therapeutic semplification will be done indipendently of pre-existent
      glicaemic control.

    <textblock>
      Older patients with type 2 diabetes often have numerous coexisting medical problems for which
      these subjets prescribed multiple medications. Actually, diabetes, hyertension,
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), digestive and respiratory
      disorders are common in aged peolple and tend to coexist. Unfortunally, the complex therapy
      of these diseases increases the risk of adverse drug events. Furthermore, there is marked
      heterogeneity in health status and functional capacity in older diabetic subjects, often
      making prescribing decisions complex and challenging. On the other hand, despite of the use
      of many medicines, undertreatment is also frequent present in the elderly and the probability
      of underprescription increased significantly with the number of medicines.Both conditions
      have a detrimental effect on quality of life (QoL) of elderly subjects increasing the risk of
      disability and death. Therefore, older people should benefit greatly of a simplification of
      drug regimens and reduction of pill burdens as well as better explanations of the reason for
      the prescriptions. The combination of insulin degludec (100 units/mL) and liraglutide (3.6
      mg/mL), termed IDegLira, was approved in 2014 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
      inadequately controlled with oral glucose-lowering agents alone or in combination with a
      GLP-1 receptor agonist or basal insulin (European indication). Interestingly, RCTs and
      real-world evidence provided insights into effectiveness and safety in routine clinical
      practice. However, beyond its known metabolic efficacy IDegLira has a very small
      hypoglicaemic rate, with a single daily and flexible administration dose and a very good
      safety profile that makes it suitable for fragile diabetic old patients.
