  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is an emergency medical condition that is prevalent in military
      soldiers, athletes, and laborers. It is diagnosed when the rectal temperature is above 40°C
      with the presence of central nervous dysfunction (altered mental status). The gold standard
      method of care for EHS is immediate onsite whole body cooling using cold-water immersion
      (cooling rates &gt;0.15°C•min-1), which is reported to have the highest cooling rate. In the
      treatment of EHS, selecting a cooling modality with a high cooling rate becomes crucial to
      minimize the time above the critical threshold of body temperature at 40°C to less than 30
      minutes for the best chance of survival and to minimize the severity of prognosis. However,
      in situations where cold water immersion is not feasible (in certain military, firefighter,
      or other remote settings), other cooling modalities must be available that have a cooling
      capacity similar to that of cold-water immersion. In this proposed study, we aim to compare
      the cooling rates of the Polar Breeze® (developed by Polar Breeze ®, Clearwater, FL),
      cold-water immersion (the current gold standard for EHS treatment), and passive cooling in
      individuals with exercise-induced hyperthermia

    <description>Participants, following exercise-induced hyperthermia, will be cooled using a Thermal Rehab Machine (Polar Breeze, Statim Technologies, LLC, Clearwater Florida), which is a micro-environmental air chiller. The device will be placed over the subjects head and through trans pulmonary cooling, will cool the body.</description>
