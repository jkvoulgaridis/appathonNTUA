  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to reduce the psychological distress of women with high-risk
      pregnancy. Women who express interest and are eligible will have the opportunity to
      participate in a 7-day acceptance therapy. This therapy is based on the theory that attempts
      to control internal states, thoughts and feelings can contribute to symptoms of depression,
      anxiety and/or stress. This study aims to educate women about how the willingness to
      experience uncomfortable pregnancy-related sensations and thoughts, rather than fighting
      them, can provide relief. The therapy is completed virtually, with the first therapy session
      done over video call with the therapist. Following, participants complete the remaining six
      days of therapy on their own using a work book. All women participating in the study will be
      asked to complete a series of self-report questionnaires before, during, and immediately
      following treatment, as well as twice postpartum. Participants will receive up to $60 and a
      work book for participation.

    <description>The intervention is a 7-day self-guided acceptance-based intervention using a published Acceptance and Commitment Therapy self-help work book. This therapy is based on the theory that rigid attempts to control internal states, thoughts and feelings, and other forms of experiential avoidance contribute to symptom development and maintenance of depression, anxiety and/or stress. The therapy includes two components: (a) educating patients about the exacerbation of stress and negative affect through rigid attempts at experiential avoidance, and (b) introducing acceptance and the willingness to experience pregnancy-related sensations and cognitions as an alternative to experiential control, through the practice of intentional and non-judgmental paying attention to one's thoughts, feelings, images and bodily sensations (including aversive symptoms) and learning to see thoughts as an ongoing process distinct from self rather than merely an event with literal meaning.</description>
