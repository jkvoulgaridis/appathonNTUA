  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center prospective study to elucidate whether extended robot-assisted right
      colectomy (e-RARC) performs as well as extended open right colectomy (e-ORC) in terms of
      specimen quality, and in addition, whether less postoperative morbidity and shorter length of
      stay (LOS) can be attained. Patients with colonic cancer near the right flexure or the oral
      part of the transverse colon will be compared excluding the most technically demanding and
      frail patients in both groups. A total of 40 patients undergoing e-RARC in a prospective
      series will be included and compared with 44 consecutive patients previously treated with
      e-ORC.

    <textblock>
      Complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation (CME) is an improvement of
      surgical technique in the operation for colonic cancer suggested to increase long-term
      survival. The concept was originally developed for open surgery by W. Hohenberger in Erlangen
      with excellent survival rates. However, if the tumor is located in the transverse colon or
      near the right colonic flexure, the procedure is particularly technically demanding, and for
      that reason most surgeons still prefer to do it by open operation (laparotomy) instead of the
      minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy) presently recommended for colonic cancer surgery.
      The advent of robotic surgery has improved the dexterity of instruments used in laparoscopic
      surgery and pushed the limits of what is possible with a minimally invasive approach. Since
      minimally invasive surgery is associated with better outcomes in terms of postoperative
      morbidity, pain, length of stay etc., it would be highly desirable if CME surgery could be
      done by robot-assisted laparoscopic operation instead of the current open approach. The
      current single-center study is proposed to elucidate whether extended robot-assisted right
      colectomy (e-RARC) performs as well as extended open right colectomy (e-ORC) in terms of
      specimen quality, and in addition, whether less postoperative morbidity and shorter length of
      stay (LOS) can be attained. Patients with colonic cancer near the right flexure or the oral
      part of the transverse colon will be compared excluding the most technically demanding and
      frail patients in both groups. A total of 40 patients undergoing e-RARC in a prospective
      series will be included and compared with 44 consecutive patients previously treated with
      e-ORC.
