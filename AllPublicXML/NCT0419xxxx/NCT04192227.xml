  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effect of two different types of group
      wellness interventions for partner caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury
      (TBI). The study is designed to evaluate how well these treatments can help TBI partner
      caregivers improve approach/avoidance behaviors.

    <textblock>
      A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
      two different types of group wellness interventions for partner caregivers of individuals
      with traumatic brain injury (TBI). 92 participants will be recruited. Participants are
      randomly assigned to one of two wellness groups. Each group will involve six weekly 75-minute
      live video conference sessions as well as independent homework assignments that will be
      discussed in closed social media forums with peers and facilitators. Participants will
      complete self-report measures (approach and avoidance, anxiety, depression, caregiver
      appraisal, resilience, self efficacy, social integration, quality of life.) prior to
      intervention participation, within a week of class 6, and at 3-months post-intervention..
      Intervention effectiveness will be determined by improvements between baseline and follow-up
      on a self-report measure of approach/avoidance behaviors.
