  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the synergistic effects of daily consumption of food
      products fortified with bioactive components (fibres, polyphenols, omega-3, Slow Digestible
      Starch) for 9 weeks, compared to the daily intake of standard food products on low-grade
      inflammation in cardiometabolic risk subject.

      The inflammatory parameters will be assessed in fasting and in postprandial period after the
      consumption of a hyper-carbohydrate and hyper-lipidic test meal called Flexmeal. A metabolic
      stress will be induced by a fructose ingestion challenge during the last 6 days of
      interventional period.
