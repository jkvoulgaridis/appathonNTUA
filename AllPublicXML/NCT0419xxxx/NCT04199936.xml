  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients lose a significant amount of muscle following major abdominal surgery. This is
      partly due to a catabolic response to the surgical insult and inflammation, but is also
      probably due to a lack of muscle use secondary to immobility.

      This study will aim to assess whether some or even all of postoperative muscle loss in the
      upper leg muscle group is preventable through electrical muscle stimulation to mimic physical
      activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following major gastrointestinal surgery patients may loose around 6 % of their skeletal
      muscle mass in the first 5 days. Whilst some of this loss is as a result of inflammation and
      starvation, some is due to muscle disuse.

      Studies have shown that patients spend 96% of their time being sedentary in the first 5 days
      following major abdominal surgery and by day 5 are still taking a median of less than 500
      steps per day. Studies of healthy volunteers who undergo similar muscle disuse loose
      approximately 3.5% of skeletal muscle mass over the same time period, indicating that around
      half of postoperative muscle loss may be due to immobility.

      Through the use of electrical muscle stimulation, this study will aim to mimic high levels of
      exercise in the quadriceps of patients who have undergo major gastrointestinal surgery to see
      whether this reduces or prevents muscle loss. Patients muscles will be measured using
      ultrasound and DXA and neuromuscular function will be measured using electromyography.
