  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB/II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR6390 in
      combination with Letrozole or Anastrozole or Fulvestrant. Patients who have HR positive and
      HER2 negative recurrent/metastatic breast cancer and have not received systemic anticancer
      therapy are eligible for study.
