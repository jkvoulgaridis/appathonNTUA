  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to collect preliminary data related to the clinical utility of the
      SPEAC System in patients with a history of motor seizures. This trial is primarily an
      observational investigation. This protocol describes a series of observational case studies.
      Each case study is intended to be interpreted independent from the other case studies.
      Self-reported seizure frequency will be compared to observed seizure frequency using the
      SPEAC System.

    <description>A lightweight, non-invasive monitor that is placed on the belly of the biceps muscles to analyze surface electromyography (sEMG) signals that may be associated with generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. It provides an alarm to alert caregivers of unilateral, appendicular, tonic extension that could be associated with a GTC seizure. The System records and stores sEMG data for subsequent review by a trained healthcare professional.</description>
