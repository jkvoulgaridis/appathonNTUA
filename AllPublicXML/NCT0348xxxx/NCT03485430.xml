  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study compares tapering of long-term opioid therapy in a
      population with chronic non-cancer pain with control group constituted of waiting list. Half
      of participants receives intervention at baseline and the other half are controls but
      receives intervention after 4 months. Ethical approval to follow up excluded participants
      denying tapering at baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic non-cancer pain is a major problem in society and a common cause to seek health care.
      The suffering is complex as it, besides pain, often includes psychological symptoms and may
      decrease the ability to participate in work life. Pharmacological treatments have limited
      possibilities to ease suffering. Opioids used in this population have evidence to ease pain
      and to some extent increase physical ability when used in limited treatment periods and in
      selected patients. Medium to long-term opioid therapy, extended beyond three months, lack
      evidence of easing pain or increase physical ability.

      The current study is conducted on a specialized pain care unit (Skane University Hospital;
      Lund) and aims at taper long-term opioid therapy with support from physician and nurse and
      study the effects of tapering.

      Method: Randomized controlled study, without concealment. Waiting-list constitutes the
      control-group. Intervention means tapering with a motivated patient. Follow up at four and
      twelve months.

      Primary end-point: collected opioid prescriptions registered in The National Board of Health
      and Welfare registry expressed in milligram of morphine equivalent.

      Secondary end-point: Data will be retrieved from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain
      Rehabilitation. The database contains participants' self-report of variables measuring the
      impact of rehabilitation on depressive symptoms, anxiety, rating of pain and acceptance to
      pain. Assessments are made prior to, at the end of and one year after discharge of the
      rehabilitation program.

      As denying tapering or participation is shown to be as common as decision to taper drugs at
      baseline an extended ethical approval was acquired also retrospective. This approval covers
      obtaining collected prescribed medication and prescribed opioid replacement therapy
      (Buprenorphine or Methadone) after one year. The study may describe the excluded population
      better this way.

    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>NPRS was used to capture the patient's level of pain intensity. Patients rate their average level of pain the last week. The 11-point scale spans from the left with the phrase &quot;no pain&quot; i.e. 0 and on the right to the phrase &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; i.e. 10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HADS was constructed for patients in medical settings. It entails 14-item measures of anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) symptoms over the course of a week. Items are rated on a four-point scale (0 = not all; 3 = very often) and the anxiety and depression subscales range from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TSK employs a 4-point Likert scale, with scoring options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) and encompasses 17 items related to pain, fear of movement and re-injury. The total score of the original 17-item version ranges between 17 and 68, with a higher score indicating a higher degree of Kinesiophobia.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS comprises 13 items that are rated from 0 to 4 with the endpoints 0 (&quot;Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;All the time&quot;) and was constructed to assess pain‚Äêrelated catastrophizing (48). Catastrophizing include three factors: (a) Helplessness i.e. perceived helplessness in situations when pain is present (six items); (b) Rumination, concerning vigilance toward the pain experience (four items) ; and (c) Magnification i.e. the tendency to magnify the threat value of pain (three items). The total score ranges from 0-52 points with a higher score indicating a higher degree of catastrophizing.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain acceptance measures two main classes of behaviors represented by respective subscales: Activity Engagement (score range: 0-24), and Pain Willingness (inverted score range: 0-24). The items are rated from 0 (never true) to 6 (always true) and higher values indicate higher acceptance to chronic pain.</description>

    <measure>Perceptions of health</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>RAND-36 is a modern translation of SF-36. RAND-36 encompasses questions from eight domains (subscales) i.e. physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE) and mental health (MH). The scores are subsequently transformed in a standardized way into a 0-100 scale where higher scores indicate better health.</description>
