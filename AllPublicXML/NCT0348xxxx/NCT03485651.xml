  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to enroll participants who present with an adnexal mass on
      imaging to develop a non-invasive ovarian cancer assay to distinguish between malignant and
      benign masses. The study will collect blood, tissue, and health information from these
      individuals.
