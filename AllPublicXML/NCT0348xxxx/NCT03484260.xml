  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate if testosterone is preferentially given to patients at higher risk of
      cardiovascular events. If this is the case, then observational studies may be prone to
      selection bias resulting in overestimation of the cardiovascular risk associated with
      testosterone when compared to a healthier population not taking testosterone

        The source population is the subset of male patients in the Clinical Practice Research
        Datalink (CPRD) that has been linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database
        (CPRD-HES).

        Cases will be defined by first testosterone use between 1st January 2001 and 31st March
        2016 (study period). The date of the GP consultation associated with the first testosterone
        prescription will be designated as the index day. All cases will be required to be over 18
        years on the index day, to have contributed for at least 2 years to the CPRD-HES link and
        to have no history of testosterone before the index day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - All male individuals in the source population with a first testosterone use during the
        study period will be included as cases. The date of the GP consultation associated with the
        first testosterone prescription will be designated as the index day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Patients of less than 18 years on the index day, with less than 2-year contribution to
        the CPRD-HES link before the index day, or with use of testosterone before the study period
        will be excluded from the group of cases.
