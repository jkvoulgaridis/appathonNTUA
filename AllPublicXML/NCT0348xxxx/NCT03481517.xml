  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is one of the most common acute abdomens that need surgical intervention.
      Laparoscopic surgery much decreases postoperative pain of wound, however, pain remains an
      important determinant of recovery after surgery. Intraoperative local anesthetic agent
      infiltrated locally into surgical wound to relieve postoperative pain is a feasible and safe
      method suggested in some literature. However, there is no routine use of this method in
      clinical practice because its benefit is still unknown. Besides, very few evidence could be
      found in literature review. To date, there is still no double blinded, prospective,
      randomized control trial addressing in evaluation of its interest. In this study, the
      investigators aim at investigating the benefit of wound infiltration with local anesthetic
      agent (bupivacaine) for laparoscopic appendectomy in adult. The study design is a double
      blind, prospective, randomized control trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Fifty adult
      patients with appendicitis will be included. The control group undergo laparoscopic
      appendectomy without wound infiltration with local anesthetic agent, the intervention group
      undergo laparoscopic appendectomy with wound infiltration with local anesthetic agent
      intraoperatively. The clinical characteristics, outcomes, and patient's satisfaction will be
      recorded and analyzed. The investigators hope this study can provide a high level evidence in
      pain management of patient undergo laparoscopic surgery.
