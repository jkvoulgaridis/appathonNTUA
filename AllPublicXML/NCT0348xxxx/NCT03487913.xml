    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, parallel-group, multiple dose study designed to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of lixivaptan
      in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease subjects with chronic kidney disease in
      stages CKD1, CKD2 or CKD3.

    <textblock>
      Therapeutic interventions aimed at counterbalancing the effect of vasopressin and/or
      normalizing intracellular levels of cAMP may be effective in delaying disease progression in
      autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

      The primary objectives of this study in subjects with ADPKD are:

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of lixivaptan following multiple doses in
           ADPKD subjects with relatively preserved kidney function (chronic kidney disease CKD1
           and CKD2) and moderately impaired renal function (CKD3).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To characterize the PK profile of lixivaptan and its major metabolites following
           multiple doses of lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects with relatively preserved kidney function
           (CKD1 and CKD2) and moderately impaired renal function (CKD3).

        -  To characterize the pharmacodynamic effect of lixivaptan on urine output, urine
           osmolality, total kidney volume, serum vasopressin, and serum creatinine following
           multiple doses of lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects with relatively preserved kidney function
           (CKD1 and CKD2) and moderately impaired renal function (CKD3).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, between 18 and 65 years of age at the time of screening

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) â‰¥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 with eGFR calculated
             by the CKD EPI equation

          -  Diagnosed with ADPKD by modified Ravine criteria

          -  Considered by Investigator to be in good health relative to underlying CKD status and
             clinically stable with respect to underlying CKD

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known sensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to lixivaptan, its related compounds such
             as benzazepines (e.g., tolvaptan, conivaptan, benazepril, fenoldopam, or mirtazapine),
             or any compound listed as being present in the study formulation

          -  Subjects have taken tolvaptan, oral or intravenous antibiotics, or any investigational
             drug or used an investigational device within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer, prior to first study dose

          -  Subject has a transplanted kidney, or absence of a kidney

          -  Subjects with clinically significant incontinence, overactive bladder, or urinary
             retention (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia)

          -  Subjects with clinically significant liver disease, or clinically significant liver
             function abnormalities or serology other than that expected for ADPKD with cystic
             liver disease at baseline
