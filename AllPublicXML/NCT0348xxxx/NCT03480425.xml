    <textblock>
      A study of a new approach to determining if, following endotracheal intubation, the
      endotracheal tube (ETT) is in the trachea or the esophagus. The test for correct placement
      consists of inflating the cuff to a pressure of 50 (to be determined by the study) and
      tugging the ETT gently up and out of the mouth. The investigators hypothesize that if it is
      in the esophagus, it will slide easily all the way out; if in the trachea, the cuff will be
      impeded by catching on the lower surface of the cricoid ring, and that this will require a
      greater force to extubate with cuff inflated than that required for the esophagus.

      Correct endotracheal tube (ETT) placement is important. Ideal ETT position is achieved when
      the distal tip is in mid-trachea with the head in neutral alignment. Unrecognized tube
      misplacement is an uncommon but significant cause of hypoxemia and death during general
      anesthesia and emergency intubation of critically ill patients. It is commoner in
      out-of-hospital intubations, where it is reported to occur in 1 to 15% of cases, often with
      disastrous results. 1, 2 Three types of malpositioning can occur: one outside the trachea
      (esophageal), and two within the trachea: too shallow (hypopharyngeal), or too deep
      (endobronchial). Esophageal intubation results in rapid hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and inflation
      of the stomach as the patient receives no ventilation at all. 3 Too-shallow placement of the
      ETT can result in inadvertent extubation, especially with manipulation of head and neck. 4
      Endobronchial intubation occurs when the ETT is advanced into a mainstem bronchus, which
      results in hypoxia and the potential for barotrauma in the hyperventilated lung. 5, 6
      Confirmation of correct ETT depth is currently performed by several methods. In the operating
      room, simple measurement of the length of the tube at the corner of the mouth is rapid but
      not reliable. One study improved on this by using additional anatomical landmarks to
      determine ETT tube length as measured at the mouth.7 It enabled a reduction in the incidence
      of too-deep placement of the ETT from 58.8% to 24%.

      Cuff ballottement at the level of the suprasternal notch is a technique that has been studied
      with cuffed tubes in adults. Ballottement as described in these papers involves moving the
      fingers in a direction normal to the long axis of the ETT in order to alternately compress
      and release the finger pressure on the cuff, while feeling and watching the corresponding
      movement of the pilot balloon. Ease of palpation of ballottement was inconsistent, and in one
      study 15 of 82 patients had ETT tips &lt;2.5 cm above the carina. 8-10 Studies to date of
      ballottement do not comment on its ability to prevent esophageal intubation. Ultrasound
      guided intubation has been shown to provide correct placement, but requires training and
      machine availability. 11-14 We proposed to refine methods of palpating the trachea that we
      studied in previous experiments. We found that palpation of the anterior trachea with the
      fingertips during intubation enabled us to feel the tip of the endotracheal tube sliding into
      the trachea and improve correct depth compared to measurement at the teeth. 15 That study was
      undertaken to determine whether palpation of the trachea could enable correct position of the
      endotracheal tube with respect to depth. Esophageal intubation was studied subsequently, but
      the study was stopped when it became clear that we could not determine esophageal intubation
      by anterior tracheal palpation (unpublished).

      However, during two instances of inadvertent esophageal intubation, we accidentally
      discovered a technique that may be able to detect inadvertent esophageal intubation as well
      as ensure correct endotracheal tube depth. Following tracheal intubation, with the cuff
      inflated to 50cm water pressure in the trachea, there was a sudden marked increase in the
      force necessary to gently tug the endotracheal tube proximally as the inflated cuff impinges
      on the rigid, encircling cricoid cartilage. When the increased force is sensed, then pushing
      the ETT down 2cm will ensure it is correctly positioned. If the cuff is in the esophagus, it
      will slide out without the sudden increased force being felt.

      We plan a clinical pilot study of intubation of esophagus versus trachea with initial
      intubation of the esophagus flowed by intubation of the trachea.

      Hypotheses. The force required for esophageal extubation with cuff inflated will be that
      required for tracheal extubation.

      Primary outcome. To assess the reliability and accuracy of TETT as a method to determine
      tracheal versus esophageal intubation by measuring the force needed to slowly pull the ETT
      from the esophagus versus from the trachea.

      Secondary outcomes. To find the optimal cuff-inflation pressure to distinguish trachea from
      esophagus and to assess the reliability and accuracy of TETT as a method to determine depth
      of endotracheal tube in the trachea.

      Experimental design. A clinical trial with an objective measure of the difference in force of
      tugging between esophagus and trachea.

      Patient safety. Intentional esophageal intubation has been reported in three previous airway
      studies with no harm coming to 275 patients. 16-18 Intentional intubation of the esophagus
      has been practiced routinely for gastroscopy in millions of patients. Mortality attributable
      to esophageal endoscopy is exceedingly low (0.005-0.01%), includes very sick patients, and
      occurs only with interventions such as biopsy and cautery of esophageal varices.19 In a
      prospective study of resident trainees performing upper G.I. endoscopy (N = 4,490), there
      were no complications attributable to insertion of the gastroscope in the upper third of the
      esophagus.20 The manoeuvre takes only about 10 seconds, then the opposite orifice can be
      intubated, with mask oxygenation between intubations if indicated. In a just-completed study
      of moving and ETT upward in the trachea with the cuff inflated to 50cm H2O pressure we found
      no increase in sore throat as a surrogate for tracheal damage in patients who had the ETT
      moved with cuff inflated compared to standard care (manuscript in preparation). 21 A recent
      study conducted at University of Saskatchewan showed that there is great variance in cuff
      inflation pressures clinically (manuscript in preparation), with pressures often exceeding
      120 cm H2O pressure with no apparent adverse effects for inflation during surgery.

      Clinical Utility. If this technique proves reliable, it can decrease the risk of ETT
      misplacement. Further, if it is reliable, it is particularly useful because it takes no
      special equipment, can be performed in less than 10 seconds anywhere from operating room to
      battlefield, and may make xray confirmation of ETT depth unnecessary, avoiding radiation and
      expense.

      Methods

      Participants:

        1. Patients: Following University of Saskatchewan Research Ethics Board and Saskatoon
           Health Region approval, informed consent will be obtained from 20 patient participants.
           The collection, use and disclosure of patients' private information will conform to the
           Health Information Protection Act (HIPA). A convenience sample of American Society of
           Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class I and II patients â‰¥18 years, undergoing elective surgical
           procedures in the Saskatoon acute care hospitals of the Saskatoon Health Region and
           requiring endotracheal intubation as a component of the anesthetic plan, will be
           recruited. 22 Recruitment will take place in the Pre-Admission Clinic (PAC); in the Same
           Day Surgery and Day Surgery admission areas; and in the Operating Room (OR) Holding
           Area. Excluded patients will be those who are physiologically unstable, if there is
           urgency to proceed with surgery, patients requiring rapid sequence induction, and those
           with respiratory distress. The anesthesiologists will be encouraged to exclude patients
           if for any reason they feel that inclusion puts them at risk.

        2. Testers: we will recruit and explain the manoeuvre to willing anesthesia staff,
           residents, and anesthesia assistants.

      Interventions: Intubation will be by the attending anesthesiologist, who will choose the
      intubating anesthetic and equipment on clinical grounds. The anesthesiologists will intubate
      the esophagus first, and inflate the ETT cuff to their customary pressure, which we will then
      measure. An apparatus including a force transducer (LoadStar F-152217557 S-beam sensor run on
      LoadVue software; Loadstar Sensors Ltd., Fremont CA, USA) will be attached to the ETT
      connector and the testers will perform the gentle tugging while recording the force of pull
      until the ETT comes out of the esophagus. The process will be repeated with the trachea. At
      this point the anesthesiologist will intubate the trachea and proceed with surgical
      anesthesia. Only one set of intubations will be tested on any participant.

      Measurements: Data will be recorded on paper data sheets for later transcription to a
      computer spread sheet for analysis. Usual demographics (age, gender, height, weight, type of
      surgery) will be recorded. Force transducer data will be digitally recorded on a computer for
      later analysis.

      Sample size. Assuming that the anesthesiologist is able to intubate the esophagus
      successfully 100% of the time in this population, and the palpation technique is able to
      detect the esophageal intubation correctly only 50% of the time, we will need 15 participants
      assuming an alpha value of 0.05 and a beta value of 0.2 with Yates correction. Therefore,
      accounting for unforeseen exigencies, we will plan to recruit 20 participants.

      Statistical Analysis: Demographics will be reported. Forces will be compared with paired
      t-tests.

      Table 1. Diagnosis of esophageal intubation. Test â†“ Truth â†’ T E totals T E totals

      We will plot and subtract the force change from esophagus from the force change from trachea
      at the various pressures and construct a receiver operating curve to show the optimal cuff
      inflation pressure.

          <title>Esophageal Then Tracheal Intubated Patient</title>
          <description>Esophagus is intentionally intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube, the cuff inflated to &gt;30cm water pressure, a force transducer attached, and force of extubation recorded. Then Trachea is intentionally intubated the cuff inflated to &gt;30cm water pressure, and force of extubation recorded.
Measuring extubation force: Intubation of the esophagus of anesthetized participants who are having planned endotracheal intubate for surgery; inflation of the cuff; attachment of a force transducer to the tube connector; and gently tugging the tube out of the mouth. Then intubating the esophagus and repeating the tugging procedure. Meanwhile, the force of resistance to tugging is measured with a force transducer.</description>
