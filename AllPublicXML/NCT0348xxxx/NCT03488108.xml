  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this proposal is to conduct a study that assesses the safety,
      feasibility and efficacy of using PRP to treat this type of hair loss.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is a common, progressive hair loss disorder affecting both sexes
      with significant negative impact on social and psychological well-being. The frequency and
      severity increases with age, and up to 80% of men, and 50% of women are affected by AGA over
      the course of their lives. While men are more frequently affected, the psychological impact
      is likely to be high for women where the social impact of hair loss is often devastating.
      Current medical therapies specifically approved by the US FDA are limited to minoxidil (for
      men and women) and finasteride (for men only) (Varothai), but variable responses and the need
      for indefinite use often result in patient fatigue and suboptimal compliance. Recently, there
      has been interest in treatments orientated to more biologically regenerative therapies, and
      consequently there have been numerous studies that have demonstrated successful use for
      platelet rich plasma (PRP) in treating AGA. PRP contains concentrated platelet cells derived
      from autologous whole blood that are believed to activate a cascade of growth factors when
      injected into an area of poor hair growth that stimulates hair growth. In this proposal we
      will examine whether PRP therapy provides similar or better hair growing capacity in women
      compared to the conventional topical application minoxidil.
