    <textblock>
      A study on warfarin administration to show whether noncompliance of the patient will affect
      our target (INR) during therapy or not beside its drug and dietary interactions.

      The study will show the prevalence of sub optimal anti coagulation among patients with
      prosthetic cardiac valves that will undergo warfarin therapy.

      Besides the risk of infective endocarditis, thromboembolism from the foreign body structures
      of the prosthesis remains a major problem, which can be effectively reduced, but not
      inhibited by the use of oral anticoagulants in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves.

      Warfarin as a vitamin k antagonist is widely used to decrease risk of thromboembolism but
      need strict monitoring for INR to avoid warfarin failure or hemorrhage.

      It acts through inhibiting an enzyme called the vitamin K1 2,3 epoxide reductase complex,
      subunit1 (VKORC1).

      All patients with mechanical heart valves need the oral anticoagulation to keep the INR
      between 2.5:3.5 according to valve type, position and other comorbid conditions.

      However some patients need higher than expected doses of warfarin to get their (INR) into the
      target therapeutic range.

      Resistance to warfarin has been described as the inability to prolong the prothrombin time or
      raise the international normalized ratio (INR) into the therapeutic range when the drug is
      given at normally prescribed doses.

      Resistance is different than warfarin failure ,which is defined as a new thrombotic event
      despite a therapeutic prothrombin time and INR .

      The causes of warfarin resistance can be either acquired from high consumption of vitamin K
      or C ,decreased absorption or increased clearance of the drug ,dietary or drug interactions
      or hereditary by genetic factors that result either in faster metabolism of the drug (a form
      of pharmacokinetic resistance) or in lower activity of the drug (pharmacodynamic resistance).

    <description>Warfarin therapy is needed in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves to obtain the target INR from 2.5-3.5 .
If some patients with prosthetic cardiac valves have sub optimal anti coagulation with INR less than 2.5 with maximal doses of warfarin the research will measure their prevalence in all patients with prosthetic cardiac valves on warfarin therapy and their will be questionnaire for some causes of sub optimal anti coagulation in those patients.
The research will fulfill the following questionnaire :
Does the patient compliance play a role in warfarin therapeutic outcome? Does changing the time of warfarin administration during the day affect its therapeutic outcome? Does administration of other medication with warfarin including contraception affect its therapeutic outcome? Does dietary habits of certain foods during warfarin administration affect its therapeutic outcome?</description>
