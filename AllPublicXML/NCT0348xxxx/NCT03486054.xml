  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogen reduction (PR) system for Whole Blood (WB) using Amustaline (S-303) and
      Glutathione (GSH) has a potential to decrease transfusion-transmitted infection. There is
      scientific basis to hypothesize, that cells containing DNA and RNA such as bacteria, viruses
      and parasites that could be present in blood collected from asymptomatic infected donors are
      inactivated in the treated whole blood and therefore reduce the risk of
      transfusion-transmitted infections. The aim of the study is to gather data to support the
      safety of whole blood products that underwent treatment with amustaline and glutathione and
      data to support a larger sufficiently powered efficacy study. This study will evaluate the
      safety of the system for whole blood in adult patients with anemia.

      This study is designed as a randomized, controlled, open-label study. The aim is to explore
      the safety of the whole blood product treated with a PR system using amustaline and
      glutathione.

      The study will enroll 20 patients with anemia. 20 patients will be randomized either to
      treated WB (Test) or Standard of Care, either Red Blood Cells or Whole Blood (Control).

      Screening:

      All potentially eligible patients at the participating institution will be approached for
      study consent prior to study transfusion. Enrolled patients will be asked for consent to the
      storage of their samples for a future project in TTI Project. Illiterate patients can be
      consented by an impartial witness.

      Patients who consent to the study will be assigned a study ID number and undergo screening.

      Screening data collection and procedures will include: Demographics (age, sex), vital signs,
      height, weight, indication for anticipated transfusion, medical history including history of
      bleeding and transfusion and concomitant medications. A physical examination, including skin
      inspection, will be performed. Blood samples will be drawn for a hematological panel
      (including complete blood count, blood chemistry, blood type, coagulation (aPTT, PT and/or
      INR) and pregnancy test (if applicable). Immunohematology tests will be performed in a
      patient's sample at the blood transfusion center. This includes the Direct Antibody Test
      (DAT), immune reactivity to RBCs that have been processed with the INTERCEPT Blood System
      (IBS RBC), red cell alloantibody screen (Indirect Antibody Test (IAT) / Indirect Coombs).

      Blood samples (pre/post-treatment) for future research on transfusion-transmitted infections
      will be archived in a biobank of the Institut Pasteur de Côte d'Ivoire (IPCI)

      Randomization:

      After successful screening, eligible patients will be assigned to a treatment arm by
      randomization. Randomization will be performed in the blood center by sequentially selecting
      a randomization envelope starting with the lowest number (e.g., 1 for the first eligible
      subject in ascending order up to envelope number 20 for the 20th subject).

      The ratio of patients assigned to the Test and Control group will be 1:1. Each subject will
      receive a Test product or SOC. The assigned blood product number must be noted on the
      randomization assignment envelope and on the release form. The product number will also be
      entered into the case report form (CRF).

      The replacement strategy in this Phase I clinical trial is based on the aim to reach twenty
      evaluable patients (&quot;evaluable patients&quot; is defined as those patients who are randomized and
      receive any study transfusion).

      If a randomized subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the study prior to the administration
      of any study transfusion, or does not receive any study transfusion through 7-days
      post-randomization, this subject will be replaced by the next eligible subject using the same
      randomization envelope. If a randomized subject receives a conventional (untreated) blood
      transfusion prior to study transfusion, the patient will be replaced as described above.

      All patients who received at least one study product will be included into the analysis of
      evaluable patients and followed up to the final study visit on Day 58.

      All used and unused randomization envelopes will be kept in the Site File for reconciliation.

      Pre-transfusion visit:

      Vital signs, height, weight, hemoglobin will be assessed and urine dipstick test for
      detection of blood will be performed. If the patient consented to future research on TTI, a
      sample is drawn.

      Treatment:

      Patients will be transfused with one investigational product or SOC on Day 1. In case he or
      she requires further transfusion support to treat anemia, enrolled patients may be treated
      with a second study transfusion. A patient who requires a second blood component will receive
      a second treatment with a study product from the assigned treatment arm. This patient will be
      included into the analysis of evaluable patients and followed up to Day 58, the end of study
      visit.

      Post-transfusion visit(s):

      Patients will be hospitalized for 24 hours after each study transfusion to allow close
      monitoring and data collection uniquely for the study purpose since their condition would
      allow an outpatient treatment. 3 hours and 6 hours after initiating each study transfusion
      vital signs, skin inspection, and urine dipstick will be performed.

      24-hours post-transfusion vital signs, concomitant medication/intervention will be assessed,
      laboratory samples for hemoglobin, coagulation assays (aPTT, PT and/or INR) and potassium and
      a sample for determination of residual S-300 will be taken.

      If a subject consented to future research on TTI, a second blood sample (post-transfusion)
      will be taken and archived in the biobank.

      In case clinical symptoms of transfusion-related bacterial contamination occur, a blood
      sample will be taken during the post-transfusion period and sent for microbiological
      analysis. Those patients will be treated according to local SOC.

      Safety Follow-up visit Day 28 (+/-3 days after last study transfusion):

      At day 28 (+/-3 days) a physical examination, vitals and blood samples will be collected for
      laboratory analysis of safety variables (e.g., complete blood count, coagulation, blood
      chemistry) and urine dipstick.

      All Adverse Events (AE), Transfusion Reactions (TR) and unanticipated adverse device effects
      will be reviewed and recorded for the period from the first study transfusion through day 28
      after the last study transfusion.

      The Investigators will assess each AE/TR for relation to the study transfusion. Available
      clinical diagnostic tools will be used to classify occurring transfusion reactions by the
      definitions of Swissmedic grading scale.

      Final study visit Day 58 (+/-7 days after last study transfusion) At the final study visit,
      the immune reactivity of patient serum to RBCs treated with amustaline/GSH and a DAT test
      will be performed.

      SAEs will be reviewed and recorded for the period of 58 days up to the final study visit.

      The Investigators will assess each Serious Adverse Event (SAE) for relation to the study
      transfusion. Depending on the availability of clinical diagnostic tools, the transfusion
      reactions will be classified by the definitions of Swissmedic grading scale.
