  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While pulmonary rehabilitation provides benefits to people with COPD, only 25% have access to
      pulmonary rehabilitation each year. The main barriers are related to travel and
      transportation. This protocol will evaluate the effect of a home-based rehabilitation system
      on quality of life and steps. The system allows for monitoring by a health care system. A
      health coach will review the data and provide coaching to facilitate behavioral change and
      self-efficacy.

      This study will test the effectiveness of a home-base pulmonary rehabilitation program, that
      includes off-the-shelf technology (Android computer tablet, Nonin pulse oximeter and Garmin
      Fitness Tracker), health coaching and an online platform that allows a health coach to review
      patient monitoring and progress. The comparison will be a wait-list control group.
