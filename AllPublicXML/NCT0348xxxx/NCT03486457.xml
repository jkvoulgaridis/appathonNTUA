  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6 month study investigating the effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib in treating
      signs and symptoms and improving physical function in Chinese patients with active psoriatic
      arthritis and had inadequate response to a conventional synthetic disease modifying
      anti-rheumatic drug. This is a China alone study.

    <description>The EuroQol EQ 5D Health State Profile is a copyrighted, patient completed instrument designed to assess impact on health related quality of life in five domains: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Additionally, scores from the five domains may be used to calculate a single index value, also known as a utility score. The validity and reliability of the EuroQol EQ 5D has been established in a number of disease states, including PsA and rheumatoid arthritis.</description>

    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ DI assesses the degree of difficulty a subject has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty,&quot; 1 as &quot;some difficulty,&quot; 2 as &quot;much difficulty,&quot; and 3 as &quot;unable to do&quot;. Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status.</description>
