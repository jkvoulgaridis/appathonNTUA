  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether stress reduction training - which a growing body of research
      indicates has manifold benefits for behavior regulation, emotion regulation, and other
      salutary outcomes of relevance to this proposal - predicts lab-based and daily life-based
      neural and behavioral outcomes indicative of reduced stress, including emotions, desires, and
      reactions to adverse events such as social conflict.

      This research study seeks to understand how stress reduction training influences neural
      responses (brain activation) and behavior related to stress, including emotions, desires, and
      reactions to adverse events such as social conflict. The full research project will be
      conducted over approximately 4-6 weeks, and will consist of two data collection sessions on
      the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) campus, one before and one after a 14-day stress
      reduction training course conducted via mobile phone (SmartPhone). The two courses entail
      instructor-facilitated stress reduction exercises previously shown to reduce stress and
      improve well-being. Participants will be randomly assigned to a mindfulness course or an
      active coping course. Both of these courses - mindfulness training (MT) and coping training
      (CT) - involve expert-facilitated mental wellness techniques. MT emphasizes mindfulness-based
      techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being, whereas CT emphasizes established emotion
      regulation techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being.

      Some study details are purposely omitted at this time to preserve scientific integrity.
