  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people who have a paralyzed arm and hand from a spinal cord injury, who
      have also received a recording electrode array in the brain as part of the BrainGate study.
      The study will look at the ability of these participants to control different grasping
      patterns of the hand, both in virtual reality and in his/her actual hand. Movement of the
      participant's hand is controlled by a functional electrical stimulation (FES) system, which
      involves small electrodes implanted in the arm, shoulder and hand that use small electrical
      currents to activate the appropriate muscles.

      This work aims to advance Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BCls) to provide severely paralyzed
      persons a natural way of controlling Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) neuroprostheses
      for restoring arm and dexterous hand movements. The prospect of using BCI technology for
      restoring arm and hand movements for reaching and grasping is based on the hypothesis that in
      a paralyzed human, there is a repeatable and understandable relationship between recordable
      brain activity and specific aspects of imagined arm movements. Many previous studies have
      attempted to understand the relationships between brain activity and arm and hand movements
      in able-bodied monkeys. Little is known about these same relationships in humans, and
      specifically within the context of trying to control an FES arm and complex hand system. This
      study will recruit persons who already have BCI and FES systems implanted to take advantage
      of the possibility of recording high resolution brain activity in human participants. Thus,
      from this study, we aim to gain a better understanding of how brain signals are related to
      specific aspects of arm and complex hand movements in humans with paralysis. Additionally,
      this study will test novel implementations of complex hand movement restoration in Veterans
      and other persons with chronic hand and arm paralysis.
