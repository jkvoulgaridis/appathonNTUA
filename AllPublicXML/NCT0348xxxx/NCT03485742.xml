      The study (Statin Eligibility Prior to myocardial infarction (MI) in Jordanians, StatinEPIC)
      is

        1. Cross sectional

        2. Non interventional

        3. One encounter per patient. No follow up. It addresses a major issue of primary
           prevention in Jordanians especially the young population, namely the issue of lipid
           lowering agents before sustaining an acute MI. A recent study in USA showed that 50% of
           patients who sustained MI were not eligible to statins had they been evaluated before
           the heart attack. It is largely unknown if a larger percentage of Middle Eastern
           patients who sustain a heart attack would be eligible to receive lipid lowering agents.

        4. The PI will overlook the whole process. Dr Ahmad Tamari, the assistant to the PI will
           asses this whole process of data collection, management and manuscript drafting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Statins, when use as primary cardiovascular prevention strategy, have been shown to lower
      future acute cardiovascular events, especially myocardial infarction. However the use of
      statins in this context (i.e., primary prevention) is governed by guidelines that limit the
      use of statins to four high risk populations: (1) hose with known cardiovascular disease, (2)
      those with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels 190 mg/dl or above, (3)
      diabetics with LDL-C levels 70-189 mg/dl, and (4) those with an estimated 10-year
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score of 7.5% or more.

      Unfortunately, some individuals are still at risk of sustaining MI despite the fact that they
      do not fit into one of these four high risk groups eligible for statins.

      StainEPIC will enroll consecutive patients admitted with MI who are not on statins to examine
      their eligibility for these medications based on the AHA/ACC guidelines.

        Patients aged 30 to 75 years admitted with MI (ST elevation and non ST elevation) who are
        not receiving statins prior to admission will be evaluated for potential eligibility had
        they been evaluated prior to admission with MI.
