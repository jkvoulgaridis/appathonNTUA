  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative nutritional state is closely related to perioperative morbidity and
      complications. This study aims to determine the effect of a protein-rich meal service in the
      preoperative setting compared to usual care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 1.4 million patients in the Netherlands are operated. Adequate
      nutritional intake, mainly protein intake, before surgery is important to improve
      preoperative muscle strength and functional capacity. However, up to 40% of patients admitted
      to the hospital suffer from malnutrition and this further deepened during hospitalization,
      which is an independent risk factor for peri-operative morbidity and severe complications,
      ranging from increased muscle loss, to higher infection rates, delayed wound healing and
      subsequently a prolonged hospital stay. An adequate food service is one strategy to improve
      protein intake and thereby the nutritional status. Extension of the study period to the
      out-of-hospital setting is recommended to explore the effects of long-term exposure to this
      concept on nutritional, functional and clinical outcomes. Therefore, the investigators aim to
      evaluate whether home delivered protein-rich meals, as part of FoodforCare meal service, in
      the preoperative setting improves protein intake in patients undergoing surgery, compared to
      usual care. The second aim is to investigate the effects on functional and clinical outcomes.

    <description>The intervention group will receive meals from FoodforCare at Home. The FoodforCare at Home concept consists of six small protein and energy enriched meals and snacks that will be delivered twice a week. After an individual intake, the composition of the dishes will be tailored to the needs of the patient in terms of composition, diet, taste, flavor and portion size. Besides the meals, patients in the intervention group will also receive an information leaflet about the importance of protein during treatment and how to reach their protein requirements.</description>
