  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before the introduction of pneumonia vaccines in 2000, between 700,000 - 1 million children
      died each year as a result of infection with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and the
      resulting diseases, namely, meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia. Most of the deaths were in
      Africa and Asia. Where the vaccines have been introduced, they have been highly effective and
      have already reduced disease. However, at 10 USD per child, they are not affordable to most
      low-income countries without financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

      This project aims to assess whether lower doses of the two commercially available pneumonia
      vaccines can protect Kenyan infants as well as the full dose. The results could be used to
      increase the affordability of the pneumonia vaccine, and enable delivery of the vaccine to
      continue in the absence of Gavi support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      PCV is currently the most expensive vaccine in the routine immunisation schedule in
      Gavi-supported countries. This study aims to provide evidence which may enable a substantial
      decrease in the cost of PCV programmes, therefore increasing the sustainability of PCV
      programmes in low and middle income countries (LMICs). We propose to assess whether
      fractional (20% and 40%) doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10 and PCV13) in a 2p+1
      schedule (2 primary doses followed by a booster dose) induce non-inferior immunogenicity and
      effects on vaccine-serotype carriage when compared to the full dose. These lower doses could
      convert new 4-dose vials of PCVs into 10- or 20-dose vials, ready for immediate
      implementation in LMIC programmes.

      Primary objective:

      Non-inferior immunogenicity at 1-month post-boost (10 months of age). Non-inferiority will be
      reached if the lower CI around the ratio of geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of IgG
      (fractional/full dose) is &gt;0.5 (i.e. the 2-fold criterion).

      Secondary objectives:

      Non-inferior immunogenicity at 1-month post-primary series (18 weeks of age). Non-inferiority
      will be achieved if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the difference
      in the proportion of 'responders', children with IgG&gt;=0.35 mcg/ml, (fractional dose group -
      full dose group) is &gt;-10% for at least 8 of the 10 vaccine types in the PCV10 arms and at
      least 10 of the 13 vaccine types in the PCV13 arms.

      The opsonophagocytic activity of the antibody response to 7 serotypes after full/ fractional
      doses at the 1-month post-boost time point.

      The direct vaccine effectiveness of full/fractional doses of PCV13 against carriage of
      serotypes 6A and 19A, with primary analyses at 18 months of age and secondary analyses at 9
      months of age.

      The proportion of children with evidence of vaccine-serotype carriage by trial arm at 9 and
      18 months of age.

      The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of serotype-specific IgG after the primary series of
      the 2p+1 schedule, prior to boost, at 9 months of age.

      The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of serotype-specific IgG after three doses of vaccine
      in a 2p+1 schedule at 18 months of age.

      The carriage prevalence at 9 and 18 months of age and IgG concentrations at 4 weeks after the
      primary series after full dose of PCV10 in a 3p+0 schedule, and full/ fractional doses of
      PCV10/13 in a 2p+1 schedule.

      Trial design:

      A phase IV individually-randomised controlled trial of full or fractional (20% or 40%) doses
      of PCV10/ PCV13, given as a 3-dose schedule to infants: 2 doses at 6 and 14 weeks of age and
      a booster dose at 9 months (the 2p+1 schedule) or 3 full doses at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age
      (the 3p+0 schedule).

      At 6-8 weeks of age, 300 infants will be enrolled at random into each of the seven trial arms
      and followed until 18 months of age.

      The seven trial arms:

      A. Full dose PCV13 vaccination in a 2p+1 schedule. B. 40% fractional dose PCV13 vaccination
      in a 2p+1 schedule. C. 20% fractional dose PCV13 vaccination in a 2p+1 schedule. D. Full dose
      PCV10 vaccination in a 2p+1 schedule. E. 40% fractional dose PCV10 vaccination in a 2p+1
      schedule. F. 20% fractional dose PCV10 vaccination in a 2p+1 schedule. G. Full dose PCV10
      vaccination in a 3p+0 schedule. This arm would represent the current vaccine and schedule in
      the Kenyan routine immunisation programme and would act as an additional comparison arm.

      Study procedures:

      No study procedures will be conducted without prior parental informed consent. Participants
      in trial arms A-F will provide 3 or 5 blood samples in the course of the trial at enrolment,
      4 weeks post-primary series (approximately 18 weeks of age) and 4 weeks post-boost
      (approximately 10 months of age); additionally a random selection of half the participants
      will contribute blood samples pre-boost (9 months of age) and at the last study visit (18
      months of age).

      Participants in trial arm G will provide 2 blood samples (at enrolment and at 4 weeks
      post-primary series (approximately 18 weeks of age).

      All participants will provide 2 nasopharyngeal swabs at approximately 9 and 18 months of age
      and contribute safety data.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants, parents of participants and all of the study team apart from the vaccinator will be masked with respect to the infant's allocation to a trial arm between A-F. If randomly allocated to trial arm G, parents and study personnel will be unmasked due to the necessity for trial arm G to receive a different vaccine schedule compared to trial arms A-F. It is thought that this unmasking will have minimal impact on retention, follow up and outcome assessment across the trial arms for primary and secondary outcomes.</masking_description>
