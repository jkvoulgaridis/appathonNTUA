  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to assess the capacity of a technological solution for analyzing older
      person's functional and cognitive autonomy at home. Results from this study will also be used
      to elaborate the design of a further larger national multicenter randomized control trial
      assessing the efficacy of the solution to detect early infra-clinical disability.

  <detailed_description>

      The object of the present project is to evaluate an instrument for monitoring functional and
      cognitive autonomy in frail or disable elderly persons living alone at home. By assessing
      older person's autonomy at home and detecting early infra-clinical indicators, the solution
      could provide relevant clinical parameters to the caregivers and healthcare professionals in
      order to support the patient's follow-up, and support the detection of preliminary signs of
      functional loss. The device consists of a set of sensors embedded in the house with minimal
      invasiveness. The solution transmits the collected data to a remote storage server. Data will
      then be available for distance consultations by users (i.e., patients, careers or
      physicians). The study will conduct a wide range of evaluations of the device (technical,
      clinical, and economic), which will allow the optimization of the prototype. The evaluation
      of the solution will involve 25 frail or disable community-dwelling subjects living alone for
      6 months. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted to highlight the feasibility,
      integration in healthcare network, and clinical relevance of the technological device.
