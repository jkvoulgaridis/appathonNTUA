  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual-reality
      audio-visual distraction goggles on pain and behavior scores in a population of 8-12 year old
      dental patients receiving routine dental care in an outpatient clinical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All appointments will take place at the College of Dentistry Department of Pediatric
      Dentistry. The first day's appointment will consist of clinically-indicated cleaning,
      radiographs and treatment planning. Toward the end of the first appointment, the participant
      will wear the virtual reality goggles for 5 minutes, in order to become familiar with the
      device. During these 5 minutes, fluoride varnish will be applied. The application of the
      varnish would occur whether the participant is in the research or not.

      At the second or third appointments, the goggles will be randomly used during the restorative
      treatment. Whether the participant uses the goggles at the second or third visit will be
      determined purely by chance, like flipping a coin. No nitrous oxide will be used, but local
      anesthesia will still be administered as standard. The participant will use a 1-10 scale at
      the end of each appointment to rate pain levels, and a research team member(the dental
      assistant) will assign a 1-4 scale value for behavior. The 1-10 scale will consist of the
      Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale.

    <description>The patient will complete a self-reported pain scale known as the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale. This is a 1-10 pain scale that has correlating faces. A 1 indicates no pain, and correlates with a happy face. A 10 correlates with a crying face and indicates severe pain. A single number between 1-10 is selected to indicate the patient's pain.</description>

    <time_frame>recorded immediately after each treatment session, during both the control visit and the experimental visit (patient acts as their own control)</time_frame>
    <description>Behavior in terms of child cooperation will reported by an unbiased dental assistant using the Frankyl behavior scale. Behavior means the child listens to instructions and follows directions given by the clinician. This is a 1-4 scale, with 1 indicating extremely uncooperative behavior (crying, strong movement) and 4 indicating positive, cooperative behavior.</description>

    <description>Patients will act as their own control over two different dental appointments. One appointment will consist of wearing the virtual reality googles, the other appointment will be conducted without them. The goggles have a small screen inside of them along with headphones. This device will play an a movie or cartoon that will immerse the patient during treatment.</description>
