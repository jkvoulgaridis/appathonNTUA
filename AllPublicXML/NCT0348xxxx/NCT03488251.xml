      This is a multi-center, open-label two-part study evaluating the safety and tolerability of
      MT-3724 in combination with GEMOX in relapsed or refractory B-cell Lymphoma patients.

      Part 1: (MT-3724 Dose Escalation) Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-3724 in
      combination with standard treatment of GEMOX

      Part 2: (MTD Expansion Cohort) Confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of MT-3724 from
      Part 1 in the MTD Expansion Cohort, where MT-3724 will be given at the MTD in combination
      with GEMOX. In addition, the PK, PD, immunogenicity and tumor response at the MTD of MT-3724
      in combination with GEMOX will be more thoroughly evaluated in Part 2.

      MT-3724 will be administered as intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour. In C1, MT-3724
      infusion should be administered on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 22, 29, and 36 of the 42-day
      cycle.

      In Cycle 2 and beyond, MT-3724 will be administered weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each
      28-day cycle.

      During the first 2 weeks of C1, no more than two MT-3724 doses can be administered on
      consecutive days. If MT-3724 is administered on consecutive days, then at least 20 hours
      (more than 5 half-lives of MT-3724 in plasma) must elapse between the start of the 2
      infusions.

      For Weeks 3 through 6 of C1 and for C2 and beyond, different dosing days within ± 2 days from
      scheduled weekly doses may be selected at investigator's discretion.

      Treatment -Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 will be administered as 30-minute IV infusion. In C1,
      Gemcitabine will be administered on Day 16 and Day 30 of the 42-day cycle.

      In Cycle 2 and beyond, Gemcitabine will be administered on Day 2 and Day 16 of each 28-day
      cycle.

      Treatment -Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 will be administered as 2-hour IV infusion after
      Gemcitabine. In C1, Oxaliplatin will be administered on Day 16 and Day 30 of the 42-day
      cycle.

      In Cycle 2 and beyond, Oxaliplatin will be administered on Day 2 and Day 16 of each 28-day
      cycle. Oxaliplatin infusion will start one hour after the start of Gemcitabine infusion
      (unless a delay is warranted at the investigator's discretion).

      Continued Treatment with MT-3724 in combination with GEMOX will continue for four cycles of
      until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or another
      reason for withdrawal.

      After four cycles, the subjects who experience clinical benefit can continue MT-3724
      treatment with additional cycles of 28 days each (either alone or in combination with GEMOX)
      if supported by the investigator's assessment of the benefit-risk ratio, after consultation
      with sponsor and Medical Monitor
