  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite being more likely than typical hearing children to experience disruptive behavior
      problems, children who are deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) rarely receive behavioral
      interventions to prevent the long-term costly outcomes of behavior problems. This pilot
      project will systematically adapt an evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT)
      intervention to increase its acceptability and relevance for parents of young DHH children.
      Two parents of DHH children will be trained in the adapted BPT for DHH children. They will
      each deliver the intervention to five families with DHH preschool-aged children.
