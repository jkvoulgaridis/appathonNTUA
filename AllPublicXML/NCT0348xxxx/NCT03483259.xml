  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open, single-dose, three-cycle cross-design study, which
      will be only enrolled Chinese male healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      27-30 Chinese male healthy volunteers will be enrolled to assess the pharmacokinetic profile
      and relative bioavailability of 300 mg (50 mg x 6) Sulfatinib capsules of single dose orally
      in two different manufacturers after breakfast. All subjects are required to collect PK blood
      samples before and after administration at the following time points: within 1 hour before
      administration, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 hours after
      administration (16 times point), each collection of venous blood is 2mL.
