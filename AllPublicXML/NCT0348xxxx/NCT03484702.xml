      This open-label Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified T cells
      (JCAR017) administered to adult patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
      The study will also help determine how long the modified T cells stay in the patient's body.
      Furthermore, changes in the patient's quality of life will be described. Phase 2 (autologous
      T cells expressing anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor) (DLBCL NOS [de novo or tFL],
      follicular lymphoma Grade 3B [FL3B], high grade B-cell Lymphoma [HGBL] and primary central
      nervous system lymphoma [PCNSL]).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of JCAR017 in adult patients with aggressive B-cell NHL. The study will enroll
      patients in Europe and Japan with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise
      specified (NOS; de novo or transformed follicular lymphoma [tFL]), high-grade B-cell lymphoma
      with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with DLBCL histology (HGBL), follicular lymphoma
      Grade 3B (FL3B), and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Patients with secondary
      central nervous system (CNS) involvement are allowed.

      Once enrolled, patients will undergo leukapheresis to enable JCAR017 cell product generation.
      Upon successful JCAR017 cell product generation, patients will receive lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy followed by infusion of JCAR017. JCAR017 will be administered at a dose of 100 x
      10^6 JCAR017-positive transfected viable T cells by intravenous infusion. Patients will be
      followed for approximately 2 years after their JCAR017 infusion for safety, disease status,
      survival and health-related quality of life.

      Delayed adverse events following exposure to gene modified T cells will be assessed and
      long-term persistence of these modified T cells will continue to be monitored under a
      separate long-term follow-up protocol for up to 15 years after JCAR017 infusion as per
      competent authority guidelines.

          6. Subjects with one of the following:

             Cohort 1: Subjects with DLBCL NOS (de novo or tFL), HGBL and FL3B per WHO 2016
             classification (Swerdlow, 2016), after ≥ 2 lines of therapy*, including an

             classification (Swerdlow, 2016), who failed first line therapy*, including an
             anthracycline and rituximab (or other CD20-targeted agent)

               -  Transplant not eligible subjects will include those who are deemed ineligible for
                  high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT due to age, performance status or comorbidity,
                  while also having adequate organ function for CAR T cell treatment. At the very
                  least, subjects have to meet one of the following criteria:

                    1. Age ≥ 70 years

                    6. Impaired hepatic function (AST/ALT &gt; 2 x ULN, bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL or
                       cirrhosis Child-Pugh B or C)

               -  Subjects must fulfil all other in- and exclusion criteria Cohort 3 (Japan only):
                  Subjects meeting eligibility criteria for either Cohort 1 or 2 Cohort 4: Subjects
                  with newly diagnosed HGBL. Subjects must be eligible for anthracycline and
                  rituximab (or other CD20-targeted agent) containing regimen as induction prior to
                  consolidation with JCAR017** Cohort 5: Subjects with PCNSL who failed first line
                  therapy with HDCT and ASCT Cohort 6: (REMOVED) Cohort 7: Subjects meeting
                  eligibility criteria for Cohort 1 and suitable for outpatient treatment***

                    -  For subjects with transformed disease, the subject should have had at least
                       2 lines of systemic therapy for his/her transformed disease (ie, DLBCL) for
                       Cohort 1 and 1 line for Cohort 2 to be eligible. Lines of therapy do not
                       include those given for a previously indolent condition (ie, follicular
                       lymphoma). Subjects do NOT have to have anthracycline for their DLBCL if
                       received for indolent disease.

                         -  For subjects already undergoing anthracycline and rituximab containing
                            regimen, eligibility is to be discussed with Medical Monitor. Subjects
                            with complete metabolic response after 2 cycles of induction will
                            proceed with JCAR017 infusion only at time of relapse, if applicable.

                              -  Subjects must meet the conditions for outpatient treatment and
                                 monitoring as outlined in the Outpatient Administration and
                                 Monitoring Guidance for Lisocabtagene Maraleucel.

             Note: Subjects with secondary CNS lymphoma involvement may enroll in Cohorts 1 to 4
             and 7; subjects with PCNSL are eligible for Cohort 5. Subject selection must consider
             clinical risk factors for severe adverse events (AEs) and alternative treatment
             options. Subjects should only be enrolled if the Investigator considers the potential
             benefit outweighs the risk for the subject. For Cohort 5 and to not compromise safety,
             subject selection has been restricted to those fit enough to HDCT and ASCT as their
             prior therapy.

          7. Histological confirmation of diagnosis at last relapse. Enough tumor material must be
             available for central confirmation of diagnosis, otherwise a new tumor biopsy is
             mandated.

             Note: If the subject did not experience CR since last biopsy, the most recent biopsy
             will be considered adequate to participate in the trial. For subjects with PCNSL, at a
             minimum, corresponding pathology report is required if archival tumor material is not
             available and repeated biopsy not feasible.

          8. (REMOVED) For subjects with NHL and Richter's transformed CLL

          9. For subjects with PCNSL: Subjects must have disease that is objectively measurable by
             International Workshop to Standardize Baseline Evaluation and Response Criteria in
             Primary Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma (Abrey, 2005), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
             cytology (in case of leptomeningeal only disease), or vitreal aspiration cytology
             and/or retinal photographs (in case of ocular lymphoma if clinically indicated)

         10. Adequate organ function, defined as:

               -  Adequate bone marrow function to receive LD chemotherapy as assessed by the
                  Investigator

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min (estimated
                  glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] by Cockroft Gault)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 x ULN and total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL (or &lt;
                  3.0 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's syndrome or lymphomatous infiltration of
                  the liver) Adequate pulmonary function, defined as ≤ Grade 1 dyspnea according to
                  Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and SaO2 ≥ 92% on room air

               -  Adequate cardiac function, defined as LVEF ≥ 40% as assessed by echocardiogram or
                  multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan performed within 4 weeks prior to
                  leukapheresis

         11. Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis procedure

         12. Subjects must agree to not donate blood, organs, sperm or semen, and egg cells for
             usage in other individuals after the JCAR017 infusion

         13. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must:

               1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator (one negative
                  serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ß-hCG] pregnancy test result at
                  screening and one negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to the
                  first dose of LD chemotherapy). This applies even if the subject practices true
                  abstinence* from heterosexual contact

               2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able
                  to comply with, effective contraception without interruption. Contraception
                  methods must include 1 highly effective (barrier) method of contraception from
                  screening until at least 12 months following LD chemotherapy

        Note: Highly effective methods are defined as those that result in a low failure rate (ie,
        less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The following are examples of
        contraception:

          -  Highly effective methods:

          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  Hormonal (birth control pill, injections, implants)

          -  Tubal ligation

          -  Partner's vasectomy c) Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation
             and for at least 12 months following LD chemotherapy d) There is insufficient exposure
             data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of contraception and the
             abstaining from breastfeeding following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision regarding
             contraception and breastfeeding after JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the
             treating physician 14. Male subjects must:

               1. Practice true abstinence* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source
                  documented) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female
                  or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study and until
                  at least 12 months following LD chemotherapy even if he has undergone a
                  successful vasectomy

               2. There is insufficient exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the
                  duration of contraception following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision
                  regarding contraception after JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the
                  treating physician * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the
                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. In contrast, periodic abstinence
                  (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal
                  are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study

          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which
             would place the subject at unacceptable risk if participating in the study

          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study

          4. Subjects with T cell rich/histiocyte rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRBCL), primary
