             longer)

          2. Had a myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to Screening

          3. Has a known personal or family history or symptoms of long QT syndrome

          8. Has previously been treated with pimavanserin or is currently taking pimavanserin

          9. Has a sensitivity to pimavanserin or its excipients

         10. Is judged by the Investigator or the Medical Monitor to be inappropriate for the study
