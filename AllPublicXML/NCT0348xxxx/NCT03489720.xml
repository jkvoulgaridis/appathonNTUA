  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the prevalence and characterize predictors of physician burnout
      in the anesthesia residency at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The study also seeks to
      evaluate the effect of an exercise intervention on burnout and personal resiliency (i.e.,
      less individual stress given the same workload).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional evaluation of burnout, perceived stress, average sleep propensity, and
      social support and coping mechanisms will be assessed from four years of Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center (VUMC) Anesthesia residents. Burnout will be assessed using the
      Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS).

      Participating interns, Anesthesia Residency Class 1 (CA-1), and Anesthesia Residency Class 2
      (CA-2) classes will be randomized to 8 weeks of an exercise intervention (15 min of activity
      at 70% of max heart rate or higher, 5 days a week) to meet the activity recommendations of
      the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion or 8 weeks of continuing their baseline
      activity level prior to the study.

MBI-HSS is a survey to measure burnout in professionals in human services. MBI-HSS EE score includes 9 items to evaluate emotional exhaustion (EE), with scores ranging from 0 to 6 on the Likert scale. MBI-HSS EE total score ranges from 0 to 54 points. We consider a high degree of burnout in the case of EE ≥ 27 points. Moderate burnout will be considered in the case of 26&lt;EE&lt;19 points. Low levels will be considered for EE≤18 points.</description>

        <description>The change in the Emotional Exhaustion (EE) burnout score(as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)from baseline to end of each exercise phase.
MBI-HSS is a survey to measure burnout in professionals in human services. MBI-HSS EE score includes 9 items to evaluate emotional exhaustion (EE), with scores ranging from 0 to 6 on the Likert scale. MBI-HSS EE total score ranges from 0 to 54 points. We consider a high degree of burnout in the case of EE ≥ 27 points. Moderate burnout will be considered in the case of 26&lt;EE&lt;19 points. Low levels will be considered for EE≤18 points.</description>

Examples of possible 15-minute exercise regimens to be used include:
Walking quickly or running up and down stairs
Plyometric exercises such as jumping jacks, high knees, squats, lunges, speed skaters, froggers, etc
Walking up an incline on a treadmill
Jogging or running on a treadmill or elliptical

MBI-HSS is a survey to measure burnout in professionals in human services. MBI-HSS PA score includes 8 items to evaluate Personal Accomplishment (PA) with scores ranging from 0 to 6 on the Likert scale. MBI-HSS PA total score ranges from 0 to 48 points. We consider a high degree of burnout in the case of PA≥ 39 points. Moderate burnout will be considered in the case of 32-38 PA points. Low levels will be considered for PA ≤31 points.</description>

MBI-HSS is a survey to measure burnout in professionals in human services. PA MBI-HSS includes 8 items to evaluate personal accomplishment (PA), with scores ranging from 0 to 6 on the Likert scale. MBI-HSS PA total score ranges from 0 to 48 points. We consider a high degree of burnout in the case of PA≥ 39 points. Moderate burnout will be considered in the case of 32-38 PA points. Low levels will be considered for PA ≤31 points.</description>

        <title>The Degree of Burnout Among VUMC Anesthesia Interns and Residents as Quantified by Baseline Emotional Exhaustion (EE) MBI-HSS Scores Broken Down by Level of Residency Training Completed.</title>
        <description>The degree of burnout among VUMC anesthesia interns and residents as quantified by baseline Emotional Exhaustion MBI-HSS scores broken down by level of residency training completed.
MBI-HSS is a survey to measure burnout in professionals in human services. MBI-HSS EE score includes 9 items to evaluate emotional exhaustion (EE), with scores ranging from 0 to 6 on the Likert scale. MBI-HSS EE total score ranges from 0 to 54 points. We consider a high degree of burnout in the case of EE ≥ 27 points. Moderate burnout will be considered in the case of 26&lt;EE&lt;19 points. Low levels will be considered for EE≤18 points.</description>

          <description>The degree of burnout among VUMC anesthesia interns and residents as quantified by baseline Emotional Exhaustion MBI-HSS scores broken down by level of residency training completed.
MBI-HSS is a survey to measure burnout in professionals in human services. MBI-HSS EE score includes 9 items to evaluate emotional exhaustion (EE), with scores ranging from 0 to 6 on the Likert scale. MBI-HSS EE total score ranges from 0 to 54 points. We consider a high degree of burnout in the case of EE ≥ 27 points. Moderate burnout will be considered in the case of 26&lt;EE&lt;19 points. Low levels will be considered for EE≤18 points.</description>
