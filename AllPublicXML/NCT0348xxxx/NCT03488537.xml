  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common new cancer diagnosis and a major cause of
      morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Early detection and treatment are critical
      factors in the course and prognosis of CRC, and screening programs have proven to be an
      important means to reduce both CRC related mortality and secondary economic burden.

      The diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive screening tests is still limited and a follow-up
      colonoscopy is required for confirmation of the diagnosis. The faecal occult blood test (FIT)
      is the most commonly used fecal screening test worldwide, but sensitivity for CRC ranges
      between 53%-99% depending on the cut-off values used, whereas sensitivity for advanced
      adenomas is disturbingly low (39%-57%).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AeonoseTM to distuinguish
      people with CRC from healthy controls.

      Rationale: An electronic nose (eNose) is an artificial olfactory system that analyses volate
      organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. Exhaled human breath is mainly composed of
      inorganic compounds, inert gases and VOCs. VOCs are exhaled in very low concentrations and
      reflect pathological processes such as inflammation, oxidation, infection and neoplasms. The
      perspective is that metabolic and biochemical processes in several pathological situations
      cause different endogenous VOCs to arise, were they can serve as non-invasive biomarkers for
      certain diseases.

      Primary objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AeonoseTM to distinguish the
      breathing pattern from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls using the
      previously established breathing pattern.

      Secondary objecitves:

        -  To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AeonoseTM to distinguish the breathing
           pattern from patients with polyps (e.g. advanced adenomas, sessile serrated lesions).

        -  To determine the influence of colonic cleansing (laxative use) on breathing patterns.

      Study population: Adult patients referred for colonoscopy.

      Estimated sample size: 66 patients with CRC.

      Intervention: Participants will be asked to breath through the AeonoseTM for 5 minutes. There
      are no risks, nor benefits for the participants.
