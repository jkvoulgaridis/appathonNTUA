      At present, it is not clear whether performing a hip arthroscopy at the same time as a PAO
      improves patient outcomes after surgery compared to a PAO alone.

      This research project will randomize patients to receive either a PAO alone, or a PAO and a
      hip arthroscopy at the same time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip dysplasia is a developmental abnormality of the acetabulum (hip socket) that causes
      abnormal stresses inside the hip joint and leads to painful arthritis at a young age. Many
      patients develop painful symptoms in their hip before advanced arthritis occurs.

      The periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a surgical procedure that reorients the acetabulum to
      reduce the stresses inside the hip joint. The PAO is very effective at improving symptoms and
      quality of life. However, some patients may have residual symptoms.

      Frequently, people with hip dysplasia will have an MRI done before their surgery, which helps
      to identify other the abnormalities inside their hip joint (e.g., labral tears). These
      abnormalities inside the joint cannot easily be addressed through PAO alone, however they can
      be addressed with hip arthroscopy. Hip arthroscopy is a separate minimally invasive surgical
      procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of the hip joint with a small camera
      and address any abnormalities.

      At present, it is not clear whether performing a hip arthroscopy at the same time as a PAO
      improves patient outcomes after surgery compared to a PAO alone.

      This research project will randomize patients to receive either a PAO alone, or a PAO and a
      hip arthroscopy at the same time. Patients will be followed for 2 years after surgery.
      Symptomatic differences between the two patient groups will be assessed to determine added
      benefit of the hip arthroscopy.

    <description>Patient-reported quality of life will be the primary outcome used for comparison between the two treatment groups as measured by the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33). The iHOT-33 is a validated, self-administered quality of life assessment tool for young, active patients with hip symptoms.</description>

    <description>Hip-specific symptoms and functional impairment will be compared using the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). This 40-item patient reported outcome tool has been validated for use in patients with and without hip osteoarthritis and has shown good responsiveness, reliability and reproducibility in this patient population.</description>

    <description>Global Health assessment will be compared using the PROMIS Global 10 Score. This 10-item tool assesses general domains of health related quality of life in the domains of physical, mental, and social well-being.</description>

    <measure>Operative time</measure>
    <time_frame>intra-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Total operative time is expected to be longer in the &quot;Scope-PAO&quot; treatment group, however the average increase in time will be valuable information for future research assessing cost-effectiveness of this treatment strategy. Total operative time will be measured from the time the patient enters the operating room to the time the patient is ready for transfer to post-anesthetic care unit (PACU). This time interval represents the best assessment of the overall time cost to the health care system associated with the surgical procedure while avoiding confounding due to delays in transfer to PACU.</description>
