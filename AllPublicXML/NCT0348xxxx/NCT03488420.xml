  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this registry is the characterization of patients with atrial fibrillation
      (AF) with confirmed valvular heart disease (VHD) who are prescribed edoxaban in a real-life
      clinical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, multicenter, edoxaban Canadian registry of adults
      (≥18) diagnosed or confirmed with AF and/or AFL with VHD, within the last 12 months,
      according to local standard procedures and judged by the investigator to be at risk of stroke
      and in whom anticoagulation with NOAC is clinically indicated and who are prescribed
      edoxaban. A total of about 300 patients will be enrolled from approximately 15 sites in
      Quebec. Patients will be treated according to standard local practices. There is no formal
      interventions. Treatment decisions are left to the physician's discretion.

      Registry data will be collected by the investigator or delegate at baseline, 6, 12 and 24
      months and recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).

      Data available in the patient's file will be collected. The only procedure to be performed in
      the context of this registry is the completion of questionnaires: the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA©) test and the Anti-Clot-Treatment Scale (ACTS-Q) questionnaire.
