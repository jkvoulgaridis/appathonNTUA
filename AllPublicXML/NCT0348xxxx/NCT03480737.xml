    <textblock>
      Executive functioning (EF) deficits are a core, transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology
      and one of the strongest predictors of clinical and functional outcomes, yet there remains a
      dearth of treatments available for EF deficits. EF is a collection of cognitive control
      processes that includes working memory (i.e., maintain/manipulate data not perceptually
      present), inhibition (i.e., inhibit/control of attention, thoughts, behaviors) and
      flexibility (i.e., shift flexibly between tasks/sets). These EF subdomains are subserved by a
      network (i.e., cognitive control network) of frontal (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      [DLPFC]), parietal and subcortical regions, with hypoactivation in such regions often
      underlying EF deficits. There is a recent call in psychiatry to develop experimental
      therapeutics that target anomalous neural systems underlying symptomology. Repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a therapeutic, non-invasive method of cortical
      excitability modulation. High frequency rTMS to the left DPLFC has an activating effect on
      the cognitive control network, with initial research in adults finding a subsequent enhancing
      effect on working memory, inhibition, and flexibility. rTMS represents a very promising
      potential tool to target EF deficits in psychopathology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to provide assent and have parent provide parental permission

          2. English fluency

          3. 13-17 years

          4. List Sorting Test (NIH Toolbox) performance: Greater than 1.0 standard deviation (SD)
             below normative mean

          5. Parent rating on BRIEF-2 Working Memory: Greater than 1.0 SD above normative mean

          6. IQ &gt; 80

          7. Clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): predominantly
             inattentive type, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type, combined type, or
             unspecified type. Diagnostic criteria will be confirmed with NICHQ Vanderbilt
             Assessment Scales-Parent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be screened to exclude individuals with neurological or medical
        conditions that might confound the results, as well as to exclude participants in whom rTMS
        might result in increased risk of side effects or complications. Common TMS
        contraindications include metallic hardware in the body, cardiac pacemaker, patients with
        an implanted medication pumps or an intracardiac line, or prescription of medications known
        to lower seizure threshold. This accounts for the majority of the exclusion criteria
        listed:

          1. Intracranial pathology from a known genetic disorder (e.g., NF1, tuberous sclerosis)
             or from acquired neurologic disease (e.g. stroke, tumor), cerebral palsy, history of
             severe head injury, or significant dysmorphology

          2. History of fainting spells of unknown or undetermined etiology that might constitute
             seizures

          3. History of seizures, diagnosis of epilepsy, or immediate (1st degree relative) family
             history epilepsy

          5. Chronic (particularly) uncontrolled medical conditions that may cause a medical
             emergency in case of a provoked seizure (cardiac malformation, cardiac dysrhythmia,
             asthma, etc.)

          6. Contraindicated metal implants in the head, brain or spinal cord (excluding dental
             implants or fillings)
