  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore if there are any difference in functional outcomes between two
      different surgical procedures for total knee replacement: robot-assisted versus
      manually-executed total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment for end-stage knee
      arthritis, improvements in surgical technique remain a necessity. Contemporary designs have
      bolstered durability, but longer life expectancies have placed an even greater emphasis on
      survivorship. Additionally, patient satisfaction remains an issue.

      A prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed to compare robotically-assisted
      versus manually executed primary (TKAs). This study is designed to address the major
      short-term clinically important issues between the two types of procedures with special
      emphasis on functional outcome. Patients will be randomized to receive either a
      robotically-assisted or a manually-executed primary TKA.

    <description>The intervention is then performed with a new device and surgical procedure. At first the femur and the tibia are fixed to the operating table with a special clamp and the knee bones are exposed with the standard technique; then the surgeon digitizes the shape of the joint and the computer transfers the planned surgical strategy to a dedicated surgical robot. Resections are performed by the surgeon on a constrained guide held by the robot.</description>
