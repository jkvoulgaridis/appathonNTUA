  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in a range of chemo, radio and surgical therapies, the overall survival
      at 5 years from gastrointestinal cancer remains poor. Endoscopic early diagnosis is a key
      strategy to improve survival but the detection rate of early cancer varies among different
      countries. Risk factor questionnaire result is easy to be obtained and may be of great help
      for improving the detection rate. The aim of this research is to validate a risk factor
      questionnaire to help predict gastrointestinal cancer therefore allowing earlier diagnosis
      and higher detection rate.

    <description>During the application stage of endoscopy, the patients are required to complete a RFQ according to their own situations. The RFQs will soon uploaded to the core server of the quality control system and be analysed automatically immediately after finish. The results are sorted into four types including &quot;N/A&quot;, &quot;High-risk for esophageal cancer&quot;, &quot;High-risk for gastric cancer&quot; and &quot;High-risk for colorectal cancer&quot;, which will be shown during the endoscopy of the specific person.
The endoscopies are carried out by experienced endoscopists. All of the data of the endoscopy itself are collected and recorded in the quality control system.
The RFQ results of this group are not known (deliberately showing &quot;N/A&quot;) by the endoscopists before and during the endoscopy.</description>
