  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the 3 - year clinical follow - up results of patients with left main bifurcation
      lesions treated by intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) - guided and coronary angiography(CAG) -
      guided percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI), and to confirm the clinical benefits of
      optimizing interventional therapy of left main bifurcation lesions by intravascular
      ultrasound(IVUS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      616 patients with primary left main coronary artery bifurcation lesions will be recruited in
      this study. The target lesions of patients need to be true coronary artery bifurcation
      lesions (Medina 1,1,1 or 0,1,1). After angiography, patients will be randomly assigned to
      intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) - guided and coronary angiography (CAG)- guided groups. The
      random number of patients will be generated by the central computer random system, and the
      random will be stratified according to the study sites. In coronary angiography(CAG)-guided
      group, two-stent technique will be used(the exact two-stent technique used was left to the
      operator's discretion). In intravascular ultrasound(IVUS)-guided group, minimal lumen
      area(MLA) in ostium of side branch will be measured by intravascular ultrasound(IVUS). If
      minimal lumen area(MLA)&lt;4mm2, two-stent technique will be used(the exact two-stent technique
      used was left to the operator's discretion) and intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) will be
      repeated at the end of the procedure. If minimal lumen area(MLA) &gt;=4mm2, one-stent technique
      will be used and intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) will be repeated. If minimal lumen area(MLA)
      in ostium of side branch is still &gt;=4mm2, the procedure will be ended. If minimal lumen
      area(MLA) in ostium of side branch become &lt;4mm2, the following interventional strategy will
      be left to the operator's discretion( balloon inflation, drug-eluting balloon, or switch to
      two-stent technique). Again, intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) will be repeated at the end of
      the procedure.
