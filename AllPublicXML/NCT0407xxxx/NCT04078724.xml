  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) supplementation
      on sleep quality and gut microbiome composition in older adults with normal cognition vs.
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a randomized controlled trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-wk parallel, single-bind (investigator), prospective study design with subjects
      randomly assigned to consume 100 mg of 5-HTP or does not consume 5-HTP. Fifty older men and
      women (aged 60-85y, approximately half men and half women, approximately half subjects with
      MCI) will be recruited with the expectation that ≥ 40 subjects (≥ 10 subjects per group) will
      complete the study. Body size, blood pressure, urinary melatonin, sleep quality, cognitive
      function and mood (including depression and anxiety), gut microbiome, and short chain fatty
      acids will be assessed. Blood amino acid concentration will be measured as an indicator of
      compliance to the 5-HTP consumption from the collected blood samples.

      Relevance to Singapore: The results from the proposed research will assist a practical
      guidance of nutritional behavior changes providing gut and brain health promoting effects to
      Singapore older individuals with or without MCI and may result in reducing cost and manpower
      for cognitive decline care.
