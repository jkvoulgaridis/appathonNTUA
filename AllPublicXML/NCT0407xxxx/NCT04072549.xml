  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will address cost barriers to participating in summer programs and
      hypothesize this will lead to marked improvements in children's obesogenic behaviors and a
      reduction in excessive, unhealthy weight gain over summer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, we will rigorously test the impact of providing access to existing
      community-operated summer programs on weight status (i.e., BMI z-score) and obesogenic
      behaviors of 1st-3rd grade children from low-income households. Using a pragmatic, Type II
      hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized design, we will compare changes in weight
      status and obesogenic behaviors of children from low-income households randomized to one of
      two conditions: free summer programming or comparison/control.

    <description>The summer day camps are not singularly focused, such as sport camps or academic only camps. Rather, the camps provide indoor and outdoor opportunities for children to be physically active each day, provide enrichment and academic programming, as well as provide breakfast, lunch, and snacks. To standardize programming, the schools operate their camps on the same daily schedules which are developed by the same district-level personnel, with identical programmatic content delivered across all schools. The schools also provide the same meals to all children enrolled. The meals adhere to the Summer Food Service Program nutrition guidelines and are reimbursed through existing federal food programs.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1st through 3rd grade students in the participating schools.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The only exclusion criteria will be the diagnosis of an intellectual disability, such as:

        Autism Spectrum Disorder Down Syndrome Fragile X Fetal Alcohol and/or a physical
        disability, such as wheelchair use

        This decision was made because of the added resources required to evaluate these children,
        as well as the inability to sample enough of these children to adequately draw conclusions.

        No other exclusion criteria will be used.
