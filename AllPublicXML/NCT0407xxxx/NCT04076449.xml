    <textblock>
      Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM)-related epilepsy (CRE) impairs the quality of life in
      patients with CCM. Patients could not always achieve seizure freedom after surgical resection
      of the lesion, suggesting an inadequate treatment and evaluation of the epileptogenic zone or
      network. Iron deposition in cerebral cavernous malformations has been postulated to play an
      important role in triggering CRE. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), as an optimal in
      vivo imaging technique to quantify iron deposition, is employed to analyze the iron quantity
      in CCM patients with epilepsy and further combined with brain structural and connectome
      analysis, to describe the difference between CCMs with and without epilepsy. In vivo
      biomarkers predicting CRE risk in CCM natural history and CRE control outcome after CCM
      surgical resection will be further identified to improve management strategy.

      The CRESS study is a prospective observational study of imaging biomarker for cerebral
      cavernous malformation (CCM) related epilepsy (CRE) risk in natural history or after surgical
      resection. This project, funded by the National Nature Science Foundation of China, will be
      performed in two sites: Bejing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University and Peking
      University International Hospital, which cover the south and north part of Beijing. Bejing
      Tiantan Hospital is also the China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological
      Diseases and the largest neurological center with high volume of patients all over the
      nation.

      Study overview: Each participants will be followed for 5 year since enrollment. Epilepsy will
      be tracked with serial video EEG recordings and clinical investigations performed annually.
      Besides medical history of the patients, data from seizure diary and MR imaging studies
      (including quantitative susceptibility mapping, diffusion tensor imaging and three
      dimension-T1 weighted imaging), will be collected. Blood samples and tissue samples of
      surgical resected lesion for biomarkers studies will also be collected in all participants of
      the project. The data obtained in participants of CCM with or without epilepsy will be
      compared.

      Sample size: Investigators plan to enroll 200 CCM patients in 24 months and follow up for 5
      years. Based upon the preliminary results and extensive literature review, investigators
      predict that about 50% of participants will undergo surgical treatment, while 25% of
      participants remain suffering from seizure after treatment.

      Study endpoints: The primary clinical endpoint of this study is a collection of a set of
      clinical, molecular, and MRI data in all participants.

    <description>Each patient contributes five outcome measurements (at annual image of 5-year follow-up). Perilesional QSM measurements will be performed at baseline and at annual epoch of image. Perilesional mean QSM (in parts per million, ppm) in each study group will be evaluated using univariate comparison and a repeated measures analysis implemented as an unadjusted linear mixed model.</description>

    <description>Each patient contributes three outcome measurements (at year 1 and 2 and 3 after surgery). Perilesional QSM measurements will be performed at annual imaging follow-up after surgery. Mean QSM (in parts per million, ppm) in patients with or without postoperative seizure will be evaluated using univariate comparison and a repeated measures analysis implemented as an unadjusted linear mixed model.</description>
