  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of single fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy
      after surgery in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Standard radiation for
      lung cancer involves delivering small doses of daily radiation for several weeks. However,
      this technique has resulted in inferior outcomes compared to surgery and is associated with
      damage to surrounding normal lung. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment
      to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. Giving
      stereotactic body radiation therapy in fewer treatment sessions (single fraction) may kill
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess feasibility and toxicity of single-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) in the post-operative setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess quality of life following post-operative single-fraction SBRT. II. Assess rate of
      in-field failures.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess progression free survival and overall survival following post-operative SBRT for
      stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Changes in the inflammatory markers.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning at least 2 weeks after surgical resection, patients undergo 1 fraction (or 5
      fractions every other day if R2 resection of central tumor) of SBRT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 5 and 12 weeks and then
      periodically for up to 5 years.

    <measure>Time to initiation of systemic treatment (TST)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of surgery until the date of systemic treatment initiation, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>

    <description>The QoL scores, from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ Lung Cancer?Specific Module, and cumulative toxicity rates will be compared be at each time-point (starting 5 weeks after SBRT) between tumor locations using the Mann-Whitney U and Fishers exact tests, respectively. Comparisons of QoL scores between time-points will be made using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. All secondary analysis will be conducted at the 10% significance level. The QoL scores will also be examined for time trends and effects of patient characteristics using regression analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>In-field failure (IFF) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>IFF rate will be reported for the total cohort and at 3- and 5-years. The IFF will be monitored using a Bayesian approach. The monitoring will start after 3 patients have received treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>

    <time_frame>From SBRT completion until death (event) or end of study/lost to follow-up (censored), assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The OS will be described using standard Kaplan-Meier methodologies. The median survival time, 3-year survival rate, and 5-year survival rate will be estimated and presented with 90% CI.</description>
