  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Setting: Translacional Surgery Graduation Program - Universidade Federal de São Paulo and
      Hospital das Clínicas Samuel Libânio - Universidade do Vale do Sapucaí. Background: Breast
      reduction is one of the most performed plastic surgery procedures. Antibiotics are widely
      prescribed, on an empirical basis, to prevent surgical site infections. However, there is a
      lack of evidence to support its use. Objective: To compare the influence of the use of
      prophylatic antibiotics as a single dose or for 24 hours on surgical site infection rates
      following reduction mammaplasty. Methods: Randomized trial of non-inferiority, with two
      parallel groups, double blinded. A total of 146 breast hypertrophy patients, with reduction
      mammaplasty already scheduled, will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly allocated to group
      A, that will receive antibiotics only at the anesthesia induction (n=73), or to group B, that
      will receive antibiotics at the anesthesia induction and for 24 hours (n=73). None of the
      patients will receive antibiotics after hospital discharge. Patients will be followed-up
      weekly, for 30 days, regarding surgical site infection. The Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention criteria will be applied. A statistical analysis of the data will be performed.
