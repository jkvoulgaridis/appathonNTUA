  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-masked, dispensing clinical trial. A total of approximately 48 myopic and 32
      hyperopic eligible subjects will be targeted to complete the study. Subjects will be fit in
      the study lens, optimized if required and worn for approximately 2 weeks. Subjects will then
      have a washout period of approximately 1 week and be refit in the lenses and be dispensed for
      an additional 2 weeks of wear.

    <description>CLUE Vision is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™) Questionnaire. CLUE™ is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens-wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable / positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/- 3XSD).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all the following criteria to be enrolled in the
             study:

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.

               2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth
                  in this clinical protocol.

               3. The subject must be between 40 and 70 years of age at the time of screening.

               4. Subjects must own a wearable pair of spectacles if required for their distance
                  vision.

               5. The subject must be an adapted monovision soft contact lens wearer in both eyes
                  (i.e., worn lenses a minimum of 2 days per week for at least 8 hours per wear
                  day, for 1 month of more duration).

               6. The subject's distance spherical equivalent refraction must be in the range of
                  +3.50 D to -4.00 D in each eye.

               7. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤1.00 D in each eye.

               8. The subject's ADD power must be in the range of +0.75 D to +2.50 D.

               9. The subject must have best corrected distance visual acuity of 20/20-3 or better
                  in each eye.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from

               3. Use of any of the following medications within 1 week prior to enrollment: oral
                  retinoid isotretinoin (e.g. Accutane), oral tetracyclines, oral phenothiazines
                  (e.g., Haldol, Mellaril, Thorazine, Elavil, Pamelor, Compazine), systemic
                  steroids.

               4. Any previous, or planned, ocular or intraocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
                  PRK, LASIK, lid procedures, cataract surgery, retinal surgery,
                  dacryocystorhinostomy, etc.).

               5. Use of any ocular medication, with the exception of rewetting drops.

               6. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7
                  days prior to study enrollment.

               7. Employee or immediate family member of an employee of clinical site (e.g.,
                  Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).

               8. Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to OPTI-FREE® Puremoist® care
                  cleaning solution, non-preserved rewetting drop solution or sodium fluorescein.

              12. Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization,
                  corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection, or any other corneal
                  or ocular abnormalities which would contraindicate contact lens wear.

              13. Any ocular infection or inflammation.

              14. Any ocular abnormality that may interfere with contact lens wear.
