  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II, multi-centered study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENERGI-F703 GEL in subjects who are ≥ 20 years old with
      venous leg ulcer (VLU). Subjects will be recruited from multiple sites in Taiwan. The
      treatment period will be 84 days with another 84-day follow-up period.
