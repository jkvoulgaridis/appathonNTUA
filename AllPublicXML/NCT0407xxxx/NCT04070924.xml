  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper
      extremity. While carpal tunnel release (CTR), both open (OCTR) and endoscopic (ECTR), is safe
      and effective, there are questions regarding the use of postoperative dressings after
      surgery. It is not currently known if dressing choices influence post-operative pain,
      function or patient satisfaction after ECTR. A less cumbersome dressing (bandaid) may allow
      patients to perform daily tasks with more ease after surgery. The purpose of this
      investigation is to compare postoperative pain scores and patient satisfaction after ECTR for
      patients treated with conventional post-operative bulky soft tissue dressings versus those
      treated with a bandaid after surgery. The hypothesis is that patients using a bandaid after
      surgery will have an easier time with functional tasks after surgery and that pain scores
      will not significantly differ between the two groups. Furthermore, this study aims to
      determine if there are differences in patient satisfaction, functional outcomes,
      complications, and unscheduled healthcare contact between these two groups. This will be a
      randomized, controlled investigation.

      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper
      extremity. While carpal tunnel release (CTR), both open (OCTR) and endoscopic (ECTR), is safe
      and effective, there are questions regarding the use of postoperative dressings after
      surgery. With recent attention to the opioid epidemic, there have been increasing efforts to
      reduce narcotic usage postoperatively while still controlling expected postoperative pain.
      Recent authors have found that many patients, particularly older patients, do not require any
      opioid analgesia after CTR with 47% of men and 36% of women consuming no narcotics after CTR
      (CHAPMAN). Furthermore, while splints have historically been used after surgery, their need
      has recently been questioned (LOGLI). It is not currently known if dressing choices influence
      post-operative pain, function or patient satisfaction after ECTR. A less cumbersome dressing
      (bandaid) may allow patients to perform daily tasks with more ease after surgery.

      The purpose of this investigation is to compare postoperative pain scores and patient
      satisfaction after ECTR for patients treated with conventional post-operative bulky soft
      tissue dressings versus those treated with a bandaid after surgery. The hypothesis is that
      patients using a bandaid after surgery will have an easier time with functional tasks after
      surgery and that pain scores will not significantly differ between the two groups.
      Furthermore, this study aims to determine if there are differences in patient satisfaction,
      functional outcomes, complications, and unscheduled healthcare contact between these two
      groups. This will be a randomized, controlled investigation.
