             resting ECG and any clinically important abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG which, in
             the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval
             changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave morphology.

         11. ECG interval measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave (QT)

             administration of IP or longer if the medication has a long half life.

         24. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed oral and topical inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4
             (including shampoo).

             visit, whichever is the longest. Note: subjects consented and screened, but not
             randomized in this study or a previous Phase I study, are not excluded.

             they have any ongoing or recent (ie, during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.

         30. Subjects who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions.
