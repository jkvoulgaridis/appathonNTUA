    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib Study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Venetoclax in
      combination with Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin(GO) in subjects with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia. Using a standard 3+3 design, subjects will receive once cycle of combination
      therapy. After one cycle of combination therapy, subjects showing response will continue on
      to one cycle of consolidation therapy with GO\Veneoclax. Subjects who respond to combination
      therapy will continue on maintenance Venetoclax until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Dose-limiting toxicity, defined as an adverse event related (possible, probably, or definite)
      to Venetoclax and/or Gemtuzumab fulfilling one of the following criteria:

        -  Hematologic toxicity: treatment-related grade 4 or worse bone marrow hypocellularity
           present at the end of cycle one (day 28); specifically grade 4 cytopenias (anemia,
           neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia) with the bone marrow documented to be free of
           leukemic infiltration. Note: patients who enter the study with grade 3 or worse
           cytopenias will not be evaluable for hematologic dose-limiting toxicities.

        -  Non-hematologic toxicity: any grade 3 or worse treatment-related toxicity (excluding
           grade 4 infections during cycle one).

      The study will also evaluate the Overall Response Rate, Anti-leukemic activity, Relapse-free
      Survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS) , and overall survival (OS). The study will
      evaluate quality of life using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of
      Cancer 30 item questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).
