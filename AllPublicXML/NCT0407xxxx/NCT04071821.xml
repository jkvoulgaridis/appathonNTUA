    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>PK blood samples to measure plasma concentrations of cetirizine will be collected by direct venipuncture or by use of an indwelling cannula. Blood will be collected into tubes containing K2EDTA for determination of plasma cetirizine concentration at time 0 (within 60 minutes pre-dose), 10, 20 minute post-dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 hours post-dose. Plasma cetirizine concentrations will be listed at each time point by subject and summarized by treatment at each time point using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD), Coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum and maximum values). Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed based on actual time of blood sample collection, using non-compartmental methods with Phoenix WinNonlin Version 8.1 (Certara USA, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, USA). Plots of mean concentrations of plasma cetirizine versus time will be generated and Cmax will be generated from the plot.</description>

    <measure>area under the plasma drug concentration versus time curve (AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>AUC will be determined using non-compartmental analysis methods (Phoenix WinNonlin software, version 8.1 or higher, Certara USA Inc., Princeton, NJ). AUC will be calculated to the last measurable observation (AUC0-t) and extrapolated to infinity (AUC0 ∞).</description>

    <measure>incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AE) will be coded using a standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Version 22,0 or higher. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) will be documented throughout the study from the time a subject receives the first dose of study drug until 7 days after the subject receives the last dose of study drug.</description>
