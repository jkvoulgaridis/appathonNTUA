      Background: Antioxidants are substances that are considered as a defensive material which
      protects cells from destruction. It is evident that use of food stuff rich in antioxidant
      will fortify one's ability to encounter with physical &amp; mental disorders. Since, among
      several potential elucidations, oxidative stress is more likely deliberated as one of the
      causative factors which give rise to cognitive and functional impairment. This deterioration
      further result in intricacy in ones thought process as progressive brain changes crop-up
      schizophrenic unfold. Therefore, this study was conducted with objectives to explore the role
      of selected antioxidants (vitamin C &amp; E) and to compare the role of both vitamins as an
      add-on management of schizophrenia .Materials &amp; Methods: One hundred and five patients were
      selected from department of psychiatry King Edward Medical University Lahore, and assigned
      into 3 groups by simple random lottery method. For eight weeks, Vitamin C group intervened
      with 500mg vitamin C tablet once a day, vitamin E group with 600IU vitamin E twice daily and
      placebo group was given 500 mg paraffin oil capsule daily. PANSS scale was used to assess the
      symptoms of schizophrenia. Demographic information was collected by structured questionnaire.
      Dietary habits were assessed by food frequency questionnaire.

    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia.The PANSS yields a total average symptom score, based on 30 items rated from one to seven (range=30-210). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>
