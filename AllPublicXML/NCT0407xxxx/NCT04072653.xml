  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several researches have proved that avoiding axillary surgery does not worsen the outcome of
      breast cancer patients with relatively low risk. Based on the routine axillary imaging
      evaluation (ultrasound and MR etc.) and latest dedicate lymph node PET (LymphPET), axillary
      nodal burden can be identified before operation.

      Therefore this prospective study are designed to evaluate the negative predictive value of
      LymphPET and to verify whether sentinel lymph node biopsy can be spared in patients with
      negative preoperative axillary assessment.

    <description>breast self evaluation for patients with negative preoperative axillary and for whom axillary surgery is spared, as assessed by BREAST Q© index. The BREAST-Q has a modular, procedure-specific structure with scales that evaluate both satisfaction and quality of life. Psychometric evaluation reveals high reliability, validity and responsiveness to surgical intervention across all scales. Breast Q is composed of aesthetical and emotional modules, and each score ranges from 1 to 4 points (higher values represent a better self evaluation). By comparing the sum of the score in different modules before and after the surgery, Breast Q can help to facilitate a self evaluation for breast cancer patients.</description>
