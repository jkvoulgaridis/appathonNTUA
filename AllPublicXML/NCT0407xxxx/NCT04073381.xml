  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to measure surgical recovery, including the length of
      hospital stay, incidence of perioperative complications, and mortality at 90 days
      post-surgery, in surgical patients with abdominal cancer. The investigators hypothesize that
      this prehabilitation program will improve recovery and reduce perioperative complications via
      the proposed prehabilitation intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that steps to augment and optimize the effectiveness of
      prehabilitation interventions for abdominal cancer patients may be found in the field of
      sport science. The investigators have identified two primary strategies to improve and
      optimize prehabilitation in patients with abdominal cancer: exercise and nutritional
      supplementation. A home-based exercise program incorporating both walking and resistance
      training will be performed with blood flow restriction training (BFR). BFR is a cutting-edge
      training modality that works by restricting blood flow out of the veins by using compression
      devices similar to traditional blood pressure cuffs (1). This training modality is frequently
      used by injured athletes for enhanced recovery (2). Muscle hypertrophy and increased muscle
      strength are more robust and achievable with BFR, even if exercises are performed at low to
      moderate intensities (2). Additionally, the implementation of a sports nutrition supplement
      cocktail, which will be provided simultaneously with the 4-week BFR exercise intervention,
      was developed to augment the effects of resistance exercise by increasing overall anabolism
      (3) and to remedy the catabolic state that cancer patients often experience (4). The
      nutrition supplement cocktail will include whey protein, creatine monohydrate, and
      L-citrulline.

Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>This is a 4 week prehabilitation program which uses both exercise and nutrition. Exercise will be prescribed at least 6 days a week. Three days a week , for 45 mins, participants will be asked to perform body, leg and arm exercises against light resistance while wearing pneumatic blood flow restriction arm and leg bands. minutes. On the alternate days participants will walk approximately 15 minutes while wearing the leg bands that restrict blood flow. Additionally, a nutrition supplement cocktail will be provided and should be taken every day within 1 hour after completing each exercise session. The 4 Week Nutrition (Sports Drink) Supplement Cocktail: will include whey protein (25 g/day), creatine monohydrate (8 g/day), and L-citrulline (5 g/day). The supplement mixture will be provided in daily packages by the investigators (nutrition supplements are not regulated by the FDA)</description>
