  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will evaluate yoga as a treatment for chronic musculoskeletal pain.
      The experimental treatment is yoga delivered via a tablet computer to participants at home
      (&quot;teleyoga&quot;). First, the investigators will develop a suitable protocol for teleyoga. Second,
      the investigators will demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled
      trial involving randomization to teleyoga or in-person yoga groups.

  <detailed_description>

      The first phase of the study is not randomized. In this phase, the first group of
      participants (n=10) will all participate in a tele-yoga class using an iPad loaned to them by
      the study. They will attend this treatment session from the comfort of their home or a
      location of their choice. Yoga treatment will last 12 weeks. At the end of treatment,
      veterans will provide feedback by completing a satisfaction questionnaire to rate various
      aspects of the teleyoga (e.g. technical challenges, ability to perform yoga through the
      video-conferencing platform, problems that occurred, and recommendations to improve the
      class, etc). The teleyoga protocol will be modified on the basis of this feedback and will be
      tested on a second group of participants (n=10). The second phase of the study will involve
      randomization of a further group of participants (n=30) to either the teleyoga developed in
      phase one, or in-person yoga.
