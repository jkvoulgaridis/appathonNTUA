    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in damage to the descending neural pathways and leads to the
      immediate dysfunction of multiple physiological systems below the level of injury. Like
      adults, children with SCI suffer from neuromuscular paralysis which results in the inability
      to sit, stand, and walk. Current therapeutic interventions largely aim to compensate for
      paralysis to achieve mobility based on the assumption that damage to the central nervous
      system is permanent and irreversible, e.g. use of braces, standers, and wheelchairs. The
      objective of this proposal is to investigate the use of transcutaneous spinal stimulation
      (TcStim) to enable stepping in children with chronic SCI.

      The investigators will recruit 19 participants, ages 4-12 years with chronic, acquired SCI,
      T12 and above and non-ambulatory. The aims of this proposal are to 1) investigate the
      mechanisms of locomotor-specific regulation in the spinal neural circuitry of children with
      acquired SCI using single vs. multi-site TcStim, 2) investigate the capacity of the
      lumbosacral spinal cord for integration of task-specific input (e.g. load, speed) during
      facilitated stepping with and without TcStim, and 3) investigate the acute and training
      effects of TcStim on the ability to step. Outcomes will provide a necessary initial step in
      the translation of scientific findings for neuromodulation from adults with SCI to children.

    <textblock>
      Like in adults, children with spinal cord injury (SCI) in children suffer from neuromuscular
      paralysis which results in the inability to sit, stand, and walk. Current therapeutic
      interventions, e.g. leg braces, wheelchairs, largely aim to compensate for paralysis based on
      the assumption that damage to the central nervous system is permanent and irreversible.The
      discovery of the &quot;intelligent&quot; spinal cord, known as the central pattern generator (CPG), has
      demonstrated that complex neuronal networks are capable of generating rhythmic and
      coordinated motor patterns and has set forth a major paradigm shift in the investigators
      expectation of the possibility for recovery even with severe SCI. Studies have demonstrated,
      first, that after SCI, the CPG can be &quot;accessed&quot;, reactivated, and retrained via sensory
      feedback arising from the muscles and joints during activity-based locomotor training
      (AB-LT). Second, application of epidural and transcutaneous stimulation (TcStim) to the
      spinal cord below the level of lesion can augment the neuromuscular capacity for voluntary
      movement, standing and stepping in adults with chronic motor complete SCI. While neural
      mechanisms for stepping regulation have been demonstrated in adults testing single vs.
      multi-site stimulation, this inherent capacity must be examined in children with SCI.
      Similarly, the addition of stimulation during AB-LT in adults with motor complete SCI has
      resulted in remarkable recovery of over ground walking. The immediate and long-term response
      of such combined therapeutic exposure and subsequent training has yet to be examined in
      children. Children with SCI may not only benefit from these novel therapeutic approaches but
      also demonstrate greater improvements in neuromuscular recovery due to inherent plasticity.
      The investigators' preliminary work has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of TcStim in
      children with SCI. Therefore, the specific aims of this proposal are to 1) investigate the
      spinal mechanisms for regulation of locomotor circuitry in children with SCI using TcStim, 2)
      assess whether the combination of task-specific AB-LT and TcStim can acutely potentiate lower
      limb muscle activity during facilitated stepping, and 3) assess the acute and training
      effects of TcStim to promote stepping capacity in non-ambulatory children with SCI.

      For this pilot study 19 participants, ages 4-12 years with chronic, acquired SCI, T12 and
      above and non-ambulatory will be recruited.

      For Aim 1, n=8, TcStim will be used to stimulate a single or multi site spinal levels to
      produce stepping/locomotor activity in lower limbs. Knee, hip, ankle kinematics and
      electromyography (EMG) of the lower limb muscles in response to stimulation will be recorded
      during the experiments. The investigators will determine the stimulation parameters that
      produce rhythmic movements with the greatest increase in lower limb joint excursions as well
      as EMG amplitude.

      For Aim 2, n=8, TcStim will be delivered while participants are stepping on a computerized
      treadmill with an overhead partial body weight support (BWS) system. The participants will be
      stepped at age-appropriate speeds and BWS optimizing the stepping kinematics. The speed and
      the amount of body weight support provided during the assessment as well as full body
      kinematics and EMG signals from trunk and lower limb muscles will be recorded during
      facilitated stepping with and without TcStim.

      For Aim 3, n=3, participants will receive AB-LT alone daily (5 times/week) for 60 sessions
      followed by 60 sessions of AB-LT+Tcstim. Ability to initiate and complete a step overground
      with and without stimulation along with full body kinematics and electromyographic (EMG)
      signals from trunk and lower limb muscles will be recorded at baseline, after 20, and 60
      sessions of AB-LT alone and at baseline, 20, and 60 sessions of the combined therapy of AB-LT
      plus TcStim.

    <description>Ability to take step independently with minimal or no external support. Participant can use a walker or other assistive device for balance and support. The participant will stand independently and lift a limb/foot off the ground and step forward making the same foot contact the ground in front as when taking a first step. This will be measured via movement observation by a licensed physical therapist and videotaped. A single step is all that is required. If more than one step is observed, this information will be documented and also videotaped. No manual assistance will be provided during the assessment for a voluntary step. The achievement of an independent step, foot leaves the ground and is placed forward, is the only criteria for the 'step'.</description>
