      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, phase I trial to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of gemcitabine combined with apatinib and toripalimab in patients with the
      recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline, before each
      study treatment, and throughout the study.Tumor response will be assessed by radiographic
      examination in screening visit and every 2 cycles after first dose.

    <description>The safety will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will also be conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 18-70 years of age.

             carcinoma, or subjects with recurrent NPC that is unfit for local treatment.

          3. Subjects with recurrent and metastatic NPC who did't receive any Systemic
             chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, concurrent radiochemotherapy and adjuvant
             chemotherapy 6 month before first dose are excepted.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          5. Life expectancy more than 12 weeks.

          6. Subjects enrolled must have measurable lesion(s) according to response evaluation
             criteria in solid (RECIST) v1.1.

          7. Adequate organ function assessed by laboratory parameters during the screening period

          8. Female subjects agree not to be pregnant or lactating from beginning of the study
             screening through at least 3 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment.
             Both men and women of reproductive potential must be willing and able to employ a
             highly effective method of birth control/contraception to prevent pregnancy. A highly
             effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure
             rate, that is, less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly

          9. Able to understand and sign an informed consent form (ICF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with any active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease, or

             tumor fever may be enrolled);

          7. History of immunodeficiency including seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), or other acquired or congenital immune-deficient disease;

          8. Any other medical (eg, pulmonary, metabolic, congenital, endocrinal, or CNS disease),
             psychiatric, or social condition deemed by the investigator to be likely to interfere
