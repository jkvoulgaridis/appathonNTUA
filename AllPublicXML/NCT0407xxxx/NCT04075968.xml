    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of cognitive rehabilitation in group with
      physical exercise in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. We assume that cognitive therapy is an
      effective treatment for multiple sclerosis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuro-psychometric Test (NPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>It is a test that evaluates memory, working memory, planning, organization, attendance span.Evaluation is made according to the number of items filled. The higher number items filled indicates the better status</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale which consists of 14 items. Each item is scored on a five-point scale (0-4).The maximum score for this assessment is 56 and the minimum score for this assessment is 0. Scores below 45 indicate balance impairment. The higher point indicates the better status</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Mental State Test (MMST)</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a test that evaluates different subset of cognitive status including attention, memory, language, orientation, visuospatial proficiency. It is scored on a scale of 0-30 with scores. Scores above 25 are interpreted as normal cognitive status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS is a 6-point rating scale which assesses muscle tone by manually manipulating the joint through its available range of motion and clinically recording the resistance to passive movements. The lower point indicates the better status</description>
