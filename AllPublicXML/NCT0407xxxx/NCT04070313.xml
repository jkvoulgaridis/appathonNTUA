         11. Written informed consent given

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient previously received adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer

          2. Patient previously received S-1 treatment and concurrent using other
             fluoropyrimidine-group anti-cancer drugs, combination therapies with them (such as
