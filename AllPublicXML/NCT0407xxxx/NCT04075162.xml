    <textblock>
      Current approaches in primary prevention for cardiovascular disease are based on
      probabilistic approaches to estimate risk, using many of the widely available cardiovascular
      risks scores, with over 100 such scoring systems currently available throughout the world.
      The rationale for this practice is to select those individuals at greatest risk for more
      intense targets, reduce risk of treatment to those at minimal risk, and to maximize the
      cost-effectiveness of treatment. A recent Cochrane Systematic Review assessed the practice of
      using risk scores to select individuals for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
      3 The principal finding of the systematic review was that there was little or no effect of
      providing clinicians with cardiovascular risk scores when compared to standard of care (5.4%
      versus 5.3%; relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence intervals 0.95 to 1.08). The authors
      concluded that there is major uncertainty whether current strategies for providing risk
      scores and called for further research to address this concern. Extent of coronary artery
      calcium (CAC) is a strong risk marker for coronary events, with evidence mainly derived from
      observational studies and from prospective non-randomized studies. CAC, although endorsed for
      intermediate risk patients, is not widely adopted due to barriers in reimbursement. The cost
      of the test ranges between 100 and 300 USD in the United States, which may have limited the
      wide adoption of the test. Whether reducing the cost burden for CAC increases utilization for
      routine screening and its influence on physician practices and downstream testing is largely
      unknown. University Hospitals started offering low charge CAC (99$) since 2014. In 2017,
      University Hospitals started offering CAC for no charge for patients to improve access to
      this test, which has not traditionally been covered by insurance companies. The impact of
      no-charge CAC has never been studied.
