  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determined effects of a cognitive distraction on amount, preference, and memory of
      food consumed and perceptions of fullness, hunger, and enjoyment of food in a healthy
      young-adult population. A randomized controlled crossover study of 119 healthy adults,
      assigned to begin in either the distracted or control condition, was conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Environmental distractions have been shown to affect eating patterns. Influences of food
      environments on consumption patterns and not simply food choices are becoming increasingly
      clear for their contributions to energy intake. Of particular interest is the presence of
      distraction. It has been postulated that when distracted, individuals are inclined to
      consumer more than when not distracted. However, how distraction and memory impact subsequent
      food choice and preference is less well known. A Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP)
      task was applied to distract individuals while eating; food intake and food behaviors were
      measured after RVIP distraction and compared to food intake and food behaviors without
      distraction in the same individuals.
