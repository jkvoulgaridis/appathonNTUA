  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis affects around 4% of world population. The disease could be disabling and
      disfiguring dermatologic condition. World Health Organization (WHO) has recently drawn the
      attention to the inadequate treatment options psoriasis patients suffer from among other
      problems. Furthermore, the available treatment options have many side effects. A lot of the
      effective treatment options are either expensive or not appropriate for hepatic patients who
      represent a large subset of Egyptian psoriatic patients. This highlights the need for
      inexpensive and safe alternative. The effectiveness of Turmeric in psoriasis treatment have
      been addressed in few reports. Having an immune modulatory effect especially as anti NFκB it
      is expected to be effective therapy with minimal side effect. Up to the investigator's
      knowledge this is the first study addressing the efficacy of combined turmeric and olive oil
      based topical therapy in psoriasis treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a prevalent skin disorder. It affects around 4% of world's population. It can be
      disfiguring and disabling in severe cases. There is dysregulated immune response in psoriatic
      patients to unknown injurious agents with upregulation of Th1/Th17 pathways which is mediated
      via Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFκB). NFκB is a key player in psoriasis development; its
      activation and nuclear translocation is present in every step of the way of psoriasis
      starting from keratinocyte release of cytokines -in response to stress- to the maturation and
      activation of dendritic cells, to the continuous loop of T cell activation.

      Turmeric extract has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial and anti-carcinogenic
      effects. It has inhibitory effects on NF-κB and various cytokines production.

      In this clinical trial 5 groups of patients with mild to moderate psoriasis are recruited;
      group (A) Receiving the Turmeric extract based ointment only. Group (B) receiving Turmeric
      extract + olive oil based treatment. Group (C) will serve as negative control receiving only
      petrolatum base. Group (D) will receive NB UVB serving as positive control. Group (E) will
      receive established topical treatment serving as positive control.

      Each patient will be assessed on weekly bases clinically for the disease severity using PASI
      score and via dermatoscope. Histopathological evaluation (H&amp; E along with NFkB expression
      analysis) will be done at 4 points of time baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks through the
      study.

    <measure>Change in Psoriasis Area &amp; Severity Index (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response to therapy is assessed via measurement of (PASI) every week for 12 w. The range of PASI score is from 0 (no disease) - 72 (sever disease). In PASI, the body is divided into four sections (head; arms; trunk; legs). Each of the sections is scored by itself, and then the four scores are combined into the final PASI. For each section, area of involved skin is given a grade from 0 to 6: 0= 0% of involved area, 1 = &lt; 10% involved, 2=10-29% involved, 3 =30-49% involved area, 4 = 50-69% involved, 5 =70-89% involved, 6 = 90-100%involved. Within each section, the severity is estimated in three clinical parameters: erythema (redness), induration (thickness) and desquamation (scaling). Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 4, from none to maximum. The sum of three severity parameters is calculated for each section of body, multiplied by the area score for that section and multiplied by weight of respective section (0.1 for head, 0.2 for arms, 0.3 for body and 0.4 for legs).</description>
