  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending oral
      doses of ASP1617 in healthy adult non-Asian and Japanese male and female participants.

      This study also evaluate the pharmacokinetics and determine the effect of food on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of ASP1617.

      After a screening period of up to 29 days prior to study drug administration, eligible
      participants will be residential for a single period of 6 days/5 nights in Part 1: single
      ascending dose, and 18 days in Part 2 multiple ascending dose.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigational product (IP) and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP.
AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if the investigator or sponsor view any of the following outcomes: Death, life-threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, hospitalization, or medically important event.
An AE with onset at any time from first dosing until last scheduled procedure will be classified as a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). A drug-related TEAE is defined as any TEAE with a causal relationship assessed as &quot;yes&quot; by the investigator, or records where the relationship is missing.</description>
