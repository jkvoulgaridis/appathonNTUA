  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the study are to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate
      intervention to reduce SHS exposure for LEP Korean women using a family-focused intervention
      approach targeting Korean Americans ages 18 and above in the greater San Francisco Bay Area,
      CA, and to evaluate efficacy of the proposed intervention. The study is a single group
      feasibility trial targeting a total of 4 lay health workers (LHW) and 24 dyads of LEP Korean
      women with self-reported SHS exposure at home and a male household smoker. The hypothesis is:

      H. Can a family-based intervention approach reduce SHS exposure among Korean American women
      who live with a current smoker?

    <description>Quit Smoking For a Healthy Family - This is a family-based psycho-education intervention using lay health worker (LHW) outreach. LHW will be trained to recruit smoke-family dyads and provide education and information about tobacco and health, and smoking cessation resources through 2 small-group education sessions and 2 individual phone calls over a 2-month period.</description>
