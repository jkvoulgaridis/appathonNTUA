      BACKGROUND Treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome with exogenous surfactant and
      mechanical ventilation made millions of preterm infants survived in neonatal intensive care
      unit (NICU). Endotracheal intubation surfactant administration is related to invasive
      intubation and short periods of positive pressure ventilation and implies the risk of lung
      injury. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or NIPPV (Non-invasive positive pressure
      ventilation) with surfactant but without intubation may work synergistically. This randomized
      trial investigated a minimal invasive surfactant administration (MISA). To test the
      hypothesis that MISA increases survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks'
      gestational age in very low birth weight infants.

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Minimal Invasive Surfactant Administration (MISA) was a
      multicenter, randomized, clinical, parallel-group study conducted between July 1st, 2017, and
      November 30, 2018, in 8 level III neonatal intensive care units in Beijing, Tianjin, and
      Hebei province, China. The final follow-up date was March 30, 2019. Participants enrolled
      spontaneously breathing preterm infants born between 26.1 and 31.9 weeks' gestational age
      with signs of respiratory distress syndrome. In an intention-to-treat design, infants were
      randomly assigned to receive surfactant (Calf pulmonary surfactant, Double-Crane
      Pharmaceutical Co., China) either via a 5Fr nasogastric tube during CPAP/NIPPV-assisted
      spontaneous breathing (minimal invasive surfactant administration group, MISA group) or after
      conventional endotracheal intubation during mechanical ventilation (endotracheal intubation
      surfactant administration group, EISA group).

      INTERVENTION MISA via a 5Fr nasogastric tube with an ophthalmic surgery straight forceps.
