        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  The subject has a body mass index 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening.

          -  The subject is judged by the investigator to be in good general health, as determined
             by medical history, clinical laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, 12 lead
             electrocardiogram results, and physical examination findings at screening.

          -  The subject is able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a medical history of any issues affecting absorption or metabolism, as
             judged by the investigator.

          -  The subject has a medical history of any problems affecting venous access or
             bowel/bladder function.

          -  The subject has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
             virus antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus types 1 or 2 antibodies at screening.

          -  The subject has used any prescription or over the counter medications (except
             paracetamol [up to 2 g per day]), including herbal or nutritional supplements, within
             14 days before the first dose of study drug.

          -  The subject has consumed grapefruit or grapefruit juice, Seville orange or Seville
             orange containing products (eg, marmalade), or caffeine- or xanthine containing
             products within 48 hours before the first dose of study drug or during the study.

          -  The subject has a positive test result for drugs of abuse, alcohol, or cotinine
             (indicating active current smoking) at screening or before the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  The subject is involved in strenuous activity or contact sports within 24 hours before
             the first dose of study drug or during the study.

          -  The subject has donated blood or blood products &gt;450 mL within 30 days before the
             first dose of study drug.

          -  The subject has a history of relevant drug and/or food allergies (ie, allergy to study
             drug or excipients, or any significant food allergy that could preclude a standard
             diet in the clinical unit).
