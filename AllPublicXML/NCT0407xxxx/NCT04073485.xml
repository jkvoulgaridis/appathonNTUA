  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of Microwave ablation
      (MWA) in treating patients with uterine fibroid.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is another form of thermal ablation that has been
      used for the treatment of uterine fibroids. Although RFA is more invasive when compared to
      High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU), the treatment is less limited by the location of
      the lesions, and the treatment procedure is more time efficient. To further improve the
      technology of thermal ablation for uterine fibroid, percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA)
      could be a promising option because it allows increased efficiency of energy transmission and
      reduction in procedure time, and may allow effective treatment of large lesions.

    <description>The uterine fibroid will be identified and located with ultrasonography. A microwave electrode appropriate for the size of target lesion is placed into the target lesion under ultrasound guidance. Appropriate microwave power and application time are selected to provide sufficient ablation coverage to the target lesion.</description>
