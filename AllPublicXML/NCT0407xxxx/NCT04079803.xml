      This is a Phase 2b, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, multiple dose study of
      PTI-125 in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. A total of sixty (60) patients will
      be enrolled in the study. Patients will receive Placebo, 50 mg or 100 mg b.i.d. of PTI-125.
      The objective of this study are to investigate the safety, and biomarkers of PTI-125
      following 28-day repeat oral administration.
