  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapy is a new modality of cancer treatment with a
      unique mechanism that has gained increased numbers of indication and is now used in several
      cancer types. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) emerge as a new entity of
      diseases involving one or multiple organ systems. irAEs could result in interruption of
      immunotherapy, morbidities of patients or even death. Among various manifestations of irAEs,
      endocrinopathy and metabolic diseases are rare but important, and require prompt diagnosis
      and treatment to avoid life-threatening conditions.

      Thus, we intend to review cases from NTUH who developed endocrinopathy and metabolic diseases
      after immunotherapy, and statistically analyzed their age, clinical presentation, image
      findings, treatment and its response. We will also review literatures to evaluate the
      difference and similarity from previous diagnostic and treatment experience.
