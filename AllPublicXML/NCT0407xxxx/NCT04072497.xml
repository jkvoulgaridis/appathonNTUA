  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a herpesvirus that causes two distinct clinical
      syndromes.Primary infection is manifested as varicella (chickenpox), whereas reactivation of
      latent VZV results in a localized eruption known as herpes zoster. Most people 40 years of
      age or older had evidence of previous VZV infection. This study plans to have 522 adults
      above 40 years old involoved in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an
      investigational live attenuated zoster vaccine. The investigational vaccine is produced by
      Shanghai Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd. The safety and immunogenicity of the
      zoster vaccine is evaluated.
