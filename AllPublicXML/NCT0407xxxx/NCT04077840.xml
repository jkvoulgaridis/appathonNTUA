  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, a new gluten- or wheat-related disease has emerged, a condition labelled
      &quot;non-celiac gluten sensitivity&quot; (NCGS) or &quot;non-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS). Given the
      lack of a diagnostic biomarker, NCGS/NCWS mostly remains a diagnosis of exclusion, especially
      respect to CD and WA, so a confirmatory test is required. The Salerno experts suggested the
      double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC), cross-over, gluten/wheat challenge as the gold
      standard test to discriminate true NCGS/NCWS patients. There are conflicting data about the
      real mechanisms which induce symptoms in NCGS/NCWS patients after wheat ingestion. Some
      Authors suggested a prevalent role for Fermentable
      Oligosaccharides-Disaccharides-Monosaccharides and Polyols (FODMAPs), rather than gluten in
      determining the symptoms. Other studies underlined the activation of mechanisms of both
      innate and acquired immunity in NCWS patients, after wheat ingestion. In the present study,
      we included a group of consecutive NCWS patients, diagnosed with DBPC wheat challenge, to
      evaluate a) the frequency of autoimmune diseases, b) the frequency and pattern of serum ANA
      and other non-organ-specific and/or organ-specific autoantibodies, and c) the possible
      correlations between autoimmune diseases and serum autoantibodies presence and other
      NCWS-related disease characteristics, in comparison with age- and sex- matched healthy blood
      donors and IBS patients unrelated to NCWS.

      In recent years, a new gluten- or wheat-related disease has emerged, a condition labelled
      &quot;non-celiac gluten sensitivity&quot; (NCGS) or &quot;non-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS). This is very
      often a self-reported condition, since patients refer to intestinal (mainly irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS)-like) and/or extra-intestinal symptoms (i.e. fatigue, headache) caused by
      gluten or wheat ingestion, even though they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy
      (WA). Given the lack of a diagnostic biomarker, NCGS/NCWS mostly remains a diagnosis of
      exclusion, especially respect to CD and WA, so a confirmatory test is required. The Salerno
      experts suggested the double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC), cross-over, gluten/wheat
      challenge as the gold standard test to discriminate true NCGS/NCWS patients.

      However, there are conflicting data about the real mechanisms which induce symptoms in
      NCGS/NCWS patients after wheat ingestion. Some Authors suggested a prevalent role for
      Fermentable Oligosaccharides-Disaccharides-Monosaccharides and Polyols (FODMAPs), rather than
      gluten in determining the symptoms. Other studies underlined the activation of mechanisms of
      both innate and acquired immunity in NCWS patients, after wheat ingestion. In line with the
      evidence of an immunologic activation in NCWS, we showed in a previous study that about one
      quarter of NCWS patients suffered from associated autoimmune diseases (mainly Hashimoto's
      thyroiditis), compared with a smaller proportion of a control group including IBS patients
      (about 3%). Furthermore, we showed that serum samples of NCWS patients tested positive for
      anti-nuclear (ANA) in more than one third of the cases. However, that study included mainly
      patients evaluated in a retrospective manner and no other autoantibodies were evaluated apart
      from ANA.

      In the present study, we included a group of consecutive NCWS patients, diagnosed with DBPC
      wheat challenge, to evaluate a) the frequency of autoimmune diseases, b) the frequency and
      pattern of serum ANA and other non-organ-specific and/or organ-specific autoantibodies, and
      c) the possible correlations between autoimmune diseases and serum autoantibodies presence
      and other NCWS-related disease characteristics, in comparison with age- and sex- matched
      healthy blood donors and IBS patients unrelated to NCWS.

    <description>The presence of autoimmune disorders both in NCWS and IBS control patients was evaluated by a structured questionnaire and a review of patients' clinical records. The presence of one of the following was looked for in all subjects: connective tissue diseases, autoimmune endocrinological diseases, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, epilepsy with cerebral calcification, unexplained cerebellar ataxia, alopecia, psoriasis, atrophic autoimmune gastritis, and immune anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia.</description>

        We prospectively surveyed 58 adult patients with a definitive diagnosis of NCWS, based on
        DBPC wheat challenge, most of them suffering from IBS-like-clinical presentation, according
        to Rome IV criteria. The patients were consecutively recruited between January 2016 and
        October 2017 at the outpatient clinics of the Department of Internal Medicine of the
        University Hospital of Palermo and the Department of Internal Medicine of the Hospital of
        Sciacca (both in southern Italy). Two control groups were selected. One included 76
        consecutive healthy blood donors sex- (+ 5%) and age-matched (+ 2 years) with the NCWS
        patients, while the second included 55 patients with a diagnosis of IBS unrelated to NCWS
        or other types of food &quot;intolerance/allergy&quot;, who were consecutively recruited during the
        study period and sex- (+ 5%) and age-matched (+ 2 years) with the NCWS patients.
