  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This an open label study using a FDA-cleared TMS stimulation protocols which will be used to
      treat patients who have responded or remitted from depression using acute clinical TMS
      therapy at the University of Missouri-Columbia Neuromodulation Clinic. TMS therapy will be
      given to subjects at monthly intervals. Depression severity questionnaires will be given
      monthly to determine if the subjects original response to TMS can be maintained. Subjects
      will be tapered down from antidepressant medication prior to TMS maintenance treatment.
      Results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of maintenance TMS
      therapies in a clinical setting.

      This an open label study using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a maintenance
      treatment for subjects that have seen a clinically significant response or remission from
      their depressive symptoms after having had an acute clinical course of TMS. All potential
      subjects must have been treated at the University of Missouri Columbia Neuromodulation Clinic
      to qualify.

      There are 2 arms in this study. The first is a group of patients who will not receive any TMS
      treatments and will be followed for a year, and have their depression severity assessed
      monthly using the Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), and the Quick Inventory of Depressive
      Symptoms.

      The second arm will receive TMS treatments 5 times/month for 12 months, be assessed for
      changes in depressive symptom severity monthly using the PHQ9 and QIDS. TMS treatment
      protocols will consist of wither the standard 20min 10Hz protocol, or a 3min theta-burst
      protocol. The protocol used will be determined by what worked for the subject when they were
      treated clinically at the University of Missouri Columbia Neuromodulation clinic. Subjects in
      this arm will be tapered of antidepressant medication prior to monthly TMS treatment and will
      remain antidepressant free for the duration of the study.

      The study will be a year long in duration.
