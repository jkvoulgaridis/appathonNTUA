      The objective of this study is to provide simple and relevant clinical and biological
      elements to distinguish a possible Congenital Thrombocytopenia from a Chronic Idiopathic
      Thrombocytopenic Purpura .

      Congenital Thrombocytopenia is a group of rare diseases, often unrecognized and misdiagnosed
      as Chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. These Chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic
      Purpura, which are exclusion diagnoses, are most often treated with corticosteroids or
      intravenous immunoglobulins and sometimes, when thrombocytopenia is refractory, splenectomy
      is performed. Currently, it is often before a case of thrombocytopenia refractory to the
      treatment of the dysimmunity syndrome that the notion of Congenital Thrombocytopenia is
      evoked. The percentage of false diagnoses (misdiagnosed Chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic
      Purpura diagnoses) seems to represent to date 10 to 20% of cases.

      The objective of this study is to provide simple and relevant clinical and biological
      elements to distinguish a possible Congenital Thrombocytopenia from a Chronic Idiopathic
      Thrombocytopenic Purpura.
