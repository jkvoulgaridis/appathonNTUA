  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Patients with decreased kidney function are in the positive acid balance due to insufficient
      renal acid excretion. To correct the varying degrees of metabolic acidosis in these HD
      patients, a high concentration of HCO3 in the dialysate is routinely used.

      During every 3-to-4 hours of HD treatment, a massive surge of HCO3 would enter the
      circulation and typically overcorrects predialysis acidosis to alkalosis and alkalemia.

      The sharp acid-base shift can cause some adverse consequences.

      The investigators believe that the rapid correction (or overcorrection) from the pre-dialysis
      metabolic acidosis to post-dialysis metabolic alkalosis during the 3-to-4 hours HD treatment
      would relate to adverse effects on HD patients.

      Thus the investigators conduct this study to prove the hypothesis that &quot;prevention of
      post-dialysis alkalosis by using lower dialysate HCO3 concentration might cause less adverse
      outcomes in ESRD patients on HD.&quot;

      Study design:

      Prospective cross-over case-control study.

      Study population:

      A total of 60 patients who receive regular hemodialysis (three times per week) for more than
      6 months in the regional teaching hospital.

    <description>In this group, the participants will receive &quot;intervention&quot; for 2 months first, followed by a wash-out period of 1 month and &quot;control&quot; for 2 months.
In the &quot;intervention period,&quot; the investigators will provide the participants with lower dialysate HCO3 concentrations. (dialysate HCO3 to 28 mmol/L for half of the HD session and 30 to the second half of their HD session.) Besides, the investigators will give the participants with pre-HD HCO3&lt;22 mEq/L oral Na-bicarbonate 650 mg 1#-2# three times a day as supplements.
In the &quot;control period,&quot; the investigators will provide the participants with dialysate HCO3 concentration of 38-40 mEq/L (as we usually provide to patients).</description>
