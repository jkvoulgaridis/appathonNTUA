      The Study objectives are:

        1. To compare the efficacy and safety of Etanercept, lyophilisate for solution for
           injection and Enbrel, lyophilisate for solution for subcutaneous injection, which are
           used as subcutaneous injections at a dose of 25 mg 2 times a week for 24 weeks in
           combination with methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

        2. To prove the therapeutic equivalence of Etanercept, lyophilisate for solution for
           injection and Enbrel, lyophilisate for solution for subcutaneous injection in patients
           with rheumatoid arthritis.

        3. To evaluate the immunogenicity of Etanercept, lyophilisate for solution for injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicentre study in parallel groups of the
      efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Etanercept, lyophilisate for solution for injection
      and Enbrel, lyophilisate for solution for subcutaneous injection, in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis.

      Total duration of patient participation in the study will be 49-52 weeks. Of these: screening
      - up to 4 weeks, treatment - 24 weeks, follow-up after treatment - 4 weeks, evaluation of the
      study drug immunogenicity - 52 weeks after the treatment initiation.

      Patients receive Etanercept or Enbrel (depending on the group) in the form of subcutaneous
      injections at a dose of 25 mg 2 times a week for 24 weeks.

    <measure>Number of patients who achieved remission (DAS28(Disease Activity Score 28)&lt;2.6) and low disease activity (DAS28≤3.2)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index includes swollen (range 0-28) and tender (range 0-28) joint counts, acute phase response (ESR in mm/hr), and general health status (participant global assessment of disease activity using VAS, range 1-100 mm).
DAS28, which uses a 28-joint count, is derived from the original DAS, which includes a 44-swollen joint count.
The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worsening. DAS28 &lt;2.6 equals (=) remission</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in activity index DAS28</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in activity index compared to baseline. The DAS28 index takes into account information on safety and swelling of 28 joints, ESR and patients' global health assessment according to VAS.
Calculate DAS28 from the expression:
DAS28 = 0.56√NPJ + 0.28√NSJ + 70lnESR + 0.014PGAH, where NPJ - number of painful joints at palpation (28 examined), NSJ - number of swollen joints (28 examined), PGAH - patient's global assessment of health in millimetres in 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS), ESR - rate of erythrocyte sedimentation in mm/h, ln - natural logarithm.
According to the ACR criteria, the levels of the disease activity depending on the values of DAS28, are ranked as:
remission - DAS28 &lt;2.6; low - DAS28 ≤3.2; moderate - DAS28 3.3-5.1; high - DAS28 &gt;5.1.
To calculate DAS28, use the official online calculator: http://www.das-score.nl/das28/DAScalculators/dasculators.html and https://www.das-score.nl/das28/DAScalculators/dasculators.html</description>

    <measure>Changes in functional state of patients according to questionnaire HAQ -(Health Assessment Questionnaire- data)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment compared to baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in functional state of patients according to questionnaire HAQ DI -(Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index) compared to baseline. It includes the categories of dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. It asks patients about the amount of difficulty they experience in these activities as well as the use of aids and/or devices. The HAQ has a numeric rating scale (NRS) (13) to assess pain on a scale from 0 to 10.Grades to evaluate the treatment efficacy using the HAQ DI. The minimal clinically significant change in the HAQ DI, which corresponds to the difference in parameters before and after treatment, is equal to 0.22. НАQ &lt; 0.22 points - no effect; 0.22 ≤ ∆ НАQ ≤ 0.36 - lowest effect (20% improvement according to ACR criterion); 0.36 ≤ ∆ HAQ &lt; 0.80 - satisfactory effect (50% improvement according to ACR criterion); HAQ ≥ 0.80 points - highest effect (70% improvement according to ACR criterion).</description>
