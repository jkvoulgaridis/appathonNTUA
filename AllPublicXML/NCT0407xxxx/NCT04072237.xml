  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open label Phase 1 study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and safety of a single IV dose of MarzAA followed by ascending single SC
      doses of MarzAA in adult subjects with moderate or severe Hemophilia A or B, with or without
      an inhibitor.

      This multi-center, open label Phase 1 study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and safety of a single IV dose of MarzAA followed by ascending single SC
      doses of MarzAA in adult subjects with moderate or severe Hemophilia A or B, with or without
      an inhibitor. The study will enroll at least 8 adult male subjects with moderate or severe
      Hemophilia A or B with or without an inhibitor, in each dosing stage. Each subject will
      receive escalating doses of MarzAA for each stage of the study (except for Stage 5, where
      subjects receive the same dose as in Stage 4 split between two anatomical sites).
