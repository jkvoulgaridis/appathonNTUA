  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this experiment, the investigators would like to study if the repeated application of
      local cuaneous anaesthetic EMLA cream will reduce itch induced by small needles from the
      plant mucuna pruriens (also known as cowhage) and histamine (an itch proving substance formed
      in the body).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of nociceptive desensitization induced by
      repeated application of topical cuaneous anesthetic (EMLA) on the development of
      histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch induced by histamine and cowhage respectively. The
      hypothesis is that repetitive EMLA cream administrations will reduced nerve fiber density in
      the application site leading to a reduction in the development of both histaminergic and
      non-histaminergic itch. This will improve the investigators's knowledge on nociceptive
      sensitization mechanisms and could improve the currant treatment of patients suffering from
      chronic itch.

      The main purpose is to follow the development of histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch and
      consequent neurogenic flare after repetitive EMLA pre-treatments administrations.

    <description>Cutaneous anaesthesia: will be topically induced by using EMLA cream 5%, a local anaesthetic cream consisting of equal parts of lidocaine and prilocaine (1g contains 25 mg of lidocaine and 25 mg of prilocaine, AstraZeneca A/S, Albertslund, Denmark).
Histamine: To deliver histamine, standard allergy skin prick test (SPT) lancets are applied.
Cowhage: Cowhage spicules are 1-2 mm in length and have diameter of 1-3 um at their tip, once inserted into the epidermis, the spicules evoke a moderate sensation of itch and to a lesser extent sensations of burning and stinging pain.</description>
