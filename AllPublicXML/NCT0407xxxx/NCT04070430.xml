  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether crutch use for 4 weeks following hip
      arthroscopic surgery is superior to crutch use for 2 weeks following hip arthroscopic
      surgery. The primary objective of the study is to compare PRO scores between patients who
      have used crutches for 2 weeks and patients who have used crutches for 4 weeks.

      This will be a single-center, randomized prospective study. The study will compare
      post-operative patient reported outcome (PRO) scores including the modified Harris hip score
      (mHHS) and the non arthritic hip score (NAHS), both are externally-validated surveys for hip
      function. One cohort will be assigned a rehabilitation regimen that includes 2 weeks of
      partial weight bearing on crutches, and the other will be assigned a regimen of 4 weeks of
      partial weight.

    <description>Following surgery, patients will be instructed by their surgeon to use crutches for 2 weeks, and will follow-up normally, as any patient would. Their crutch use will not impact the quality or style of their postoperative care in any manner. At their 6-week, 6-month, 12-month, and 24 months postoperative visit, the mHHS and NAHS scores will be collected and stored in a secure data system, REDCAPS.</description>
