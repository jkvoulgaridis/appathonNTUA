    <textblock>
      ProMAS is a prospective post-marketing, single-arm study to assess performance and safety of
      the Alfapump® system in the treatment of patients with malignant ascites. The study aims to
      enroll 40 patients in up to 8 sites in Europe.

      The Prospective Malignant Ascites Alfapump® study is a single-arm, prospective study to
      evaluate the performance and safety of the Alfapump® system in the treatment of patients with
      malignant ascites. The Alfapump® system is a fully implantable programmable pump, able to
      move ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder via 2 catheters. The Alfapump®
      has obtained CE (Conformité Européenne) mark approval for the indication of malignant
      ascites. The primary objective of the study is to assess the performance of the system to
      remove ascites. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      Alfapump® in the treatment of malignant ascites for a total follow-up period of 9 months, and
      to evaluate quality of life (QoL) by reduction or elimination of paracentesis requirement.
      Furthermore the study includes an exploratory scientific objective as to feasibility to
      obtain 'liquid biopsy' samples suitable for analysis in a non-invasive way after Alfapump®
      implantation. 40 patients with malignant ascites will be enrolled in up to 8 sites in Europe
      (Belgium, United Kingdom, Switzerland). Specific sub-analysis of data from patients with
      gynecological (ovarian) cancer is planned.

        Investigators will be asked to enrol subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria
        .This study population is highly palliating with overall limited prognosis and significant
        comorbidities and possibly reduced performance status. Subjects must be under the care of
        an oncologist specialised in their disease. In the case of hepatic involvement, a
        hepatologist, and in the case of ovarian or breast cancer a gynaecologic oncologist
        accustomed to managing subjects with advanced malignancy. Subjects will be enrolled into
        the trial from the clinical practices of the investigators. Suitable subjects will undergo
        screening, including detailed medical history, paracentesis history and blood tests, to
        ensure compliance with study inclusion / exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has evidence of multiple ascites loculation

          2. Ascites analysis with neutrophil count &gt;250/µl within 24-hours prior to implant.

          3. Subject has acute Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) within 24-hours of implantation
             assessed by urinalysis.

          4. Subject has skin infection of the abdominal wall at the area of implantation.

          5. Subject has a serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL Subject has

          6. Subject has obstructive uropathy (bladder residual volume &gt;100 mL, determined by
             catheterization or abdominal ultrasound) in case of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms
             (LUTS) .

          7. Existing bladder anomaly denying proper catheterization of the bladder.

          8. Subject has active bleeding or thrombocytopenia &lt; 45,000 X106/L.

          9. Subject on long-term prophylactic anticoagulation

         10. Subject is pregnant or a female of childbearing potential.

         11. Patient has recurrent requirement for MRI

         12. Subject is currently participating in an oncology trial which might be negatively
             affected by the alfapump as assessed by the treating physician
