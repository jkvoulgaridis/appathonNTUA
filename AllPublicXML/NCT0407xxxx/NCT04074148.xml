  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The prediabetes population is a high risk group for developing diabetes and is
      also associated with a higher risk of micro- and macrovascular complications. Prevalence of
      prediabetes is also increasing in Nepal (10.3%). Therefore, appropriate strategies should be
      developed to detect prediabetes and prevent its complications. Early detection of prediabetes
      offers opportunity for intervention to prevent diabetes either by reverting into
      normoglycemia or stabilizing blood glucose levels. Even a small shift in weight loss and
      reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (i.e., a change in HbA1c of 0.5%) can be
      significant in reducing cardiometabolic risk. Therefore, we propose to develop a culturally
      tailored Diabetes Prevention Education Program (DiPEP) for Nepal and implement this program
      among a prediabetes population with the aim to prevent diabetes.

      Aims: Primary aim of the research is to test the effectiveness of a Diabetes Prevention
      Education Program (DiPEP) in lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c %) among a pre-diabetes
      population in Nepal. Our secondary aims are to test the effectiveness of DiPEP in improving
      health literacy in diabetes, reducing weight, improving healthy diet and physical activity.
      We also aim to explore acceptability and usability of DiPEP among a prediabetes population
      and perception of adoption and sustainability of DiPEP in the health sector of Nepal.

      Significance: Prevention of diabetes, especially Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is proven,
      possible and powerful. It is more cost effective than spending huge money in treatment and
      usual care. It requires modification of dietary and exercise behavior, which are efficacious,
      safe, and cost-effective measures. Therefore, a culturally tailored DiPEP intervention
      program for Nepal will serve as an additional reference resource for the Non-Communicable
      Disease division of Ministry of health to develop and implement national diabetes prevention
      program if they decide such program is important for Nepal. It will be helpful to achieve
      Non-communicable disease target 3.4 of the Sustainable Development Goal by Nepal government's
      Ministry of Health. Additionally, it will be beneficial for the prediabetes population who
      could have developed T2DM in short span of time if they had been undiagnosed and
      unconsidered. Therefore, the main significance of the study is it will provide knowledge and
      environment to prevent diabetes at their community level.
