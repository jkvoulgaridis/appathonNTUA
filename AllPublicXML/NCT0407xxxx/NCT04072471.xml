  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-interventional population-based prospective cohort study in multiple databases comparing
      patients with gout who initiate lesinurad in combination with an existing xanthine oxidase
      inhibitor (XOI) (lesinurad+XOI cohort) to a propensity score-matched cohort of similar
      patients from the same data source who continue treatment with XOI monotherapy (XOI mono
      cohort). Study will characterize the cardiovascular safety of lesinurad in combination with
      XOI in patients with gout aged 18+ years compared with similar patients who continue XOI
      monotherapy. Primary objective: to assess the relative incidence of major adverse cardiac
      events plus hospitalization for unstable angina (MACE+ events) in patients with gout in both
      cohorts. Secondary objectives: to describe the characteristics of the cohorts prior to
      matching; to assess the relative incidence of hospitalisation for acute kidney injury between
      the matched cohorts; to assess the relative incidence of individual MACE+ components in the
      matched cohorts.

    <description>MACE+ is a composite endpoint comprised of: hospitalisation for non-fatal AMI, stroke, or unstable angina and cardiovascular (CV) death. CV death includes the following causes, occurring in or out of the hospital: AMI, sudden cardiac, heart failure, CV procedures, CV haemorrhage, stroke, underlying cerebrovascular cause, other CV causes.</description>

    <measure>Hospitalisation for acute kidney injury (AKI) including renal failure (with AKI as the primary diagnosis)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed cases of AKI require all three of the following criteria:
A diagnosis of renal injury or acute renal injury recorded as a primary hospital discharge diagnosis in the electronic database AND
An increase in serum creatinine at hospital admission or within 48 hours of hospital admission defined as follows:
Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 1.5-fold from baseline where baseline is lowest value recorded within 1 year before the hospital admission date OR
Decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or actual 24-hour GFR by ≥ 50% from baseline where baseline is highest value recorded within 1 year before the hospital admission date OR
Estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) &lt; 30 mL/min AND
Absence of all the following contraindications for lesinurad patients at any time prior to the index date:
A diagnosis code of chronic kidney disease stage IV or greater
eCrCl &lt; 30 mL/min recorded at any time prior to the index date</description>

        All patients in this study will be 18 years of age or older, will have had at least 6
        months (183 days) of continuous baseline data available before entering one of the cohorts,
        and will be current users of XOI monotherapy (i.e., &gt; 1 dispensing/prescription of a study
        XOI in the 183-day baseline period prior to the index date and days' supply extending
        beyond the index date). The study population will include patients from one primary care
        database in Italy (Health Search) and another in Spain (Information System for Research in
        Primary Care [SIDIAP]), as well as two US health systems (the HealthCore Integrated
        Research DatabaseSM [HIRD] and Medicare).
