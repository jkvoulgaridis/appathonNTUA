  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 3 clinical study is a randomized, observer-blind, comparator controlled,
      multicenter study of QIVc versus a Comparator QIV in children 6 months through 47 months of
      age. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that vaccination with QIVc elicits an immune
      response that is noninferior to that of a Comparator QIV containing the same virus strains,
      in children 6 months through 47 months of age.
