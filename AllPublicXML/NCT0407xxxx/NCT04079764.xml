  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One third of individuals aged &gt;60 years will be diagnosed with at least one renal cyst
      following abdominal imaging. These cystic lesions are categorized according to the Bosniak
      classification which categorizes cysts according to their degree of complexity and risk of
      malignancy. Growing evidence suggests that a significant proportion of Bosniak III and IV
      cysts are benign and that the malignant ones present low metastatic potential. Since renal
      surgery carries substantial morbidity (20%) and potential mortality (0.5%), active
      surveillance has gained attention as a potential tradeoff to surgery to overcome
      overtreatment. Therefore, prospective studies of long-term follow-up are needed to confirm
      the oncologic outcomes of this strategy for Bosniak III/IV cysts. We first designed a pilot
      study that will assess the feasibility of a subsequent larger multicenter observational study
      aiming to ascertain mid-term safety of active surveillance. The objectives of this pilot
      study are a) Determining patients and urologists buy-in and barriers to the proposed
      intervention; b) Collecting perceptions and concerns of patients and urologists; c)

      STUDY DESIGN - This is a two-arm multicenter prospective observational pilot study where
      patients with Bosniak III or IV choosing either active surveillance or surgery will be
      monitored closely. OBJECTIVES - PRIMARY Validate the feasibility issues (acceptability,
      recruitment rate, costs, protocol adherence and implementation of imaging central review) of
      an observational study on the treatments of complex cysts. SECONDARY a- Validate the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria in regard to the feasibility of the study; b- Validate the
      triggers for discontinuation of AS in terms of feasibility and safety for the patients.
      POPULATION - For the pilot study, the intended targeted population will be patients
      incidentally diagnosed with a Bosniak III or IV cysts and who opted to be managed by either
      surgery or active surveillance. METHODOLOGY - Upon written consent, patients will be
      explained the followup scheme which will consist of a semi-annual visits for 1 year. To mimic
      the upcoming larger study and to evaluate visit feasibility issues, the baseline and the
      follow-up visits will consist of the following items: blood results, CT-scan result, quality
      of life questionnaires and medical data. Baseline (prior to study entry) and follow-up
      abdominal imaging (CT/MRI) suspicious for progression will be reviewed centrally by an
      interventional radiologist at the CIUSSSE-CHUS, to confirm Bosniak classification.
