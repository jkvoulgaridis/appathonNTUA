  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body Dissatisfaction (BD) is associated with marked distress and often precipitates
      disordered eating symptomology (Milligan &amp; Pritchard, 2006). BD in male athletes is an
      important area to explore, as research in this field often focuses on eating disorders in
      female athletes (e.g., Becker et al., 2012; Varnes et al., 2013). The current body of
      literature regarding male college athletes suggests that they experience pressures associated
      with both societal muscular ideals and sport performance (Galli et al., 2015). While there is
      a clear association between drive for muscularity and BD in collegiate male athletes (Galli
      et al., 2015), no study to date has conducted research aimed to attenuate the effect of BD in
      this population. The current study seeks to investigate a BD intervention for male college
      athletes. Participants will be randomized to an adapted version of the standardized Female
      Athlete Body Project (i.e., the Male Athlete Body Project) or an assessment only control
      condition. All participants will complete baseline and post-treatment measures of BD,
      negative affect, internalization of an athletic ideal, drive for muscularity, sport
      confidence, eating pathology, and unhealthy weight-control behaviors. Study aims are to
      determine if the Male Athlete Body Project intervention group reduces BD and related factors
      post-treatment, and to investigate whether these differences are maintained at 1-month follow
      up. Results will inform mental health and sport clinicians, coaches, and other personnel
      involved in an athlete's care about successful strategies for decreasing BD.

    <time_frame>Participants will complete this at baseline, 3-week follow up, and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses body dissatisfaction and appearance concerns over 34 items. The total score will not be interpreted; instead, subscale scores will be reported and interpreted. The subscales are: Appearance Evaluation, Appearance Orientation, Overweight Preoccupation, Self-Classified Weight, and the Body Areas Satisfaction Scale. For the Appearance Evaluation subscale, higher scores indicate a better outcome. Scores range from 7-35. For Appearance Orientation, higher scores indicate a worse outcome. Scores range from 12-60. For the Overweight Preoccupation subscale, higher scores represent a worse outcome. Scores range from 4-20. For Self-Classified Weight, higher scores represent the individual believing they are overweight. Scores range from 2-8. For the Body Areas Satisfaction Scale, higher scores indicate a better outcome. Scores range from 9-45.</description>

    <description>Participants who meet eligibility criteria and consent to the study will be randomized to one of two conditions: intervention condition (i.e., Male Athlete Body Project) or an assessment only control condition. The intervention groups will take place at IIT. Participants who accept randomization to condition will complete baseline questionnaires after randomization (immediately prior to Session 1 in the intervention condition and after being randomized to the assessment only control condition). Questionnaires will be repeated immediately post-intervention (intervention condition)/after a 3-week interval (control). All participants will be asked to complete the questionnaires again, 4 weeks after the previous round of questionnaires. The 3, 80-minute group sessions will be separated by 1 week.</description>
