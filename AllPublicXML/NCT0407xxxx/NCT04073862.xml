  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every day, a significant number of children and young people in Norway experience violence,
      abuse, or other potentially traumatizing events. These children are at risk of developing
      serious health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression,
      behavioral problems, and drug dependency. Moreover, when left unaddressed, trauma experiences
      in childhood can have long-term implications for work- and educational participation as well
      as later subjection to violence. Provision of accessible and situationally adaptable
      treatments can therefore have great benefits for children, families, and communities at
      large.

      In this project, the investigators will introduce the method of Stepped-Care Trauma-Focused
      Behavioral Cognitive Therapy (SC-TF-CBT) in a selection of 10 municipalities across Norway.
      SC-TF-CBT is a parent-led - therapist-assisted low-threshold method aimed at treating
      children exposed to abuse, sexual assault, or other trauma and who are at risk of developing
      more severe trauma-related difficulties (Salloum, et al. 2014). This is the first test of the
      method outside the US. The project's main aim is therefore to evaluate the feasibility and
      efficiency of the treatment in a Norwegian context through a pre-post design.

      The following questions are to be explored:

        1. How does the SC-TF-CBT model fit the Norwegian health care culture and service system?

        2. When testing Stepped-Care in a Norwegian context, the model is set to involve both the
           municipal and specialist service levels. Severe cases will be stepped up/transferred to
           the specialist level for TF-CBT treatment. How do these transitions work for the
           participating families, and what are the experiences and perspectives of practitioners
           and service-leaders regarding coordination and collaboration between service levels?

        3. Do the children, parents, and therapists like working with the method?

        4. Do recipients of the treatment (children and parents) report symptom improvement?

        5. Which children and parents seem to benefit the most from the method, and who do not?

    <textblock>
      Stepped-Care Trauma-Focused Behavioral Cognitive Therapy (SC-TF-CBT) is a semi home-based
      treatment for children at risk of developing PTSD, where the child's caregiver takes on the
      role as helper under the guidance of a trained therapist. The treatment runs over a course of
      approximately 12-15 weeks and has two phases. In cases where symptom improvement is evident
      after 6-9 weeks, the following 6 weeks is a maintenance phase. In the maintenance phase, the
      child and caregiver will continue with some of the exercises found helpful and engage in
      pleasant activities together, while receiving follow-ups by the therapist.

      In cases where symptoms persist, however, the treatment is stepped up to TF-CBT. In the
      Norwegian context, in contrast to the US, stepping up will imply that responsibility for the
      treatment is transferred from the municipal service level to a Child and Youth Psychiatric
      Policlinic (BUP). In this particular way, the treatment scheme is adapted to the local
      context, while ensuring continuity as intended by the developers. Examining how this
      transition is experienced, how the transition is reasoned for and organized, and the
      transitions correspond with treatment needs are therefore important objectives.

      The first stage of this trial project involves providing SC-TF-CBT training to 20 therapists
      (primarily clinical psychologists with experience in trauma treatment and working with
      children/ families) in the 10 municipalities across Norway. Training is carried out by
      specialists in psychology at NKVTS in collaboration with the University of South Florida
      (USF). Following the training, the therapists will receive referrals as usual, but will be
      equipped with an additional treatment method.

      While protocols exist for two age categories (3-6 and 7-11), this project focuses on children
      between the ages of 7-11. In total, about 75 children (and caregivers) will participate in
      the study. This estimate takes into account a possible dropout rate of about 30 percent. In
      order to produce sufficiently strong analysis, including mediator analysis, the
      investigators' calculations indicate that the study requires 58 children to complete the
      SC-TF-CBT program.

      Caregivers and children participating in the study will be asked to provide information about
      symptoms and treatment experiences at several points throughout the treatment trajectory. The
      therapist will collect information by way of assessment forms available for completion on
      iPads. The therapists will also submit evaluations throughout the trajectory of each family
      by way of online assessment forms. Audio recordings from treatment session will be used to
      determine fidelity.

      To attain data on entire trajectories, from pre-screening through completed treatments, the
      quantitative data will be supplemented by qualitative, semi-structured interviews with
      children, caregivers, and therapists. The interviews are to take place upon treatment
      completion, after approximately 12-15 weeks. A similar time-frame will be adopted for
      interviews with families transferred to the specialist service level. Additionally, to assess
      the long-term effects of the treatment, the investigators will invite a sample of children
      and caregivers for follow-up interviews 3-4 months after completion.

    <description>Clinical Assessment of Trauma Paths and Symptoms (CATS) (Sachser et al., 2017). The investigators use a revised edition of CATS, based on DSM5 and ICD-11. CATS consists of 15 questions about stressful or scary experiences, 20 questions measuring level of post-traumatic stress responses (to be answered if &quot;yes&quot; on one of the first 15 items), and 5 questions about the social/ performance consequences of experienced problems. Both the Children's version and the Caregiver version of CATS 2.0 contain the same questions, but formulated according to their different points of view. The 15 questions about trauma events are answered by indicating &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; The 20 items about symptomatology are scored from 0 (never) to 3 (almost all the time). The final 5 items are indicated with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; In order to measure change, the questions will be completed at three points in time by caregivers and children, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>T1 (start-up), T3 (12-15 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>17D is a validated health-related quality of life survey for children aged 8-11 years (but can be used for 7-year-olds with the aid of an adult) (Apajasalo et al., 1996). The form consists of 17 questions that deal with both physical and mental health. On each of the 17 questions (dimensions) the respondent indicates the appropriate level on each dimension). The scale runs from 1-5, with 5 indicating better outcome. Each dimension has been ascribed a utility weight, which is used to calculate an overall score across dimensions. Quality of life is determined by a single index (17D score) on a 0‑1 scale, where 1 is the better outcome.</description>

    <description>Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) is one of three related instruments (acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility) developed to fill a need for measures to predicting outcomes, for instance when a treatment is about to be introduced in a new context (Weiner et al., 2017). According to the developers, the measures can be used together or separately. The present research will use the measures, which are scored separately, together to predict how Stepped-Care TF-CBT might suit a Norwegian context. Translation (back-translations) to Norwegian was done by NKVTS. Each measure has 4-items that are scored from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Average scores are calculated for each measure. The questions will be posed one time to all participating therapists, prior to recruiting first family for SC-TF-CBT.</description>

    <description>The Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (CASSS) is a scale consisting of four modules. In this study only one of the modules will be included; the children's self-reported experience of social support from the parents. This sub-scale consists of 10 questions. CASSS is a validated instrument for 8-11 year olds (Malecki &amp; Demaray, 2002). Investigators have not found a Norwegian translation. The research group has therefore carried out a translation of the scale itself, with independent translation back to English (back-translation) to ensure the quality. The 10 items in CASSS are scored from 1 (never) to 6 (always).</description>

    <description>Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) consists of one single question each and are used to make a simple assessment of the condition and level of functioning in children at the first meeting and subsequently to assess changes in condition and functioning at later meetings. Both the children and the caregivers will respond, in addition to the therapist (Busner &amp; Targum, 2007). The wording of the questions can easily accommodate different types of patients. CGI has been used in a variety of populations, including children receiving Step TF-CBT (Salloum et al., 2014), patients with social anxiety (Zaider, Heimberg, Fresco, Schneier, &amp; Liebowitz, 2003) and bipolar disorder (Spearing, Post, Leverich, Brandt, &amp; Nolen, 1997). CGI-S is scored 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (extremely ill). CGI-I is scored from 7 (extreme/serious worsening) to 1 (extreme improvement).</description>
