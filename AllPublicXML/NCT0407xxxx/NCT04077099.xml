  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the dose escalation (phase 1) part of the study is to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of REGN5093 for determination of the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or definition of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REGN5093 in
      patients with MET-altered Non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).

      The primary objective of the dose expansion (phase 2) part of the study is to assess
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5093 as measured by the objective response rate (ORR)
      per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed NSCLC that is at advanced stage. Advanced is defined as
             unresectable or metastatic disease. Patients must have exhausted all approved
             available therapies.

          -  Has available archival tumor tissue

          -  Willing to provide tumor tissue from newly obtained biopsy from tumor site which has
             not been irradiated previously and is not the only measurable lesion. Newly obtained
             biopsies at screening are required unless discussed with the medical monitor.
             Provision of archival tumor tissue is mandated.

          -  Previously documented presence of MET alterations: either MET-exon14 gene mutation
             and/or MET gene amplification, and/or elevated MET protein expression

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received treatment with an approved systemic therapy within 3 weeks or has not yet
             recovered (i.e. ≤Grade 1 or baseline) from any acute toxicities except for laboratory
             changes as described in the protocol and patients with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy

          -  Has received radiation therapy or major surgery within 14 days of first administration
             of study drug or has not recovered (i.e. ≤Grade 1 or baseline) from AEs, except for
             laboratory changes as described in the protocol and patients with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy

          -  For expansion cohorts only: prior treatment with MET-targeted biologic therapy

          -  Untreated or active primary brain tumor, CNS metastases, leptomeningeal disease or
             spinal cord compression as defined in the protocol

          -  Known allergy to doxycycline or other tetracycline antibiotics

        Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.
