      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the noninferiority of insulin glargine 300 U/mL in comparison to insulin
      degludec 100 U/mL on glycemic control and variability in participants with diabetes mellitus

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the glycemic control and variability parameters in each treatment group at Week
      12 using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)

      To evaluate the safety of insulin glargine 300 U/mL in comparison to insulin degludec 100
      U/mL

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of the study per participant will be around 18 weeks :1 or 2 weeks of screening
      followed by a 4-week run-in period, a 12-week treatment period and a 2 to 4 days follow-up
      period

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Participants with Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM)

          -  Participants treated with multiple daily injections (MDI) using basal insulin analog
             once daily and rapid acting insulin analogs for at least one year

          -  HbA1c ≥ 7% (48 mmol/mol) and ≤ 10% (86 mmol/mol) at screening

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participants not on stable dose of basal insulin analog

          -  Participants having received Toujeo or Tresiba as basal insulin within 30 days prior
             to screening

          -  Participants not using the same insulins (both basal and rapid) within 30 days prior
             to screening

          -  Participants having received basal insulin dose ≥0.6 U/kg body weight within 30 days
             prior to screening

          -  Participants having received any glucose lowering drugs (including any premixed
             insulins,human regular insulin as mealtime insulins, any others injectable or oral),
             other than basal and rapid insulin analogs, within 3 months prior to screening

          -  End stage renal disease or on renal replacement treatment

          -  Retinopathy or maculopathy with one of the following treatments, either recent (within
             3 months prior to screening) or planned: intravitreal injections or laser or
             vitrectomy surgery Body weight change ≥5 kg within 3 months prior to screening

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
