      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a worksite based Fruit &amp;
      Vegetable Prescription (Rx) Program designed to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and
      improve diet quality and other health outcomes of participants. The program includes
      incentives (coupons) and skill building/educational sessions to increase intake of fruits,
      vegetables, and other health promoting foods (i.e. legumes, whole grains). The program will
      focus on delicious, nutritious, affordable, simple and quick meal preparation.

      Hypotheses

        -  The program will increase intake of fruits, vegetables and other health promoting foods,
           and will improve diet quality.

        -  The program will improve household meal practices.

        -  The program will improve BMI, waist circumference, lipid panel, HbA1c, and blood
           pressure.

        -  Improvements in outcome measures will be sustained 3 months post intervention.

      Specific Aims

        -  To determine the effect of a worksite based F&amp;V Rx program as compared to control/no
           intervention on diet quality.

        -  To determine the effects of a worksite based F&amp;V Rx program as compared to control/no
           intervention on household meal practices.

        -  To determine the effects of a worksite based F&amp;V Rx program as compared to control/no
           intervention on BMI, waist circumference, lipid panel, HbA1c, and blood pressure.

        -  To determine whether improvements resulting from the program are sustainable over time.

      Background In 2011-2012, two-thirds of adults and over 30% of children and adolescents in the
      U.S. were overweight or obese. Obesity is widely recognized as a grave public health concern
      because of its association with increased risk for a multitude of chronic diseases and other
      adverse health outcomes. The persistence of high obesity rates in children and adults in the
      U.S. and the low rates of adherence to current recommendations for fruit and vegetable
      consumption are evidence of the inadequacy of efforts to date to promote healthy lifestyles.

      Adults—specifically, parents—have a strong influence on children's eating and physical
      activity habits. Children have innate preferences for sweet, energy-dense foods; however,
      some food preferences are learned. Early introduction and repeated exposure to healthy foods
      may help to familiarize and increase acceptance and liking of those foods. Parents can help
      children learn healthy eating habits by using appropriate child feeding practices, modeling
      the desired behaviors, and creating a home food environment that is conducive to healthy
      eating. Likewise, parents' physical activity behaviors may also influence children's activity
      levels. To achieve meaningful change in childhood obesity, it is necessary to change the
      culture of the entire household by reaching both adults and children.

      Whereas children are often exposed to health promotion programming in schools, adults may be
      exposed to similar messages at work. There is an extensive literature on the capacity of
      worksites to effectively promote healthy lifestyles while reducing medical costs and
      absenteeism. Worksite interventions targeting fruit and vegetable consumption have been found
      to be effective, particularly when they include a focus on employees' families. Interventions
      that include a subsidy or financial incentive to reduce the cost of fruits, vegetables, and
      other healthy foods have also been shown to increase the purchase and consumption of those
      foods. However, there are few if any studies evaluating the effectiveness of a worksite-based
      intervention including financial incentives for fruit and vegetable purchases, nutrition
      education, and a focus on changing the behavior of the whole family.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Household meal practices</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Meals in Our Household questionnaire will be used to assess changes in household meal practices (e.g. preparation, timing and location of meals; child behavior during meals, etc.). Because this instrument was designed for families with children between the ages of 3 and 11, it will only be administered to participants with children within this age range.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as weight (kg) divided by height in meters (m) squared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Composition- Body Fat and Body Water Percentage</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition (Body Fat and Body Water Percentage) will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis, which uses the resistance of electrical flow through the body to estimate body fat and water. The Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer will be used to measure body composition. The SC-240 calculates body fat% and total body water%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference will be measured using the U.S. government standard protocol. To measure the waist circumference, the clinical research coordinator will ask the participant to stand and he/she will place a tape measure around the participant's middle, just above her/his hipbones, at the level of the belly button. The clinical research coordinator will ensure that the tape is horizontal around the participant's waist, and will then keep the tape snug around the participant's waist while not compressing the skin, and will measure her/his waist just after exhaling.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Serum Lipids and HbA1c</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Total cholesterol (Tchol), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) will be obtained by direct measurements. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) will be obtained by calculation: VLDL = TG/5; and LDL = Tchol - (VLDL + HDL). HDL: Tchol ratio will be used to evaluate the impact of treatment assignments on the lipid panel. If the PRC staff see that your lab values are abnormal, we will give you a copy of your test results and ask that you follow up with your doctor for care</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured by using a Dinamap Monitor Pro 100 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) after sitting for 5 minutes. Both systolic and diastolic pressures will be calculated as the mean value of 2 readings 5 minutes apart for each participant at every time point of assessment. If either number of your blood pressure reading is 170/110 mmHg or above, the Prevention Research Center staff will plan to escort you to the Emergency Department for care.</description>
