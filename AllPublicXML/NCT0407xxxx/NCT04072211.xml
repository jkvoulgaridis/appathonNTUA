  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has infected over one third of the world's population; of these about
      350 million go on to be chronic carriers. Infection with HBV can be self-limiting depending
      on age and immunity status of the infected person. Acute infection with HBV is cleared within
      six months of initial infection while chronic infection can last longer than six months. HBV
      can be transmitted perinatally, sexually, horizontally, through direct contact with
      infectious body fluids or blood, being pricked with an infected needle and injury from
      instruments contaminated with infectious body fluid or blood. Certain population groups are
      at higher risk of infection with HBV. Among these populations is that of health care workers
      (HCWs). In this population, HBV infection can occur through occupational exposure. In fact,
      the hepatitis B virus is more contagious than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during a
      needle stick injury (30% versus 0.5%). It is therefore imperative that HCWs are highly
      knowledgeable about HBV and how they can prevent transmission. Protection from HBV infection
      can be achieved by means of vaccination after which the HBV vaccine has been shown to be
      90-100% effective.

      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has infected over one third of the world's population; of these about
      350 million go on to be chronic carriers. In adults, infection with HBV can be self-limiting
      in up to 95% of those infected and the most common route of infection is sexual transmission.
      HBV can also be transmitted perinatally, horizontally, through direct contact with infectious
      body fluids or blood, being pricked with an infected needle and injury from instruments
      contaminated with infectious body fluid or blood.

      Certain population groups are at higher risk of infection with HBV. Among these populations
      is that of health care workers (HCW). In this population, HBV infection can occur through
      occupational exposure. It is therefore imperative that HCWs are highly knowledgeable about
      HBV and how they can prevent transmission.Protection from HBV infection can be achieved by
      means of vaccination after which the HBV vaccine has been shown to be 90-100% effective.

      Despite availability of these vaccines, studies have shown low rates of vaccination against
      HBV amongst HCW in different countries. However, in countries where there is a deliberate
      policy to vaccinate HCW, the rates of HBV vaccination are over 90%. In Zambia, this rate has
      been reported to be as low as 19.3%.

      This project will demonstrate an approach to reduce HCW risk of HBV through increasing
      knowledge and awareness of HBV among HCWs, providing vaccination to HCWs and linking those
      already carrying HBV infection to care and treatment. The study will also investigate the
      cost of vaccinating HCWs against HBV and evaluate feasibility, acceptability and
      implementation factors to inform possible scale-up of this approach throughout Zambia.

    <description>2.0×106 cells/mL will be stimulated with artificial Hepatitis B surface Antigen antigen and characterised into naïve B and T cells, effector B and T cells and memory B and T cells. This will be done by targeting specific cell surface markers using fluorochrome labelled antibodies such as anti-CD4+-ECD, CD8+-PeCy7, CD3-APC-H7, CD45RA-FITC, CD45RO-PCy7, FoxP3+-PE, CD27-PCy5, CCR7-FITC, CD20-APC, CD40-FITC, CD78-FITC, CD30-PE, CD38-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD19-PE-Cy7 and IgM-FITC. Before the cells are labelled, they will be stained and blocked using FcR blocking reagents.</description>

    <description>The descriptive costing study will estimate the costs of a vaccination program. Assuming a bottom-up, ingredients-based approach, costs will be collected in local currency units and converted to United States Dollar (US$) using the midpoint exchange rate at the time of implementing the study. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out from societal and payer's perspective.</description>
