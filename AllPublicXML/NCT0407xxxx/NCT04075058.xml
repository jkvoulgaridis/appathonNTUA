  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators at PGIMER have been practicing hypofractionation radiotherapy with a dose
      of 35Gy/15#/3wks to the chest wall in post mastectomy and 40Gy/16#/3wks in breast
      conservation in breast cancer patients for the last 4 decades. It is also a routine practice
      in UK and few centers in Canada. Hypofractionation reduces treatment time to half while
      maintaining cosmesis and gives control rates equal to conventional fractionation. As breast
      cancer is a leading cancer in females and radiation therapy is an important part of its local
      management, hypofractionation help the radiation centers worldwide to meet the growing need
      for radiation in breast cancer, particularly in developing countries where resources are
      limited. It also reduces the financial burden on the patient and family. In this study the
      investigators want to reduce the treatment duration from 3 weeks to 2 weeks. The study will
      include 1000 patients, 500 in each arm, with breast cancer post mastectomy or after breast
      conservative surgery to be treated with a radiotherapy dose of 34Gy in 10 fractions over 2
      weeks in the study arm and 35Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks in the control arm. The primary
      endpoint of the study will be ipsilateral local tumour control. Secondary endpoints will be
      early and late adverse effects in normal tissues, quality of life, contralateral primary
      tumours, regional and distant metastases and survival.

      Patients to be included in this study will be pre-operatively staged according to American
      Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition, International Union against cancer ( which uses
      TNM staging ) as stage I-III of breast carcinoma. Total 500 patients of histologically proven
      post lumpectomy/mastectomy cases of carcinoma breast suitable for radiotherapy will be
      enrolled in this study. Patients would be evaluated at the Department of Radiotherapy PGIMER,
      Chandigarh by doing a thorough clinical examination followed by routine investigations which
      will include hemogram, liver function tests, kidney function tests, chest X-ray. Patients
      will be treated by standard rectangular tangential fields.

    <description>done using Harvard/National Surgical Adjuvant Bowel and Breast Project(NSABP)/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group(RTOG) breast cosmesis grading scale. Grading will be done as Excellent- no or minimal difference between two breasts,Good- slight difference between two breasts,Good- slight and Fair minimal difference between two breasts, Fair- obvious difference between two breasts Poor- marked difference between two breasts.

    <description>EORTC QLQ -30 The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures, as well as five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and six single items.The scores must be averaged and linearly transformed to obtain a range of scores from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a greater response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a healthy level of functioning and a high score for the global health status represents a high QoL, but a high score for the symptom scale represents a high level of symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 year, 5 year</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-BR 23 It contains 23 items rated on a four-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The items assess the side effects of therapy, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, body image, and sexual function. Additionally, there are single items assessing sexual enjoyment, anxiety caused by hair loss, and future outlook. The scores range between 0-100 points. For scales evaluating function, a higher score represents a higher level of functioning. For scales evaluating symptoms, a higher score indicates more severe symptoms.</description>
