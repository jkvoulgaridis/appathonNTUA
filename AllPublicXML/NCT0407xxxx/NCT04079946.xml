  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer Colon is one of the major public health problems worldwide. Complete eradication of
      the tumor with no recurrence or residual masses is a challenge which faces all the surgeons
      and medical staff all over the world. A lot of techniques were used to ensure 100 %
      eradication of the tumor and to cure the patients from cancer. Total Mesocolic Excision with
      Central Vessel Ligation is one of the recent techniques used for colon cancer surgeries. Here
      in the research the investigators answer the question of how this technique is superior and
      more beneficial in complete eradication of the tumor than the conventional surgery for colon
      cancer

    <description>sharp dissection of the anatomical layers and the dissection of the visceral plane from the parietal one . In addition a central division of the feeding arteries at their origins is performed at the level of superior mesenteric artery for tumors of the right colon and at the level of inferior mesenteric artery or the aorta for tumors of the left colon .this allows for removal of the maximum number of lymph nodes possible.</description>
