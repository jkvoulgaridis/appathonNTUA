  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latino and African American populations have a higher rate of human papillomavirus vaccine
      initiation of the vaccine; however, they have a significantly less likelihood of completing
      the vaccine series. Pharmacists are licensed to vaccinate against the HPV virus. However,
      they are less likely to administer the vaccine. Although past research has recommended
      incorporating pharmacists to increase adolescent vaccination, no intervention studies, to our
      knowledge, have tested a healthcare delivery model that incorporates pharmacists to complete
      the HPV vaccine series. The aims of this pilot randomized controlled trial are to 1)
      determine the preliminary efficacy of an intervention to increase HPV vaccine series
      completion with the community pharmacist vs. with the primary care provider among
      racially/ethnically diverse participants; and 2) assess perceived intervention feasibility
      and acceptability of the intervention among intervention participants and primary care clinic
      staff.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection, and persistent
      infection with oncogenic HPV strains causes cancer. Commercially available 9-valent HPV
      vaccines offer the potential of immunity against seven oncogenic strains and the two low-risk
      strains that cause over 90% of genital warts. The majority of HPV-related cancers and genital
      warts can be prevented through the timely uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine series.
      However, in 2016 only 37.5% of boys and 49.5% of girls completed the HPV vaccine series, and
      racial/ethnic minority youth populations are least likely to complete the vaccine series.
      More specifically, Latino and African American populations have a higher rate of initiation
      of the vaccine; however, they have a significantly less likelihood of completing the vaccine
      series. Past research with Latino and African American populations determined the following
      patient-level barriers to vaccine completion: caregivers' lack of awareness to receive
      additional vaccine doses, lack of time to attend an additional vaccine-only primary care
      clinic appointment, and other structural barriers that prohibit caregivers and their children
      from returning to primary care clinics for additional vaccine doses. Pharmacists are licensed
      to vaccinate against the HPV virus. However, they are less likely to administer the vaccine.
      Although past research has recommended incorporating pharmacists to increase adolescent
      vaccination, no intervention studies, to our knowledge, have tested a healthcare delivery
      model that incorporates pharmacists to complete the HPV vaccine series. We propose a
      randomized controlled pilot study titled Community Pharmacists Vaccinate Against Cancer
      (CPVAC). In CPVAC, the PI will oversample for ethnic minority (particularly African American
      and Hispanic) HPV vaccine age-eligible children and their caregivers to take part in the
      study. Patients will be randomized to intervention or control group. After enrolling in the
      study, primary care providers of patients in the Intervention Group will contact the
      patients' community pharmacy and prescribe the remaining HPV vaccine dose(s). The pharmacy
      will electronically update patients' files and schedule the HPV vaccine &quot;refill&quot; (additional
      doses) at the appropriate dosing schedule. The pharmacy will contact patients' caregivers
      when it is time to complete additional HPV vaccine dose(s). Control group participants will
      receive usual care, returning to their PCPs to complete the additional HPV vaccine doses. The
      aims of this study are to 1) determine the preliminary efficacy of CPVAC to increase HPV
      vaccine series completion with the community pharmacist vs. with the primary care provider
      among racially/ethnically diverse participants; and 2) assess perceived intervention
      feasibility and acceptability of CPVAC among intervention participants and primary care
      clinic staff. Findings from this pilot study can be used to inform a larger randomized
      controlled trial to examine intervention effectiveness and analyze the cost-benefit of
      working with community pharmacies to enhance HPV vaccine completion among diverse children.

    <description>Upon completing informed consent, parents of children who have received Dose 1 of the HPV vaccine at the recent clinical visit will be invited to participate in the study. Upon completing the demographic form and pre-test survey for the study, they will be randomized to intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group will be asked to complete the additional vaccine doses with their community pharmacist. A provider from the participating clinic will electronically prescribe the HPV vaccine dose. Participants in the control group will be scheduled to return to the clinic (based on the vaccine schedule) to complete the vaccine series. The research team will conduct a follow-up survey six months after baseline for each participant. A sample (n=30) of intervention and control group participants will be invited to participate in an in-depth interview to gauge both parents' and children's' acceptability of this intervention.</description>
