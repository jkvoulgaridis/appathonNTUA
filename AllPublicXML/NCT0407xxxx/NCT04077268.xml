  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the future of traumatic brain injured patients at day 7 of their trauma

      Primary endpoint: Fate, classified as survival with or without sequelae, death. Use of the
      GOS-E scale to classify survival with or without sequelae. The collection of this scale will
      be done by telephone contact, 7 days of admission to the emergency room.

      Secondary judgment criteria:

        -  Compendium of the realization of the CT / time respected between the TCL and the CT /
           Hospitalization / 2nd CT to realize at 24 hours in the patients treated by TAC or AAP

        -  Application of the recommendations of the French Society of Emergency Medicine 2012:
           Become 7 days of patients classified according to whether or not the recommendations, .

        -  Become TCL patients under AAP or TAC

        -  Number of reconsultation, rehospitalization, new imaging within 7 days after TCL
