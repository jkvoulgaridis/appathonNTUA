  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a common manifestation of lesions of central motor pathways, such as after
      stroke, traumatic brain or spinal cord injury and in cerebral palsy and is associated with
      increased impairments and disabilities. Spasticity may be associated with pain and
      contractures, caused by muscle weakness, reduced muscle length and volume that add to the
      disability.Treatments of spasticity comprise physical therapy, pharmacological agents and
      surgical treatment. Recently, a systematic review concluded that transcutaneous, electric
      nerve stimulation may have beneficial effects on spasticity and activity performance after
      stroke, which lends support to the new treatment method Mollii, which will be evaluated in
      this study.The Mollii suit provides electric stimulation through multiple electrodes places
      in a tight fitting suit. This study relates to the clinical trials performed at the
      University department of rehabilitation medicine at Danderyd Hospital in Stockholm and
      comprises an initial study of effects on spasticity (&quot;Mechanical substudy&quot;) and a following,
      exploratory treatment trial (&quot;Clinical substudy&quot;) in patients with spasticity after stroke.

      Spasticity is a common manifestation of lesions of central motor pathways, such as after
      stroke, traumatic brain or spinal cord injury and in cerebral palsy and is associated with
      increased impairments and disabilities. Spasticity may be associated with pain and
      contractures, caused by muscle weakness, reduced muscle length and volume that add to the
      disability.Treatments of spasticity comprise physical therapy, pharmacological agents and
      surgical treatment. Recently, a systematic review concluded that transcutaneous, electric
      nerve stimulation may have beneficial effects on spasticity and activity performance after
      stroke, which lends support to the new treatment method Mollii, which will be evaluated in
      this study.The Mollii method has been developed by Inervetions, which is a small Swedish
      med-tech company, and represents an innovative approach for non-invasive electro-stimulation
      to reduce spasticity and improve motor function. The theoretical background of this treatment
      method primarily refers to the concept of reciprocal inhibition, i.e. that sensory input from
      a muscle may inhibit the activation of an antagonistic muscle. Thus, the application of
      Mollii aims at stimulating a muscle, e.g. the anterior tibial muscle of the lower leg in
      order to reduce reflex mediated over-activity, i.e. spasticity, in calf muscles by inducing
      reciprocal inhibition.

    <time_frame>Mechanism study: To assess change, NeuroFlexor data is recorded before, during and 10 minutes after treatment at each session. Clinical study: To assess change Neuroflexor data is collected before and after the 6 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure related to spasticity: The Neuroflexor device comprises a portable computer-controlled step motor system with a lever arm that generates constant velocity movements of the wrist or ankle. The passive resistive force of the wrist or ankle is recorded by a force transducer. The force is then analyzed off-line and the total resistance is separated into mechanical and a neural components using a neuro-biomechanical computerized model. NeuroFlexor neural component reflecting stretch reflex mediated resistance, represents the main outcome. The NeuroFlexor hand (used in mechanism and clinical substudy) and foot module (used in mechansim substudy only) is a valid method that quantifies and distinguishes the genuine spasticity and the mechanical contributions (viscoelastic and soft tissue components) of the resistance opposing a passive stretch.</description>

    <description>The Mollii method is provided in a tight fitting, whole body suit with multiple electrodes that can be set individually. The Mollii method uses low frequencies and low intensities that evokes sensory input but does not directly elicit muscle contractions. The theoretical background of this treatment method primarily refers to the concept of reciprocal inhibition, i.e. that sensory input from a muscle may inhibit the activation of an antagonistic muscle through the activation of the disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibitory pathway.</description>
