  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip osteoarthritis is associated with joint pain, physical disability, decreased muscle
      strength and poor health status, and the most common cause for total hip arthroplasty. No
      studies have investigated the effect of total hip arthroplasty compared to non-surgical
      treatment in patients with end-stage hip osteoarthritis. This comparison is of upmost
      importance as it is unknown whether non-surgical treatment may be used as an alternate to
      surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether total hip arthroplasty followed by
      standard care is superior to progressive resistance training for improving hip function and
      pain in patients with end-stage hip osteoarthritis.

      The hypothesis is that patients treated with total hip arthroplasty will improve more than
      patients treated with progressive resistance training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with joint pain, dysfunction of activities of daily
      living (ADL), decreased muscle strength and decline in health-related quality of life status,
      and the most common cause for total hip arthroplasty (THA). In Denmark, approximately 10.400
      primary THA surgeries are performed annually, and the yearly incidence rate of this procedure
      has increased dramatically from 80 to 180 per 100.000 persons between 1995 and 2016. However,
      some patients experience long-term pain and may never recover full physical function and
      muscle strength after surgery.

      Exercise has been shown to improve physical function and reduce pain in people with hip OA,
      and is recommended initially as a treatment in international clinical guidelines.
      Furthermore, a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed clinically relevant
      improvements in ADL and muscle function after 10-weeks of supervised explosive-type
      progressive resistance training (PRT) in patients with end-stage hip OA scheduled for THA
      compared to standard preoperative care.

      To date, no RCTs have investigated the effect of THA followed by standard postoperative care
      compared to supervised explosive-type PRT in patients with end-stage hip OA. Therefore, this
      highlights the need for a high-quality trial as it is unknown whether non-surgical treatment
      may be used as an alternate to surgery.

      The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to investigate whether THA followed by
      standard care is superior to a 12-week supervised explosive-type PRT programme for improving
      patient-reported hip function and pain 6 months after initiating the intervention, measured
      using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS), in patients with end-stage hip OA eligible for THA.
      Exploratory outcome time-points will be assessed at 3, 12, 24 and 60 months after initiating
      the intervention.

      The hypothesis is that THA followed by standard care is superior to a 12-week supervised
      explosive-type PRT programme for improving patient-reported hip function and pain 6 months
      after initiating the intervention, measured using the OHS, in patients with end-stage hip OA
      eligible for THA.

      Observational cohort:

      Patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria but declining to participate in the RCT will be
      asked to participate in a prospective observational cohort study using the same primary
      end-point (6 months), exploratory time-points (3, 12, 24 and 60 months), and patient-reported
      outcomes, but following usual clinical practice.

    <description>A standard fast-track multimodal surgical program comprising patient information, optimised pain management, and early mobilisation. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) will be performed by experienced orthopaedic surgeons in accordance with the standard posterior surgical approach. Patients will receive standard postoperative rehabilitation consisting of either a standard leaflet with a hospital-specific home-based exercise program aimed at increasing hip muscle strength and range of motion or, if considered necessary, a referral to supervised hip-specific exercise therapy delivered at private physiotherapist clinics or municipal rehabilitation. Furthermore, postsurgical procedures will follow hospital-specific procedures ranging from no postsurgical control to postsurgical assessment of the hip and rehabilitation at the physiotherapy department (after six-weeks).</description>

    <description>A 12-week supervised explosive-type progressive resistance training (PRT) program with two training sessions a week. All training sessions will be conducted in municipal rehabilitation centres with one-to-one supervision and ≥48 hours of rest in between sessions. The standardised PRT program will consist of warm-up on a stationary bicycle (10 min) followed by four lower extremity exercises (50 min). Exercises will be performed unilaterally with as full range of motion as possible in sets of three separated by 60 sec of rest in the following order: leg press, hip extension, hip flexion, and hip abduction. Patients will be instructed to complete the concentric phase of each repetition &quot;as fast as possible&quot;, maintain full extension for 1 sec, and perform the eccentric phase in 2-3 sec. Hip-related pain up to 5 rated on a Numerical Rating Scale (0-10) is considered acceptable during exercises. After the 12-weeks, patients will be offered three-months of optional unsupervised PRT.</description>
