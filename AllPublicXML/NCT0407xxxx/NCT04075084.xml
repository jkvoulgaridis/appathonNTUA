  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry is performed for the long-term assessment of outcome, performance and residual
      safety aspects of the BIOMONITOR III and possible successors in a real-life clinical set-up.
      In addition, this registry is set up in a way that it may also be used as a platform for
      submodules to investigate additional scientific and regulatory aspects while minimizing the
      additional effort for the investigational sites and patients.
