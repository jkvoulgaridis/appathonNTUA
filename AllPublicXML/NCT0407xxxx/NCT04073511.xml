  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to conduct a multicenter clinical trial to verify the effectiveness
      and safety of the administration of 'Eungyosan(EGS)' and 'Samsoeum(SSE)' in cold patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      375 participants with symptoms of the common cold within 48 h will be recruited for this
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects who will participate in the study will be
      divided into three groups, 'Eungyosan' group(EGS), 'Samsoeum' group(SSE) and placebo group
      according to the randomization number. Each group of subjects will take the drugs(EGS or SSE
      or placebo) 3 times a day up to 8 days.

      The severity of illness will be assessed by Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21
      Korean version (WURSS-21-K) and the VAS(visual analog scale) every 8days. Also, the duration
      of the common cold will be checked to evaluate the effectiveness.

    <description>The investigators will assess the primary outcome through the change in total score(symptom score sum quality of life score) of Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 Korean version (WURSS-21-K) 6 days after baseline. WURSS-21, which consists of questionnaires regarding gross severity, symptoms, quality of life, and improvement of illness. All items rank on a seven-point scale(1=very mild and 7=severe), where a higher score means higher severity. The symptom score is from 0(Do not have this symptom) to 70, and quality of life score is from 0(Not at all) to 56. Therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 126.</description>
