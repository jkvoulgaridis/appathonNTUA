  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effectiveness of an intensive five day falls prevention
      training programme with a home evaluation and a home exercise programme, compared with a home
      evaluation and exercise programme alone for reducing incidence of falls and fear of falling,
      and improving confidence in functional ability and objective balance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While previous research shows a clear link between visual impairment and increased risk and
      incidence of falls, as well as fear of falling, there is little research to investigate the
      effectiveness of falls prevention programmes for visually impaired populations. At the time
      of writing there were no studies identified that used this type of intensive training over a
      period of several days, rather most of the studies that exist have been conducted in
      community settings.

      This study will aim to compare the effectiveness of a comprehensive exercise programme aimed
      at improving balance, walking technique, postural control and ability to complete functional
      tasks, with a home exercise programme with either written or audio instructions.
