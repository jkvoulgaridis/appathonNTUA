  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an interventional study that aims to assess a new primary care model of collaboration
      between specialized centers and primary care physicians in Switzerland, in order to reduce
      morbidity and improve patients' and providers' experience with delivery of follow‐up care in
      individuals with chronic spinal cord injury as compared to current best practice.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This model will lead to awareness, recognition and interactive communication between GPs and
      specialists and guidelines on the shared‐role relationship.

      The study interventions are educational modules on bladder, bowel, skin-care, and pain
      management which will be provided to participating GPs by Spinal Cord Injury specialists. In
      addition visits by specialized nurses to the participating GPs at their practices to support
      the establishment of specialized care on-site.

    <description>DOC is a validated questionnaire covering organization, communication, professional expertise, image and knowing each other. It will be completed by GPs and SCI specialists. The DOC will be converted to an interval score and scaled from 0 to 100 with minimum and maximum score (0=completely agree, 100=completely disagree)</description>

    <measure>Average difference in total score of Modified Spinal Cord Injury Secondary Conditions Scale (SCI‐SCS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 and 24 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Spinal Cord Secondary Conditions Scale (SCI-SCS) targets secondary conditions associated with SCI composite endpoint, excluding diabetes mellitus and joint and muscle pain. Modified (SCI-SCS) includes 14 health conditions and chronic pain. Self reporting through questionnaires on pressure sores, urinary tract infections, spasticity, postural hypotension, bowel, and bladder problems, etc...). The rating scale uses a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (not experienced/insignificant problem never limiting activity) to 3 (significant/chronic problem).</description>
