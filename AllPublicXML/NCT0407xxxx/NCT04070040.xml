      This study is intend to improve the objective response rate in treatment of camrelizumab in
      recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare B-cell variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is
      confined to the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord, and eyes. The optimum treatment for
      patients with recurrent PCNSL remains challenging and at present there is no universally
      accepted therapeutic approach . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of camrelizumab [a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor] for recurrent patients
      with primary CNS lymphoma.
