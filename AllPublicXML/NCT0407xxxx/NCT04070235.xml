      Phase II: Exploring the efficacy and safety of different doses of SH229 tablets combined with
      fixed-dose Daclatasvi dihydrochloride (DCV) tablets in the treatment of adult patients with
      chronic hepatitis C for 12 weeks, providing a basis for the design and implementation of
      phase III clinical trials.

      Phase III: Confirmation of the efficacy and safety of SH229 tablets combined with Daclatasvi
      dihydrochloride (DCV) tablets in the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C for
      12 weeks, providing a sufficient basis for drug registration and clinical use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that China has a population of over 10 million infected with HCV and also a
      highly variable HCV genotype geographic distribution. A simple, universal,
      non-genotype-specific treatment regimen is preferred for anti-HCV treatment in clinical
      practice and public health. The combination regimen of SH229 and DCV is expected to
      completely suppress HCV replication in subjects chronically infected with HCV and achieve a
      sustained virologic response.
