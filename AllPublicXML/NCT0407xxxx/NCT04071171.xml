  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the BiPhox-Trial are to demonstrate, that the use of Biphozyl® as a
      replacement fluid in adult critically ill acute kidney injury (AKI) patients, results in a
      lower rate of pH excursions and of bicarbonate (HCO3-) excursions compared to the use of
      Phoxilium® during the studied continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) interval with
      regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA).

      The secondary objectives of the BiPhox-Trial are to evaluate the time to pH level
      normalization and the HCO3- substitution rates after initiation of CVVH treatment. Further,
      to demonstrate that the use of Biphozyl® as a replacement fluid in adult critically ill AKI
      patients, results in a more stable acid-base-status as well as improved respiratory situation
      due to lower intracorporeal HCO3- and carbon dioxide levels compared to the use of Phoxilium®
      during the studied CVVH interval with RCA.

      After being fully eligible by meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria,
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, either the Phoxilium® - Group or
      Biphozyl® - Group. After randomization, patients receive either Phoxilium® or Biphozyl® for
      CVVH initiation and maintenance as a replacement fluid during the first 48 hours (h) of
      treatment. After the first 48h of CVVH with either Phoxilium® or Biphozyl® a cross-over
      follows, with another 48h of CVVH with the opposite replacement fluid (Phoxilium® switched to
      Biphozyl® or Biphozyl® switched to Phoxilium®). In comparison, all patients should receive
      one session of CVVH with 96h. Resulting from 48h of CVVH with Phoxilium® and 48h of CVVH with
      Biphozyl® as a replacement fluid. The order is determined by randomization.

      Anticoagulation is always delivered as pre-filter RCA with Regiocit® (Gambro Lundia AB,
      Sweden). For antagonisation of Regiocit®, a calcium solution (calcium chloride, with or
      without magnesium chloride) will be used post-filter.
