  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate whether drug effects in suspected overdose patients could be
      identified using the electroencephalogram (EEG). From previous work it is known that
      different classes of anesthetic drugs have specific &quot;EEG signatures&quot; related to the drug
      mechanisms. Many of the drugs of abuse that are frequently encountered in overdose patients
      are similar or identical to anesthetic drugs. The hypothesis for this study is that the EEG
      could be used to characterize the brain effects of intoxicants using EEG in the ED setting.
      Such monitoring could one day help clinicians and first responders at the point-of-care make
      more informed decisions to improve the care of overdose patients.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients aged 18 years and older who present to the ED with suspected use of a
             potential drug of abuse

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemodynamic instability or other acute medical condition for which the primary
             treating team does not thing it would be appropriate or safe for the study staff to
             approach the patient

          -  The patient has an overt head trauma or deformity of the face which would preclude
             application of the forehead EEG monitoring lead

          -  The patient has dermatological issues or skin conditions on the forehead

          -  The patient has known dementia and/or mental impairment

          -  The patient is a prisoner

          -  The patient is an employee or student at one of the study sites.
