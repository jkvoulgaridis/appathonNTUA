  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to begin an exercise program combined with behavioral
      counseling for patients who are hospitalized with a cystic fibrosis exacerbation. The
      exercise program will begin during the hospital stay. Beginning an exercise program during
      this period of reduced mobility and isolation may be an ideal time to deliver a structured
      exercise prescription along with a behavioral program to promote long-term adherence to
      exercise (structured physical activity) . Hospitalized patients have an acute awareness that
      their lung function is declining and may be more motivated and open to changing their
      behavior and adding exercise to their treatment regimen.

      During the hospitalization (T0 to T1; Figure 1, next page), participants will perform
      supervised exercise 6 days/wk. On each of these days, there will be a 5-10 min warm up
      consisting of low intensity execises for lower and upper exermity muscles. The total time per
      week will be between 2.5 and 3.5 hours.

      Three days/wk will consist of aerobic exercise (&quot;frequency&quot;). The various &quot;modes (types)&quot; for
      this exercise include 1) overground ambulation (including stairs), 2) treadmill ambulation,
      3) stationary cycling, or 4) repetitive body-weight exercises (e.g., &quot;jumping jacks&quot;). The
      &quot;time (duration)&quot; of these sessions will be 20-30 min/day. The &quot;intensity&quot; will be moderate
      (40-60% of heart rate reserve and/or perceived dyspnea/exertion of 3-5) to vigogous (60-85%
      of heart rate reserve and/or perceived dyspnea/exertion of 6-8). Participants will be given a
      HR monitor and specific &quot;target&quot; HR ranges based on their resting HR in standing and their
      age predicted maximal HR (NOTE: maximal exercise testing will not be performed); they will
      also be familiarized and instructed in use of the Borg CR10 scale to rate perceived
      dyspnea/exertion Participants should be able to &quot;talk comfortably&quot; during moderate intensity
      exercise, while talking should be &quot;somewhat challenging&quot; during vigorous efforts; HR, as well
      as perceived exertion/dyspnea and &quot;talk test&quot; will be monitored throughout each supervised
      session by trained personnel.

      On alternate days, participants will perform supervised resistance exercise training (3
      days/wk; &quot;frequency&quot;). The various &quot;modes (types)&quot; for this exercise include 1) body-weight
      exercises (e.g., lunges, squats, jumping, situps, pushups) and/or 2) resistance bands and
      dumbbells; exercises will target upper extremity, trunk/core, and lower extremity muscles
      (NOTE: specific inspiratory muscle training will not be performed). The &quot;intensity&quot; of these
      exercises will be at approximately 12-15 repetition max (that is, on the 3rd set of an
      exercise, the participant should have difficulty performing more than 12-15 quality (good
      form) repetitions of the exercise. An appropriate number of exercises will be selected such
      that the exercise &quot;duration (time)&quot; will be 20-30 min/day.

    <description>The proposed study is prospective single-arm feasibility clinical trial that will enroll 12 hospitalized patients with CF in accordance with consensus criteria.
Standard care for an acute CF exacerbation includes i.v. antibiotics and airway clearance therapies for 10-14 days. Routine care following hospitalization is an outpatient CF clinic visit 2-4 weeks after discharge, and then regular follow up every 2-3 months.
In addition, to standard care in the hospital, study participants will receive a 1) tailored exercise prescription, 2) daily, individual, supervised, aerobic and strength/power training, as well as 3) daily behavioral counseling focused on topics related to long-term adherence to exercise (details below).</description>
