    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of Karonudib for
      the treatment of hematological malignancies.

      Secondary objectives are to determine a recommended RP2D and schedule for further development
      of Karonudib, to determine the pharmacokinetics of Karonudib, to look for evidence of
      treatment efficacy. Overall survival will also be recorded.
