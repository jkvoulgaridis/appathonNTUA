  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chinese children are some of the most short-sighted in the world, but only one in five
      children in poor areas who needs glasses has them. Our team has already shown in other trials
      that giving children free glasses leads to better grades and that free glasses have a bigger
      impact on grades than factors like parents' education level and the amount of money a family
      has. The effect on grades from glasses is greater than from other health services in school,
      like giving vitamins. Only about one in three children in rural western China goes on to a
      regular, non-vocational high school. The investigators would like to show the Chinese
      government strong evidence of what glasses can do to help children continue their education,
      in order to help convince the government to carry out national programs to provide free
      glasses for children who need them.

      Study Plan: The investigators will choose 130 middle schools at random in Ningxia, western
      China, and all children in Years 1 and 2 (one class each) at each school will go at random
      into one of two groups: either a group getting free glasses, with support from teachers to
      push them to wear the glasses (&quot;Intervention&quot;) or a group getting just glasses prescriptions
      (&quot;Control.&quot;) The main study outcome will be the proportion of children going on to academic
      (as opposed to vocational) high school, and the study is powered to detect a 10% difference
      in this figure between groups.The study will also assess children's test scores, whether they
      wear their glasses at school, and how often they use blackboards (which disadvantage
      short-sighted children) vs textbooks to learn from. These other outcomes will help us to
      better understand the causal pathway between vision and high school attendance. We will also
      study the total cost of providing glasses glasses and the teacher support to wear them per
      additional student attending academic high school. The hypothesis of this study is that
      providing glasses will increase academic high school attendance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research question: Will providing free glasses to myopic rural Chinese students, with a
      teacher incentive to promote use, increase academic high school attendance?

      Design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial

      Rationale: Rural Chinese children have high myopia prevalence, but poor access to glasses.
      Our previous trials show giving free glasses significantly improves academic performance,
      with greater effect size than parental education or family income, equaling or exceeding
      other classroom-based medical interventions. Non-vocational (academic) high school attendance
      is only 30% in rural western China. Strong evidence of educational benefit from glasses is
      needed to spur adoption of national distribution programs.

      Methods: Children in Year 1 and 2 (1 class each) at 130 randomly-selected middle schools in
      Ningxia, western China, will be randomized by school to receive free glasses and a
      trial-proven teacher-based incentive to promote wear (Intervention) or prescriptions only
      (Control). The main outcome 2-3 years later will be high school attendance (powered to detect
      10% difference between study groups); secondary outcomes of compliance, test scores and use
      of near versus distance classroom learning aids will elucidate biological plausibility of a
      causal pathway between myopia correction and learning. Local knowledge and attitudes about
      myopia and spectacle use and intervention cost-effectiveness will be studied.

      Statistical methods to be employed in the analysis and justification for the choice of sample
      size:

      Adjusted- and unadjusted-comparison of the difference between study groups

        -  Of academic high school attendance

        -  of mathematics test performance at endline (adjusted for baseline),

        -  of observed spectacle wear at un-announced examinations

      Sample size: Assuming 50% of children will fail vision screening, 70% of these needing
      glasses, with loss to follow-up=10%, Î±=0.05, intra-class correlation=0.15, explained
      variation by covariates=0.40, difference between the groups in the main study outcome=10%,
      high-school attendance rate in the Control group=30%, a sample size of 130 middle-schools (65
      in each group) will provide power=85%.

    <masking_description>Study personnel assessing trial outcomes will be masked as to children's study group assignment, which will be simplified by the fact that there will be participants with and without glasses at both Intervention and Control schools. It is not ethical in this setting to provide Control participants with placebo treatment (glasses with zero power lenses), but students, parents and teachers will not be informed of either the overall design of the study or the explicit treatment intervention assignment. Only one school will be selected in each township, minimizing the possibility of cross arm communication and contamination.</masking_description>

    <description>Children at Intervention schools will receive free spectacles of a design they select, based on the child's measured refractive power and dispensed at school by the study optometrist. Additionally, teachers (but not children) in eligible classes will be informed that if 80% spectacle compliance as measured across three separate unannounced inspections was achieved, they will be given an incentive of an conditional cash transfer. The cash transfer will be deposited into the teacher's bank accounts directly.</description>

    <description>Children at Control schools will receive a glasses prescription and letter to the parents informing them of the refractive status of their child, with free glasses provided only at the end of the trial.
