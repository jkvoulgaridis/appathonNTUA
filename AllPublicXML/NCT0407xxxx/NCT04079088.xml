  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of BIIB061 versus placebo in
      participants with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS), and to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB061
      to improve disability outcome versus placebo in participants with RMS.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effects of BIIB061 versus placebo
      on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of remyelination and axon preservation in
      chronic Multiple Sclerosis lesions and to evaluate the effects of BIIB061 versus placebo on
      additional measures of improved disability outcome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BIIB061's unique mechanism of action may provide a pharmacological intervention to overcome
      the failure of remyelination in all forms of multiple sclerosis by blocking mechanisms that
      prevent differentiation of oligodendrocytes progenitors.

    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal assessment such as an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

    <measure>Overall Disability Response Score (ODRS) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>ODRS is a multicomponent score based on 4 components: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 9-Hole Peg Test in the dominant hand (9HPT-D), and 9HPT in the nondominant hand (9HPT-ND). It assesses overall changes in disability over time. The 4 individual scores are added together to get the overall score that ranges from +4 to -4. At each visit, each component is given a score relative to baseline: -1 if threshold is met for worsening, 0 if no changes meet threshold criteria, or +1 if threshold is met for improvement. The thresholds for T25FW and 9HPT are defined by a 15% change from baseline (≥15% decrease from baseline for improvement and ≥15% increase from baseline for worsening). For EDSS, improvement is defined as a ≥1.0-point decrease in EDSS from a baseline score of ≤6.0, and worsening is defined as a ≥1-point increase from a baseline score of ≤5.5 or a ≥0.5-point increase from a baseline score equal to 6.0.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed walk over 25 feet. The score for the T25FW is averaged between two completed trials. The 9HPT is a quantitative test of upper extremity function that measures the time it takes to place 9 pegs into 9 holes and then remove the pegs.</description>
