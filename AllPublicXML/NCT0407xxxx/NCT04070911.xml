      The study was conducted to determine the effect of oral water and ice popsicle on management
      of thirst in the immediate postoperative period as experimental.

      Also, it is aimed to evaluate validity and reliability of &quot;Safety Protocol for Management
      Thirst in the Immediate Postoperative Period Protocol&quot; which is used to take oral water and
      ice of patients in the immediate postoperative period, as administrative. The study was
      conducted with 150 patients who are transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) after
      their operation and met study criteria. Patients divided into three groups as the study
      (water group=50, ice group=50) and control (n=50). Patients in the study group were performed
      oral water/ice popsicle after their accession to PACU. However, the control group patients
      have performed rutin treatment and care without any other intervention. Physiologic variables
      and symptoms with thirst were followed in every three group patients at certain times. Data
      were evaluated by using NCSS (Number Cruncher Statistical System) 2007 program.
