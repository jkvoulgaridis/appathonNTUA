  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective observational multicentre study in real-life conditions of
      patients with complicated urinary infection of community presentation caused by Escherichia
      coli using intravenous fosfomycin, quinolones or beta-lactams.

      It's a multicenter and multinational study and it will include 200 patients in the fosfomycin
      cohort and 200 patients in the control cohort (quinolones or beta-lactams).

      The objectives are:

        1. To asses the clinical and microbiological efficacy and safety of intravenous fosfomycin
           in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli in real
           life conditions, in comparison with a matched cohort of patients treated with quinolones
           or beta-lactams.

        2. To evaluate the frequency of microbiological failure and development of resistance (or
           decrease in sensitivity) in Escherichia coli isolates, depending on different
           pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, with special emphasis on fAUC0-24/MIC.

        3. To evaluate the frequency of microbiological failure and development of resistance (or
           decrease in sensitivity) and their association with the existence of basal mutations in
           genes related to intracellular transport or regulation of these transporters.

      For objective 1, a study of prospective mated cohorts (fosfomycin cohort versus quinolones or
      beta-lactams cohort) will be performed, and for objectives 2 and 3 a prospective cohort study
      (fosfomycin cohort) will be conducted.
