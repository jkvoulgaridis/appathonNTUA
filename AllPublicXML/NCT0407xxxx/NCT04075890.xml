  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People utilize two behavioral strategies, goal-directed and habitual, when engaging in
      value-based decision-making that involves rewarding or punishing outcomes. Accumulating
      evidence suggests an imbalance between habitual and goal-directed behavior in favor of
      habitual control in parallel with exaggerated tendency toward compulsive/harm avoidance
      behavior in OCD. In healthy subjects, an arbitration mechanism has been proposed recently
      that controls the balance between those two strategies of action selection. Arbitration
      regions regulate the goal-directed/habitual decision-making balance by selectively
      downregulating the activity of the habitual regions. This project aims to explore the
      neurobehavioral characteristics of arbitration mechanism and its relationship with behaviors
      and clinical phenotypes in OCD by applying computational cognitive neuroscience, clinical
      task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) method.

      Investigators will recruit 30 male and female adults (age 18-65) with OCD and 30 age-, sex-,
      and education-matched healthy (medically, neurologically and psychiatrically) controls for
      this project. Each participant will come for three sessions. There will be 3-4 days interval
      between sessions:

      Session 1 that includes initial clinical assessment and obtaining T1 structural image (needed
      for neuronavigation analysis and electric field modeling).

      Session 2 and 3 that include performing two separate decision-making and symptom
      provocation-avoidance tasks by participants with OCD and healthy controls under two
      conditions: while scanned inside the MRI scanner (no tDCS) or while receiving neuronavigated
      tDCS neurostimulation outside the scanner (no fMRI imaging). As participates will perform
      each task twice, there might be an order effect on task performance. For minimizing the
      impact of such a potential order effect on imaging and tDCS results, participants will be
      randomly assigned to undergo scanning in the session 2 and then receive tDCS in the session 3
      or in the opposite order (tDCS in session 2 and then imaging in session 3) but in each
      session only one of imaging or tDCS experiments (for both tasks) will be conducted for each
      participant. OCD-relevant and aversive picture rating (explained below) will be done always
      in the session 3 as the last experiment.

    <description>Participants perform a decision-making task in which goal-directed and habitual strategies of decision-making compete to govern the manner of action selection. Action Selection Ratio is the ratio of goal-directed/habitual action selection strategies during the task. Change in Action Selection Ratio will be measured across 3 sessions (baseline, during fMRI and finally tDCS sessions).</description>

    <description>During symptom provocation-avoidance task, OCD-relevant photos will be shown to participants and they will be instructed to push a button to stop the picture presentation when they feel distressed such that they desire to stop viewing the photo. Timing of Avoidance Behavior is the interval between starting time of photo presentation until pushing the stop button. Change in Timing of Avoidance Behavior will be measured across 3 sessions (baseline, during fMRI and finally tDCS sessions).</description>
