    <textblock>
      The main purpose with this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a garment with
      integrated electrodes for multifocal transcutaneous electrical stimulation intended for
      treatment of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of spasticity at 12 Occasions using the Modified Ashworth Scale. Measures include both upper and lower limbs. Scores are rated by::
0= No increase in muscle tone
Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+= Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension
The mesures will be perfomed three times each week for four weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of physical function at 12 Occasions, the mesures will be perfomed three times each week for four weeks.
Instructions:
The patient should sit on a standard armchair, placing his/her back against the chair and resting his/her arms chair's arms. Any assistive device used for walking should be nearby. Regular footwear and customary walking aids should be used. The patient should walk to a line that is 3 meters (9.8 feet) away, turn around at the line, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The test ends when the patient's buttocks touch the seat. Patients should be instructed to use a comfortable and safe walking speed. A stopwatch should be used to time the test (in seconds).</description>

    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of physical function at 12 Occasions, the mesures will be perfomed three times each week for four weeks.
The participant will be placed in sitting position. Score 1 indicating lowest score on sitting function (highest need of support) and 8 indicating highest function on sitting function (lowest need of support)</description>

    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of physical function at 12 Occasions, the mesures will be perfomed three times each week for four weeks.The score is the number of blocks carried from one compartment to the other in one minute. Score each hand separately.
After testing, the examiner should count the blocks If a patient transports two or more blocks at the same time, this should be noted and the number subtracted from the total.</description>

    <description>The garment claims to have a 48 hours lasting effect of an hour of treatment. The garment should be worn for at least 1 hour every other day. All participants receive individually tailored garments and individually tailored appropriate training towards specific goals set in connection to study start. The garment is used in the home environment and the family is responsible for documentation of use in a diary. Measurements is performed following an ABAB design for four weeks. Measurement performed at 12 occasions during the four weeks are; spasticity, physical function, pain, sleep and adherence. Standardized protocols for the intervention are provided to involved physical therapists.</description>
