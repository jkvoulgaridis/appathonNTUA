  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, single-center, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effect of Stannous Protoporphyrin in healthy volunteers and
      in subjects with stage 3-4 CKD. The following biomarkers will be used as surrogate measures
      of protective activity: Haptoglobin, Ferritin, Bilirubin, Hemopexin, IL-10, and Heme
      Oxygenase-1. Additionally, the P21 biomarker will be monitored at various points of the
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects age 18 to 80 years (inclusive, at time of ICF).

          -  Body weight &lt;125 kg.

          -  Able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

          -  Female subjects must be either post-menopausal for at least 1 year or surgically
             sterile (tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 3
             months, or if of childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test and agree to
             use dual methods of contraception, or abstain from sexual activity from Screening
             until 28 days after study drug administration.

        Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly
        effective method of contraception from screening until 28 days after study drug
        administration. All fertile men with female partners of childbearing potential should be
        instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect their partner might be
        pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.

          -  CKD stage 3 as determined by a GFR between 30-59 ml/min as estimated using the CKD-EPI
             equation.

          -  CKD stage 4 as determined by a GFR between 15-29 ml/min as estimated using the CKD-EPI
             equation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of malignancy except carcinoma in situ in the cervix, early stage prostate
             cancer or non-melanoma skin cancers. Cancer free for less than 5 years.

          -  Use of investigational drugs or participation in another clinical trial within 30 days
             or 5 half-lives prior to screening, whichever is longer.

          -  Serum ferritin &gt; 500 ng/ml or who have received IV iron within 28 days of screening,
             or currently being treated with oral iron.

          -  Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while
             participating in the study.

          -  Regular use of drugs of abuse and/or positive findings on urinary drug screening.

          -  Current tobacco use and/or positive findings on urinary cotinine screening.

          -  Subjects who are severely physically or mentally incapacitated and who, in the opinion
             of investigator, are unable to perform the subjects' tasks associated with the
             protocol.

          -  Presence of any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places the
             subject at undue risk or potentially jeopardizes the quality of the data to be
             generated.

          -  Subjects with history of photosensitivity or active skin disease, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator could increase the risk of photosensitivity.

          -  Subjects with abnormal baseline liver tests or hepatitis serologies that suggest
             active infection.

          -  Subjects with CKD and not at their baseline of renal function and have significant
             acute or chronic illnesses.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or previous anaphylaxis to SnPP or to components thereof. -
