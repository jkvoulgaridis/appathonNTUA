  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether cigarette package inserts (i.e., small printed leaflets inside
      cigarette packs) with messages about the benefits of cessation and tips for quitting can help
      smokers quit. To do this, the investigators will conduct a 2 X 2 between-subject experiment
      in which 380 smokers will be randomized into one of four labeling groups: 1. no inserts or
      pictorial health warning labels (HWLs); 2. inserts only; 3. pictorial HWLs only; 4. inserts &amp;
      pictorial HWLs. Smokers will be given a 14-day supply of their preferred cigarette brand with
      packs labeled according to their experimental group. Participants will answer a brief survey
      at the end of each day and four other times each day, using ecological momentary assessment
      approaches. The investigators will study whether smokers in each group experience different
      psychological responses and behaviors associated with smoking cessation.
