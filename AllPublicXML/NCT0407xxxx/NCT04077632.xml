    <textblock>
      Chronic low back (CLBP) pain is an important public health and socioeconomic problem
      worldwide and, despite the volume of research in the area, it remains a difficult condition
      to treat. There are some evidences that altered heart rate variability (HRV) parameters are
      associated with different clinical disorders, such as chronic low back pain. For instances,
      diminished parasympathetic activity has been explored as a potential therapeutic target.
      Considering the dynamic interaction between brain and heart, neuromodulatory strategies
      targeting this relationship could exert a positive influence on cardiac autonomic system and
      pain modulation systems.

      Transcranial direct current (tDCS) stimulation is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique
      that has been presenting recent advances in the treatment of chronic pain. However, tDCS
      application focusing on brain-heart interaction has not been extensively explored, especially
      on chronic pain conditions.

      This study aims to investigate the effects of tDCS on HRV in chronic low back pain patients.
      Sixty patients will be randomized into two distinct groups to receive either tDCS (anodal) or
      tDCS (sham) in a single session protocol. The primary clinical outcome (HRV parameter) will
      be collected before, during and post-tDCS. The data will be collected by a blind examiner to
      the treatment allocation.
