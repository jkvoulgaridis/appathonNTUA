    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Nowadays, there is a progressive aging of population. Chronic osteoarticular pain
      is associated to a bigger consumption of medication and a deterioration of life quality in
      elderly people that could be improved by boosting education for health from Primary Health
      Care. JUSTIFICATION: The need to develop non pharmacological treatments in order to get
      better results in people's global care. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectivity of group
      intervention, based on Animal Assisted Therapy, on elderly people suffering from chronic
      osteoarticular pain and poli-medication; regarding decrease of chronic pain, use of
      analgesics and improvement of life quality. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Randomized clinical trial,
      two arms, controlled and open-label. Twelve group sessions of kinesiotherapy with the
      intervention of a therapy dog in the experimental group (EG), carried out in the Primary
      Health Centre.
