  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of butylphthalide (NBP) in the
      treatment of cerebral small vessel disease through a multicenter, randomized,double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. Butylphthalide Soft Capsule and placebo were prescribed to the
      experimental group and the control group for a period of 24-months, respectively. After that,
      the experimental group and the control group were given Butylphthalide Soft Capsule for 6
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Butylphthalide can protect mitochondrial function and inhibit neuronal apoptosis by
      significantly increasing the activity of mitochondrial ATP complex enzyme and mitochondrial
      respiratory chain complex enzyme IV, improving the fluidity of mitochondrial membrane and
      maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential. Butylphthalide can reconstruct microcirculation
      and protect mitochondria, which can protect neurovascular units in an all-round way. Findings
      from previous studies have shown that butylphthalide can improve the ability of daily living
      of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and can enhance cognitive function of
      patients diagnosed as subcortical vascular cognitive impairment no dementia.

             vascular origin (Fazekas score≥ 2 points) and lacunar lesions (≥ 2);

          4. Consistent with at least one of the following clinical manifestations: (1)Subjects
             with a history of lacunar stroke syndrome more than 6-months before study
             initiation(Patients should have one of the traditional clinical lacunar syndromes and
             a new symptomatic lesion with a diameter of less than 20mm observed in subcortical
             white matter or basal ganglia), without a stenosis of greater than 50% in ipsilateral
             internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery.) (2)Subjects with cognitive
             impairment (impairment involving memory and/or other cognitive domains and lasting for
             at least 3-months) have at least one domain rating of CDR &gt; 0.5. Cognitive impairment
             and cerebrovascular disease are likely to have a causal relationship, showing sudden

             frequently with the subjects (at least 4 days a week, at least 2 hours a day). The
             caregivers will help the subjects participate in the whole process of the study. The
             caregiver must accompany the subjects to participate in the research visits, and must
             fully interact and communicate with the subjects in order to provide valuable
             information for CIBIC-plus, ADL, NPI and other scales.

             screening, they need to take them stably for at least one month before screening, and
             try to maintain the dose stability during the research process. Sedative and hypnotic
             drugs such as zopiclone, alprazolam and estazolam may be used when necessary, but they

          3. Systemic diseases that may be responsible for cognitive impairment (such as liver and
             kidney dysfunction, endocrine diseases, vitamin deficiency, systemic autoimmune
