      The purpose of this phase 3, open-label, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, PK, and
      PD of lanadelumab in children with age of 2 years to &lt;12 years with Hereditary Angioedema
      (HAE).

      This Study will consists of 52-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period. 52-week
      treatment period comprises of a 26-week treatment period A (Day 0 to Day 182) and a 26-week
      treatment period B (Day 183 to Day 364). Participants who complete treatment period A will
      immediately continue into treatment period B.

      15 JULY 2020: The temporary enrollment stop of new patients into this study due to the
      COVID-19 pandemic has been lifted in one or more countries/sites, and the study is now again
      enrolling new patients. However, some countries/sites may still have paused the enrollment of
      new patients due to the pandemic.

      21 APRIL 2020: Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this investigational product or medicinal product. A SAE is any untoward clinical manifestation of signs, symptoms or outcomes (whether considered related to investigational product or not and at any dose which results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital abnormality/birth defect, is an important medical event. Adverse events of special interest for this study are hypersensitivity reactions and disordered coagulation (hypercoagulability events and bleeding events).</description>

             screening.

          -  Documented diagnosis of HAE (Type I or II) based upon both of the following:

               1. Documented clinical history consistent with HAE (SC or mucosal, nonpruritic
                  swelling episodes without accompanying urticarial).

               2. Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening from a sponsor- approved
                  central laboratory that confirm C1-INH functional level &lt;40 percent (%) of the

                  level below the normal range. With prior sponsor approval, participants may be
                  retested during the baseline observation period if results are incongruent with
                  clinical history or believed by the investigator to be confounded by recent
                  complement1 (C1) inhibitor use.

          -  A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at least 1 attack per 3 months. Note: In

          -  Have any active infectious illness or fever defined as an oral temperature greater
             than (&gt;) 38 degree celsius (°C) (100.4 fahrenheit [°F]), tympanic &gt; 38.5°C (101.3°F) ,
             axillary &gt;38°C (100.4°F), or rectal/core &gt;38.5°C (101.3°F) within 24 hours prior to
             the first dose of study drug in treatment period A.

          -  Have any HAE attack that is not resolved prior to the first dose of study drug in
             treatment period A.

             (ALT) &gt;3x upper limit of normal (ULN), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3x ULN, or
             total bilirubin &gt;2x ULN (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of Gilbert's
             syndrome).

          -  Have any condition (any surgical or medical condition) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or sponsor, may compromise their safety or compliance, preclude the
             successful conduct of the study, or interfere with interpretation of the results (eg,
             significant pre-existing illness or other major comorbidity that the investigator
             considers may confound the interpretation of study results).

          -  Participant has a known hypersensitivity to the investigational product or its
             components.
