  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB104 in healthy Japanese
      and non-Japanese participants. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of multiple, oral doses of BIIB104 administered BID for 9 days, with an
      additional dose occurring in the morning on Day 10 in healthy Japanese and non-Japanese
      participants.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Japanese participants, was born in Japan, and biological parents and grandparents
             were of Japanese origin.

          -  For Japanese participants, if living outside Japan for more than 5 years, must not
             have significantly modified diet since leaving Japan.

          -  Non-Japanese participants must have a screening weight within Â±20% of the mean value
             for Japanese participants.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Suicide attempt within the last 2 years. Participants who, in the Investigator's
             judgment, pose a significant suicide risk or who have suicidal ideation associated
             with actual intent and a method or plan in the past 6 months (i.e., &quot;Yes&quot; answers on
             items 4 or 5 of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale) will be excluded from the
             study.

        Note: Other protocol specific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
