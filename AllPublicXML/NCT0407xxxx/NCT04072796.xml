    <textblock>
      This study investigated effects of the neurogenic bladder on the quality of life in stroke
      survivors. Patients were divided into two groups: the First group consisted of patients with
      neurogenic bladder and the Second group consisted of patients without neurogenic bladder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic bladder after stroke is a commonly encountered medical condition which slows down
      the recovery process and exacerbates the functional status of the patient. The neurogenic
      bladder may possibly affect the quality of life of patients with stroke.

      Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the quality of
      life and the neurogenic bladder in Turkish stroke survivors.

      Methods: 71 patients with stroke were included in the study. Patients were divided into two
      groups: the First group consisted of patients with neurogenic bladder and the Second group
      consisted of patients without neurogenic bladder. Short Form-36 (SF-36), Barthel Index (BI),
      Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Mini-Mental Test (MMT) and Beck Depression Inventory
      (BDI) questionnaires were applied to both groups for clinical evaluations.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used to evaluate the quality of life of the patients. The form consists of 36 items, which measure 8 dimensions. These include (1) Physical function, (2) Social function, (3) Pain, (4) Energy/vitality, (5) Role limitation due to emotional problems , (6) Role limitation due to physical health problems, (7) Mental health and (8) General perception of health. Each subscale is evaluated between 0-100 points. A higher score indicates the better health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess depressive signs. The scale consists of 21 items and the items are ordered from mild to severe. Evaluation is performed in a range of 0-63 points. The lower score indicates the better psychological profile.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Mental Test (MMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Mini Mental Test (MMT) was used to evaluate the extent of cognitive impairment. MMT is divided into 5 main categories: orientation (10 points), memory (3 points), attention and calculation (5 points), recalling (3 points) and language (9 points). Total points is 30. Total score between 0-9 points is considered as severe cognitive impairment. Total score between 10-19 points is considered as moderate cognitive impairment. Total score between 20-23 points is considered as mild cognitive impairment. Total score between 24-30 points is considered as normal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brunnstrom scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Brunnstrom scale is used to evaluate separately upper extremity, lower extremity or hand functions. Six stages are defined. Stage 1: No active movement, Stage 2: Mild spasticity, weak flexor-extensor synergy patterns, Stage 3: Marked spasticity, synergy patterns are evident, Stage 4: Some isolated movements other than synergy patterns can be seen, Stage 5: Decreased spasticity, most muscle activities are isolated, Stage 6: Phasic and well-coordinated isolated movements are performed. A higher point indicates the better status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Ambulation Category</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) was used to evaluate the functional status. FAC assesses human support for ambulation rather than assistive devices. FAC 0: nonfunctional ambulation, FAC 1: Ambulator- dependent for physical assistance level II FAC 2: Ambulator- dependent for physical assistance level I, FAC 3: Ambulator-dependent for supervision FAC 4: Ambulator-independent level surfaces only FAC 5: Ambulator-independent. A higher score indicates the better status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Barthel Index (BI) evaluates functional independence in term of daily living activity. Total score is 100 points. A higher point indicates better functional status.</description>
