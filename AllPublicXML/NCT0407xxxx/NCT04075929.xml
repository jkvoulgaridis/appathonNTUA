      To compare the effects of short and long high intensity interval training (HIT) conducted
      with the same total accumulated duration on physiological- and performance parameters during
      a 4-week training period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies among elite athletes have documented the importance of large amounts of training
      volume in order to perform at a high level in endurance sports. It is also well documented
      that both low intensity training (LIT), moderate intensity training (MIT) and high intensity
      training (HIT) should be included in the overall training efforts. It is well documented that
      HIT has a positive effect on the aerobic endurance among both elite athletes and recreational
      athletes.

      Despite the fact that there is general agreement that HIT is an important part of the overall
      training, it is unclear how this part of the training should be organized in order to
      optimize the training effects. The adaptions of endurance performance seem to depend on both
      the intensity and the accumulated duration of the HIT sessions. Therefore, the aim of this
      study was to compare the effects of SI and LI training, including equal accumulated HIT
      duration, during a 4-week intervention period, conducted as 4x8-min with 2-min recovery
      periods, 4x(12x40/20-sec) with 2-min recovery periods and 4x(8x40/20-sec) with 2-min recovery
      periods, in different physiological- and performance parameters among well-trained cyclists.

    <description>The cyclists were allowed to perform ad libitum low intensity (LIT) in addition to high intensity (HIT) sessions that were determined to each group. The cyclists completed 12 supervised HIT sessions during the intervention period, three HIT sessions per week with at least 48 hours between each HIT-session. All HIT sessions were performed as supervised group training sessions. Each HIT session started with an individual 30 minutes' warm up at low intensity (55-70% HRmax) interspersed by freely chosen progressive sprints. For all groups the power output during the recovery periods was 50 % of the power output used during work intervals. The cyclists in all groups were instructed to perform each interval session at their maximal sustainable intensity. Each session ended with 15-20 minutes' cool down (55-70% HRmax). All HIT sessions were supervised and performed in groups on the University of Agder's (UiA) premises at Spicheren fitness center in Kristiansand.</description>
