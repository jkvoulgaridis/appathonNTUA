  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine the role of machine learning and computer aided
      diagnostics in automatic polyp detection and to determine in real-time how a computer-aided
      detection (CADe) algorithm will perform when compared to standard screening or surveillance
      colonoscopy alone. Design will be a multi-center, prospective, unblinded randomized tandem
      colonoscopy study. 196 patients referred for either screening or surveillance colonoscopy
      will be included.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting to the endoscopy unit for a screening colonoscopy or a
             surveillance colonoscopy

          -  Willingness to undergo tandem colonscopies with and without the use of computer-aided
             software while undergoing conventional colonoscopy with sedation

          -  Ability to provide written, informed consent (approved by IRB) and understand the
             responsibilities of trial participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  People with diminished cognitive capacity

          -  Patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy (e.g. as an evaluation for active GI bleed)

          -  Patients with incomplete colonoscopies (those where endoscopists did not successfully
             intubate the cecum due to technical difficulties or poor bowel preparation)

          -  Patients that have standard contraindications to colonoscopy in general (e.g.
             documented acute diverticulitis, fulminant colitis and known or suspected
             perforation).

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Patients referred for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
