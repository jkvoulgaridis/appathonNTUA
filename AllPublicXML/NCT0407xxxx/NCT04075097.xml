  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the acute effect of aerobic exercise and yoga on pain, plasma levels of
      endocannabinoids, and mood (i.e., mood disturbance and anxiety). Participants will complete
      three separate sessions on different days. The first session is a familiarization session in
      which participants complete questionnaires and are familiarized with the experimental
      protocols. During the second and third sessions, outcomes are measured before and after the
      participants complete either 44 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (i.e., walking on a
      treadmill) or 44 minutes of yoga.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neuropathic Pain Sensations as determined by VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 2 times during each experimental session- once before the assigned exercise task (i.e., baseline) and once upon task completion (i.e., approx. 50 mins later), approximately week 1 and week 2 on study.</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scales (VAS) will be used to assess the intensity of the following sensations specific to neuropathic pain: pins and needles, tingles, stinging, and electrical pain sensations. The VAS is measured on a 100mm scale ranging from &quot;No Pain&quot; to &quot;Worst Imaginable Pain.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in cold pain threshold</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of breast cancer (stage 0-III),

          -  no evidence of active disease (i.e., recurrence, bone metastases, etc),

          -  presence of painful polyneuropathy, with onset coinciding or developing after
             receiving chemotherapy agents that in the opinion of the research team is likely to
             have caused such symptoms,

          -  at least six months since last active cancer treatment, with no further planned
             treatment (Note. active treatment is defined as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation),

          -  the participant agrees to use the safety stop feature on the treadmill if needed,

          -  at least 18 years of age,

          -  and their physicians has provided consent for them to participate in yoga and aerobic
             exercise sessions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Undergoing current chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer,

          -  taking anticoagulant therapy,

          -  uncontrolled medical conditions (i.e., uncontrolled hypertension, heart disease, stage
             4 liver disease, end-stage renal disease, end-stage pulmonary disease, etc),

          -  stroke or myocardial infarction in the past 6 months,

          -  being pregnant or planning to become pregnant,

          -  severe mobility constraints (e.g., confined to a wheelchair),

          -  having a history of light headedness or fainting during blood draws or physical
             activity.
