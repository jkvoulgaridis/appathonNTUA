  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to support previous research on the effects of antioxidant therapy on
      the outcome of diabetic retinopathy and local oxidative stress values. The researchers intend
      to evaluate 56 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy undergoing the vitrectomy
      procedure, who will be assigned to a placebo group or combination antioxidant therapy. Each
      group will receive the intervention for 2 months. This intervention consists of taking one
      tablet (placebo or antioxidant therapy) orally, once a day.

      At the beginning of the study, only blood samples will be collected to evaluate the state of
      oxidative and metabolic stress at a systemic level. After 2 months of intervention, blood
      samples will be taken again on the day of the intervention, adding the samples of aqueous and
      vitreous humor obtained during the vitrectomy. The results obtained between both groups and
      the different analysis matrices will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes microvascular complication due to an insufficient oxygen
      supply to its endothelial cells in states of constant hyperglycemia. This entity is
      classified in two main categories: non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy, the latter is characterized for the presence of neovascularization as
      oppose to the first one.

      Oxidative stress has been considered as one of the main factors in the development of
      diabetic retinopathy. It is a result from an imbalance between oxidants production and
      cellular antioxidant defenses, which provokes DNA damage.

      The treatment of diabetic retinopathy simply includes glycemic, lipemic and blood pressure
      control. Only when the view is compromised is when a vitrectomy is performed, which usually
      occurs in the more advanced stages such as the proliferative stage. Antioxidant therapy has
      been used as a coadjuvant for these interventions, complementing the action and efficacy of
      the treatment established for diabetic retinopathy in the early stages. However, in order to
      obtain vitreous and aqueous humor, the vitrectomy procedure is required, which is only
      carried out in the proliferative stage.

      Diabetic retinopathy is a specific and chronic complication of diabetes mellitus and is known
      to have a prevalence of 43.6% internationally and 31.5% in the Mexican population. It
      represents the main cause of visual blindness and weakness in the economically active
      population, which also affects the quality of life and the productivity of the people who
      suffer it.

      The researchers intend to evaluate whether antioxidant therapy influences the levels of
      oxidative stress markers at the ocular level.
