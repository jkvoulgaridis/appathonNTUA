  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, general anaesthesia is carried under &quot;balanced anesthesia technique&quot; in which many
      anesthetic adjuvants are used simultaneously, including opioid analgesics in order to reduce
      the amount of inhalation agents. The most popular adjuvants used are remifentanil, which is
      an opioid analgesic, and dexmedetomidine. Both of these agents are short acting, can be
      infused with targeted concentrations, excreted shortly from the body with stable
      hemodynamics.

      Remifentanil, when infused for more than 2 hours, causes hyperalgesia to increase the amount
      of pain postoperatively as well as the amount of opioid analgesics. However, dexmedetomidine
      does not cause hyperalgesia and is known to have an opioid -sparing effect. In our center.

      In this study, we aim to compare the effects of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine on
      postoperative pain in patients undergoing Nuss procedure, which is a very painful operation
      on the chest wall.

    <description>In both interventional groups, Sevoflurane is used as an inhalational agent, in 0.5-1.5% age-adjusted Minimal Alveolar Concentration (MAC). As explained above, remifentanil is infused with Target Controlled Infusion pump, and concentration is adjusted so that Bispectral index (BIS) is maintained as 40-60, which means that the patients are maintained in general anesthesia. Remifentanil is usually infused with the effect site concentration of 2.0 to 6.0 ng/ml during general anesthesia. If bradycardia or hypotension develops due to remifentanil infusion, the infusion rate could be reduced, or inotropic, vasopressor, anticholinergic agents can be used (ephedrine, atropine, etc.) to correct the side effects of the drug, or the drug infusion can even be ceased. At the end of the surgery when skin closure starts, remifentanil infusion will be stopped.</description>

    <description>In both interventional groups, Sevoflurane is used as an inhalational agent, in 0.5-1.5% age-adjusted MAC (Minimal Alveolar Concentration). As explained above, dexmedetomidine is infused with syringe pump, and concentration is adjusted so that Bispectral index (BIS) is maintained as 40-60, which means that the patients are maintained in general anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine is loaded for 10 minutes in 1mcg/kg, and then infusion rate is set between 0.4 to 0.6mcg/kg/hour for this study. If bradycardia or hypotension develops due to remifentanil infusion, the infusion rate could be reduced, or inotropic, vasopressor, anticholinergic agents can be used (ephedrine, atropine, etc.) to correct the side effects of the drug, or the drug infusion can even be ceased. At the end of the surgery when skin closure starts, dexmedetomidine infusion will be stopped.</description>
