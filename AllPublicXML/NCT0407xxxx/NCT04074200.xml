      This study aims to explore the difference in outcomes relating to pain and quality of life
      after open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted inguinal hernia repair.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational pilot study comparing outcomes of pain and
      quality of life after inguinal hernia repair between open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted
      surgical approaches. The study will focus on short-term outcomes through 3 months
      post-operation. During the post-operative period through 3 months, pain medication intake,
      pill count, subject-reported pain (on post-operative days 1-3 and 14 days post-surgery), and
      quality of life (at 14 days, 30 days, and 3 months post-surgery), incidence of intra- and
      post-operative complications, and time to return to normal activity will be collected.

The hernia defect may be closed, as per the operating surgeon's standard of care (SOC). Mesh may be used to repair the hernia, as per SOC. The specific laparoscopic approach may vary due to surgeon preference and patient characteristics.

    <description>With the patient under general anesthesia, several small incisions are made in the groin area. Ports are placed, the abdomen is insufflated, and the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive) is docked to the patient and used to complete the procedure.
