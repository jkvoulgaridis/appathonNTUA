  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by physiological changes, some of
      which are thought to be chronic, while others are observed in response to stressogenic
      stimuli. A psychiatric diagnosis of PTSD is currently based mainly on non-quantitative
      elements, such as interviews and subjective impressions. Discernable patterns of
      stress-related measures may constitute a physiological and biochemical phenotype
      characteristic of PTSD, which may serve as a biomarker and support diagnostic decisions, as
      well as personalized treatment plans.

      The current study is aimed at examining the possibility of basing a psychiatric diagnosis by
      measuring changes in the biochemical phenotype of participants with PTSD. Physiological and
      biochemical data will be collected from participants with and without PTSD using wearable
      sensors and adhesive biosensor patches. The data will be collected in two conditions: in a
      neutral, quiet situation, and during and following exposure to controlled stressogenic
      stimuli.
