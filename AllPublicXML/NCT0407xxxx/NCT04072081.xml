      The main objective of this study is to compare a Drug-coated Ballon with Drug-eluting stent
      in the treatment of coronary arty lesions in STEMI patients in de novo coronary lesions.The
      study aims to find a DCB treatment for STEMI patients can achieve early and mid-term
      functional outcomes that are not inferior to DES, and realize the strategy of intervention
      without implantation.
