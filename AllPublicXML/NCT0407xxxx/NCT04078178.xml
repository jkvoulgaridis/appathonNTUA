  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we want to learn more about whether taking Niagen, a daily supplement
      containing a form of Vitamin B3, will improve cognitive function, mood, and daily activity in
      people with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a 7 month period, we will ask study participants to take both Niagen or a placebo for 8
      weeks each and come in for research visits every 4 weeks. Most research visit will involve a
      blood draw, an EEG, cognitive testing, and mood questionnaires. The study involves at least 1
      lumbar puncture, with the option to participate in 2 more lumbar punctures as part of an
      additional sub-study. There will also be an option to participate in an MRI sub-study, in
      which participants would have up to 3 MRIs over the course of the study. In between research
      visits, we will also ask the participants to wear a Fitbit activity tracker in play
      computerized brain games a few times a week. This will enable us to get a snapshot of each
      subject's functioning levels day to day and better determine whether or not the supplement is
      having an effect on the participant.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Ages 60 and up;

          2. Memory and other cognitive complaints consistent with SCD or MCI as defined by the
             National Institute on Aging:

             a. SCD will be defined as: i. any subjective concern of change in cognitive
             functioning without objective evidence of cognitive impairment, and ii. complete
             preservation of functional abilities and independence in instrumental activities of
             daily living.

             b. MCI will be defined as: i. a preexisting diagnosis of MCI given by a trained
             physician or behavioral health provider, or ii. evidence of objective impairment in
             cognitive functioning in one or more domain with preservation of functional abilities
             and independence in instrumental activities of daily living as defined by the National
             Institute on Aging;

          3. Minimum score of 18 on the MoCA;

          4. Ability to provide direct informed consent as assessed by obtaining a score of 100% of
             the Informed Consent Worksheet after two attempts;

          5. Education level, English language skills and literacy indicates participant able to
             complete all assessments;

          6. Willing and able to complete all assessment and study procedures;

          7. Not pregnant, lactating, or of child-bearing potential;

          8. If on cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine, doses are stable for 3 months prior
             to baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any specific CNS disease history other than suspected ADRD, such as major clinical
             stroke, brain tumor, normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, significant
             head trauma with persistent neurological of cognitive deficits or complaints;

          2. Any impairment in instrumental activities of daily living that would indicate a level
             of cognitive impairment beyond MCI as assessed by a trained rater;

          3. Clinically significant unstable medical condition that could affect safety or
             compliance with the study and would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose a risk
             to the participant if they were to participate in the study;

          4. History of neuroimaging with evidence of major infarction, injury, infection, or other
             focal lesions that may be related to cognitive dysfunction;
