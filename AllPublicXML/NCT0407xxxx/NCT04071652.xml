      The Mistral is an investigational device intended for percutaneous trans-catheter repair in
      high risk for surgery individuals suffering from functional Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR).

      The device system is to be used only in accordance with the approved Investigational Plan on
      subjects who have signed an informed consent form. Device use is limited to the approved
      study investigators.

      The study is designed to clinically demonstrate device acute safety and technical performance
      (Primary Endpoints) along with longer FU device safety and effectiveness evaluation
      (Secondary Endpoint).

      The main objectives of the study are :

        -  Evaluate the Acute safety of the implanted Mistral device post procedure and at 30 day
           follow up period.

        -  Evaluate the long term Safety of the device.

        -  Demonstrate effectiveness of the Mistral device in reducing TR.

      Primary endpoints:

        -  Safety: Acute safety. Rate of device related SAE including device related mortality,
           stroke, MI, cardiac tamponade, surgery for failed percutaneous repair and non-elective
           cardiovascular surgery to treat an adverse event. At discharge and 30 days.

        -  Performance: Mistral Implantation rate of technical success (defined as successful
           device implantation with grasped chords from at least two leaflets.).

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Safety: Safety at 3 and 6 months. Rate of device related SAEs at 3, 6 months.

        -  Effectiveness: TR reduction post-procedure, at discharge and 30 days, 3 and 6 months.
           Improved NYHA class, 6MWTdistance and KCCQ (quality of life) at 30 days, 3 and 6 months
