  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the systemic and white adipose tissue inflammatory profile of
      individuals who are classified as lean and obese. Blood and white adipose tissue samples will
      be collected in the fasted state to assess inflammatory status.

      There is evidence to suggest that markers of inflammation in the blood and white adipose
      tissue increase with increasing levels of obesity. However, the white adipose tissue total
      protein content and phosphorylation of proteins involved in inflammatory pathways has not
      previously been compared between lean and obese individuals.

      The investigators hypothesise that obese individuals will have increased levels of
      inflammation in the blood and white adipose tissue, compared to their lean counterparts.
