  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is the most frequent mononeuropathy. CTS is more frequent in
      females than in males, it has been associated to work activities, hormone exposure and
      obesity. Although its primary treatment is conservative, there is strong evidence that
      patients who retard surgery are more prone to develop worse outcomes. Surgery to treat CTS
      consists in liberating carpal tunnel in order to ameliorate median nerve symptoms; however,
      more than 20% of patients who undergo surgery have recurrent CTS (RCTS). RCTS is due to a
      fibrotic process in the site of the surgery. Amniotic membrane (AM) is the inner layer of the
      placenta which has been used to treat different pathologies. AM transplantation (AMT) has
      demonstrated to significantly inhibit inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, the aim of the
      present study was to determine the effect of AMT in CTS surgery. The present is a randomized,
      open labeled, controlled clinical study. The investigators included patients with recent
      diagnosis of CTS and divided into two groups. The experimental group received AMT
      concomitantly with conventional surgery; whilst, the control group received only the
      conventional surgery. Clinical status of patients measured with the BCTQ questionaire was the
      main outcome. Both groups showed similar BCTQ punctuation at the beginning of the study.
      However, the results of the experimental group were significantly better than those from the
      control group through time, until the finish of the study. None of the patients presented
      complications or adverse effects related to the AMT. These results indicate that AMT is a
      secure and suitable treatment for CTS presenting better clinical outcomes at one-year
      follow-up.

    <description>The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) is a disease-specific measure of self-reported symptom severity and functional status. It is frequently used in the reporting of outcomes from trials into interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome.
It has two distinct scales, the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) which has 11 questions and uses a five-point rating scale and the Functional Status Scale (FSS) containing 8 items which have to be rated for degree of difficulty on a five-point scale. Each scale generates a final score (sum of individual scores divided by number of items) which ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score indicating greater disability.</description>
