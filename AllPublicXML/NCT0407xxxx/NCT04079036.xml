  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The balanced anesthesia process contains three main parts: the control of hypnosis,
      analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade. For the induction phase, the anesthesiologist performs
      protocols based on prior planning specific to each patient and usually performs these
      controls by monitoring the classic vital signs and other clinical signs for the maintenance
      phase.

      In a way, this professional is the controller in a control system that acts on the plant (the
      patient) through the infusion of hypnotic drugs, analgesics and neuromuscular blockers. In
      addition, the anesthesiologist estimates the state of consciousness, the level of analgesia
      and the level of neuromuscular blockage through other indirect measures, as well as a state
      observer.

      There are different techniques for direct monitoring of these three anesthesia variables
      (DoA, NMB and NoL), such as BIS and Narcotrend, but all have some disadvantages, especially
      when the anesthesia process combines different drugs. This work proposes a new way of
      evaluating DoA, NMB and NoL using data fusion techniques to combine classical clinical signs
      with advanced EEG monitoring techniques to provide a decision support system for the
      anesthesiologist.

      The balanced anesthesia process contains three main parts: the control of hypnosis, the
      analgesia and neuromuscular blockade. For the induction phase, the anesthesiologist performs
      protocols based on prior planning specific to each patient. Normally, the anesthesiologist
      controls the process by monitoring the classical vital signs and other clinical most common
      signs during the maintenance phase. In a way, this professional is the controller in a
      control system that acts on the plant (the patient) through the infusion of hypnotic and
      analgesic drugs and neuromuscular blockers.

      In addition, the anesthesiologist estimates the the level of consciousness, of nociception
      and the level of neuromuscular blockade through these indirect measurements, just as a state
      observer in a control system would do.

      There are different techniques for the direct monitoring of these three variables of
      anesthesia (DoA, NMB and NoL), such as BIS and Narcotrend, but all of them present a few
      disadvantages and mis-measurements, especially when the anesthesia process combines different
      drugs.

      This work proposes a new way of evaluating DoA, NMB and NoL, using techniques to combine
      classical clinical signs with advanced EEG monitoring, to provide a decision support system
      for the anesthesiologist.

      For this, we will perform data acquisition from the equipment usually used in surgical
      procedures with general anesthesia, such as ECG, EEG, blood pressure, mechanical ventilation,
      among others.

      In short, all data of the patient's vital signs during the procedure and the actions taken by
      the anesthesiologist and surgeons.

      The data will be concentrated on a specific equipment, and will be analyzed together with the
      data of other patients to improve the mathematical models involved in the process.
