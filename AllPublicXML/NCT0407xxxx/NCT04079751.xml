  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare migration patterns between mechanical and anatomic
      alignment surgical techniques for the Attune S+ CR-FB knee system using model-based RSA over
      the first 2 post-operative years.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing cruciate-retaining
      total knee arthroplasty with the Attune S+ fixed bearing TKR system. Patients will be
      randomized to two study groups:

        1. Neutral mechanical alignment;

        2. Anatomical alignment.

      The principal objective of this study is to compare migration patterns between mechanical and
      anatomic alignment surgical techniques for the Attune S+ CR-FB knee system using model-based
      RSA over the first 2 post-operative years.

      Secondary objectives include; comparison of 2-year migration values against published
      thresholds for adequate short-term fixation, comparison of functional and health status of
      subjects following surgery, comparison of intra-operative soft-tissue releases, incidence of
      complications and adverse events, and to assess several health economic parameters relating
      to the surgery.

    <measure>Oxford-12 knee score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a patient self-administered 12-item questionnaire with each question having a Likaert-like response option. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, and the items are summated, with lower total scores indicating poorer performance. The OKS measures pain and general activities of daily living.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient are asked to indicate the degree to which they have the above thoughts and feelings when they are experiencing pain. Each PCS item is rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The PCS total score is computed by summing responses to the 13 items. PCS total scores range from 0 - 52.</description>

    <description>Evaluate and compare the change from preoperative to 2 years between the study groups timepoints in functional outcomes assessments. The EuroQol 5D 5L questionnaire is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of generic health status - completed by the subject. The EQ5D uses a Likert scale which assesses five states (mobility, self care, usual care, pain and discomfort and anxiety and depression) at five different levels - none(0), slight(1), moderate(2), severe(3) or unable to perform(5). Levels are coded 1-5 and an index score is then generated.</description>

    <description>The Pre-surgical and/or Post-surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) questionnaire is a patient reported questionnaire that consists of 24 questions relating to the patient's awareness of their knee. Questions include the patient's self-confidence about the current status of their knee performance, stability, and overall satisfaction. Each question has a 5, 6 or 10 Likaert- like response option.</description>
