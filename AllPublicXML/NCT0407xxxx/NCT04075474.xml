      Background: Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution is effective in arresting early childhood
      caries (ECC). Previous studies suggested that it might exert a preventive effect in managing
      ECC. However, no well-designed clinical trial has been performed to study this topic. The aim
      of this randomised clinical trial is to assess whether 38% SDF is superior to 5% sodium
      fluoride (NaF) varnish in preventing new carious lesions in primary anterior teeth.

      Methods/Design: This is a Phase II single-centre randomized, double-blind, active-controlled,
      parallel-group pragmatic trial. The hypothesis tested is that 38% SDF is more effective than
      5% NaF in preventing new caries development in primary anterior teeth. Approximately 2,100
      three-year-old kindergarten children who are generally healthy and with parental consent will
      be recruited. This sample size is sufficient for an appropriate statistical analysis of
      superiority trial with power at 80%, allowing for a 15% drop-out rate. Stratified
      randomization will be adopted for the intervention allocation. The intervention is either 38%
      SDF or 5% NaF (as positive control) therapy on primary upper anterior teeth. Dental
      examination followed by fluoride therapy will be conducted every six months until 30 months
      in kindergartens by a single examiner. The examiner, children and children's parents will be
      blinded to the treatment allocation. Questionnaire survey will be conducted to study the
      children's oral health-related behaviours and their socioeconomic backgrounds.

      Discussion: The effectiveness of 38% SDF in preventing ECC remains uncertain. If the results
      are as anticipated, it will help change the standard of care that using 5% NaF for ECC
      prevention. In addition, the results will be widely available and increase adoption of SDF in
      other countries to reduce the global burden of ECC.
