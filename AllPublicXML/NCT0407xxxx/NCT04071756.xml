  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is studying the preventative use of topical 0.1% tazarotene gel daily in
      addition to best practice standards to reduce the development of hand-foot skin reaction
      (HFSR).

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved tazarotene for specifically for
      hand-foot skin reaction but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are:

      -aiming to determine if the use of tazarotene gel daily, in addition to best practice
      standards:

        -  reduces the development of HFSR.

        -  decreases modification of regorafenib dose due to HFSR

        -  improves health-related quality of life associated with HFSR

        -  decreases stress associated with HFSR

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors with a
             plan to initiate regorafenib via dose escalation protocol describe in the ReDOS study
             in CRC. The ReDOS study recommends this dose escalation of regorafenib:80mg daily x 1
             week, 120mg daily x 1 week, 160mg daily times one week, off week, then 160mg daily
             goal, or maximum tolerated dose thereafter. This is not a separate study; this is the
             current standard of care for regorafenib dosing. In addition, to compare across the
             cohorts, patients must be ambulatory with full use of all 4 distal extremities.

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation Tazarotene is known to be
             teratogenic, although the dose required with topical application to affect the
             developing human fetus is unknown. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of administration.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Regorafenib use in combination with another TKI

          -  Pregnancy or non-compliance with contraception (4 weeks before, during and for at
             least 3 ovulatory cycles after treatment cessation). Pregnant women are excluded from
             this study because tazarotene is category X with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects.

          -  Nursing or lactating: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with tazarotene,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.

          -  A history of hypervitaminosis A

          -  Other systemic retinoids needed for another condition (ie. Isotretinoin for
             inflammatory acne, acitretin for psoriasis, bexarotene for CTCL).

          -  Need for treatment dose systemic steroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents (i.e.,
             for autoimmune disease or cerebral edema) at the time of enrolment

          -  Psoriasis or other autoimmune disease requiring skin directed or systemic therapy
             known to impact keratinocyte proliferation (UV therapy to the hands or feet, TNF
             inhibitors, etc).

          -  Active skin disease of the hands or feet with redness, scaling or blisters prior to
             enrolment

          -  Participants who have had any systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks
             prior to entering the study AND who have not recovered from adverse events on the
             hands and feet due to the agents administered.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents to treat HFSR.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled lower
             extremity edema, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.
