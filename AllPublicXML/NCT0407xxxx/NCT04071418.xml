  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrence after radiotherapy are often encountered in clinical
      practice.Patients with recurrence after radiotherapy are less likely to undergo surgery or
      secondary radiotherapy, and the guidelines recommend only systemic therapy, although the
      effective rate is relatively low.For patients with local recurrence without distant
      metastasis, local treatment is still significant.Radioactive I-125 Seed Implantation (RISI)
      treatment is to I-125 Radioactive nuclide directly inside the implanted tumors, make its rays
      to continuous destruction of tumor cells, have inside the tumor target high dose, low dose of
      normal tissue around, and its radiation is low dose rate, in theory, more conducive to the
      protection of the normal tissue, more suitable for salvage treatment of recurrence after
      radiotherapy lesions.Some retrospective studies on RISI treatment of NSCLC showed that the
      local control rate was up to 25%-80%, and there were few reports of toxic and side effects,
      suggesting that it had good efficiency and safety.Therefore, for patients with recurrent
      NSCLC after chest radiotherapy, RISI may be considered.And template technology, 3 d printing
      is a new kind of technology in recent years, can be individualized and human body surface,
      the guide posts on the the direction of the puncture needle can be accurately controlled, the
      current data show that in the template with CT guided by solid tumors as well had
      significantly higher accuracy, as the actual target dose of basic postoperative can reach the
      design request of the preoperative planning, so the application of 3D printing template helps
      to further improve the operation efficiency and safety, also has potential promotion effect
      to curative effect.The purpose of this study was: (1) to observe the efficacy, toxic and side
      effects of RISI in the treatment of recurrent NSCLC after radiotherapy under the guidance of
      3D printing template assisted CT, and to evaluate its safety and effectiveness;(2) to explore
      the relationship between the efficacy, toxicity and side effects of RISI dose in the
      treatment of recurrent NSCLC after radiotherapy;(3) analyze the relevant influencing factors
      affecting the effect/toxicity of RISI in the treatment of recurrent NSCLC after radiotherapy.

      The purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy and adverse reactions of RISI in the
      treatment of recurrent NSCLC after radiotherapy, and to evaluate its safety and efficacy.To
      explore the relationship between the efficacy, toxicity and side effects of recurrent NSCLC
      treated with different RISI doses after radiotherapy.To analyze the relevant influencing
      factors affecting the efficacy/toxicity of RISI in the treatment of recurrent NSCLC after
      radiotherapy.

      This study is a non-randomized, prospective, single-arm, cohort study.Patients meeting the
      inclusion criteria were enrolled consecutively in the order of admission and treatment, and a
      total of 30 patients were expected to be enrolled.The therapeutic dose range of I-125 was
      140-160Gy, and the prescribed dose was intended to be divided into 15 cases of 140-150Gy and
      150-160Gy, respectively. The specific situation was subject to the actual postoperative
      verified dose.
