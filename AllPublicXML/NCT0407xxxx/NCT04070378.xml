      Daratumumab is a human antibody that targets CD38. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of
      multiple myeloma, has broad-ranging immunomodulatory effects on nonplasma cells that express
      CD38, and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. CD38 expression on CD8+ T-cells is
      significantly increased in the blood of early AD patients as compared with age-matched
      controls, and activated T-cells are capable of trafficking into the central nervous system
      and exerting toxic effects. This study is designed to explore whether treatment with
      Daratumumab may have a clinically meaningful effect on patients with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease.

          2. Each subject must have a diagnosis of probable AD dementia according to National
             Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria.

          4. Each subject must have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan performed during the
             screening period that is consistent with a diagnosis of AD.

          5. Each subject must have a positive amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan,
             either performed during the screening period, or previously performed provided that
             the scan and result are considered acceptable by the investigator.

          6. If the subject is receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, rivastigmine, or
             galantamine) and/or memantine, the dose must have been stable for at least 12 weeks
             before the screening visit, and the subject must be willing to remain on the same dose
             for the duration of the trial.

          7. Each subject must have a study partner who is reliable and competent. The study
             partner must have a close relationship with the subject, have face to face contact at
             least 3 days/week for a minimum of 6 waking hours/week, and be willing to accompany
             the subject to all required study visits.

          8. Each subject must have no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results
             [complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio
             (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), comprehensive metabolic panel
             (CMP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and vitamin B12 level] at the screening
             visit.

          9. Each subject must have results of a physical and neurological examination and vital
             signs within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator at the
             screening visit.

         10. If female, the subject must be postmenopausal defined as: No menses for 12 or more
             months without an alternative medical cause OR permanently surgically sterile
             (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or hysterectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has a Rosen-modified Hachinski Ischemia Score &gt; 4 at the screening visit.

          2. The subject has a known history of stroke or evidence from screening MRI that is
             clinically significant in the investigator's opinion.

          3. The subject has evidence of a clinically relevant neurological disorder other than
             probable AD at the screening visit, including: vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease,
             dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy,
             corticobasal degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease,

             based on DSM-5 criteria, including schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, bipolar
             disorder, delirium, or major depression. (Major depression in remission is not
             exclusionary.) A score on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) of 5 or more
             requires an assessment by an appropriate health care professional to evaluate for the
             presence of major depression. Subjects with a score of 5 or more who are not diagnosed
             with major depression following such an assessment may be included in the trial.

          5. The subject has a history of alcoholism or drug dependency/abuse within the last 5
             years before screening.

          6. The subject has been treated with any investigational product within 60 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit.

             protein.

          9. The subject has received a live/live-attenuated bacterial or viral vaccine within 3
             months prior to the screening visit.

         10. The subject has been treated with immunosuppressive medications, such as azathioprine,
             cyclosporine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, or mycophenylate, within 2 months prior to the
             screening visit.

         11. The subject has been treated with a course of corticosteroids longer than 5 days
             within 2 months prior to the screening visit.

         15. The subject has a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

         16. The subject has had a myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient
             ischemic attack or required intervention for any of these conditions (e.g., coronary
             artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention via cardiac catheterization,
             thrombolytic therapy) within 6 months prior to the screening visit.

         17. The subject has had an infection requiring medical intervention within 30 days prior
             to the screening visit.

         18. The subject has serologic evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             infection based on hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis core antibody blood tests
             at the screening visit.

         19. The subject has serologic evidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection based on
             hepatitis C antibody blood test at the screening visit.

         20. The subject has serologic evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
             based on HIV antigen/antibody test at the screening visit.

         21. The subject has a platelet count less than 50,000 per microliter (mL) at the screening
             visit.

             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or localized
             prostate carcinoma) within the 2 years prior to the screening visit.

         24. The subject has had any other unstable/uncontrolled medical illness within 12 weeks
             prior to the screening visit such that, in the judgment of the investigator,
             participation in the trial would pose a significant medical risk to the subject.

         25. The subject has significant visual or auditory impairment, or limited English
             proficiency, that in the investigator's opinion would preclude collection of outcome
             measures.

         26. The subject has any contraindication to or inability to tolerate brain MRIs (e.g., a
             pacemaker or any other implanted device or condition that would preclude proximity to
             a strong magnetic field).

         27. The subject has any contraindication to or inability to tolerate a PET scan (includes
             current or recent participation in any procedures involving radioactive agents such
             that the total radiation dose exposure to the subject in any given year would exceed
             acceptable limits of annual and total dose).

         28. The subject has a history of allergy to dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, acetaminophen,
             montelukast, or acyclovir.
