  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessing symptoms of patients with cancer should be a priority for the physicians to improve
      their quality of life. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) is a common tool, easy to
      complete and to analyse. Originally, it has been validated in English with 9 common symptoms.
      But a new version with 12 commons symptoms and some explanations has been created. This
      modified version has been translated in French, and the transcultural validation has been
      done. But the psychometreic validation has not been validated yet.

      The primary objective is to validate the psychometric properties of this new version in
      French.

      To validate the tool, we will compare the ESAS12-F to the European Organization for research
      and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) which assesses
      common symptoms for patients with cancer, which is validated in French, but which is longer
      and more difficult to complete and to analyse. the patient will complete the ESAS 12-F and
      the EORTC QLQ-C30 at day 1, then the ESAS12-F at day 2, and the ESAS12-F and the EORTC
      QLQ-C30 at day 7.

    <description>The validation of the French version of the modified ESAS scale will be made by assessing the following metrological properties: validity (criterion validity and construct validity) :
Criterion validity will be established against the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale using correlation coefficient for each item. It will be assessed at Day 1 and Day 7. Construct validity will be assessed by a principal component analysis (PCA) an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and then a confirmatory analysis (CFA) on an independent sample.</description>

    <description>The validation of the French version of the modified ESAS scale will be made by assessing the following metrological properties: reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) :
Internal consistency will be checked using Cronbach's alpha coefficient or a more adequate coefficient whenever the former is not applicable. Test-retest reliability will be checked using the intra-class correlation coefficient. It will be assessed at Day 2 and Day 7.</description>

    <description>Comparison between 2 tools evaluating the symptoms of patients with advanced cancer: the ESAS12-F and the EORTC QLQ C30 to assess if the ESAS12-F well evaluates the symptoms and if it is easy to complete. The objective is to validate the ESAS12-F, which is easier and shorter than the well validated EORTC QLQ C30</description>
