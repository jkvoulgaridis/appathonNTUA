          -  Imaging Criteria:

               1. Strokes in the Anterior Circulation:

                    -  Non-Contrast CT (NCCT): ASPECTS 6 to 10 on baseline CT, or

                       and Mismatch Ratio ≥ 1.5

                    -  CT perfusion (without Automated Volume Calculation): ASPECTS 6 to 10 on the
                       CBV maps with Visualized MTT or TMax - CBV Mismatch greater than 50%, or

                    -  Brain MRI: ASPECTS 6 to 10 (and &lt;70cc if Automated Volume Calculation is
                       available) on baseline diffusion-weighted sequence (DWI).

               2. Strokes in the Posterior Circulation: pc-ASPECTS score 8 to 10 on baseline NCCT,
                  CTA-source images, or DWI MRI.

                    -  Subjects for whom IV-tPA is indicated and who are available for treatment,
                       are treated with IV-tPA within 4.5 hours of stroke onset (onset time is
                       defined as the last time when the subject was witnessed to be at baseline),
                       with verification that the subject has received/is receiving the correct IV
                       t-PA dose for the estimated weight

                    -  Arterial puncture within 12 hours of symptom onset (or time last seen well -
                       TLSW), thrombectomy procedure able to be completed within 2 hours from
                       procedure start (arterial puncture).

                    -  Subject or legal representative is able and willing to give informed
                       consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Rapid neurological improvement prior to groin puncture suggestive of resolution of
             stroke

          -  Seizures at stroke onset if it makes the diagnosis of stroke doubtful and precludes
             obtaining an accurate baseline NIHSS assessment.

               -  Note: Subjects with a questionable seizure at onset of stroke should not be
                  excluded if DSA confirms the presence of intracranial ICA and/or M1 occlusion,
                  and accurate NIHSS can be obtained.

          -  Pre-existing medical neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the
             neurological or functional evaluations, e.g. dementia with prescribed
             anti-cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g. Aricept).

          -  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, significant cardiac arrhythmia, evidence of ongoing
             myocardial infarction, concern for pre-treatment pulmonary aspiration.

          -  Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or stroke in multiple territories.

          -  Cerebral vasculitis.

          -  History of severe allergy to contrast medium.

          -  Known allergy to stent retriever materials (nitinol, stainless steel);

             [≤ 3 cm]).

          -  CT or MRI evidence of recent/fresh hemorrhage on presentation.

          -  CTA, MRA, or DSA evidence of flow limiting carotid dissection, high-grade stenosis, or
             complete cervical carotid occlusion requiring stenting at the time of the index
             procedure (i.e., mechanical thrombectomy).

          -  Evidence of dissection in the intracranial cerebral arteries;

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension on presentation (defined as SBP &gt; 220 mmHg and / or DBP &gt;
             120 mmHg). For subjects placed on intravenous BP medication, uncontrolled hypertension
             is defined as SBP &gt; 185 mmHg and / or DBP &gt; 110 mmHg.

          -  Baseline hemoglobin of &lt; 7 mmol/L.

          -  Baseline platelet count &lt; 50,000/uL.

          -  Renal failure as defined by a serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL (264 mmol/L).

               -  Note: subjects on renal dialysis may be treated regardless of serum creatinine
                  levels.

          -  Known hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency, or on anticoagulant
             therapy with INR &gt; 3.0 or PTT &gt; 3 times normal. Subjects on factor Xa inhibitor for
             24-48 h ago must have a normal PTT.

          -  Baseline blood glucose of &lt; 50 mg/dL (2.78 mmol) or &gt; 400 mg/dL (22.20 mmol). Note:
             The ''correction'' of baseline glucose or coagulation laboratory values to meet
             inclusion criteria will not be allowed.

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Known current or recent use of illicit drugs or alcohol abuse.

          -  Use of an investigational drug or device within past 3 months;

          -  Life expectancy less than 6 months.

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes an
             endovascular procedure or poses a significant hazard to the subject if an endovascular
             procedure was performed.
