  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells have been implicated to play a role in female reproductive
      performance. Serval studies showed an increased uNK cell density in the endometrium of women
      with reproductive failure. In this study, we wish to investigate the density and clustering
      of four different immune cells.

    <textblock>
      Implantation is a process whereby the embryo attaches itself to the endometrium. In humans,
      the endometrium has a specific period of uterine receptivity, which occurs 5-7 days after
      ovulation and remains receptive for ~4 days (cycle days 20-24), when embryo implantation
      starts. Implantation failure refers to the failure of the embryo to reach a stage when
      intrauterine gestational sac is recognized by ultrasonography. It occurs when the embryo is
      abnormal or when endometrial function is impaired.

      Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells have been implicated to play a role in female reproductive
      performance. They comprise 70-80% of the total leukocyte population in the endometrium during
      implantation and early pregnancy. Several studies showed an increased uNK cell density in the
      endometrium of women with reproductive failure. To better understand the contribution of
      various immune factors to endometrial function and future pregnancy, it is proposed to
      examine the major immune cells in the same specimen to measure the relative magnitude of the
      cell density changes and the degree of clustering between two immune cell types.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the endometrial leucocytes profile around the time of
      embryo implantation.

    <description>The counting method will be performed according to an agreed and published standardized protocol by a multicenter working group designed to reduce variance of results between centres. Ten images of 40X magnification fields will be analyzed for each sample. The first field to be captured should be selected at random, ensuring that it contained the luminal epithelial border. Subsequent fields should be obtained by moving one field to the left or right of the original field, keeping the luminal epithelial border in view.</description>

    <description>. Endometrial samples are obtained using a biopsy catheter as follows: the Pipette is inserted through the cervical os and advanced gently until resistance is felt. The inner piton of the device is then withdrawn to create suction, and the endometrial sample is obtained by moving the pipette up and down approximately 2-3 cm within the uterine cavity. The device is rotated 360Â° to ensure adequate coverage of the area.</description>
