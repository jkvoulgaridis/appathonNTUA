  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the purpose of the researchers; The aim of this study is to evaluate the consistency of niche
      dimensions measured by ultrasonography with visual measurement of the surgeon during the
      operation of the patient when presenting with pain in her current pregnancy.

      If patients who have had previous cesarean section present to the emergency department with
      pain or NST pain, a panic occurs immediately for operation. Purpose of researchers; The aim
      of this study is to investigate whether a really fine determination of the thickness of the
      old incision line is associated with full-thickness rupture or incomplete rupture, which
      appears to be an operation, and if a relationship is found, there is a limit for this
      thickness.
