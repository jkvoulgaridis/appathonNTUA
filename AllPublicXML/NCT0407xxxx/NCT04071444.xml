  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia spectrum have been suffering from constipation due to long-term
      use of psychotropic medications and changes in physical activity and eating habits caused by
      diseases.

      Aim this study was to examine the effectiveness of Baduanjin program in improving the
      symptoms of intestinal peristalsis and constipation in patients with psychosis.

      Method:A randomized controlled trial was conducted in tow psychiatric centers in northern
      Taiwan.The experimental group was provided with an 8- session Baduanjin program for 24 weeks
      (1 hour, thrice times per week), while the control group received routine care.

      This study was conducted in tow psychiatric center. Residents in one of psychiatric center
      were allowed to walk for 20 min after dinner every day, and each unit residents rare active.
      In this study, patients on the schizophrenia spectrum were invited to receive screening for
      constipation syndrome. A total of 275 patients agreed to undergo the screening. In total of
      112 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria, and 58 patients consented to participate in
      the experiment.

      Each participant was assigned one number from 1 to 112 by the first author. The second author
      enrolled participants. They were randomized to either Baduanjin program group or routine care
      group in a 1:1 ratio using blocked randomization having a block size of 3. Patients in the
      experimental group (EG) participated in the Baduanjin intervention in a privacy setting&quot;,
      which involved 60-min sessions 3 times per week, 1 hour after dinner between 6 and 7 pm; the
      entire program continued for 24 weeks. The control group (CG) received routine care. The
      outcome indicators for this intervention program involved the risk factors for constipation,
      constipation symptoms, and Intestinal Peristalsis.

Every session began with a 20-min warm-up, followed by 20 min of Baduanjin program, and ended with a cool-down session. The participants were instructed, with the assistance of a video, to practice Baduanjin program in a group by two authors who are experienced in the psychiatric nurses and had been trained in this program.</description>
