  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our key objective will be to investigate if geographic proximity to first- and second-degree
      relatives has an influence on post-acute stroke survival and use of health and social
      services. We will also model and map spatial variation in stroke and cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) incidence and mortality and see if some of the variation is due to spatial clustering
      of familial risk. The study will use innovative approaches to large-scale registry and survey
      data and statistical analysis on the full Norwegian population. We will integrate
      multigenerational and geographical information. This will enable us to assess key
      determinants on stroke survival and use of health and social care at municipality level.
