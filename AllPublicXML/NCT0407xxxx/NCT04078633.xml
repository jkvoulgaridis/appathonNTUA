      Understanding how different types of visual prompts and props could impact handwashing
      practices in humanitarian emergency settings could allow organisations managing camps to
      deliver hygiene interventions tailored to populations in humanitarian crises. The study aims
      to test how liquid soap, bar soap and the use of a mirror could impact handwashing
      behaviours. As such, this research could lead to participants increased handwashing, which
      should lead to decreased disease transmission of important infectious diseases. With the
      compliance of NGOs, and the working relationship that will be formed, the results of the
      research will be shared directly with them. It is likely they will immediately act on any
      findings.

      According to UNICEF, respiratory and diarrheal diseases are the first and second leading
      causes of deaths among children under-five years of age worldwide. Handwashing has the
      potential to reduce diarrhoeal disease by almost half and respiratory infections by a
      quarter. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are especially vulnerable to diarrheal and
      respiratory diseases, mainly due to overcrowding of settlements and camps and lack of access
      to WASH facilities. Hygiene programmes delivered in humanitarian crises primarily involve
      distributing hygiene kits and teaching people about disease transmission. These things are
      important but are commonly insufficient to lead to behaviour change.

      Research in non-emergency settings has shown that the presence of a convenient and desirable
      handwashing facility may be the factor most likely to determine whether or not people wash
      their hands. This is particularly relevant to handwashing promotion in IDP camps where it is
      typically the responsibility of governments or organisations to provide water, sanitation and
      hygiene (WASH) facilities. Research in non-emergency settings has also shown that using
      stories and emotional motivators can be a powerful way of changing behaviour, but to date
      such approaches have not been tried in emergency settings, where they could potentially have
      a more substantial impact on disease transmission.

      Study Aim: To develop and test innovative behaviour change approaches to improve handwashing
      behaviour among IDPs in Ethiopia.

      Study objectives:

        1. To conduct a cluster randomised pilot study to assess whether the provision of liquid
           soap makes handwashing more desirable and more likely to be practiced.

        2. To conduct a cluster randomised pilot study to assess whether installing mirrors above
           the handwashing facility makes handwashing more desirable and more likely to be
           practiced.

        3. To conduct a pilot study of the effect of motivational stories on handwashing behaviour.

        4. To conduct a pilot study of the effect of educational activities on handwashing
           behaviour.

      Methodology: The study will be conducted in IDP settlements in Oromia Region. Zones of the
      camp will be randomised to either receive one of the interventions or to act as a control. If
      the intervention is successful, the control arm will receive the intervention also.
      Households will be informed about the research and provide voluntary consent if they wish to
      participate. Handwashing behaviour will be assessed through structured observation and
      socio-demographic information will be collected through a survey. Focus groups will be
      conducted to understand people's perceptions about the interventions.

    <measure>Structured observation to measure frequency of handwashing, who is washing their hands and whether soap was used.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after implementation</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study will be observed handwashing at five key critical times (after using the toilet, before preparing food, before eating, before feeding a child and after cleaning a child's faeces). It will also be monitored whether hands are washed with soap or with water only. This will be measured via 3-hour structured observations which is considered to be the gold standard within the sector</description>

    <measure>Survey on socio-demographics and hand hygiene behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after implementation</time_frame>
    <description>After completing the structured observation, a short survey will be conducted with each household. This will cover family demographics, and information about water, sanitation and hygiene practices. The survey will be administered to the female head of the household. It is estimated that this will take 30 minutes to complete.</description>

    <measure>Focus group discussions on drivers and barriers to handwashing in the IDP settlement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour per focus group discussion 6 weeks after implementation</time_frame>
    <description>Focus group discussions will be conducted with recipients in the intervention arms. These will be designed to explore reactions to the interventions and generate reflections on what was liked or disliked about them. The focus group discussions aim to explore what is driving handwashing behaviour, or preventing it in the camps. Two focus group discussions, one with women and one with men, will be conducted in each of the intervention arms. It is estimated that about seven people will participate in each group discussion. Participants will be selected to represent a diverse mix of demographics within the camp and will be individuals that are believed yo contribute most to our learning about hygiene in the local context. The focus group discussions will involve participatory activities using visual prompts or tasks like ranking and scaling. Focus group discussions will be audio recorded.</description>

    <description>Hygiene promoters will share a story of being a good parent through teaching their children to do hand washing with soap at critical times. A story about a good mother who every day reminds her child to wash her/his hands before eating or preparing food and after going to the toilet will be shared with participants. The story ends with the child growing up healthy, happy and with a good education. This story if belived to increae handwashing with soap in the household/</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Hygiene promoters will deliver hygiene promotion through an activity that provoke the feeling of comfort by having clean hands. Hygiene promoters will deliver this intervention to up to 5 neighbor households at the time, sharing a story about a family that keeps good hygiene behaviors and therefore are clean, healthy and happy. This story is believed to encourage families to increase handwashing with soap in the household.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Hygiene Promotion Activity - Disgust</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The activity will be delivered to a group of maximum 5 neighbouring households at the time. Hygiene promoters will use 5 buckets of clean water and place them in front of households. They will then ask a member of one of the households to rinse their hands in the first bucket. Some dirt will come of their hands. Then the participant rinses their hands again in bucket number 2, then 3 and then 4. Before the 5th bucket the participant receives a bar of soap to use when they rinse their hand. When they do the water will have a dirty colour as the dirt comes of their hands. This activity is believed to encourage handwashing with soap.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Hygiene Promotion Activity - Comfort</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The activity will be delivered to a group of maximum 5 neighbouring households at the time. Hygiene promoters will bring some food oil and ask participants to cover their hands in food oil. They will then ask the participants to cover their hands in turmeric powder. The participants will then be asked to wash their hands with water only. This will have little effect on the cleanliness of their hands. Then participants will be given a bar of soap. The participants will then be asked to wash their hands again. This will leave their hands nice comfortable and clean. They will experience the comfort of clean hands and the activity hope to increase regular handwashing.</description>
