  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II basket study evaluating the ability of enterade® to reduce
      bowel frequency in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients with carcinoid syndrome and
      non-carcinoid syndrome.

      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the ability of enterade to reduce bowel movement frequency in NET patients with
      and without carcinoid syndrome.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess subject-reported health-related quality of life measures in subjects before
           and after compound administration.

        -  To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of the compound as measured by
           the number of total 8-oz enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial.

        -  To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of the
           compound.

        -  To assess differences in intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalizations for
           dehydration in patients between observation period and active enterade® period.

        -  To evaluate differences in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications in
           patients between observation period and enterade® period.

        -  To compare subjective bloating and flatulence in patients before and after
           administration of the compound.

        -  To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of the compound.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To assess changes in serum and stool inflammatory markers before and after the study
           compound.

        -  To evaluate changes in fecal lactoferrin before and after study compound administration.

    <time_frame>At 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-D is a questionnaire composed of 5 categories (physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and additional concerns). Each category has 6-11 questions which are scored on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) scale. Groups of categories are scored differently. For example in the additional concerns, emotional well-being and physical well-being categories, a higher score reflects poorer quality of life. In the family well-being and functional well-being categories, a higher score indicates better outcomes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Carcinoid syndrome:

        Participants must have histopathologically confirmed neuroendocrine tumor with 4 or more
        bowel movements per day on standard anti-diarrheal regimen (which includes somatostatin
        analogs and/or Telotristat Ethyl). Additionally, a plasma 5-HIAA, or a urine 24-hour 5-HIAA
        or plasma secretory hormone levels (VIP, gastrin) above the upper limit of normal per
        reference lab. Patients may be grouped into this cohort based on a previous plasma 5-HIAA
        level though the final cohort determination will be made based upon the 5-HIAA level drawn
        during screening.

        bowel movements per day on standard anti-diarrheal regimen (which may or may not include
        somatostatin analogs), but do not have elevated results for one of the following: plasma
        5-HIAA, or 24-hour urine 5-HIAA or other plasma secretory hormone levels (VIP, gastrin)
        above the upper limit of normal per reference lab. Patients may be grouped into this cohort
        based on a previous plasma 5-HIAA level though the final cohort determination will be made
        based upon the 5-HIAA level drawn during screening

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥60%)

          -  Ability to tolerate thin liquids by mouth at the time of enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to Stevia.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active

          -  Clostridium difficile infection or history of Clostridium difficile infection.

          -  Participants with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
             bariatric surgery and/or Celiac disease.

          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements.

          -  Patients who have had enterade® within the past 3 months.
