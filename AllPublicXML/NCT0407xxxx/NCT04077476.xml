      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness on PTSD
      symptoms of the addition of a Facebook group to an online yoga intervention for women
      following a stillbirth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year in the United States, over 26,000 women experience a stillbirth (death of a fetus
      â‰¥20 weeks of gestation). Stillbirth moms are six times more likely to develop post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) and four times more likely to have anxiety and depressive symptoms
      than moms who have live births. Stillbirth moms also experience poor sleep, lack of support,
      and disenfranchised grief. The negative effects of a stillbirth may last for years and may
      negatively impact subsequent pregnancies; many get pregnant within a year after their loss.

      There is currently no standard of care for women who have experienced a stillbirth.
      Recommended treatment after a stillbirth typically includes medication and referral to
      support groups and therapists. While medication may be helpful to some women, others may be
      averse to medication. Support groups, if not catered to bereaved moms, may trigger
      post-traumatic stress symptoms. Other barriers may inhibit participation in outside the home
      treatment after stillbirth, such as seeing babies or having to explain their stillbirths, as
      reported in one study.

      Yoga may be a complementary strategy to help mothers cope with post-traumatic stress.
      Evidence suggests yoga may improve physical and mental health (e.g., anxiety, depressive
      symptoms) in various populations who experience trauma (e.g., war veterans, abuse victims).
      Research suggests those who participate in yoga are likely to exhibit healthier behaviors
      (i.e., physical activity, healthy diet, abstain from alcohol/substance abuse). Yoga is safe
      and feasible for pregnant and post-partum women. Although yoga may be an effective strategy
      for PTSD following a stillbirth, due to the barriers these mothers experience, attending yoga
      classes at a studio may not be feasible.

      Online interventions are growing in popularity and may be a way to overcome barriers to
      participation in treatment for stillbirth moms. Investigators are currently conducting a
      feasibility study to explore the use of online yoga to improve PTSD in stillbirth moms
      (NIH#R34AT008808). Data collection will be complete in May, 2019. Supplemental to this study,
      investigators conducted interviews with stillbirth moms who have finished the intervention. A
      brief view of the data from these interviews suggest women liked the online platform but felt
      isolated and wanted more social interaction during the intervention.

      When an intervention is delivered online (e.g., through social networking: engaging in social
      interactions though online platforms), the natural social interaction that happens during
      in-person interventions is lacking. Research suggests giving and receiving support is an
      adaptive coping strategy to reduce PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.
      Stillbirth moms who perceived adequate levels of social support had significantly lower
      anxiety and depression levels than those who did not. There is a need to explore the
      feasibility of online interventions that include social networking to determine the
      relationship between online interventions and social support, and how social support acts as
      a mediator between social networking and PTSD, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and health
      behaviors.

      Interventions that include a Facebook component have been shown to effectively improve social
      support, however little is known about the optimal structure of this type of intervention.
      One research study asserts existing social media platforms (e.g., Facebook) as ideal because
      members are familiar with the platform's social norms (e.g., how to post, &quot;like,&quot; and
      comment). There is a need to explore the feasibility of a social networking component (i.e.,
      Facebook) in addition to an online yoga intervention and the effects this might have on
      social support as well as PTSD, anxiety, depressive symptoms and health behaviors.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to:

        1. Examine the feasibility (acceptability, demand) of a social networking component (i.e.,
           Facebook) to an eight-week online yoga intervention for a future U01 application.

        2. Explore the preliminary effects (i.e., not powered for effects) of a social networking
           component (i.e., Facebook) added to an eight-week online yoga intervention on social
           support.

        3. Explore the mechanism (i.e., social support) by which social networking may impact PTSD
           symptoms, anxiety, depressive symptoms and health behaviors (i.e., physical activity,
           diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption).

    <description>Participants in both groups will follow a prescription of classes the research team (including a 200-hour yoga instructor) developed, and is safe and appropriate for this study population. The yoga prescription will be based on the prescription used in the current R34 study (see reference for description), and modified based on results (i.e., participant feedback). Participants will be given instructions about how to use the online yoga class platform (Udaya) during the intake appointment.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In addition to what is described above, participants will be provided instructions on how to join the private Facebook group. The Facebook group will be an informal platform where participants can connect with other people in the online + SN group to share their experiences with yoga as it relates to their stillbirths. Current social media intervention research suggests careful consideration must be given to the intervention. The current intervention will be designed based on results of focus groups asking stillbirth moms who have completed an online yoga intervention what they would find helpful in a Facebook intervention. For instance, preferences included having a moderator, rules about what they can post (e.g., no &quot;rainbow babies&quot;), and discussion about both stillbirth and life in general.</description>

    <description>Each week, the research team will post a prompt for discussion to encourage participation. Prompts will be developed in the beginning stages of the project based on data from the current R34 study and with guidance from consultant Waibel. Participants will be encouraged to post about their experiences with the intervention and stillbirth (emotional support), share resources, (informational support), and offer feedback and advice (appraisal support). Participants will not be required to adhere to certain criteria for engagement (e.g., number of posts, etc.), other than their weekly log in. This is to account for different types of engagement when using social networking as a means of support (e.g., posting, just reading); the benefits of each type of engagement are person-specific. The page will be moderated by members of the research team, who will post prompts and ensure content is updated and appropriate. No members can be added to the group without approval from the research team.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a series of videos covering basic poses and safety techniques, tracked using the Wistia plugin software. Once complete, they will be able to access the library of pre-selected classes (range in time from 10-90 minutes). Participants will be asked to complete at least 60 minutes of yoga per week; participants may choose any classes to yield 60 minutes. Preliminary data from the current R34 study suggests 60 minutes is a feasible amount of time for yoga participation. There is no upper limit to the number of minutes participants can complete.</description>
