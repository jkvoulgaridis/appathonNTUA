  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the clinical effectiveness of sarcoma treatment has improved, long-lasting and
      cumulative treatment side-effects may often detract from the overall marginal advantage.
      Information only on survival is insufficient to determine the net clinical benefit of a
      treatment. It is important to assess treatment effectiveness both in terms of objective
      outcomes (e.g., response, recurrence and survival) and in terms of subjective patient
      reported outcomes (PROs), objective functional outcomes including health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL).

      Previous studies have predominantly used generic HRQoL instruments, which cover some relevant
      issues but do not capture all the unique experiences of patients with sarcoma, and thus lack
      content validity. A sarcoma-specific questionnaire should be able to detect, with more
      sensitivity, side-effects, symptoms and problems with function that are particularly relevant
      to patients with sarcoma. To date , there is no specific sarcoma HRQoL instrument available;
      and, given the heterogeneity of the disease in terms of subtype, location, age and treatment,
      the development of such an instrument may be challenging.

      The aim of this collaborative project between the EORTC Quality of Life Group (QLG) and the
      EORTC Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG) is to raise the standard of HRQoL
      measurement in patients with sarcoma. An important question remains to be answered: Is it
      possible to develop one PROs questionnaire covering HRQoL issues that are relevant to all
      adult patients with sarcoma, or are the HRQoL issues related to the different localization /
      treatment sufficiently different to warrant the creation of separate item lists selected from
      the EORTC QLG Item Library?

      The investigators will follow the EORTC QLG questionnaire development guidelines. First, a
      computerized search of the academic literature will be performed to identify all relevant
      HRQoL issues for and existing HRQoL questionnaires currently used among patients with
      sarcoma. In parallel, semi-structured interviews will be conducted worldwide with patients
      with sarcoma(N=154) and health care professionals (HCPs; N=30; phase 1a). The patient sample
      will be stratified to capture diversity across the sarcoma population tumour location
      (extremities, axial, head and neck, thorax, retroperitoneal/intra-abdominal and
      gynecological), stage (localized vs. metastatic disease ) and type or lines of treatment .

      This list of HRQoL issues generated by the a) literature search, b) relevant items from the
      Item Library, and c) semi-structured patient and HCP interviews, and will be consolidated
      into a comprehensive list of issues for all languages of collaborating countries.

      In phase 1b, the new list of HRQoL issues will be presented to another group of patients with
      sarcoma(N=475) and HCPs (N=30). Patients and HCPs will be asked to rate the HRQoL issues on
      relevance (4point Likert scale) and to prioritize the 25 most important issues.

    <description>the framework will outline which strategy to adopt for HRQoL in patients with sarcoma: the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 + one sarcoma module; EORTC QLQ-C30 + one sarcoma module + an item list; EORTC QLQ-C30 + item list.
This will be based on analysis of the interview data (patients and HCPs) and the relevance of certain HRQoL rated by patients and health care professionals and possible identification of certain subgroups (according to tumour localization, type of sarcoma, disease stage and treatment).</description>
