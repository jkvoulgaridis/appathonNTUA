  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether standardized implementation of a scripted
      template for discussing important issues that arise near the end of life improves the care of
      those who have advanced cancer.

      Primary Objective: To determine whether the Serious Illness Conversation Guide will improve
      the consistency with which providers have and document conversations regarding patients'
      goals and priorities as they near the end of life.

      Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess whether having conversations as per this model will
      improve the quality of care near the end of life as determined by appropriate care in
      concordance with their goals of care.

      2. To assess whether having conversations as per this model will improve patient Quality of
      Life (QOL) as per a validated scale.

      3. To assess in patients with concordant care whether this model will improve patient QOL as
      per a validated scale 4. To assess provider opinions about end-of-life conversations.
