  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cirrhosis are frequently hospitalized and often undergo procedures. Knowledge
      surrounding bleeding risk is sparse and practice patterns vary across centers in regards to
      bleeding prophylaxis. The goal of this study to is to obtain more knowledge regarding risk
      factors for procedural related bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and to develop a
      predictive model to risk stratify patients before undergoing procedures. Through
      collaboration from centers across the world this study should provide information on
      prevalence of bleeding and variation in practice patterns for prophylaxis.

      Hospitalized patients with cirrhosis who undergo 1 or more non-surgical procedure will be
      enrolled. The investigators will collect multiple clinical characteristics from the medical
      record and follow the patients prospectively over the hospitalization and/or until 28 days to
      determine if clinical events have occurred including bleeding, thrombosis, re-hospitalization
      and death. Characteristics of the hospitalization will be recorded including presence of
      acute decompensation and acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Procedure type will be
      recorded including coagulation laboratory data before and after each procedure. All bleeding
      events will be recorded and characteristics surrounding each bleed will be recorded. Bleeding
      will be defined according to International Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions of
      major bleed and clinically relevant non-major bleed. REDCap (https://www.project-redcap.org)
      will be used to collect and centralize data maintained at the University of Virginia.
      Characteristics of each hospitalization will be recorded accordingly and patients will be
      followed for 28 days for outcome and mortality information. Each participating center will
      obtain local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to participate and enter data directly
      into REDCap. After center IRB approval is obtained, centers will consecutively enroll
      patients on a rolling basis for 4 weeks. Data will be collected from enrollment until death,
      transplant, discharge and/or 28 days on each individual enrolled.

        Adult patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital are evaluated and then consented to
        participate in the study (see Inclusion/Exclusion). Patients with cirrhosis admitted to the
        general ward or intensive care unit may be enrolled.

        The investigators will collect multiple clinical characteristics from the medical record
        and follow the patients over the hospitalization and/or until 28 days to determine if
        clinical events have occurred including bleeding, thrombosis, re-hospitalization and death.
