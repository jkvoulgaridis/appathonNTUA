  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized multicenter phase 1b clinical trial of the safety and
      pharmacokinetics, as well as the preliminary efficacy of monotherapy with alofanib, an
      allosteric fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 inhibitor, in patients with advanced gastric
      cancer who have exhausted the resource of standard therapy.
