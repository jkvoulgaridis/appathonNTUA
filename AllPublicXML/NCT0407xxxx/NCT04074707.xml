  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is common during pregnancy and has adverse effects on the
      mother, fetus and newborn. Oral iron supplements are usually recommended to prevent ID/IDA
      during pregnancy.

      The aim of this study is to define an iron supplementation schedule with maximal absorption
      using serum hepcidin profiles and stable iron isotopes in pregnant women. In this randomized,
      open-label trial, fractional and total iron absorption will be compared from daily dosing
      with 60 mg iron versus alternate day and every third day dosing with 120 mg iron in pregnant
      Thai women with low iron stores (n=28) during their second trimester of pregnancy.

      This study could have wide impact, providing the evidence base for revised, improved
      recommendations for iron supplementation during pregnancy.
