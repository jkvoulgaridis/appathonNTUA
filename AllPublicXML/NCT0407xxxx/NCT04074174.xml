  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study looks at how the study medicine affects the level in the blood of a birth control
      pill. The study also looks at how the study medicine affects the duration of emptying of the
      stomach. Participants will get 1 injection of study medicine once a week for 12 weeks by a
      study nurse at the clinic. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold
      in the stomach. In addition, participants will get 1 birth control pill per day for 8 days
      before the first dose of the study medicine and again after 10 weeks of dosing with the study
      medicine. Participants will also get a dose of acetaminophen before the first dose of the
      study medicine and again after 10 weeks of dosing with the study medicine. Acetaminophen is a
      mild painkiller but used here to assess the emptying of the stomach. The study will last for
      about 9 months, but participants will only be in the study for about 6 months. Participants
      will have 17 clinic visits with the study staff and some will be overnight visits. There will
      also be 3 phone calls with the study staff. At all visits, participants will have blood drawn
      along with other clinical assessments. Participants will be asked about their health,
      diseases and habits including mental health questionnaires. Participants must not be able to
      become pregnant if they want to participate in the study.

             signing informed consent.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 39.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive). Overweight should
             be due to excess adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial products (including acetaminophen) or
             related products.

          -  Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as signed informed
             consent.

          -  Previous participation in trial(s) with NNC0174-0833 unless documented that the
             subject was assigned to placebo treatment. Participation is defined as randomised.

          -  Any disorder which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety or
             compliance with the protocol.
