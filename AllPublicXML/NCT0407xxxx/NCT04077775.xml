      The relationship between the pelvis and stomatognathic system:

      Various rationales for the relationship between the spine or pelvis and TMJ have been found.
      These theories include fascial, myological interrelationships, referred pain patterns and
      facilitating tonic neck reflexes involving inter segmental spinal pathways. A contributing
      mechanism could be the relationship between how TMJ occlusion, head position and body posture
      relate to the body's natural neurological visual/vestibular righting mechanism (Blum, 2004).

      There is a Correlation between the facial axis together with the lordotic angle and the
      pelvic inclination, the inner gonial angle and the mandibular plane with the lordotic angle
      and the pelvic inclination, as well as the facial depth with the pelvic inclination showed a
      significant correlation (Carsten et al., 2007).

    <description>The blocks are released and the rods are placed over the crest of the ilium. The blocks are then pressed firmly toward the midline. Read the angle from the level. If the gauge reads over 21/2Â°, the result is listed as positive.Anterior pelvic tilting angle: PALM was used for measuring pelvic tilting angle. A mark was put on a point just inferior to ASIS; another mark was put just inferior to PSIS. The callipers of the PALM were put on these two points</description>

From sitting position, with the use of the calliper, the distance between the incisal edges along the midline of the upper and lower central incisors without pain was measured, by placing one end of the poley gauge against the incisal edge of one of the upper central incisors, and the other end against the incisal edge of the opposing lower incisor.
The distance recorded in millimeters, the subjects was instructed to&quot; open your mouth as wide as possible without causing pain or discomfort&quot;. The poley gauge was sterilized with antiseptic solution before and after each measure</description>

I) Pelvic tilt angle:
The physiotherapist stood beside the women and found the position of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) accurately while the woman was in standing position. Hence the therapist placed one end arm of PALM inclinometer on ASIS, and the other end arm was placed on PSIS. The pelvic sagittal inclination angle was the angle between the horizontal line and a line passing through the ASIS and PSIS that determined by the bubble level in the PALM inclinometer</description>
