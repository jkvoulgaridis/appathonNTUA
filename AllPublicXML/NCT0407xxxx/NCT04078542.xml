  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is among the most common causes of medical consultation in primary care.[1] Chronic
      cough, arbitrarily defined as symptom persisting more than 8 weeks, has been variably
      reported in different settings and geographical area, with an overall prevalence of 10-20% in
      the general population, that increases up to 40-50% in pneumology specialist clinics.[2,3]
      While acute cough is generally caused by the common cold and typically lasts one to three
      weeks, chronic persisting cough can underlie more serious disease processes. Moreover, it can
      impair quality of life,[4] possibly leading to tiredness, urinary incontinence, and
      eventually syncope. It also has psychosocial effects such as embarrassment and negative
      impact on social interactions.

      A careful clinical history may provide important diagnostic clues that allow therapeutic
      trials without the need of further investigations.[5] Smoking history, medication list and
      presence and character of sputum should be carefully detailed. Identification of the causes
      of productive cough is generally straightforward and strategies for intervention and
      treatment are well defined.[5] Conversely, chronic dry or poorly productive cough represents
      a greater diagnostic challenge. Several studies have shown that in nonsmokers with normal
      chest radiography who are not taking ACE-inhibitor, chronic cough is usually due to asthma,
      rhinosinusitis or gastro-esophageal reflux (GER).[6] Many dedicated algorithms have been
      identified to guide the diagnostic phase and to sequentially coordinate the execution of
      further diagnostic deepening and/or empirical treatments, based on cost-effectiveness
      principles.[5,7-9] Among these, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommendations[5] are
      widely applied in clinical practice and broadly parallel those released by the American
      College of Chest Physicians[7]. This notwithstanding, a proportion of cases do not reach a
      definite diagnosis and resolutive treatment[7]. This condition is termed chronic refractory
      cough (CRC), chronic idiopathic cough, or unexplained chronic cough.[7,10] It can be
      diagnosed when patients have no identified causes of chronic cough (unexplained or idiopathic
      chronic cough) or when the cough persists after investigation and treatment of cough-related
      conditions. Because patients with unexplained chronic cough often receive specific therapies,
      such as inhaled corticosteroids or proton pump inhibitors, they can also be classified as
      having CRC.

      The real prevalence of CRC is not well-know and many cases of CRC may be actually
      misdiagnoses due an incomplete application of recommended work-up. In the present study we
      aim to estimate the prevalence of chronic cough in different care settings, together with the
      prevalence of CRC according to a systematic and integrated approach. The careful application
      of the recommendation defined by ERS guidelines will allow to detect truly refractory cases
      of chronic cough.

        All patients will be screened for the presence of cough and those complaining chronic cough
        (i.e. lasting more than 8 weeks) will be included. Only subjects aged less than 18 years
        will be excluded and no other specific exclusion criteria will be adopted, in order to
        gather data on a real life population.
