  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation-induced esophagitis is an acute, dose-limiting toxicity in oncologic treatment.
      Since it can lead to interruption of treatment, hospitalization, and even death, clinicians
      should be aware of this condition as an adverse effect of oncologic therapies, in order to
      prevent interruption of treatment, as it has been associated with reduced survival. ZIVEREL®
      is a new, over-the-counter medical device that comes as an oral solution in a 10-ml stick
      pack. It is composed of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and poloxamer 407 and Women
      plays a role in the symptomatic relief of esophagitis induced by radiotherapy alone or
      radiochemotherapy in oncologic patients. ZIVEREL® acts naturally and exerts a protective
      action by reinforcing the effect of the elements that make up the extracellular matrix, where
      the connective tissue provides the architecture, proteoglycans maintain the fluid-electrolyte
      balance, and glycoproteins maintain the intracellular substrate responsible for cell-cell
      reactions and cell-matrix reactions. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether
      administration of ZIVEREL® diminishes the grade of acute radiation-induced esophagitis and
      the incidence of severe esophagitis in oncologic patients treated with radiotherapy or
      radiochemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan formed by glucuronic acid and N acetylglucosamine
      disaccharide units. It is found mainly in the extracellular matrix of the loose connective
      tissue and is associated with several key processes, including cell signaling and repair, as
      well as with tissue generation, morphogenesis, and structural organization of the
      extracellular matrix itself. In clinical terms, its role is well known in conditions such as
      mouth ulcers, where its barrier effect relieves symptoms. Chondroitin sulfate forms part of
      the glycosaminoglycan group in the extracellular matrix, which is in turn formed by
      D-glucuronic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine. It has been shown to protect the epithelium of
      the esophageal mucosa by shielding the epithelial areas damaged by acid, thus diminishing
      catabolic activity and inhibiting proteolytic enzymes (e.g., metalloproteases, collagenase,
      or elastase). Chondroitin sulfate also regulates several inflammatory mediators (TNF-α,
      IL-1β, COX-2, PGE2, and NFκB) and reduces the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is involved in
      the inflammatory cascade. Polaxamer 407 is a bioadhesive component that acquires the active
      ingredients of ZIVEREL® adhere to the damaged mucosa and are not dragged away by the
      ingestion of food and liquids.
