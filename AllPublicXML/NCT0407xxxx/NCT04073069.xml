  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is common for the first 2 days after major craniotomy. A majority of patients would
      suffer from moderate-to-severe postoperative pain after undergoing craniotomy. Inadequate
      analgesia induced sympathetically mediated hypertension may lead to an increased risk for
      post-operative complications, such as arterial hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage,
      prolonged hospital stay, and mortality. Adequate pain control is essential for patients'
      prognosis and their postoperative life quality. Pain after craniotomy derives from the scalp
      and pericranial muscles. Local anesthetics administered around the incision have been
      performed clinically. However, some studies revealed that the analgesic effect of local
      anesthetics was not unsatisfactory due to its short pain relief duration. Pain is common for
      the first 2 days after major elective intracranial surgery, and the relatively short
      analgesic time of scalp infiltration does not seem to meet the requirements of craniotomy.
      Steroid such as diprospan as an adjuvant to local anesthetics intra-articular injected
      locally ameliorated pain intensity in knee osteoarthritis or in total knee arthroplasty.
      However, there has not been reported about local application of diprospan on scalp
      infiltration. Thus, the investigators suppose that pre-emptive scalp infiltration with
      steroid (diprospan) plus local anesthetic (ropivacaine) could relieve postoperative pain
      after craniotomy in adults.

WHOQOL-BREF is a self-report questionnaire that contains 26 items and addresses 4 QOL domains: physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relationships (3 items) and environment (8 items). Two other items measure overall QOL and general health. Each domain's mean score can range between 4 and 20 and a higher score indicates a higher quality of life. The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. A transformation method converts domain scores to a 0-100 scale.</description>
