  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the changes of blood flow
      index and skin temperature after the peripheral nerve blocks measured by laser speckle
      contrast imaging and infrared thermography, respectively.

      Methods: Patients scheduled for elective surgery with peripheral nerve blocks will receive
      laser speckle contrast imaging and infrared thermography measures 5 min before the block and
      continous to 20 min after the block. The sensitivity, specificity of laser speckle contrast
      imaging and infrared thermography as diagnostic methods will be determined by receiver
      operator characteristic analysis.

Level 1: slight muscle contractions are visible. Level 2: the limbs can move in parallel on the bed. Level 3: the limbs can overcome gravity and lift off the bed. Level 4: movement of the limbs against resistance. Level 5: normal muscle strength, free movement）</description>
