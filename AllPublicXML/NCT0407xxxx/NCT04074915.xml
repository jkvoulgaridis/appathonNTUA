  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel clinical trial involved seventy
      five patients, suffering with chronic periodontitis, which were randomly divided in three
      groups: negative control (SRP+placebo), positive control (SRP+0.12% CHX), and test group
      (SRP+1% MTC mouth rinse). Mouth rinsing (adjunctive therapy) was continued for 1 month while
      clinical parameters [plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI),
      probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), stain
      index (SI)] were evaluated at base line, 1 month, and 3 months. CFU was also evaluating at
      above said time periods.

      This double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel clinical trial involved seventy
      five patients, suffering with chronic periodontitis, which were randomly divided in three
      groups: negative control (SRP+placebo), positive control (SRP+0.12% CHX), and test group
      (SRP+1% MTC mouth rinse). Mouth rinsing (adjunctive therapy) was continued for 1 month.The
      primary outcome of this study was CAL, while PPD was the secondary outcome measure. A single
      clinician (AA) who was blinded to the groups assigned to the individuals, recorded all the
      parameters i.e. PI, GI, SBI, PPD, CAL, GR, SI at base line (prior to the treatment), 1 and 3
      months after therapy. PPD, CAL and GR were recorded at the six sites per tooth in every
      tooth, except third molar, with a manual UNC-15 periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, Leinmen,
      Germany) to the nearest millimeter. For recording of parameters at different time periods
      patients were instructed to refrain from any oral hygiene procedure for 8 hours prior to the
      evaluation. Staining of the six maxillary anterior teeth was assessed using the Lobene index.
      CFUs of P. ginigvalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola were evaluated at baseline , 1 months,
      3 months.
