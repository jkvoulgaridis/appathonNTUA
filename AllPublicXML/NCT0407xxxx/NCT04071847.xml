    <textblock>
      The purpose of this international study is to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of
      Abbott deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems for all indications, including Parkinson's
      disease, essential tremor and dystonia.

      ADROIT (Abbott DBS Registry of Outcomes for Indications over Time) is an international,
      prospective, multicenter, observational, post-market study intended to collect worldwide
      long-term safety and effectiveness data on patients implanted with market-released Abbott DBS
      systems.

      Patients with new DBS systems or replacement devices will be followed for up to 5 years after
      initiating stimulation. Improvement in symptoms from baseline will be assessed over time.
      Individuals who are scheduled to receive a new Abbott DBS system or a battery replacement may
      be considered for inclusion in the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to each follow-up visit in disease-specific motor rating scale. For subjects with Parkinson's disease, MDS-UPDRS Part III.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III evaluates motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and consists of 18 items. The total score ranges from 0 to 132, and is the sum of 33 scores each rated on a scale from 0 (no symptom present) to 4 (severe symptom). A higher score indicates more severe symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to each follow-up visit in disease-specific motor rating scale. For subjects with disabling tremor, FTM-TRS.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS) assesses tremor severity and includes ratings for tremor at rest, during posture and intentional movements for 9 body parts, action tremor of the upper limbs while writing or pouring liquids, and functional disability. The total score ranges from 0 to 144 with a higher score indicating higher disease severity/disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to each follow-up visit in disease-specific motor rating scale. For subjects with dystonia (except for cervical dystonia), BFMDRS movement scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) movement subscale rates the severity of dystonia in 9 body regions. Provoking and severity factors are rated from 0 (no dystonia) to 4 (severe dystonia) for each body region and then adjusted scores are summed for an overall score ranging from 0 to 120. A higher score indicates more severe dystonia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to each follow-up visit in disease-specific motor rating scale. For subjects with cervical dystonia, TWSTRS severity scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) severity subscale rates the severity of cervical dystonia and includes scores for maximal excursion, duration of neck deviation, effect of sensory tricks, shoulder elevation/ anterior displacement, range of motion, and time maintained in neutral position. The total score ranges from 0 to 35, with a higher score indicating more severe dystonia.</description>

        This clinical investigation will enroll subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease,
        essential tremor or other disabling tremor, or dystonia who are scheduled for a new implant
        or IPG device replacement surgery with a market-released Abbott DBS system. Males and
        females of any age who receive DBS may participate in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is scheduled for a new implant or implantable pulse generator (IPG) device
             replacement surgery with a market-released Abbott DBS system within 3 months.

          2. Subject, or a legally acceptable representative, must provide written informed consent
             prior to any clinical investigation-related procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is currently enrolled or plans to enroll in another concurrent study that may
             confound the results of this clinical investigation, as determined by Abbott.

          2. Subject has anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other medical, social, or
             psychological conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the
             subject's ability to participate in the clinical investigation or to comply with
             follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the clinical
             investigation results.
