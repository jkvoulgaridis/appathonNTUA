    <textblock>
      Growing evidences have pointed to the role of 5-lipooxygenase / leukotriene pathway in the
      pathogenesis of diabesity. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LT) are potent inflammatory lipid
      mediators derived from the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. They act on
      Cys-LT receptors that are primarily present in the spleen, blood leukocytes, and lung
      macrophages and are involved in mediation of inflammation. 5-lipoxygenase products exert
      potent proinflammatory actions, such as induction of nuclear factor (NF) - kB and secretion
      of proinflammatory and insulin resistant adipokines (i.e., monocyte chemotactic protein-1,
      tumor necrosis factor-a, macrophage inflammatory protein-1, and interleukin-6) that could
      potentially contribute to systemic insulin resistance. Furthermore, the physiological
      consequences of these changes in adipose tissue function were corroborated in vivo by the
      observation that inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway reduced proinflammatory cytokines
      and circulating free fatty acid concentrations, as well as alleviated insulin resistance and
      hepatic steatosis in experimental obesity.

      Montelukast is a Cys-LT1-receptor antagonist that blocks the proinflammatory action of LTD4 .
      Montelukast is approved for the maintenance treatment of asthma and to relieve symptoms of
      seasonal allergies. It acts by inhibiting neutrophil infiltration, balancing
      oxidant-antioxidant status, and regulating the generation of inflammatory mediators.
