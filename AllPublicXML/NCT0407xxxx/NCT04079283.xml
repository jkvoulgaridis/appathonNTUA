  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of CT radiomic analysis which
      serves as a high through-put analytical strategy applied to image big-data resource in
      evaluating and predicting the response of immunotherapeutics. A multi-center retrospective
      diagnostic test has been designed for this aim to compare the predictive performance of
      clinical model, qualitative model incorporating semantic CT features and image-based
      quantitative radiomic model. The reference standard of therapeutic effect is determined by
      the latest evaluation result utilizing iRECIST within 365 days after recruited. This study
      intends to enroll 400 participates who had been diagnosed with advanced somatic solid tumor
      confirmed by histo- or cyto-pathological examination and were planning to receive
      immunotherapy.
