      To examine the effects of evidence-based care bundles combined with the internet platform in
      patients with extremity injuries. A longitudinal and two group experimental design will be
      used. Outcome measures for the trauma care bundles will use the Barthel's Index, the
      Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life
      questionnaire. The results may influence health policy and clinical practice, and a wide
      range of injured patient outcomes.

      Background: Over 50% of injuries are accompanied by musculoskeletal injuries that are
      life-threatening, require amputation or lead to major extremity dysfunctions. Some barriers
      exist to deliver evidence-based care in the trauma group. Based on recent research findings,
      this project will be an evidence-based project and evaluation of care bundles combined with e
      health care to establish and refine evidence-based care guidelines for patients with
      extremity injuries in Taiwan.

      Aims: To examine the effects of evidence-based care bundles combined with the internet
      platform in patients with extremity injuries.

      Methods: A longitudinal and two group experimental design will be used. The trauma care
      bundles combined with internet platform will be implemented over 24-hour admission and ended
      in 10-14 days after hospital discharge. Participants will be patients with extremity injuries
      that meet the criteria. The experimental group and the control group will be given the same
      routine care except for the trauma care bundles. Both groups will be followed up at 3 and 6
      months after hospital discharge. Fifty-eight participants for each group will be expected.
      The generalized estimating equations will be used to analyze the data. Outcome measures for
      the trauma care bundles will use the Barthel's Index, the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale, and
      the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire.

      Expected outcomes: This is an innovation project as it combines a comprehensive trauma care
      bundles with internet platform, and applied in the biggest injury population in Taiwan. It
      may be the pioneer study to integrate care bundle and e-health care in trauma care. The
      results may influence health policy and clinical practice, and a wide range of injured
      patient outcomes. The internet platform established by the research team may be an important
      template for domestic e-health in hospital-based settings and long-term care facilities.

    <description>The BI will be used to measure functional disabilities patients with extremity injury. The BI, organically developed by Mahoney and Barthel (1965), assesses BADL in terms of respondent abilities related to feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowel and bladder control, toilet use, transfer, mobility, and stair use. The BI has 30 items with scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher independence in performing BADLs. A total BI score of 0 to 20 correlates with total dependence, 21 to 60 correlates with severe dependence, 61 to 90 correlates with moderate dependence, 91 to 99 correlates with slight dependence, and 100 correlates with total independence. The Chinese version was applied in older populations, with Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.79 to .085 (Shyu, Tang, Tsai, Liang, &amp; Chen, 2006). The Cronbach's alpha for this current project will be retested using the injury group.</description>

    <measure>the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The PTDS is a self-report instrument for post traumatic syndrome that is simple to administer and has demonstrated good psychometric properties. The PTSD will not use to diagnose if injured patients have psychological illnesses. It will be applied in measuring how and what post traumatic symptoms that patients will have after injuries. The scale is a structured interview for assessing PTSD diagnostic status and symptom. The degree of severity is rated on a five-point scale scoring with zero: not at all, one: once per week or less / a little, two: 2 to 3 times per week / somewhat, three: 4 to 5 times per week / a lot, and four: 6 or more times a week / severe (Pynoos et al., 1993). This instrument was not only broadly used in patients with mental illnesses, but also used in patients with vehicle accidents domestically (Wang, 2013). The Cronbach's alpha for the current study will be retested using the injury group.</description>

    <description>The World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) will be used to measure HRQOL. Six popular generic instruments of HRQOL are commonly used as disability outcome measures, some of them were developed later were tested trans-culturally in extensive research programs such as the WHOQOL-BREF (Yao, 2000). The WHOQOL-BREF is a 28-tem scale that is measure along with 4 domains including physical, psychological, social relationship and environment. Scores range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life (The WHOQOL Taiwan Group, 2000). The reliability and validity of the Chinese WHOQOL-BREF have been tested in various clinical settings.</description>
