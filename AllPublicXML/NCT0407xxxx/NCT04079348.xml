  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of Oasis extracellular
      matrix (ECM) when used as a treatment for donor site wounds in the United Kingdom. Oasis ECM
      is commercially available for the treatment of partial and full-thickness skin wounds,
      including chronic wounds, wounds from trauma, and wounds that occur during surgery, such as
      donor site wounds. The ability of the Oasis ECM to promote the healing of donor site wounds
      will be evaluated in this study.

      About 40 patients (20 in each arm) over 16 years old will be involved in this study at one
      center in the United Kingdom.

    <masking_description>Randomization to treatment groups will be performed using a computer system to randomly assign subjects to treatment arms. Sealed envelopes numbered 1-40 will be provided to the study site. Patients will be assigned an envelope number upon providing informed consent. The envelope will be opened during the treatment procedure to minimize the risk of bias in patient assignment to the treatment group.</masking_description>
