      Study to provide evidence of efficacy for Rapid Resolution Therapy in symptoms of PTSD,
      Anxiety, and Depression in survivors of sexual violence.

      The investigators will recruit 24 participants to complete pre-test measures, participate in
      a 3 hour therapy session of Rapid Resolution Therapy (RRT), and then re-test one week post
      treatment and 6 months follow up.

      If participants do not report a &quot;good result&quot; following the 3 hour session, the investigators
      will offer a 1.5 hour follow up session Participants will receive free therapy for their
      participation, but will not be paid.

      Participants will be men and women over the age of 18 who do not have a diagnosis of
      psychosis and are not actively suicidal and have experienced a single rape at least 3 months
      before enrolling in the study.

      Sessions will be audio recorded and transcribed for construct validity (of RRT). Identifying
      in formation will be removed by the study coordinator before transcripts are coded for
      validity.

      This study proposes to use the same methods as Rothbaum et al (2005) published in Journal of
      Traumatic Stress that compares Prolonged Exposure to Eye Movement and Desensitization and
      Reprocessing (EMDR) for PTSD Rape Victims. The investigators will compare our results to
      theirs. Both of their treatments were 8 sessions, and this study's treatment is one. They
      also include data for a control group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5: Weathers et al, 2015)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention (one month version), one week post intervention (past week version) , 6 months post intervention (one month version)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD and assess PTSD symptoms over the past week In addition to assessing the 20 Diagnostic and Statistics Manual- 5th Edition (DSM-5) PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization).
The scale measures 1) severity of PTSD symptoms 2) severity of PTSD clusters and 3) PTSD Diagnostic status.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PTSD Symptom Scale Self-Report- Civilian Version (PSS-SR: Foa et al, 1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>screening, one week post-treatment, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>A 17 item self-report measure that corresponds to the 17 DSM-IV PTSD symptoms. Items are rated 0 (not present) to 3 (very much).
Responses create three subscales, including re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal, as well as a total score that ranges from 0 to 51. Score above 13 indicate a presence of PTSD.
we expect to see scores decrease post-treatment and to stay lower than baseline at 6 month follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): beck et al, 1988)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, one week post intervention, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI is a 21 item self-report questionnaire widely used in research on depression to evaluate cognitive and vegetative symptoms of depression.
The inventory includes 21 items rated from 0 to 3, with 0 being absence of symptoms and 3 being extreme symptoms. A score between 1 and 16 indicates a low level of mood disturbance, 17-30 indicates Moderate depression, and 31 and up indicates severe or extreme depression. We are looking for a decrease in scores with treatment, and lower than baseline score at 6 month follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI: Spielberger et al, 1970)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, one week follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>STAI is a 40-item self-report measure with two scales designed to assess state anxiety and trait anxiety.
Items are score on a 4-point Likert scale, with 4 being most severe. 20 items measure state anxiety and 20 measure state anxiety. Scores on each scale range from 20-80, with lower scores indicating more mild anxiety and higher scores indicating clinical anxiety. We are looking for scores to go down with treatment and remain lower than baseline at 6 month follow up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Session Rating Scale (Miller et al 2002)</measure>
    <time_frame>one week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A 4-item continual scale measure that asks the client to report on his or her experience of the session: relationship, goals and topics, approach or method and overall from negative to positive. The rater uses a ruler to divide the scale into 10 intervals and gives the score that matches the position on a line between positive and negative</description>

    <measure>Outcome Rating Scale (ORS: Miller and Duncan, 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>One week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A 4-item continual scale measure that asks the client to report on his or her subjective experience of how s/he is feeling individually, interpersonally, socially, and overall. The rater uses a ruler to divide the scale into 10 intervals and gives the score that matches the position on a line between positive and negative</description>

    <description>RRT is a talk therapy that uses Neurolinguistic Programming Language and trance states to cause a shift in how the mind is processing incoming data.
The understanding is that the part of the mind that is causing the disturbing emotion, thought or sensation is causing them to cause the person to take an action to ensure the organisms survival. RRT therapists employ psycho-therapeutic techniques taht are designed to cause the mind to process information differently so that the disturbing content and distorted meaning shift.</description>
