  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simplified methods to estimate lean body mass (LBM), an important nutritional measure
      representing muscle mass and somatic protein, are lacking in non-dialyzed patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      Objective: We developed and tested a reliable equations for estimation of LBM in daily
      clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two cross-sectional data sets were derived from outpatients with CKD stage 3-5 in Peking
      University First Hospital.Two equations for estimating LBM based on midarm muscle
      circumference (MAMC) or hand grip strength (HGS)were developed and validated in CKD patients
      with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as referenced gold method. Demographic data,
      comorbidity, and other clinical variables were also recorded.
