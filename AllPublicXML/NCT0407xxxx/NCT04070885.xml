    <textblock>
      This study aims to conduct a prospective collection of clinical and para-clinical data in
      patients with Chronic Renal Diseases to identify disease progression factors, markers of
      renal function, and the pathophysiology of Chronic Renal Diseases complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Renal Diseases have a growing incidence and prevalence in France, with significant
      consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality, especially cardiovascular, and Public
      Health.

      It is necessary to know better:

        -  the mechanisms leading to the progression of the Chronic Renal Diseases

        -  markers to quantify renal function and progression of the Chronic Renal Diseases

        -  the pathophysiology of Chronic Renal Diseases complications, cardiovascular,
           nutritional, or mineral metabolism in particular.

      This study aims to conduct a prospective collection of clinical and para-clinical data in
      patients with Chronic Renal Diseases to identify disease progression factors, markers of
      renal function, and the pathophysiology of Chronic Renal Diseases complications.
