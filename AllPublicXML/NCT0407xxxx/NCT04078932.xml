  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The killing of young black men by police officers is a major public health issue and is a
      clear health disparity. Black men are 21 times more likely to be fatally shot by a police
      officer than white men. Homicide is the second-leading cause of death of black males, ages
      15-34. It is disconcerting to consider that this statistic includes homicide by police
      officer. Pediatricians have an opportunity to contribute to violence prevention efforts and
      social justice advocacy for young black men in regards to interactions with police officers.

      We seek to engage residents in social justice advocacy by preparing them to discuss safely
      navigating police encounters with young black males. Adverse police encounters can result in
      poor mental health outcomes, physical trauma, and death. We will develop a conversation
      script with input from existing expert resources, black male youth, and their caregivers. The
      script will be patient-centered and will be used to facilitate a conversation about safely
      navigating encounters with police officers. Utilizing a train-the-trainer model, attending
      pediatric physicians will be trained to use the script in their practice as well as model and
      demonstrate how to use the script for pediatric residents. We hypothesize that pediatric
      residents trained in the conversation script will be empowered to facilitate discussions on
      safely navigating police encounters in the primary care clinic setting and will exhibit
      increased comfort and greater levels of self-efficacy from baseline measures.

    <description>Likert-type, self-reported Self-efficacy instrument. The items on the survey instrument will assess for feelings of self-efficacy pre-intervention (baseline) and 6 months post-intervention. Respondents will select their level of agreement with each item on the survey, selecting within a range from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. &quot;Strongly agree&quot; indicates the highest level of agreement with each statement on the survey. Respondents who predominately select &quot;strongly agree&quot; for the items on the survey express greater levels of self-efficacy with delivering the intervention.</description>

    <description>Likert-type, self-reported instrument assessing comfort with delivering the intervention. The items on the survey instrument will assess for comfort pre-intervention (baseline) and 6 months post-intervention. Respondents will select their level of agreement with each item on the survey, selecting within a range from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. &quot;Strongly agree&quot; indicates the highest level of agreement with each statement on the survey.

    <description>Self-response to the following question: In the past 6 months, how many times have you delivered the conversation script (the intervention) to African-American male youth ages 9-18? Respondents will answer by selecting between the following choices: 0 times, 1-5 times, 5-10 times, 10-15 times, and greater than 15 times.</description>

    <description>Cohort of residents trained in the conversation script who will utilize the script at pediatric clinic visits. Will evaluate baseline feelings of comfort and self-efficacy prior to being trained in the script (pre-intervention measures). After being trained in the conversation script (the intervention), the following will be measured (post-intervention measures): frequency of facilitating conversations on safely navigating police encounters in clinical practice, feelings of comfort and self-efficacy.</description>
