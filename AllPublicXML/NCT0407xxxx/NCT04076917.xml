      BIO-Precision is a post-market study investigating the utility of atrial fibrillation (AF)
      detection using BIOTRONIK's subcutaneous cardiac rhythm monitor, BIOMONITOR. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of BIOTRONIK's BIOMONITOR for the detection
      and confirmation of AF prior to an ablation procedure. Study population includes patients
      with paroxysmal AF being evaluated for an AF ablation. Holter monitoring for 48 hours will be
      performed after insertion of the BIOMONITOR but prior to AF ablation. This study will enroll
      up to 100 subjects, to obtain 60 usable Holter recordings, at 5 study sites within the United
      States (U.S.). Study subjects will be followed for three months after the completion of a 48
      hr Holter monitor.

        The investigator is responsible for screening all potential subjects and selecting those
        who are appropriate for study inclusion. Potential subjects will be evaluated to determine
        if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The subjects selected for participation
        should be from the investigator's general patient population according to the inclusion and
        exclusion criteria. Patients who require a legally authorized representative will not be
        allowed in the study.

             BIOTRONIK's most current subcutaneous cardiac rhythm monitor

          -  Diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and being evaluated for an AF ablation

          -  Agree to wearing a 48 hr Holter monitor

          -  Able and willing to use a CardioMessenger® and accepts Home Monitoring concept

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient meets none of the indications for a BIOMONITOR

          -  Patient is planned to have an ablation prior to BIOMONITOR insertion or 48 hr Holter
             monitoring visit

          -  Patient is currently diagnosed with long-standing persistent or permanent AF

          -  Patient is enrolled in another study that may change or alter the cardiac rhythm that
             occurs prior to the completion of the Holter

          -  Currently indicated for or implanted with a pacemaker, ICD device, or hemodynamic
             monitoring system

          -  Life expectancy less than 6 months

          -  Patients reporting pregnancy at the time of enrollment

        For patients enrolled after BIOMONITOR insertion:

        • R-wave sensing &lt;0.25 mV according to the most recent remote or in-person device
        interrogation available prior to enrollment

        After the pre-Holter observation period but prior to 48 hr Holter monitoring initiation,
        confirm the absence of the following exclusion criteria based on the remote interrogation
        collected at the end of the observation period:

          -  No AF episodes observed or transmitted during pre-Holter observation period

          -  R-wave sensing &lt;0.25 mV during pre-Holter observation period as reported by the 24 hr
             mean or mean value since last follow-up
