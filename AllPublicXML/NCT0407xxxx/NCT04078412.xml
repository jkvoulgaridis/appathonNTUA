      Background:

      NTM(Nontuberculous mycobacteria) pulmonary disease is increasing worldwidely, however the
      diagnosis and treatment of NTM pulmonary disease still has multiple obstacles. The initiation
      of treatment is not necessary for all patients with NTM pulmonary disease. In addition, the
      drugs for treatment of NTM pulmonary disease is not enough.

      objective. The aim of this prospective registry for Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary
      disease is to register the NTM pulmonary patients and analysis of the treatment outcome based
      on the species and to collect the blood and urine samples from the patients for exploring the
      biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring the NTM pulmonary disease and collect the
      nontuberculous mycobacterium.

      Methods:

        1. informed consents

        2. register in cohort and collect the clinical information and serum, plasma, urine and
           mycobacteria

        3. follow up 6 months to 1year based on the clinical situation

      Analysis:

        1. treatment outcome based on NTM-NET consensus statement

        2. exploration of biomarker for progression and monitoring of treatment response
