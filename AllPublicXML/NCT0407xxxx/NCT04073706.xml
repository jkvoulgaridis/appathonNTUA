  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological cancer. Current treatment of EC
      typically includes removal of the uterus and to determine the extent of the disease (removal
      of fallopian tubes, ovaries &amp; if required a lymph node dissection (surgical staging)). While
      lymph node dissection may be valuable to guide the need for adjuvant treatment (chemo or
      radiotherapy) after surgery, it has been a topic of controversy for the last 30 years. In
      some patients it causes morbidity, specifically lymphoedema. This recently has been replaced
      with sentinel node biopsy (SNB). It requires an injection of a dye into the cervix with
      specific equipment &amp; surgical dissection of the lymph node in which the dye first becomes
      visible. Despite this promising proposition &amp; similar to a lymph node dissection, the value
      to patients, cost effectiveness &amp; potential harms (e.g. lymphedema) of SNB compared to
      no-node dissection in EC has never been established. Aim: determine the value of SNB for
      patients, the healthcare system and exclude detriment to patients using a randomised approach
      1:1. Outcome: Disease free survival is equivalent in patients undergoing a hysterectomy for
      EC having an SNB vs those having no lymph node dissection.

      Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that disease-free survival in patients with SNB versus
      without retroperitoneal node dissection is equivalent. The secondary hypothesis is that SNB
      will not be cost effective and will cause detriment to patients (lymphoedema, morbidity, loss
      of quality of life).

      Aims: To determine the value of SNB for patients, the healthcare system and to exclude
      detriment to patients.

      Objectives:

      Primary: Compare disease-free survival at 4.5 years for participants randomised to receive
      hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with SNB compared to participants randomised to
      hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without retroperitoneal node dissection.

      Secondary:

        -  Compare patterns of recurrence and overall survival between the groups

        -  Determine the cost-effectiveness of SNB

        -  Compare perioperative outcomes (duration of surgery, length of hospital stay,
           intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion requirements) and the incidence of intra-
           and postoperative adverse events within 12 months from surgery between groups

        -  Compare quality of life at 12 months after surgery

        -  Compare lower limb lymphoedema at 12 months after surgery

        -  Compare the need for postoperative (adjuvant) treatments between groups

        -  Determine the impact of body composition and frailty on survival, quality of life,
           lymphoedema, peri-, intra- and postoperative outcomes

        -  Determine the value of follow-up strategies

    <description>An assessment will be performed on the cost-effectiveness of TH + SNB relative to TH alone, calculated as the incremental cost per unit of improvement in functional outcome, measured in terms of the primary outcome. This will assess how much more money the proposed intervention will cost the health system and society, and whether this represents a sound investment in terms of the improvement in quality of life. We will also measure the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained with the intervention and use this to undertake a cost-utility analysis. The QALY calculations will be based on health status measures for trial participants, with valuations of changes in health status and quality of life based on the EQ-5D</description>

    <measure>Impact of body composition (sarcopenia) on surgical complications, recovery and overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass measures are practical &amp; sensitive for predicting health risks &amp; outcomes. Sarcopenia is defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass &amp; strength. It's been found to be associated with procedure-related morbidity, survival in cancer patients and increased use of healthcare. The concurrent appearance of low muscle mass with high adiposity (sarcopenic obesity) is common in people with chronic diseases. The trial will determine the role sarcopenia has on participants pre-operatively (via CT images &amp; Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS - if available at site) &amp; postoperatively using the BIS in regard to survival in gynaecological malignancies, if it is a predictive factor for treatment adverse events &amp; participants tolerability of treatment &amp; compare diagnostic methods to determine medical fitness for surgery. BIS sends non-detectable electrical currents, at a range of frequencies through the body allowing precise measurement &amp; analysis of impedance to currents by extracellular fluid</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of frailty on surgical complications, recovery and overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>It has been reported consistently that frailty has a significant impact on the occurrence of adverse postoperative outcomes. Therefore, measuring frailty is important to estimate risks, determine the best treatment options, and to aid diagnosis and care planning. Frailty will be measured prior to surgery suing the validated tool - Frailty Phenotype. This may determine the impact frailty has on survival, quality of life, lymphedema, peri-, intra- and postoperative outcomes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Follow-Up Strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Current institutional &amp; clinical guidelines suggest patients need to be seen at regular follow up visits. The risk of developing a recurrence is higher within the initial period after surgery &amp; the majority of recurrences develop within those first 3 years. Participants will ideally be seen 3 monthly for the first 3 years &amp; 6 monthly until 4.5 years. The objective of follow up is that local recurrences from endometrial cancer are potentially curable. It helps to diagnose local recurrences as early as possible so that they are amenable for curative or effective palliative management. We will compare these clinical findings to a symptom checklist that will be completed by participants every 3 months from surgery until 4.5 years. This records patient reported symptoms that may indicate a recurrence. Comparing these findings should determine effective follow up strategies for this group of patients.</description>
