  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to establish the mean superior cup migration of the Pinnacle
      Acetabular Shell using model-based RSA over the first two years post-implantation. The
      primary endpoint is the mean vertical subsidence (Y translation, also known as superior cup
      migration) at 2 years as measured with RSA. This will be summarized for each surgical
      approach separately, as well as combined.

          3. Individuals with poor bone quality, such as osteoporosis, where in the surgeon's
             opinion, there could be considerable migration of the prosthesis or require additional
             acetabular cup fixation using screws, or a significant chance of fracture of the
             femoral shaft and/or the lack of adequate bone to support the implant(s)

          6. Women that are pregnant or lactating

          7. Individuals who have had a contralateral hip that was implanted less than 6 months
             prior to the time of consent into this study or individuals that expect to have a
             contralateral hip implanted in the following 6 months at the time of consent into this
             study

          8. Individuals that have amputations in either leg that would impact rehabilitation

             worker's compensation claims

         12. Individuals, in the opinion of the Investigator, who are drug or alcohol abusers or
             have psychological disorders that could affect their ability to complete patient
             reported questionnaires or be compliant with follow-up requirements

         13. Individuals diagnosed and taking prescription medications to treat a muscular disorder
             that limits mobility due to severe stiffness and pain such as fibromyalgia or
             polymyalgia
