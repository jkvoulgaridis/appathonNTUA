  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olanzapine is frequently used off-label as an adjunct antiemetic in clinical oncology
      settings. North American oncology guidelines recommend it as salvage therapy and as add-on to
      the standard triple regimen; some suggest it may also be effective as an initial triple
      therapy (olanzapine replacing the NK-1 antagonist) based on phase II and III trials.

      This prospective, multi-center, open-label study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a large
      scale randomised controlled trial to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of 5mg orally
      once daily olanzapine in triple antiemetic therapy versus the standard treatment of
      aprepitant + ondansetron + dexamethasone in treatment-naive patients receiving the first
      cycle of a highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Secondary outcomes include effectiveness,
      tolerability and quality of life assessments. Effectiveness will be measured with complete
      response and complete remission rates in each treatment arms. Tolerability and patient
      quality of life will be evaluated with a standardised side effect form and validated
      questionnaires; ESAS-R and FLIE.

      The role of olanzapine-based triple therapy in prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and
      vomiting remains founded on low-quality evidence. To the investigator's knowledge, this study
      will be the first large scale direct comparison of 5mg olanzapine versus aprepitant in triple
      therapy.
