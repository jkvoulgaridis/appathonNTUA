  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have indicated increased vasopressin due to hypertonic saline infusion
      impairs glucose regulation. The current study will examine the effect of low water intake on
      glucose regulation. No currently published study has investigated the acute effect of low
      water intake on glucose regulation using continuous glucose monitoring over the course of a
      full day. The aim of the study is to observe the effect of low water intake on glucose
      regulation in low drinkers. The study will study the glycemic responses to standardized meals
      in adults during an 11-hour period in two conditions: a) high water intake and b) low water
      intake. It is hypothesized that the area under the glucose curve will be greater in the low
      water intake trial as compared to the high water intake trial
