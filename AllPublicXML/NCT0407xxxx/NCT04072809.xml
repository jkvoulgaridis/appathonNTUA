      The purpose of this study is to help scientists understand why some people who were exposed
      to alcohol in the womb have special facial features but other people do not. This study will
      test if genetics (or DNA) explains these differences. We hope this will help improve
      treatments and interventions for people with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).

      Participants in this study (or their parents or legal guardians) will be asked to:

        -  Answer some questions about themselves. These questions ask about their demographic
           background (such as gender, race, ethnicity, income, and education), their health
           history, and their mother's health during her pregnancy with them (if that information
           is known).

        -  Speak with study staff briefly by phone or video chat to confirm enrollment in the study
           and ask any questions they have.

        -  Take photographs of their face.

        -  Provide a saliva sample for genetic research.

      Participants can complete the study at home from anywhere in the world. The questions can be
      answered online, over the phone, or on paper. Adopted families are welcome to enroll. The
      study pays for all shipping costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) typically involves poor growth for age, particular facial
      characteristics, and cognitive deficiencies. Although FAS was first described in the
      literature over 40 years ago, significant challenges remain in the development of rapid and
      efficient approaches to identify individuals who were prenatally exposed to alcohol. Further,
      no widely available effective interventions or treatments to improve the long term outcomes
      of individuals with FAS and related disorders (collectively known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders or FASD) exist, despite the high prevalence (as high as 33.5 per 1,000 in some
      communities) of FASD across the United States.

      The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) seeks to address
      critical issues related to earlier and improved recognition of FASD, identify biomarkers of
      exposure, and elucidate the genetic risk factors contributing to FASD risk and resilience by
      conducting multidisciplinary projects and maintaining cooperative resources. This project is
      part of CIFASD's ongoing efforts and will specifically address the elucidation of genetic
      factors that contribute to risk and resilience in FASD.

      Prior work with animal models of FASD have identified genetic variants that contribute to
      alterations in facial morphology after exposure to alcohol during embryonic development
      (McCarthy et al., 2013). Prenatal alcohol exposure also activates immune pathway genes in
      animal models. The identification of these genetic factors suggest that genetic variation may
      similarly contribute to differences in response to prenatal alcohol exposure in humans. The
      goal of this project is to identify genetic variants that protect against or increase the
      effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in humans.

    <description>Facial Risk Score
Each participant's facial images will be evaluated and a Facial Risk Score will be assigned to each individual. This risk score is relative to all individuals participating in the study, and therefore will be updated at the end of each year. Final scores will be completed at the end of the study. The risk score is computer-based, with high scores indicating increased dysmorphology and low scores indicating decreased dysmorphology.</description>

    <description>Whole Exome Sequencing
After Facial Risk Scores have been assigned to each individual, two subsets of the study population will be selected: those with high risk scores, and those with low risk scores. Saliva samples from these subpopulations will be subjected to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). Rare variant analysis will be performed in each gene to evaluate whether there are more rare variants in individuals from one group (e.g., high risk scores) compared to the other group (e.g., low risk scores). This will enable us to determine if the variant increases risk (more common in those with high risk scores) or increases resilience (more common in those with low risk scores).</description>
