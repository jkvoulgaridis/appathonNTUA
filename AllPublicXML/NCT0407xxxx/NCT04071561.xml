  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With our retrospective study the investigators show the limitations of the posterior
      retroperitoneal adrenalectomy by analyzing anatomical parameters.

      The investigators compared the data from one patient who underwent a conversion with 13
      patients without a conversion. Furthermore, they explored the influence of these parameters
      on the operation time and excluded the patient who had a conversion from this analysis.

      The investigators hypothesize that by determining anatomical characteristics on
      cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI), they can show the limitations of the posterior
      retroperitoneal adrenalectomy to prevent patients from being converted to lateral
      transperitoneal adrenalectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive adrenalectomy has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of
      small, benign adrenal lesions. In addition to the common laparoscopic lateral transperitoneal
      adrenalectomy, the posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy is becoming increasingly
      important.

      To date, there is no consensus regarding the preferred approach in the resection of benign
      adrenal tumors. A comprehensive adrenal tumor program should be able to offer both options,
      however, patient selection criteria for a given approach have not yet been defined. The
      choice between lateral transperitoneal adrenalectomy and posterior retroperitoneal
      adrenalectomy is relevant for patients with unilateral tumors &lt; 6-7 cm and without previous
      abdominal surgery.

      The aim of this study was to determine the limits of posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy
      using anatomical parameters to enable the preferred access to be chosen preoperatively to
      prevent conversion. In addition, the investigators describe the relationship between these
      parameters and the operation time to find a measure of the degree of technical difficulty.
