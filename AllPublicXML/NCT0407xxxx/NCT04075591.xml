    <textblock>
      This study will be a 12-month, prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-comparative,
      non-randomized clinical investigation conducted at 10 to 14 sites. A total of 383 subjects
      will be enrolled to achieve approximately 268 treated subjects, resulting in at least 241
      evaluable subjects at the point of refractive stability. After signing the informed consent,
      subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria in both eyes may be scheduled for
      surgery. The follow-up visit schedule will be the same for each operative eye.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent and HIPAA authorization.

          -  At least 40 years of age at enrollment (date informed consent signed).

          -  The refractive error (i.e. prescription) of both eyes, based on the iDesign system
             must be myopic with astigmatism up to -6.00 D spherical equivalent (SE), with
             astigmatism up to -3.00 D and minimum pre-operative myopia in their non-dominant eye
             at least as great as their targeted myopic retention.

          -  At least one eye must require a myopic (nearsightedness) treatment.

          -  Your distance vision must be 20/20 or better

          -  Require an add power of +1.25 D or more but not greater than +2.00 D at 40 cm.

          -  You have a history of contact lens wear within the last 4 weeks must demonstrate
             stable corrected vision

          -  Rigid contact lenses must be removed for at least 4 weeks and soft contact lenses for
             at least 2 weeks prior to the first refraction used to establish stability.

          -  If you meet the refractive stability criteria, contact lens wear is not permitted
             prior to surgery except as required to test monovision acceptance as described below
             in the Study Procedures, Contact Lens Trial section

          -  Willing and capable of complying with follow-up examinations for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  You are pregnant, breast-feeding, or intend to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Concurrent use of systemic (including inhaled) medications that may impair healing,
             including but not limited to: antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane速) within 6
             months of treatment, and amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone速) within 12 months of
             treatment.

          -  History of any of the following medical conditions, or any other condition that could
             affect wound healing: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency
             diseases, ocular herpes zoster or herpes simplex, endocrine disorders (including, but
             not limited to unstable thyroid disorders and diabetes), lupus, and rheumatoid
             arthritis.

          -  You have a cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator or other implanted electronic
             device.

          -  History of prior intraocular or corneal surgery (including cataract extraction),
             active ophthalmic disease or abnormality.

          -  Evidence of keratoconus, corneal dystrophy or irregularity, or abnormal topography.

          -  Known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the medications used in
             the postoperative course.

          -  Intolerance to monovision correction based on questionnaire responses to contact lens
             trial.

          -  Participation in any other clinical study.
