      The main objective of this study is to describe the care pathway of patients presenting in
      the medico-judicial unit of the Raymond Poincaré Hospital in Garches, France, following a
      complaint for sexual assault and suggest ways to improvement of the care adapted to the
      characteristics of the participants.

      AS secondary objectives, the study aims to:

        -  Analyze the population of victims of sexual assault seen in consultation at the
           medico-judicial unit of Raymond Poincaré Hospital.

        -  Analyze the decision elements of the initiation of the post-exposure treatment and
           evaluate them against the recommendations.

        -  Analyze the data collected on the patients and their follow-up in consultation of
           infectious disease of the hospital of Garches following a sexual assault.

        -  Identify obstacles encountered by participants to follow the complete follow-up path.

      For this purpose the data collection will be done initially within the forensic unit of
      Raymond Poincaré Hospital. Then, in a second step, the patients requiring the setting up of a
      post-exposure treatment, are addressed in the service of infectious diseases. The
      compilations of the data necessary for the study will then be continued until 3 months after
      the sexual assault.

      For the collection of data, they will be based on the medical records of the victims.
