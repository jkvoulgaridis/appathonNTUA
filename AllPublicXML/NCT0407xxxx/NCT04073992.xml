  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The longstanding view has been that insomnia, and other forms of sleep disturbance, emerge as
      a consequence of dementia and are the result of progressive neuronal damage. However, there
      is growing evidence that the direction of causation may go both ways, with sleep disturbance
      potentially increasing vulnerability to dementia. Longitudinal studies have found that sleep
      disturbance often precedes and increases risk for dementia by several years. The purpose of
      this study is to examine whether treatment of insomnia with cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT-I) is associated with a decrease in dementia biomarkers found in cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF). Fifteen adults age 30-50 with chronic insomnia will undergo overnight polysomnography
      and CSF sampling in the morning. This will be followed by 8 weeks of treatment with CBT-I and
      then repeat CSF sampling.
