  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: running is one of the most accessible and practiced sports in the world since
      the 21st century. Unfortunately, the incidence of injuries in the population that practices
      it is high regardless of experience, although the risk of injury increases in amateur
      runners. One of the main keys to reduce the incidence of running related injuries may be to
      improve the ability to reduce the load or impact. For this, there are different strategies
      such as a gradual increase in the load to run, and exercise within which is muscle
      strengthening and balance training or proprioception.

      Objective: to verify the effectiveness of a program of proprioceptive exercises based on the
      static and dynamic balance for the reduction of lower limb injuries in amateur runners during
      the competition season.

      Methodology: 66 amateur runners, after simple size calculation, will be randomized into two
      groups. Experimental group will carry out the proprioceptive exercise program during 8 weeks
      at the begining of the season and control group will continue with their usual training
      routine. The main variable running related injury will be collected weekly during the
      follow-up.

      Results: When all the data needed for the study has been collected, researchers gathers
      results and exports them for statistical interpretation.

    <measure>Knee Joint Position Sense (JPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Joint Position Sense Pressure at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>JPSThe JPS is defined as the awareness of the actual position of the limb to quantify proprioception.The method for measuring JPS is to place the joint at a specific target angle and then, after the limb has been moved back to the starting angle, the subject is asked to actively or passively reproduce the target angle. The outcome of the measurement is the absolute error (AE), which is the difference between the true target angle and the reproduced angle</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Y Balance Test (YBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline dynamic balance at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The YBT, derived from the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), has been reported to be a valid and reliable measure of dynamic balance; furthermore, the results of the YBT have been reported to be related to lower-extremity impairments and to be predictors of injuries.The YBT instrument has a central raised platform with three pieces of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) pipe in the three directions with a sliding plastic reach indicator that the participant pushes to determine reach distance.The YBT testing protocol assessed absolute reach and normalized distance for each direction, asymmetry between limbs, and composite score. Normalized reach distance is calculated by dividing reach distance by the limb length. Asymmetry is the absolute difference between right and left leg and is determined for each reach direction. The composite score is calculated by summing the reach distance in the three directions, dividing by three times limb length, and multiplying by 100.</description>

    <measure>The countermovement jump (CMJ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline jump height at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CMJ is primarily used to measure an athlete's explosive lower-body power, and has become one of the most frequently used tests by coaches and researchers to indirectly measure power in the lower limbs. CMJ performance is reported as either jump height(centimeters).</description>
