  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study the investigators will compare blood pressure measurements obtained
      using the non-invasive, wireless Biobeat monitoring device (both a wrist watch and a patch
      configuration) to an invasive arterial line catheter (radial or femoral) and a Swan Ganz
      Catheter in 20 patients immediately after cardiac surgery, at the cardiac intensive care
      unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Biobeat non-invasive, wireless monitoring device is based on reflective
      photoplethysmograph (PPG) technology. It measures several vital signs, including blood
      pressure, stroke volume, pulse rate, pulse pressure, heart rate variability, respiratory
      rate, saturation, cardiac output, cardiac index, and more. The data is transmitted to
      Biobeat's application (in both Apple and Google Play), and is available on the individual's
      cellular phone, tablet, or as a full monitoring system in a hospital department. The aim of
      this study is to compare the Biobeat monitor with the invasive method of blood pressure
      measurement, an arterial line, and a Swan Ganz catheter for measurements of cardiac output
      and stroke volume. The study population includes 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. As
      per local protocol, each one of the participants will come out from the operating room with
      an arterial line, some will also have a Swan Ganz catheter. Once in the intensive care unit,
      the investigators will attach the Biobeat non-invasive monitor (both a wristwatch and a
      patch), these two configurations are identical in terms of the monitoring system), and
      monitor the participants for 4 hours. Though both methods are continuous, the investigators
      will record the vital signs every 15 minutes during the 4 hours of the study.

        20 patients immediately after cardiac surgery arriving to the intensive care unit, and
        connected to an arterial line and or a Swan Ganz catheter transducer. Usually the arterial
        line is left for 24 hours. Right after arrival and once connected to an arterial line, the
        participants will be connected to the Biobeat monitor (both wristwatch or a patch). Vital
        signs will be monitored for 4 hours, and recorded every 15 minutes, for comparison. After 4
        hours, the Biobeat monitor will be disconnected.
