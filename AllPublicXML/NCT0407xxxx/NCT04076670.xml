      This work aims to study the benefits a psychological intervention in family caregivers of
      palliative care patients can have for reducing anxiety, depression and overburden.

      A parallel randomized controlled trial of two groups was performed. Information was collected
      on 154 family caregivers of patients at the end of life during the moments before and after
      the intervention.

    <measure>Change in anxiety (PRE and POST measures)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This variable was assesed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS. This Scale contains 7 items asessing anxiety, where lower values represent a better outcome.
In order to observe the change in anxiety, it was measured at two time points:
First measurement: PRE. Once the participant had signed the informed consent, the initial score for this outcome was assessed.
Second measurement: POST. Up to 3 months after the first measurement the second measurement of the same variable was carried out.
Between first and second measurement, the control group received the usual psychological attention, whereas the intervention group received the usual psychological attention plus the structured psychological intervention proposed in this study.</description>
