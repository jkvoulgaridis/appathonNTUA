  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a home-based dialysis therapy and peritonitis is a serious
      complication in PD. A reliable point-of-care test to detect peritonitis is important for
      patients to self-detect peritonitis at home as delayed diagnosis and treatment of peritonitis
      will translate to poor outcomes in PD patients. The study aims to examine the effectiveness
      of Periplex®, point-of-care test, in the diagnosis of peritonitis in PD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A reliable point-of-care test to detect peritonitis is indeed needed for early diagnosis of
      peritonitis at home and seeking medical help early.

      We hypothesize that Periplex® is not inferior to routine leukocyte testing of PD Fluid
      effluent in the diagnosis of peritonitis. The test strip is designed to detect the
      inflammatory markers (IL6 and MMP-8) which are usually released during peritonitis. The strip
      is intended to be used in the PD patients who suspected to have symptoms of peritonitis. The
      target population is all adult PD patients who are followed up in Singapore General Hospital
      and have signs and symptoms suspected of peritonitis during the study period. The test is
      considered positive for peritonitis if one or both test lines appear in the window of the
      test strip.

      The test will be performed at 2-time points, one at the presentation of peritonitis and one
      at the completion of antibiotics for the current episode of peritonitis, to document
      resolution of peritonitis.

      The results of the tests will be compared with the leukocyte testing of PD effluent.
