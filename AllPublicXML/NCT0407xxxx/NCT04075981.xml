  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past few years, research has focused on the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF)
      after cardiac surgery, but highly effective interventions are still missing. Postoperative AF
      remains the most common complication after cardiac surgery, with an incidence of 10 to 50%.
      This complication is usually a transient condition that resolves spontaneously but it has
      major adverse consequences for patients and the health care system, including increased rates
      of death, complications (strokes), and hospitalisations with inflated costs.

      Recently, animal studies have demonstrated that neurotoxins such as botulinum toxin (BTX)
      injected into fat pads could suppress AF inducibility by parasympathetic activation.
      Botulinum toxin injection in fat pads has been studied in the dog's heart and could be
      associated with the reduction of atrial fibrillation in postoperative cardiac surgery. One
      pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility and safety of this technique in the human heart.

      The investigators hypothesize that botulinum toxin injection may substantially reduce
      postoperative AF during the first postoperative month after cardiac surgery without any
      serious adverse events. By the suppression of ganglionic plexi (GP) activity in the
      epicardial fat pads, mild term antiarrhythmic effects can be achieved with fewer
      antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulant treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Botulinium toxin use has been developed with success in wide-ranging fields (neurology,
      otorhinolaryngology, gynaecology, urology, plastic surgery, pain therapy), but not in
      cardiology.

      In the cardio-vascular field, only one pilot study on man has shown its utility in the
      prevention of atrial fibrillation by blocking the triggering through the sympathic and
      parasympathic systems. The investigators need to assess its potential benefits to prevent
      postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmia in a randomised multicentre study, with an expected
      impact of approximately 30,000 patients per years in France undergoing these types of cardiac
      surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that botulinum toxin injection may substantially reduce
      postoperative AF during the first 3 weeks after cardiac surgery without any serious adverse
      events. By the suppression of ganglionic plexi (GP) activity in the epicardial fat pads, mild
      term antiarrhythmic effects can be achieved with fewer antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulant
      treatment.
