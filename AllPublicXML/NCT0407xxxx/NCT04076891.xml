      This is an open label, 2 cohort clinical trial in women with lipedema with substantial fat
      above the knee or women and men with nodular Dercum's disease. Each cohort will have 6
      subjects who will receive RZL-012.

        -  The 1st cohort will be comprised of subjects with Dercum's disease

        -  The 2nd cohort will be comprised of subjects with lipedema with substantial fat above
           the knee.

      Within each cohort, dosing of the subjects will progress consecutively from one individual to
      the other with a minimum of 7-days between subjects to assess safety. This study design will
      allow the physicians to monitor safety for at least 7 days prior to dosing the next subject.
      Cohort 2 will be conducted in a dose escalation manner and the decision to proceed to the
      next dose level will be made after reviewing all safety data collected by Day 14 within 2 Â±
      1d of the last dosed subject. The trial will proceed within a cohort provided that no more
      than one subject experiences intolerable side effects in a cohort, and based on the decision
      made by the Principal Investigator (PI) and the Medical Monitor.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Post-menopausal (at least 2 years) women no more than 65 years old, with lipedema
             involving substantial fat above the knee or nodular Dercum's disease in such women and
             in men 20 - 65 years with nodular Dercum's disease.

             2. For Dercum's disease subjects - at least 2 nodules to be injected of at least 2cm
             diameter each, as determined by ultrasound 3. For lipedema subjects - Significant
             subcutaneous fat above the knee as determined by circumference of 50cm 4. Generally
             considered healthy according to medical history, physical examination, ECG and
             laboratory evaluation with a special emphasis on metabolic parameters (fasting glucose
             concentration &lt; 200 mg, normal blood pressure).

             5. Subjects must be able to adhere to the visit schedule and protocol requirements and
             be available to complete the study.

             6. Subjects must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Unable to tolerate subcutaneous injection. 2. Subjects with uncontrolled cardiac,
             hepatic, renal or neurologic/psychiatric disorders, that in the opinion of the
             investigator, put the subject at significant risk, are not eligible.

             3. Positive blood screen for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbSAg), Hepatitis C virus
             (HCV), or Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or positive urine screen for alcohol or
             drugs of abuse (unless prescribed by a physician).

             4. Subjects with a clinical history of primary or secondary immunodeficiency,
             autoimmune disease or subjects taking immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids
             are ineligible.

             5. As a result of medical review, physical examination, the PI (or medically qualified
             nominee) considers the subject unfit for the study.

             6. Known sensitivity to components of the injection formulation. 7. Prior wound,
             tattoo or infection in the treated area. 8. Prior invasive treatment such as surgery
             or injectable drug at the RZL-012 injected area.
