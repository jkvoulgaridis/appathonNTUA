  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among European women under 45 years old. It
      is secondary to cervical dysplasia induced by persistent human papillomavirus infection. The
      involvement of matrix metalloproteinases in carcinogenesis of the cervix is real, but their
      expressions vary according to the published series. An association between the expression of
      MMPs and that of the human papillomavirus deserves to be explored, as this can have a
      prognostic influence in the case of gradual expression demonstrated in the development of
      (pre) cancerous lesions of the cervix.

      This study aims to compare the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue
      inhibitors between 4 groups of patients defined according to the severity of the cervical
      lesion.

    <description>The immunohistochemical score is the modified HScore, also called Quickscore. It is calculated by multiplying the percentage of cells that are marked (from 0 to 100) by intensity (from 0 to 3). The total score is between 0 and 300. This score will be defined on normal, tumoral and stromal cells according to the analyzed tissue (normal, dysplasias or cancer)</description>
