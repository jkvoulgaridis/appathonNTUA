  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anastomotic leakage remains the major early complication after laparoscopic anterior
      resection(LAR) for medium &amp; low rectal cancer. Pelvic floor reconstruction (PR) is a key step
      in various standard resections for open radical rectal cancer surgery, which was considered
      to be helpful for decreasing the rate of leakage. However, PR in endoscopic LAR surgery is
      not routine practice and remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of PR during LAR for mid/low rectal carcinoma, especially in preventing anastomotic
      leakage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with rectal cancer will be randomly assigned to group with pelvic floor
      reconstruction(PR) versus group without pelvic floor reconstruction(NPR).

      We want to investigate the rate of anastomotic leakage and re-operation between the two
      groups, some other relevant outcomes will be concerned all the same.
