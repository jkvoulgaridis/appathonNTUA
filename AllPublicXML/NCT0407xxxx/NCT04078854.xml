  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of two types of education on HbA1c
      level and future amputations in inpatient diabetics after initial minor foot amputation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective randomized study evaluating inpatient diabetics after
      initial minor foot amputations.

      b) When a potential enrollee has been identified, while still inpatient, one research
      associate from a group of trained residents and medical students will spend 15-30 minutes
      with the patient to enroll and give one of the two education video presentations. The video
      presentations are the narrated versions of the slides attached to the IRB application. We
      will have both English and Spanish videos available. Because we are using video education,
      the education provided will be standardized across all patients, and there will be minimal
      variation in education provided despite using different research associates. The patients
      will be randomized to one of the two presentations. Both presentations are identical in
      educating patients how to control diabetes and the risk of future amputations in diabetes,
      but the experimental arm presentation will also include information regarding sexual
      dysfunction in diabetes. Each enrollee will also be asked if they are receiving structured
      diabetes education at the Montefiore Diabetic Center and will be encouraged to follow up to
      receive structured education there.

      The education presentation will occur after post-operative day 1 after minor foot
      amputations.

      Primary Outcome: HbA1c level Secondary Outcomes: LDL level, Mortality, Re-amputation (higher
      level or contralateral leg)
