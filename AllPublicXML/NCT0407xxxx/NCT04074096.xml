    <time_frame>From randomisation until end of treatment, up to 60 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.
The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <description>This EORTC brain cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30 questionaire.
The QLQ-BN20 contains 20 items organized into four scales (three items each: future uncertainty, visual disorder, motor dysfunction, and communication deficit), and seven single items (headaches, seizures, drowsiness, hair loss, itchy skin, weakness of legs, and bladder control). All items are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = &quot;not at all,&quot; 2 = &quot;a little,&quot; 3 = &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), and are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
