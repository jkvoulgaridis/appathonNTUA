  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral and maxillofacial pathology in pediatric patients differs from the general population,
      as the nature of lesions in children changes with growth and development. Oral and
      maxillofacial pathology encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases, some of which (i.e. aphthous
      ulceration, geographic tongue, and herpes labialis) can be diagnosed on clinical presentation
      alone. For other soft tissue diseases and for pathology with bony components, incisional or
      excisional biopsy is mandatory to establish a definitive diagnosis .

      Several studies illustrated that oral and maxillofacial pathology in pediatric populations
      varies based on the geographic location of the population as racial and environmental
      specificities and the lifestyle of each population may influence the prevalence of these
      diseases .

      Although there is increasing literature regarding the incidence and prevalence of pediatric
      oral and maxillofacial pathology, there is no study investigating the range and frequency in
      Egyptian children.
