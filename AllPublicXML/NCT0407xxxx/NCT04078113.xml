  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project has 2 phases. Phase 1: diagnostic test study, to evaluate the efficacy of the
      variation of pupillary size (PDR) to detect pain in ICU patients regarding to Behavioural
      Pain Scale (BPS) and ESCID (Conductual Scale Pain Index). Phase 2: controlled and aleatorized
      clinical trial to evaluate efficacy in PDR monitoring after painful assessed minimum stimulus
      with the best diagnostic efficiency on phase 1, as a need of analgesia indicator tool.

      The sample will be patients over 18 years, sedated and mechanically ventilated, with an
      initial BPS of 3, RASS between -1 and -4, not able not to communicate , with inform consent
      signed. Exclusion criteria will be: ophtalmologic pathology and administration of drugs
      interfering pupillary reflexes. Measurements before/during pain/non-pain situations,
      aspiration of secretions and calibrated intensity stimulus through the pupilometer Algiscan.
      The investigators will study association between pain according to BPS/ESCID and pupillary
      dilatation according to pupillometry and percentage of patients with pain and preanalgesia
      according to pupillometry and standard clinical practice.

    <description>Every patient will be subjected to a measured stimulus with a power selected in phase 1 (X mA) and pupillary dilatation will be measured by pupillometry. In those patients showing pupillary size variation over the limit for insufficient analgesia estimated in phase 1 for tracheal suction, additional analgesia will be provided before tracheal suction. In those patients without pain detected by pupillometry, additional anlagesia won´t be provided. In both cases Pupillometry, BPS and ESCID will be measured during tracheal suction to determine whether the patient is in pain or not.</description>
