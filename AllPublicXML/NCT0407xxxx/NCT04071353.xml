      This study was a clinical observational cohort study of two-way, non-intervention long-term
      dynamic follow-up. Enrolled in the Department of Liver Diseases, Beijing Ditan Hospital,
      Capital Medical University, with interferon combined with ribavirin (PR) antiviral therapy
      (PR treatment greater than or equal to 6 months) and/or direct acting antivirals (DAAs) In
      patients with chronic hepatitis C, the baseline, antiviral treatment and withdrawal follow-up
      data before the antiviral treatment were collected, and the patients were followed up for 3-6
      months. Clinical data such as clinical biochemistry, HCV RNA and serological markers
      (anti-HCV), AFP and liver imaging (liver ultrasound) were collected during the study period.
      At least 144 weeks of observation on the virological response and clinical outcome of
      anti-viral treatment of chronic hepatitis C, the main evaluation index of liver cancer and
      decompensated liver cirrhosis after stopping the drug, and exploring the antiviral treatment
      of patients Long-term virological response and clinical outcomes, clarifying their
      influencing factors.
