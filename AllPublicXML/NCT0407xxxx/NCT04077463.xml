      The purpose of this study is to confirm the tolerability of recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      of lazertinib (Phase 1), to determine the tolerability and identify the recommended Phase 2
      combination dose of lazertinib when combined with JNJ-61186372 (Phase 1b), to characterize
      the safety and tolerability of lazertinib and JNJ 61186372 combinations at the RP2CD in
      participants with advanced NSCLC with documented EGFR mutation (Phase 1b expansion cohorts)
      and to estimate the antitumor activity of lazertinib and JNJ 61186372 combinations at the
      RP2CD in participants with advanced NSCLC with documented EGFR mutation (Phase 1b expansion
      cohorts).
