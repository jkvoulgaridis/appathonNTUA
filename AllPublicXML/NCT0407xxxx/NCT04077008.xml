    <textblock>
      Bilaterally obstructed kidneys could be caused by benign or malignant causes it could lead to
      renal failure which can be avoided by urgent drainage either by PCN or DJ , The aim is to
      determine whether unilateral or bilateral drainage make a difference in improvement of renal
      function of bilaterally obstructed kidneys and whether that improvement relays on the cause
      of the obstruction.

      The investigators will do that by doing a prospective comparative study on patients presented
      to our department by bilaterally obstructed kidneys , by either benign or malignant causes ,
      with high serum chemistry. Intervention to this cases will be done by inserting JJ or PCN
      either unilateral or bilateral depending upon lab workups , our staff decision and patients
      fittness and agreement .

      Kidney obstruction means obstruction of urinary flow with back pressure on the kidney, which
      may be unilateral or bilateral, may have many causes either benign e.g; urolithiasis,
      retroperitoneal fibrosis, renal papillary necrosis or malignant e.g; urinary tract tumors as
      bladder cancer and prostate cancer, or Extrinsic tumor as cervical cancer(5) , lymphoma or
      other pelvic tumors When kidney obstruction occurs bilaterally this raises serum chemistry
      and may lead to post-renal AKI which represents about (1-10%) of all causes of AKI.
      Post-renal AKI is an emergency case that requires an urgent and minimally invasive procedure
      to drain the urine either by PCN or ureteric stents.

      There has been always a debate about which one is better to drain the obstructed kidneys
      percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteric stents and which is better in improvement of renal
      function and with less effect on life style . Also the mode of drainage of the obstructed
      kidneys, bilateral or unilateral, also has been a point of debate. Unless bilateral renal
      obstruction is due to benign or treatable malignant cause, unilateral nephrostomy is always
      the rule according to some authors . some authors, reported better improvement in renal
      function with bilateral PCN with pelvic tumors The investigators will do prospective
      comparative study for studying mode and laterality of drainage in benign and malignant causes
      in bilaterally obstructed kidneys .

    <measure>when the serum creatinine comes to normal after drainage of bilaterally obstructed kidneys either on one side or 2 sides</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure seum creatinine of patients with bilaterally obstructed kidneys and raised serum chemistry who are in urgent need for intervention . After intervention , either by PCn or ureteric stents , serum chemistry will be measured in those patient again in fixed times e.g; after 6 hrs , 1 day , 3 days , 1 week , 2 weeks . after collecting and processing the data we will come to a conclusion either bilateral drainage of patients with bilaterally obstructed kidneys due to benign cause is faster to return serum chemistry to normal than unilateral drainage. The same will be applied to patients of bilaterally obstructed kidneys due to malignant cause .</description>
