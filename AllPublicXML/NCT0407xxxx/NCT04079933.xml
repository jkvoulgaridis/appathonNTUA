  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to estimate changes in biomarkers of exposure (BOE) in adult
      cigarette smokers using an oral tobacco-derived nicotine (OTDN) product relative to adult
      smokers who continue smoking exclusively.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel group, multicenter, 9-week study to
      determine changes in BOE in adult smokers allowed ad libitum use of an OTDN product relative
      to adult smokers who were not allowed to use an OTDN product. This study was conducted in
      adult smokers who were considered to be in overall good health. Subjects were randomized to
      Test (allowed OTDN use) or Control (not allowed OTDN use) groups.
