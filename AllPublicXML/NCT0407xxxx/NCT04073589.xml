  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate the pharmacodynamic (PD), pharmacokinetic (PK),
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of efgartigimod co-administered with rHuPH20, and to
      measure the time to inject the full dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) of
      different dose levels of efgartigimod co-administered with a fixed concentration of rHuPH20
      by the subcutaneous (SC) route of administration in healthy adult male subjects.
