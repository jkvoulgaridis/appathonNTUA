  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for most intra-articular distal femur fractures (above the knee
      joint) in geriatric patients is a surgical fixation using plates and screws to hold the
      fracture pieces in the correct position, until the fracture as healed.

      However, surgical fixation of these complex fractures in geriatric patients, is associated
      with significant complications, such as non-union (when the broken bone does not heal
      properly), infection and the need for revision surgery. Additionally, surgical fixation
      requires prolonged immobilization of of the affected limb (typically around 6-12 weeks
      post-operatively), which can lead to disability and other complications. Geriatric patients,
      especially those frail and with cognition impairment, are unable to adhere to the
      immobilization restrictions, which leads to an increased risk of fixation failure (broken
      bone does not heal).

      Another treatment option for those patients is an acute distal femoral replacement
      (artificial knee), where damaged parts of the knee joint are replaced with artificial
      prosthesis. This procedure allows patients to walk immediately after the surgery and faster
      return to previous level of function, therefore avoiding the complications for
      immobilization.

      There is a lack of guideline and evidence to suggest which surgical technique is best to
      provide superior function outcomes, lower complications and reduced costs. The proposed study
      seeks to answer this question by performing a large clinical trial comparing knee replacement
      versus surgical fixation in geriatric patients with distal femur fracture.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial, involving multiple centers
      across North America, to compare distal femur replacement (knee prosthesis) versus surgical
      fixation as a treatment for geriatric distal femur fracture.

      Patients 65 years of age and older, with closed, displaced ( when the two ends of the bone
      are not lined up straight), comminuted (bone is in many pieces) distal femur fracture, who
      meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study, will be randomly assigned
      (by chance like flipping a coin) to receive either acute distal femoral replacement or
      surgical fixation.

      The hypothesis is that patients in the acute distal femoral replacement group will have
      superior function, range of motion (full movement potential of a joint), general health
      status, reduced pain, and lower complications when compared to patients in the surgical
      fixation group.

    <description>TUG is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility (in seconds) and requires both static and dynamic balance. A line is placed on the floor 3 meters away from a chair where patient will be sitting.
When instructed to &quot;GO&quot; patient will stand, walk to a line on the floor at his/her regular pace, turn around and walk back to the chair and sit down. The longer it takes for subject to complete the test, higher is the risk of fall and lower is the its functional mobility.
Reference values are:
60-69 years old = 8.1 seconds; 70-79 years old = 9.2 seconds; 80-99 years old = 11.3 seconds. Over 14 seconds is associate with high risk of fall</description>

    <description>It is a function of tight muscles weakness that assess the patient inability to achieve the final 15 degrees of active knee extension.
The therapist/assessor will evaluate if the patient can extend the knee fully with help (passive movement), but have limited range of movement when perform an active knee extension.
The therapist/assessor will record the degree of limitation for each patient.
