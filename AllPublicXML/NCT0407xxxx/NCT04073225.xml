      Patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at elevated risk for Alzheimer's
      disease and related dementias (ADRD). Improvements in TBI treatment may mitigate this risk.

      have well established neurocognitive benefits. This study seeks to address the need for novel
      TBI interventions optimized for adults with history of TBI by determining the effectiveness

      Patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at elevated risk for Alzheimer's
      disease and related dementias (ADRD). Improvements in TBI treatment may mitigate this risk.
      The treatment of TBI, especially for those with chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae, is moving
      toward multi-modal approaches that include non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise
      and cognitive enrichment. Complex motor activities, which combine physical and cognitive
      demands, have been shown to have well established neurocognitive benefits. However, there are
      a lack of cognitive enhancing interventions that utilize these complex motor activities. Many
      adults with history of TBI face significant barriers to engaging in physical activity which
      limit the adults' ability to participate in many neurocognitive interventions. This study
      seeks to address the need for novel TBI interventions optimized for adults with history of
      TBI by determining the effectiveness of an immersive computer game designed to integrating
      complex cognitive-motor interventions. During this proposed 12-month study involving patients
      with history of TBI (n=66) the investigators will examine cognition, independent function,
      mood and ADRD related brain biomarkers after 12 weeks of a randomized intervention, as well
      as 9 months post-intervention to assess for durability of any benefits. The investigators
      hypothesize that complex motor activities will improve cognitive health in adults with a
      history of TBI and that promising results would have implications for early intervention for
      those at risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment and ADRD.

    <description>The immersive video game being tested in this study is called Bandit the Dolphin, developed by neurologist Dr. John Krakauer, and engineers in the Brain, Learning, Animation, and Movement Lab at Johns Hopkins. Bandit the Dolphin provides an oceanic environment in which the individual's arm movements control a simulated dolphin. The neuromotor effects of this game have been designed to be used in the clinical setting to rehabilitate arm and hand function following stroke. The game has further been modified to a Microsoft Kinect-based system and piloted for play in non-laboratory settings among community-dwelling adults. The game offers a unique combination of skilled arm movements plus varying levels of cognitive challenge. In this way, the individual's arms are challenged the same way the legs would be when walking in a complex, outdoor environment. Importantly, the participant &quot;plays&quot; while standing, thus engaging the whole body in this novel multi-sensorial experience.</description>
