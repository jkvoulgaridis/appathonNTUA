    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well the combination of XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and
      ipilimumab work in treating patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (i.e.,
      neuroendocrine tumor that does not look like the normal tissue it arose from). Cabozantinib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab may shrink the cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) associated with the combination of XL184
      (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and ipilimumab in patients with advanced poorly-differentiated
      neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), after the failure of at least one line of prior therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). II. To measure the safety and tolerability of
      the combination of XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and ipilimumab in patients with advanced,
      poorly-differentiated NECs.

      III. To evaluate disease control rate (DCR). IV. To measure duration of response (DOR). V. To
      describe the tumor molecular profile using whole exome sequencing (WES) and correlate it with
      treatment outcome.

      VI. To describe the tumor molecular profile using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq)
      and correlate it with treatment outcome.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes in pre- and on-treatment biopsies.

      II. To measure tumor-infiltrating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in pre- and
      on-treatment biopsies.

      III. To measure tumor-infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the pre and
      on-treatment biopsies.

      IV. To measure the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells and
      infiltrating immune cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of cycles 1-4 and days
      1-28 of subsequent cycles, nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, and
      ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4 only. Treatment repeats every 21 for 4
      cycles then every 28 days for subsequent cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, and then every 3
      months thereafter.

             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP
             should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months after the last dose of
             study therapy. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity: 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic
             gonadotropin [hCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of study therapy. Women must
             not be breastfeeding. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any
             contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year. Men who receive study
             therapy and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to
             contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of study therapy. Women who
             are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile)
             as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception. WOCBP is defined as any
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is
             defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of
             other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must
             have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &lt; 40 mIU/mL. WOCBP
             and men who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to
             contraception for a period of 5 and 7 months, respectively, after the last dose of
             study therapy. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the
             half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP
             use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with
             WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days. Should a woman become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,
             she (or the participating partner) must inform the treating physician immediately

             replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids in patients with adrenal insufficiency
             are permitted, even if &gt;= 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of
             corticosteroids for prophylaxis or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted, as is

             treatment. Patients may continue on bone-modifying agents (denosumab or
             bisphosphonates) with caution

          -  Patients who have not recovered to baseline from adverse events due to prior

             study treatment

               -  Note: If a single EKG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 msec, two
                  additional EKGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30
                  min after the initial EKG, and the average of these three consecutive results for
                  QTcF will be used to determine eligibility

          -  Patients should not have known, untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal
             metastases because of poor prognosis and concerns that progressive neurologic
             dysfunction could confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to agents used in study

          -  Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any
             monoclonal antibodies

          -  Patients must not require concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.,
             dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine,
             phenobarbital, or St. John's wort). Because lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, patients will be counseled on
             the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to
             be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
             herbal product

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness
             including, but not limited to, the following conditions:

               -  Cardiovascular disorders:

                    -  Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 3 or 4,
                       unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.

                    -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) &gt; 140 mm
                       Hg systolic or &gt; 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive
                       treatment within seven days prior to the first dose of study treatment.

                    -  Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction
                       (MI), or other ischemic event, or thromboembolic event (e.g., deep venous
                       thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]) within 6 months before first
                       dose.

               -  GI disorders including those associated with a high risk of perforation or
                  fistula formation:

                    -  The patient has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer
                       disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease), diverticulitis,
                       cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis,
                       acute obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric
                       outlet obstruction.

                    -  Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal
                       abscess within 6 months before first dose. Complete healing of an
                       intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before first dose.

               -  Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis or other history of
                  significant bleeding (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first
                  dose.

               -  Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease
                  manifestation.

               -  Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels.

               -  Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study
                  participation.

                    -  Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture.

                    -  Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.

                    -  Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 (cabozantinib) has the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects, and the effects of nivolumab and
             ipilimumab on the developing fetus are not well known. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother,
             breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with XL184 (cabozantinib),
             nivolumab, or ipilimumab

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment
             including high dose systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but
             are not limited to: immune-related neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis,
             autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or myasthenia gravis;
             systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective
             tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative
             colitis, or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with a history of toxic epidermal
             necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be
             excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus (DM), or endocrine deficiencies (e.g., thyroiditis)
             managed with replacement hormones, including physiologic corticosteroids, are
             eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's
             syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication,
