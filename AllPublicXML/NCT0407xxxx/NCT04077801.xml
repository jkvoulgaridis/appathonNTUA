    <textblock>
      arious rationales for the relationship between the spine or pelvis and TMJ have been found.
      These theories include fascial, myological interrelationships, referred pain patterns and
      facilitating tonic neck reflexes involving inter segmental spinal pathways. A contributing
      mechanism could be the relationship between how TMJ occlusion, head position and body posture
      relate to the body's natural neurological visual/vestibular righting mechanism (Blum, 2004).

      There is a Correlation between the facial axis together with the lordotic angle and the
      pelvic inclination, the inner gonial angle and the mandibular plane with the lordotic angle
      and the pelvic inclination, as well as the facial depth with the pelvic inclination showed a
      significant correlation (Carsten et al., 2007).

    <description>The blocks are released and the rods are placed over the crest of the ilium. The blocks are then pressed firmly toward the midline. Read the angle from the level. If the gauge reads over 21/2Â°, the result is listed as positive.Anterior pelvic tilting angle: PALM was used for measuring pelvic tilting angle. A mark was put on a point just inferior to ASIS; another mark was put just inferior to PSIS. The callipers of the PALM were put on these two points</description>
