    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, prospective, open label, randomized-controlled study that will compare
      radial access with state-of-the-art femoral access in patients without ST-segment elevation
      acute myocardial infarction undergoing cardiac catheterization. Subjects will be randomized
      1:1 into 2 treatment groups: radial access and state-of-the-art femoral access. Randomization
      will be performed in blocks of 50 per site. Similarly, a second sub-randomization will be
      performed in the femoral access group into use of 18 vs 21 gauge needles, also in a 1:1
      fashion.
