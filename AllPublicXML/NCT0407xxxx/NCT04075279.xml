  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to examine the cardiovascular mechanisms of increased
      cardiovascular mortality in those with high activity occupations.

      The current proposal uses a repeated-measures, within-subject design to address our aims.
      Twenty male participants will report to the laboratory to provide informed consent, complete
      baseline assessments, and receive ambulatory monitors. Following this session, each
      participant will wear physical activity and ambulatory cardiovascular monitors for 7 days,
      including at least one non-work day and one work day. Characterization of work activity will
      use physical activity data from self-reported time at work (Specific Aim I). The 24-hour
      cardiovascular load (HR and BP) and nocturnal HRV will be compared across work and non-work
      days (Specific Aim II). Lastly, whether fitness level or job strain modify the difference in
      cardiovascular strain between work vs. non-work days will be evaluated (Specific Aim III).
