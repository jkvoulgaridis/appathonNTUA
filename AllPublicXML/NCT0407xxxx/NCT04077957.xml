      This study evaluates clinical responses and cost-effectiveness of using etanercept (ETN) and
      conventional synthetic Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) with treat-to-target
      strategy in ankylosing spondylitis patients. Half of participants will be used
      treat-to-target strategy with ETN and csDMARDs, while the others will be used conventional
      therapy scheme with ETN only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tumor necrosis factor inhibitors(TNFi) like etanercept(ETN) has been always recommended
      as the primary treatment option for active AS. But when sustained applied in daily clinical
      practices, it is unaffordable for patients in developing countries in most cases due to the
      high expense of TNFi. On this ground, this study proposes a new scheme dividing AS treatment
      into relatively active phase and relatively stable phase, and sequentially introducing TNFi
      and conventional synthetic Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) in each phase
      respectively. Taking full advantages of the rapid and precise efficacy of TNFi when
      short-term application in active AS and then csDMARDs combination was prescribed to maintain
      the remission cause by TNFi. Drug regimes are adjusted according to the different responses
      of individual patient based on treat-to-target strategy. TNFi is reintroduced if there is a
      reactive tendency and then switching to csDMARDs again when patients are in remission. Thus,
      the continuous low activity or remission of AS may be promising through this treating
      management and the treatment cost will reduce for csDMARDs partially replace TNFi in the
      management of relatively stable phase.

      This study is designed as a prospective randomized, positive controlled, 48-week clinical
      trial, involving 100 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. All enrolled patients will
      randomly assign to 2 groups for the comparison of the clinical responses and
      cost-effectiveness of our treatment scheme with that of the conventional therapy scheme of
      TNFi (etanercept). Multiple clinical indexes will be measured to evaluate the therapeutic
      effect, including Patient's Global Assessment, BASDAI and ASDAS-CRP for disease activity,
      BASFI for functional state, EQ-5D and SF-36 for quality-of-life assessment, SPARCC and SPARCC
      Sacroiliac Joint Structural Score (SSS) for sacroiliac joint invasion. We expect to assess
      the feasibility of our new treatment scheme in AS disease controlling and cost-effectiveness
      improving through this one-year follow-up study.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 24, 36, 48</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI score was determined using a simple, self-reported questionnaire that consists of 6 questions on disease activity. Each question is scored from 0 to 10 (0 = no symptoms, 10 = very severe symptoms).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS tool is a self-administered questionnaire plus an objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire covers disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling assessed on a visual analogue scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (extreme pain or disability) cm) and duration of morning stiffness on a numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of 2 hours or longer). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of C-reactive protein (mg/L) (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h) (ESR). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and either CRP or ESR values) are combined to yield a score ranging from 0 to no defined upper limit. Higher scores indicate higher disease activity. Remission is defined as ASDAS score &lt;1.3. Clinically important improvement is defined as a change &gt;= 1.1 units, and major improvement is defined as a change &gt;= 2.0 units.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 24, 36, 48</time_frame>
    <description>BASFI is a validated self assessment tool that determines the degree of functional limitation in AS. Participants answered 10 questions, consisting of 8 specific questions regarding function in AS and 2 questions reflecting the participant's ability to cope with everyday life. Each question was answered on a 0-10 scale (0 being no problem and 10 being the worst problem), the sum of which (divided by 10) resulted in the BASFI score (0-10).</description>

    <description>EQ 5D is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (extreme problems).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 24, 36, 48</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome Study health measure SF-36 questionnaire is a well-validated and widely used quality-of-life instrument. It is a self-administered survey that consists of 8 multi-item scales: The 4 subscales of the SF-36 comprises the PCS (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health) score and the 4 subscales of the SF-36 comprises the MCS (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) score. PCS and MCS are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health (worst value is 0 and best value is 100), which are scored using a norm-based system where linear transformations are performed to transform scores to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 12, 24, 48</time_frame>
    <description>SPARCC score for the sacroiliac joint was based on 6 consecutive coronal slices from posterior to anterior. Each joint was divided into 4 quadrants. Each quadrant was assigned a score of 0 = no lesion/1 = increased signal. For each slice, the score is increased by 1 for each joint that exhibits an intense signal in any quadrant. Also, for each slice, an additional score of 1 will be given for each joint that includes a lesion demonstrating continuous increased signal of a depth ≥1 cm from the articular surface. The maximum possible score is 72.</description>

    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study regents was considered an AE, without regard to possibility of relationship. An AE resulting in any of the following outcomes, or deemed to be significant for any other reason, was considered to be a SAE: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; a life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
