  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients are vulnerable to develop protein energy malnutrition and
      make a notion that to maintain the nutritional status is of paramount importance in these
      patients. However, proteins intake from vegetarian and meat diet were observed to have
      different impacts on nutritional and inflammatory status, mineral homeostasis and its related
      hormones, and clinical outcomes in non-dialysis CKD patients. In here, we aim to investigate
      these impacts in CHD patients.

    <description>The items scheduled to be evaluated in this study include serum albumin, pre-albumin, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, lipid profile, ferritin, transferrin, hs-CRP, Alk-P, iPTH, 25(OH)D3, intact &amp; C-terminal FGF23, Klotho and hepcidin levels. We'll collect the patient's serum data in plant diet group, and collect the serum data in animal diet group, then we'll compare the data in these two groups to see whether there is any difference between each item.</description>
