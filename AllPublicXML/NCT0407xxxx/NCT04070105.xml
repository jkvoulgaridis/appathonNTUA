  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prosthesis that requires no power, yet has the functionality to perform various tasks,
      including those needed in the military, is extremely important. To bridge the gap between
      passive and powered prostheses, this study will test the Compliant Adaptive Energy Storage
      and Return (CAESAR) foot. The investigators will test and improve this foot design
      mechanically, and then test this design on individuals with lower limb amputation in a lab
      setting. The goal of this project is to develop a passive foot that can ultimately provide
      the user with more normalized biomechanics and function during ambulatory tasks.

    <description>The primary concept of the CAESAR foot is to capture the energy at heel strike and then store it to be released at a later time when it can provide additional propulsive forces during walking. Each transtibial amputee will wear the CAESAR foot and perform various tasks in the lab.</description>
