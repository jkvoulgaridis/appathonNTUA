  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate Procellera® , a novel FDA approved antimicrobial
      wound dressing in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study. The hypothesis is
      that when the dressing is moistened, the low electric field created by moisture-activated
      elemental silver and zinc electro-couple will prevent formation of biofilm in wounds or to
      disrupt existing biofilm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The healing of traumatic wounds, to include burns, can be compromised by the presence of
      infection so efforts are made to prevent or diagnose infection early in order to mitigate the
      negative impact on healing. Electric stimulation has previously been shown to have both
      bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects in wounds. Until now, administering low intensity
      electric field/micro-current as a therapy to mitigate biofilm infection and to improve wound
      healing was not feasible. In this study the investigators will use Procellera® , a FDA
      approved fabric based wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) consisting of a silver-zinc
      electro-couple for the prevention of wound biofilm formation. The dressing generates a low
      electric field (~1V) upon activation by a moist environment, which mitigates biofilm
      formation and promotes wound healing. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the
      efficacy of a wireless electroceutical dressing to prevent the formation or disrupting
      existing biofilms. The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized controlled
      clinical trial using the Procellera® dressing compared to the standard of care. Treatment
      sites will be randomized to either receiving Procellera® or the standard of care treatment.
      Objective measurements and assessments will be completed during subject follow-up visits for
      up to one month post treatment. This includes biopsies to calculate bacterial load by
      assessing colony forming unit (CFU) count and bacterial film visualization using scanning
      electron microscopy, histology, clinical assessment of infection, Transepidermal Water Loss
      (TEWL) and wound photography.
