  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of YH25448 when given orally to participants with epidermal growth factor receptor
      single activating mutation positive (EGFRm+) locally advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-third of all cancer deaths worldwide are still caused by lung cancer and non-small-cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). YH25448 is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective and irreversible
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) targets both the
      T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild type-EGFR. The study will be
      conducted in participants with EGFR mutation positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Study Parts A, B, and C are sponsored by Yuhan Corporation under protocol identifier
      YH25448-201 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03046992), and Study Part D is sponsored by
      Janssen Research and Development, LLC under protocol identifier 73841937NSC2001. In Part D,
      YH25448 will be given to participants outside Korea, including Caucasians, in order to
      evaluate safety, tolerability, efficacy (including tumor response) and Pharmacokinetics (PK)
      in participants outside of Korea. The duration of this study will be up to 2 years. Study
      treatment should be held in all participants with suspected (symptomatic) or documented
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive disease, until recovery
      from all infection related symptoms, and documented to be negative for SARS-CoV-2.

    <measure>Part D: Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have at least one confirmed Partial response (PR) or Complete response (CR) (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) prior to disease progression or recurrence. CR is defined when all target lesions (TLs) and non-target lesions (NTLs) present at baseline have disappeared (with the exception of lymph nodes which must be less than (&lt;)10 millimeters (mm) to be considered non-pathological) and no new lesions have developed since baseline. PR is defined when the sum of diameters of the TLs has decreased by 30 percent (%) or more compared to baseline (with no evidence of progression) and the NTLs are at least stable with no evidence of new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part D: Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part D: Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall, extracranial and intracranial response of CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD). CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR is defined as At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. SD is defined as Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD). PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm for extracranial and intracranial lesion, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part D: Tumor Shrinkage</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor shrinkage is measured at each visit by the percentage change in the sum of the diameters of target lesions compared to baseline measured as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 10 mm in the longest lesion diameter with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part D: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date until documented disease progression or death from any cause whichever occur first based on investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm for extracranial and intracranial lesion, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part D: Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
