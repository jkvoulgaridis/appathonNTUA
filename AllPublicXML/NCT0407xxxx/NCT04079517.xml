  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A feasibility study, randomising to either 10 or 20 mg of tamoxifen. The primary aim is to
      identify the time to mammographic density change and piloting the procedures. It is known
      that a density change is seen after 12 months of 20 mg of tamoxifen, but the clinical
      experience indicates that an effect of drugs influencing mammographic density could be seen
      already after a few months. The second aim is to evaluate if there is a density change from
      10 mg of tamoxifen equivalent to 20 mg.

    <textblock>
      The investigators want to conduct a feasibility study including 42 women who will be
      randomised to either 10 or 20 mg of daily oral tamoxifen. The primary aim of the study is to
      identify the time to mammographic density change and piloting the procedures. It is known
      that a density change is seen after 12 months of 20 mg of daily tamoxifen, but the clinical
      experience indicates that an effect of drugs influencing mammographic density could be seen
      already after a few months. The second aim of the pilot study is to see if there is a density
      change from 10 mg of tamoxifen equivalent to 20 mg and if there is a difference in adverse
      reactions between the two doses. Interim analysis will be performed at 6 months, monitoring
      both safety and level of mammographic density change.
