  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the proposed study is to compare the effects of weight loss (WL) alone with
      WL plus weighted vest use or WL plus resistance exercise training (RT) on indicators of bone
      health and subsequent fracture risk.

      The study team proposes that a 12 month trial in 192 older (60-85 years) adults with obesity
      (Body mass index or BMI=30-40 kg/m2) randomized to one of three interventions (n=64/group):
      WL alone (WL; caloric restriction targeting 10% WL); WL plus weighted vest use (WL+Vest);
      targeting â‰¥8 hours/day, weight replacement titrated up to 10% WL); or, WL plus structured RT
      (WL+RT; 3 days/week). Total hip trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) is the
      primary outcome. This outcome will be complemented by exploratory assessment of several
      fracture-related risk factors, including: (1) femoral neck and lumbar spine vBMD, cortical
      thickness, finite element modeling of bone strength, and regional fat and muscle volumes,
      measured by CT; (2) areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the total hip, femoral neck, lumbar
      spine, and distal radius; trabecular bone score; and total body fat/lean masses, measured by
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); (3) muscle function and strength; (4) biomarkers of
      bone turnover; and (5) bone-regulating hormones/cytokines known to influence bone metabolism
      during WL. Therefore, the investigators Specific Aims are to:

      Aim 1: Determine the effects of WL+VEST compared to WL and WL+RT on 12 month change in total
      hip trabecular vBMD. Despite similar reductions in total body weight, Hypothesis 1:
      Participants in the WL+VEST group will show attenuated losses of total hip trabecular vBMD
      versus WL; and Hypothesis 2: Loss in total hip trabecular vBMD will be no greater in WL+VEST
      compared to WL+RT.

      Aim 2: Explore the effects of WL+VEST compared to WL and WL+RT on the 12 month change in
      fracture-related risk factors. Despite similar reductions in total body weight, we
      hypothesize that WL+VEST and WL+RT will demonstrate improvements in fracture-related risk
      factors compared to WL.
