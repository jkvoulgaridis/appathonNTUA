  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to investigate influence of bioceramic filling of the root canal and
      photodynamic therapy on periapical healing and development of postoperative pain after
      endodontic retreatment. Patients are divided into two main groups and each of the group is
      divided into two subgroups. Main groups are patients receiving photodynamic therapy and
      patients receiving passive ultrasonic irrigation. Each of the main group is divided by the
      root canal filling material on the AH+ group and BioRoot group.

      Clinical trial will be conducted in Dental clinic Zagreb. Patients will be chosen for this
      randomized prospective trials from the everyday patients referred by general dentist for
      endodontic retreatment. In the research will be included only patients with symptoms of
      chronic apical periodontitis and previous endodontic treatment. It includes teeth sensitive
      to palpation, percussion or visible sinus tract or swelling and asymptomatic inadequate
      endodontic filling. Patients that are immunocompromised, pregnant women, teeth with pocket
      depth bigger then 3mm, teeth with signs of vertical root fracture, teeth that are impossible
      to restore are excluded from research.

      Every patient will be assigned to one group and one subgroup using &quot;wheeldecide&quot; programme.
      Patients will not be aware what group or subgroup they are assigned. endodontic retreatment
      will be conducted by one specialist in endodontics. Therapy is single visit retreatment.
