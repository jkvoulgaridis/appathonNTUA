  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the safety and efficacy of individualized new antigen cancer vaccine
      combined with Programmed Cell Death Protein 1（PD1） inhibitor Toripalimab in the treatment of
      metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Melanoma is the most malignant skin neoplasm. Immunotherapy is
      the main treatment at present. PD1 is an immunological checkpoint and the inhibitors can
      reduce the immune escape of tumors, enhance T cell function and kill tumors. At present, PD1
      antibody is the representative drug of immunotherapy, but the overall efficiency of its
      single drug treatment of acral melanoma is still low, and the combined treatment can
      significantly improve the efficiency. Melanoma has a high mutation load, which makes each
      patient have mutations specific to individual patients and tumors (changes in genetic
      material). These mutations lead to tumour cells producing proteins that are distinct from
      those of the body's own cells. These proteins used in vaccines may cause a strong immune
      response, which may help participants' bodies fight against any cancer cells that may lead to
      future recurrence of melanoma. Inhibition of PD1 can enhance the activity of T cells and form
      T cells with sustained killing activity. Tumor vaccines activate human Antigen Presenting
      Cells (APC) by injecting tumor antigens and adjuvants, and then activate T cells by APC to
      produce specific killing T cells. Therefore, the combination of &quot;tumor vaccine + PD1
      inhibitor&quot; can produce effective specific killing and sustained activation of T cells, and
      prevent the establishment of inhibitory tumor microenvironment by tumor cells. The study will
      examine the safety and efficiency of the combined therapy at different time points and assess
      whether there is an immune response in the patient's peripheral blood and tumor tissue.
