  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication safety is a crucial health issue for every older Canadian since many of the
      medications causing serious harm are those which also have life-saving or important
      symptom-relieving benefits. Very few specialists can accurately advise seniors which
      medications provide more benefit than harm for them personally, and make changes safely as
      this requires a very large breadth and depth of knowledge about the patient, the conditions
      they have and their therapies. Now that telemedicine is compatible with smart phones, this
      extends the ability of scarce specialists to 'see' any patient in Canada in a way that is
      more convenient for the patient and may be less expensive than current care. This project
      will find out whether a unique Clinical Pharmacology specialist team in Hamilton, Ontario can
      improve medication safety (stop medications no longer needed, reduce doses where appropriate,
      change to safer medications) for a high risk group of older hospitalized Canadians taking
      many medications. The hospital where this pilot study will take place was the first to
      install the world's leading electronic health record and set it up to facilitate and support
      high quality research. Patients who volunteer will be assigned to their usual care, or to the
      intervention which is the Clinical Pharmacology specialist team approach starting in hospital
      and following up with the patient at home using telemedicine and detailed communication with
      them, their caregiver, family physician, community pharmacist and other specialists. The
      investigators will study whether the intervention is effective and cost-effective at reducing
      harmful medication burden, reducing the need to return to hospital, or improving the
      patient's ratings of their care coordination. The results will determine whether a subsequent
      large trial is worthwhile.

    <measure>Feasibility Outcomes of CPT consultation volume capacity and potential to apply the intervention entirely through telemedicine.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured based on the number of successfully enrolled patients, and the number of patients that will entirely undergo the intervention through telemedicine.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility Outcomes of patient retention rate.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by looking at the number of patients enrolled, the number of patients that dropped out, and the number of patients that completed the study.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility Outcomes of likelihood of the intervention proving cost-effective.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using Healthcare resource utilization questionnaire, which will determine whether the intervention reduced healthcare costs compared to the control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-important outcomes: Participant ratings of coordination and continuity of transitions in care.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured using the Coordination and Continuity of Care Questionnaire (CCCQ). Which is a questionnaire we adapted from the brief prepared questionnaire (B-PREPARED) and the three-question care transitions measure questionnaire (CTM-3).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-important outcomes: Health related quality of life: EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured using the EuroQol five-dimensional, five-level descriptive system (EQ-5D-5L) that asks patients to self-assess their own health quality related quality of life. Whereas a scoring metric is used to assess the overall health related quality of life based on the answers to the questions. The questionnaire scale considers 1 as the best possible health and 5 as the worst health possible.</description>
