  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the Phase Ib portion aims to establish safety and tolerability of ARRY-614
      with either nivolumab or ipilimumab and to determine a recommended phase II dose of ARRY-614
      in combination with either nivolumab or ipilimumab immunotherapy in patients with selected
      advanced solid tumors. The Phase II portion will estimate the efficacy of ARRY-614 in
      combination with either nivolumab or ipilimumab immunotherapy in patients with melanoma and
      renal cell carcinoma.

      In the Phase lb portion of the trial: Participants must have a histologically confirmed
      malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard curative or palliative
      measures do not exist or are no longer effective. Melanoma trial participants must have
      either nivolumab or ipilimumab available and have progressed on anti-PD1 or
      anti-PD1/anti-CTLA4 combination therapy. Other advanced solid tumor trial participants must
      have nivolumab or therapy available and must be appropriate for this therapy. In the Phase ll
      portion of the trial: Participants with melanoma who previously experienced disease
      progression on anti-PD1 may enter the ARRY-614 plus nivolumab cohort or the ARRY-614 plus
      ipilimumab cohort. Participants with melanoma entering the ARRY-614 plus ipilimumab cohort
      must be naïve to ipilimumab therapy. Participants with RCC who previously experienced disease
      progression on anti-PD1 may enter the ARRY-614 plus nivolumab cohort. Potential participants
      will undergo Screening Procedures to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to the start
      of study treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1). Results of standard of care tests or
      examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 21 days prior to Cycle
      1 Day 1 may be used for screening assessments rather than repeating such tests. The first 5
      patients in each Phase II arm will undergo pre and on-treatment biopsies. The second biopsy
      will occur at C2D1 ± 7 days.Participants who meet all study eligibility criteria will be
      eligible to start study treatment. Patients will receive ARRY-614 on a QD continuous
      schedule. One cycle is defined as 4 weeks (28 days) ± 3 days. Prescribed QD doses should be
      taken at consistent times each day, as close to 24 ± 2 hours apart as possible. Daily study
      treatment will begin on C1D1 with planned concurrent dosing of ARRY-614 and either nivolumab
      or ipilimumab. Upon determination of the Recommend Phase ll Doseof ARRY-614, a similar dosing
      schedule will be pursued. Three simultaneous phase II, tumor-specific trials will be
      conducted: melanoma with nivolumab, melanoma with ipilimumab, and RCC with nivolumab.
      ARRY-614 will be given on a daily PO schedule in 4-week cycles (± 3 days). Nivolumab and
      ipilimumab will be given according to the corresponding FDA label dosing schedule for each
      individual agent.

          -  Have an active infection requiring systemic anti-infective therapy or with an
             unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C within 7 days of Day 1 (at the discretion of the
             Investigator, patients with tumor fever may be enrolled).

          -  Have any known hypersensitivity to any of the components of ARRY-614 or
             anti-PD1/ipilimumab combination therapies.

          -  Have significant active cardiac disease within 6 months prior to the start of study
             treatment, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive
             heart failure); myocardial infarction; unstable angina; and/or stroke.

          -  Have known LVEF &lt;40% by ECHO scan (or by other methods according to institutional
             practice) obtained within 28 days prior to the start of study treatment (testing is
             not otherwise mandatory).

          -  Have known active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infections. Patients with a
             sustained viral response to HCV treatment or immunity to prior HBV infection will be
             permitted. Patients with chronic HBV that is adequately suppressed per institutional
             practice will be permitted.

          -  Have any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent
             (within 12 months of Day 1) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or a laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Have known active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, chronic diarrhea, previous
             gastric resection or lap band dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other
             conditions that limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs
             administered PO. Gastroesophageal reflux disease under medical treatment is allowed
             (assuming no drug interaction potential).

          -  Have been committed to an institution by an order issued either by the judicial or
             administrative authorities.
