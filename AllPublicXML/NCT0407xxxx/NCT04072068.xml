  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, phase IV study. In this study patients that are receiving an
      antineoplastic treatment and that have been diagnosed with venous thromboembolism will
      receive edoxaban as per clinical practice. Edoxaban will be administered according to summary
      of product characteristics. Patients will receive 6 to 12 months of treatment with edoxaban
      administered orally. The thromboembolic event will be monitored as per local clinical
      practice. In this study patients will be evaluated at baseline, at the beginning of therapy
      with edoxaban, after 1 month (+/- 7 days), after 3, 6 and 12 months (+/- 3 weeks). During
      these visits, patients will be provided of a diary in which they should report drug intake
      and interruptions and quality of life questionnaires.

    <description>Every patient will receive every day edoxaban orally once a day. Edoxaban therapy will start after at least 5 days of lead-in with low-molecular-weight heparin, as per clinical practice. Edoxaban will be administered at dosage of 60 mg/day. In case of patients with body weight â‰¤60kg or with renal failure (creatinine clearance between 15 and 50 ml/min) or that are treated with P-gp inhibitors (cyclosporine, dronedarone, erythomycin, ketoconazole), dosage will be 30 mg/day. Patients will be treated for 6 up to 12 months with edoxaban, as per medical decision.</description>
