  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Sintilimab combined with
      IBI305 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in China.

      Approximately 26-38 subjects with locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma
      will be enrolled in the study. It includes dose escalation and dose expansion stage. 12-18
      subjects will be enrolled in dose escalation stage for the safety and efficacy evaluation.
      Then select specific dose of IBI305 +Sintilimab 200mg/kg, expand to 20 patients for the
      further safety and efficacy study.

      The study treatment lasts up to 24 months, or until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity,
      withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require
      termination of treatment, whichever occurs first.
