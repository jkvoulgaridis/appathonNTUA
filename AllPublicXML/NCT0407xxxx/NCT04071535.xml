  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To detect small fiber neuropathy in patients with possible or established diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (DPN) by skin biopsy and explore clinical characteristics and pathological
      features in Chinese patients with diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a subtype of diabetic neuropathy, patients with SFN often
      manifest as paresthesia of warmth, cold, pinprick and so on, especially affect ed
      length-dependent area. Skin biopsy is an effective method to diagnose SFN with high
      diagnostic accuracy. The procedure is simple and minimally, and the wound usually heals
      within a few days. However, skin biopsy is not widely used in diagnose of SFN in Chinese
      patients with diabetes. This study is aimed to establish a normal reference range of
      intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in the Chinese population, and to detect SFN in
      Chinese patients with diabetes by skin biopsy.

    <measure>Evaluation of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of sudoscan in Chinese diabetic patients with small fiber neuropathy compared with intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD)</measure>
    <time_frame>December, 2019</time_frame>
    <description>Sudoscan is used to as an autonomic nerve assessment tool with objective and stable operations, which measures the function of sweat glands by stimulating a low voltage current ( &lt; 4 volts) and detects the electrochemical reaction between the electrodes and chloride ions in both hands and feet. Results are presented as electrochemical skin conductance in hands (HESC) and feet (FESC), asymmetry ratio value in hands (HASYM) and feet (FASYM). We use intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) measured by skin biopsy as the gold standard, sudoscan is used to evaluate its diagnostic efficiency including sensitivity and specificity of small fiber neuropathy.</description>
