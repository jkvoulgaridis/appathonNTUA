    <textblock>
      Based on the clinical efficacy of ALK inhibitors in ALK+NSCLC, NCCN guidelines recommend ALK
      molecular testing of lung cancer patients, to select patients for ALK-targeted therapy.
      However, molecular testing via tissue biopsy cannot always be performed on NSCLC patients,
      potentially limiting access of effective treatment to the subset of patients who are able to
      undergo current testing procedures that utilize tissue biopsies. Obtaining an adequate tissue
      biopsy specimen for NSCLC presents a number of challenges. In particular, the method for
      diagnosis of lung cancer depends on the location, size, and type of suspected lung cancer,
      and the presence or absence of metastases. Common procedures for centrally located tumors
      include bronchoscopy and sputum cytology, which frequently yield insufficient tumor tissue
      for comprehensive mutation testing. In addition, 75% of patients are diagnosed with
      late-stage disease and often present with multiple comorbidities. Biopsies in these patients
      can lead to complications such as pneumothorax, hemoptysis, other bleeding complications, and
      cardiopulmonary decompensation. As a result of these factors, a physician treating a patient
      who presents with a significant burden of disease as well as significant comorbidities may
      rightly consider whether it is in the best interest of the patient to undergo a risky and
      potentially unsuccessful procedure. Thus, there exists a major unmet clinical need for
      testing procedures that do not require tumor tissue. The purpose of this phase II study is to
      assess the efficacy of brigatinib in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangement
      that are selected using predictive biomarkers identified via blood-based assays.
