      Understand the effect of recombinant EPO (rEPO) boosting and microdosing on the hematological
      module of the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)

        -  Measure the change in CD71 longitudinally in subjects from both cohorts

        -  Assess whether rEPO administration can be detected in a dried blood spot (DBS) using
           recent advances in analytical methodologies

        -  Compare windows of rEPO detection using both Athlete Biological Passport models and
           direct detection using analytical methods in urine, blood, and DBS

    <textblock>
      Despite being banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, blood doping is a common method of
      performance enhancement used by athletes wishing to gain an unfair advantage over their
      competition. A common way to achieve this increase is by using erythropoiesis stimulating
      agents (ESA's), namely recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO). Though laboratory tests have been
      developed for the direct detection of all known isoforms of exogenously administered ESAs in
      both urine and blood, athletes have found ways to circumvent these testing measures using
      techniques such as microdosing.

    <description>CD71 concentration will be measured during and following administration and will be compared to established baseline values from each individual and the study population to understand the changes caused by this dosing pattern of rEPO. These data, especially when comparing to the variability in CD71 in the placebo cohort, may be extrapolated in the anti-doping framework to detect rEPO abuse by athletes.</description>

    <description>The length of time (following both the subcutaneous 'boosting' phase and the intravenous 'microdosing' phase) that rEPO use is evident will be assessed. This will be assessed using different criteria:
Direct detection of the rEPO drug in urine, serum (and/or plasma), and dried blood spots
