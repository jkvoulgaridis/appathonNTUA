      This is a first in human, dose escalation study and will assess the safety and tolerability
      of ARV-471 in woman and men with ER+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who
      have received prior hormonal therapy and chemotherapy in the locally advanced/metastatic
      setting.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed ER+ and HER2- advanced
             breast cancer. Advanced breast cancer is metastatic, recurrent, or locally advanced
             unresectable breast cancer for which standard curative therapy is no longer effective
             or does not exist.

          -  Patients must have measurable or non-measurable disease by RECIST criteria
             (version1.1), with radiologic tumor assessments performed within 28 days of the first
             dose of therapy.

          -  Patients must have received at least 2 prior endocrine regimens in any setting
             (neoadjuvant, adjuvant or advanced/metastatic) a CDK4/6 inhibitor and up to 3 prior
             regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. All
             such therapy must be discontinued at least 14 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo a biopsy of accessible tumor within 4 weeks prior
             to the initiation of study treatment and a follow-up biopsy on treatment for ER IHC
             testing and PD studies. (Patients without accessible tumor tissue may be eligible
             after discussion with the Medical Monitor.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids (above physiologic
             replacement doses). Patients with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible
             if they have completed their treatment and have recovered from the acute effects of
             radiation therapy or surgery prior to first dose of study drug, have discontinued
             high-dose corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at least 4 weeks and are
             neurologically stable as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Patients who have received 4 or more regimens of chemotherapy for locally advanced or
             mBC.

          -  Receipt of prior anti-cancer or other investigational therapy within 14 days prior to
             the first administration of study drug.

          -  Radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug or prior irradiation to
             &gt;25% of the bone marrow. Palliative radiation for the alleviation of pain due to bone
             metastasis will be allowed during the study.
