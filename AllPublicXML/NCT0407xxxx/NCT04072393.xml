  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Other than optimizing medical management of cardiac risk factors, and reducing radiotherapy
      (RT) dose to the heart, there currently exist no interventions to mitigate or reverse the
      adverse cardiac effects of RT. Aerobic exercise has been demonstrated to improve patient
      quality of life, cardiac outcomes, and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with cancer
      receiving cardiotoxic systemic therapies, but the effects of aerobic exercise on patients at
      high risk for radiation induced heart disease (RIHD) who are not receiving cardiotoxic
      chemotherapies, such as patients with lung and esophageal cancers, is unknown. In addition,
      cardiac rehabilitation has not been tested in patients with lung or esophageal cancers.

    <description>The intervention consists of a prescribed course of cardiac rehabilitation: 36 sessions, three times a week, one hour each, over a period of 8 to 12 weeks.
Each customized exercise session includes three phases:
a 5- to 10-minute warm-up which consists of stretching, flexibility movements, and aerobic activity which gradually raises the heart rate to the desired level
a conditioning or training phase, which consists of 20 to 45 minutes of continuous or discontinuous aerobic activity
a cool down for 5 to 10 minutes consisting of low-intensity exercise that permits a gradual recovery from the conditioning phase</description>
