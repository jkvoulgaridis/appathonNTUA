  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an explorative, open, single-arm clinical investigation to collect real-life
      measurement data in order to assess the mathematical algorithms involved in TENA SmartCare
      Change Indicator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory clinical investigation is to evaluate safety and to collect
      real-life measurement data using the TENA Urine Sensor. The collected data will be used to
      assess the device related algorithms. These algorithms have been established and verified in
      a laboratory environment. However, due to possible differences in parameters, real-life
      measurement data are to be collected to aid in further product development.

    <description>Descriptive statistics are used to summarize any individual differences between the predicted urine volume from the urine sensor and the true urine volume (by measuring absorbent product weight). A combination of these values will be used to assess the mathematical algorithms for the TENA SmartCare Change Indicator.</description>

    <description>Each participating subject will be provided with Urine Sensor and absorbent products for the duration of the investigation. Nine types of absorbent products will be used to collect real-life measurement data in order to assess the mathematical algorithms involved in the TENA SmartCare Change Indicator. Each participating subject will be allocated to the type(s) that are considered most suitable.
Gateways will be placed in the resident's rooms as well as in common areas, this to enable full measurement registration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is willing and able to provide informed consent and to participate in the
             clinical investigation.

          2. The subject is ≥18 years of age.

          3. The subject is diagnosed with urinary incontinence.

          4. The subject is being cared for at Tre Stiftelser.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has ≥ 4 fecal &quot;incidences&quot; per week.

          2. The subject has severe absorbent product related skin problems, as judged by the
             investigator.
