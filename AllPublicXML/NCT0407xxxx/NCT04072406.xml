  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to week 3</time_frame>
    <description>-10-item measure of globally perceived stress. The measure invites participants to retrospectively report their feelings and thoughts about various topics during the last month, including &quot;how often [you] have felt upset because of something that happened unexpectedly,&quot; &quot;how often [you] have felt that things were going your way,&quot; and &quot;how often [you] could not cope with all the things that you had to do.&quot; Participants rate each item on a scale of 0 (Never) to 5 (Very Often), and a higher score indicates greater stress.</description>
