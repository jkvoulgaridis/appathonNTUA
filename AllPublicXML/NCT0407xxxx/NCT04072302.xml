        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Healthy male subjects,aged 18 to 40 years of age included and in good health as
        determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and laboratory
        tests

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical
             classes.

          -  Known history or current clinically significant ECG abnormalities or arrhythmias.

          -  Symptoms, physical signs and laboratory values suggestive of systemic disorders
             including renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, skin, immunodeficiency,
             psychiatric, or other conditions which could interfere with the interpretation of the
             study results or compromise the health of the subjects.

          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for
             al least 4 weeks after stopping study medication and should not father a child during
             this period.

          -  History of malaria or residence in a malaria-endemic area over a period of 6 months
             before study entry. - Any condition that would, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk or render the subject unable
             to meet requirements of the protocol.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
