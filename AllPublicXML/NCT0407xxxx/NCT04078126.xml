        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be 40 to 80 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the ICF.

          2. Individuals who have a physician diagnosis of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic
             Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)

          3. Require COPD maintenance therapy: all subjects must be receiving 2 or more inhaled
             maintenance therapies, including at least 1 long-acting bronchodilator, for the
             management of their COPD for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

          4. A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC of &lt;0.70 and post-bronchodilator FEV1 of &lt;50% predicted
             normal value during screening (Visit 2).

          5. A pre-bronchodilator PIF of &lt;50 L/min using the InCheck Inspiratory Flow Measurement
             Device set to Turbuhaler S resistance during screening (Visit 2).

          6. Current or former smokers with history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current diagnosis of asthma, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          2. Other respiratory disorders including known active tuberculosis, lung cancer, cystic
             fibrosis, significant bronchiectasis (high resolution CT evidence of bronchiectasis
             that causes repeated acute exacerbations), immune deficiency disorders, severe
             neurological disorders affecting control of the upper airway, sarcoidosis, idiopathic
             interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, or pulmonary
             thromboembolic disease.

          3. A moderate or severe exacerbation of COPD ending within 6 weeks prior to
             randomization.

          4. Need for mechanical ventilation within 3 months prior to screening.
