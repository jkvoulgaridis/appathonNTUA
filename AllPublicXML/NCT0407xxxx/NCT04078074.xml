    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of mandibular occlusal stabilization
      splint (OSS) and modified farrar splint on sleep bruxism and respiratory indices and the
      effects of occlusal splints on the airway volume through imaging.

    <description>Maxillary OSS will be a night guard for the top teeth. Digital impressions will be taken at the first appointment. After delivery appointment the patient will take home a sleep test monitor and bruxism monitor to record respiration and muscle activity during sleep.This will be a 2 night sleep study (Night A will be without splint and Night B will be with splint). Therefore, the patient will sleep with the mouth guard one night and the monitoring device two nights. Subjects will also undergo cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) airway imaging with and without splint.</description>

    <description>Mandibular OSS will be a night guard for the bottom teeth.Digital impressions will be taken at the first appointment. After delivery appointment the patient will take home a sleep test monitor and bruxism monitor to record respiration and muscle activity during sleep.This will be a 2 night sleep study (Night A will be without splint and Night B will be with splint).

    <description>Modified farrar splint will be a night guard for the top teeth that positions and maintains the lower jaw in a more forward position.Digital impressions will be taken at the first appointment. After delivery appointment the patient will take home a sleep test monitor and bruxism monitor to record respiration and muscle activity during sleep. This will be a 2 night sleep study (Night A will be without splint and Night B will be with splint). Therefore, the patient will sleep with the mouth guard one night and the monitoring device two nights. Subjects will also undergo CBCT airway imaging with and without splint.</description>
