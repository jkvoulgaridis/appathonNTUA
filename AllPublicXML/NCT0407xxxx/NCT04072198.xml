  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric single arm, open label trial. In this study patients candidated to a
      first line of chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer will be treated with 8 cycles of
      folfoxiri plus bevacizumab plus nivolumab followed by a maintenance with bevacizumab plus
      nivolumab.

      Patients who do not progress during chemotherapy phase will receive bevacizumab plus
      nivolumab as maintenance therapy.

      Patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      patient/physician decision.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent.

          2. Male or female of 18-75 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer RAS/BRAF mutated.

          4. Initially unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer not previously treated with
             chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

          5. Patients suitable for first line chemotherapy.

          6. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          7. At least one site of measurable disease per RECIST criteria.

          8. Performance status of 0-1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          9. Adequate organ function

         10. Availability at baseline of a representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
             diagnostic tumor specimen, as primary and/or metastatic tumor tissue block or as
             fifteen 5-micron unstained slides are allowed (the neoplastic cell content of each
             tumor sample will be assessed and in those cases with neoplastic cells &lt;50% a
             macro-dissection of the specimen will be performed, if possible).

         11. If DPD status is known it must be wild type. No restriction are applied if DPD status
             in unknown.

         12. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test within 24 hr
             prior to the start of study drug. For this trial, women of childbearing potential are
             defined as all women after puberty, unless they are postmenopausal for at least 12
             months, are surgically sterile, or are sexually inactive.

         13. Subjects and their partners must be willing to avoid pregnancy during the trial and
             until 5 months for WOCBP (Women of Childbearing Potential) and 7 months for male
             subjects with female partners of WOCBP after the last trial treatment. Male subjects
             with female partners of childbearing potential and female subjects of childbearing
             potential must, therefore, be willing to use adequate contraception as approved by the
             investigator (barriers contraceptive measure or oral contraception).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy, excluded patient treated in neo/adjuvant setting at least 12
             months before diagnosis of metastatic disease.

          3. Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          4. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          5. Uncontrolled hypertension and prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive
             encephalopathy.

          6. Systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks of the first dose of nivolumab.

             with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.

         10. Any active or recent history of a known or suspected autoimmune disease or recent
             history of a syndrome that required systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone
             equivalent) or immunosuppressive medications except for syndromes which would not be
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger.

         11. Evidence of interstitial lung disease, active non-infectious pneumonitis, or a history
             of grade 3 or greater pneumonitis.

             arterial thrombosis) within 6 months of study enrolment.

         18. Any previous venous thromboembolism &gt; NCI CTCAE Grade 3.

         19. History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, intra-abdominal abscess or active GI
             bleeding within 6 months prior to the first study treatment.

         20. Current or recent (within 10 days prior to study treatment start) ongoing treatment
             with anticoagulants for therapeutic purposes.

         21. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to study treatment start, or anticipation of the need for major surgical
             procedure during the course of the study.

         22. Presence of colic prosthesis or stent.
