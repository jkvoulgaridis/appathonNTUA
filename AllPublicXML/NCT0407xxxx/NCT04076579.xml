  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trabectedin and olaparib work in treating patients with
      sarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other places in the body. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as trabectedin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing cells, stopping them from dividing or stopping them from spreading.
      Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking pathways responsible for repairing
      damaged cells. Giving trabectedin and olaparib may shrink or stop the tumor from growing.
