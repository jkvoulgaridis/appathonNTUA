      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of caplacizumab on prevention of recurrence of aTTP (proportion of
      participants with a recurrence of aTTP) during the overall study period.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate effect of caplacizumab on

             -  prevention of recurrence of TTP (the number of recurrences of TTP) during overall
                study period.

             -  a composite endpoint consisting of aTTP-related mortality, recurrence of aTTP and
                major thromboembolic events during study drug treatment

             -  restoring platelet counts as a measure of prevention of further microvascular
                thrombosis

             -  refractory disease

             -  biomarkers of organ damage: LDH, cardiac troponin I, serum creatinine

             -  plasma exchange (PE) parameters (days of PE and volume of plasma used), days in
                intensive care unit, days in hospital

             -  cognitive status of Japanese patients

        -  To evaluate safety profile of caplacizumab in Japanese patients

        -  To evaluate effect of caplacizumab on pharmacodynamic (PD) markers in Japanese patients

        -  To evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of caplacizumab in Japanese patients

        -  To evaluate immunogenicity of caplacizumab in Japanese patients
