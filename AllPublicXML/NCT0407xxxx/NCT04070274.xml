      Purpose: Study on the method of lateral nursing and surgical operating tables optimization in
      the calcaneal surgery.

      Method:Design combined surgical operating tables grouped according to the time of clinical
      application.58 patients with lateral calcaneus surgeries are divided into the control group
      of 29 patients and the experimental group with 29 patients. The traditional lateral method
      and calcaneus lateral surgery platforms are separately applied to compare the sliding of the
      affected limb during a surgery, the stability of the position, the difference of the surgical
      instruments fall and the satisfaction of the medical staff.Moreover,30 healthy volunteers are
      selected to experience the comfort level of the two placement methods.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The sliding frequency of the affected limb during a surgery with two methods</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The time patients'surgical position can last for in a surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Necessary position stability is significant.For intraoperative fluoroscopy,surgeons need to keep the injured feet a fixing steady position with the help of different platforms.So,time the steady position can last for is recorded by the investigator separately.</description>

    <measure>The whole satisfaction level of the patients and medical staffs</measure>
    <time_frame>From the beginning of operation till 1 days postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Patients and medical staffs are asked for feelings about the utilization of the new surgical platform.Mark 0 is extreme poor.Mark 10 is very perfect,and the numbers between them are comments of varying degrees.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extra possible adverse effects due to the new surgical platform</measure>
    <time_frame>From the beginning of operation till 24 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Check adverse effects on the basis of influences on respiratory or circulatory systems and damages on patients' nerves or skin.</description>
