  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REM (Rapid Eye Movements) Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by
      episodes of elaborate or violent motor activity during dreams, which can lead to injury and
      sleep disruption in patient and / or his/her spouse. This is due to the loss of the normal
      muscle atonia during REM Sleep. RBD is often associated to neurodegenerative diseases, and
      may even precede them for several years as an early marker. Currently, there is no scale or
      tool for assessing the severity of RBD. Nevertheless, it is crucial to have a tool of
      severity when one wants to study the natural evolution of this disorder, as well as the
      possible effect of a drug in the context of a clinical trial. A Severity Scale of RBD has
      recently been proposed within the International RBD Study Group and an international
      validation study in several languages is being considered.

      The main objective of this study is to validate a new scale of severity of the REM sleep
      behavior disorder (RBD Severity Scale or RBDSS) and to characterize its metrological
      properties, in particular its concurrent validity, internal consistency and reproducibility

      Research involving the human person, non-interventional, category 3

      80 patients with RBD of any etiology (eg Idiopathic RBD, RBD associated with Parkinson's
      Disease, Multiple System Atrophy, Narcolepsy etc.) and their bedpartners (if available) will
      be include in 5 French centers (Clermont-Ferrand, Paris, Nantes, Montpellier et Lyon)

           pre-payed envelop. For the Bed Partners Visit 1 (D0- baseline): duration: 30 minutes

        -  Information of and collection of non opposition

        -  Verification of inclusion / exclusion criteria

        -  Ongoing Treatments

        -  RBD severity scale of the bed partner (RBDSS BP)+ Global Clinical Impression-Severity
           Scale

      Visit 2 (D7- retest) : duration : 20 minutes

        -  Ongoing treatments

        -  RBDSS-BP + Clinical Overall Impression Severity Scale

        -  Patient will be given a Weekly Joint Severity Agenda to be completed together with the
           patient, (wRBDQ) for 4 weeks, plus a copy of the RBDSS-BP + CGI-S-BP

      At home: bedpartners will fill:

      D8 à D36 :

      • Weekly Severity Agenda for 4 weeks, in common with patient

      D36 :

      • RBDSS-BP + Impression Global Clinique-Severity scale These documents will be mailed back in
      a pre-payed envelop.
