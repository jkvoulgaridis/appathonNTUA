  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EUS-guided combined therapy of coilingand 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate in patients with gastric
      varices reduced rebleeding and need for reintervention in comparison to EUS-guided coiling
      alone.The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the primary prophylaxis of
      GOV II and IGV I with the EUS combined therapy versus beta blocker therapy in patients GOV II
      and IGV that have never bleed.

      Gastric variceal bleeding is a severe condition associated with a high mortality. Bleeding
      from varices bleeding will be defined as the occurrence of hematemesis and/or melena
      requiring &gt;2 U of blood or a decrease of 2 gm/dl of hemoglobin if no blood transfusion is
      given, with the confirmed endocopic visualization of GOV II and IGV I.

      The beta blocker therapy is an effective method for the prevention of the first esophageal
      variceal bleeding; however, the efficacy in preventing first gastric variceal bleeding is
      controversial.

      The investigators aimed to compare the efficacy in preventing the first gastric variceal
      bleeding in patients with documented GOV II and IGV I.

    <description>o Beta-blocker (propranolol) will be started at dose of 20 mg twice daily. The principle of incremental dosing was used to achieve the target heart rate for propranolol. The dose will be increased every alternate day to achieve a target heart rate of 55/min or to the maximal dose to 360 mg/day if the medication was well tolerated and the systolic blood pressure was &gt; 90 mm Hg. On the occurrence of intolerable adverse effects, systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg or pulse rate &lt; 55/min, the dose of the medication was decreased step-wise, and eventually stopped if these adverse events persisted. Reintroduction of the medication will be attempted if cessation of the medication did not result in improvement of the reported side-effect.</description>

Patients with Gastric Varices GOV II or IGV I that have never bleed and are of high-risk GV according to Baveno VI consensus will be prophylactically obliterated via the EUS-guided coiling and cyanoacrylate injection. Patients will also be on beta-blocker therapy as indicated in the other group.</description>
