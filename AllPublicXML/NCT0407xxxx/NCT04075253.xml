      This study will evaluate the acute effect of one single bout of high intensity exercise on
      the tendency for ventricular arrhythmia.

      This study is a substudy of a planned study involving participants with an implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), who will be randomly assigned to either take part in a
      exercise program for 12 weeks or serve as control and live as usual (Clinical Trials Unique
      Protocol ID: 2018/1592). In that study all participants will complete an exercise treadmill
      test to determine maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 peak).

      In this study we wish to examine the acute effect of one single bout of high intensity
      exercise (i.e the VO2 peak test) on the tendency for ventricular arrhythmia. The study will
      evaluate changes in ICD-parameters and the number of premature ventricular contractions the
      first 24 hours after VO2 peak testing compared to the average number of the 48 hours prior to
      the test.

      The study will also examine if the acute effect after VO2 peak testing alters after
      completing 12 weeks of aerobic interval training or control respectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ICD and dilated cardiomyopathy or coronary heart disease as cause for
             implantation

          -  ICD implanted at St Olavs hospital, Trondheim

        In case of difficulties with patient inclusion for the study, the criteria might be
        broadened to include patients with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia as cause for
        implantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  inability to accomplish the exercise program due to serious comorbidity or to
             participate in regular training within the next 3 months due to other reasons

          -  signs of severe cardiac ischemia or persistent ventricular tachycardia during
             individualized treadmill O2 peak test, which after individual assessment is to be
             found at risk

          -  comorbidity where endurance training at more than moderate intensity is discouraged

          -  severe cardiac valve disease

          -  planned surgery within the next 3 months

          -  inability to give informed consent
