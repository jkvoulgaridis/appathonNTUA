  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the impact of a long-term light treatment intervention on sleep physiology and
      memory in mild cognitively impaired and mild Alzheimer's disease patients living at home. The
      goal is also to measure the impact of the lighting intervention on caregivers' sleep,
      cognition, depression, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current application proposes to investigate the impact of a long-term light treatment
      intervention on sleep physiology and sleep-dependent cognitive processes in mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The premise is that older
      adults, especially those with cognitive impairment, are often in continuous dim light, which
      leads to circadian misalignment. Circadian misalignment impacts the close relationship
      between homeostatic and circadian processes, which can reduce memory-related sleep features.
      The hypothesis is that a lighting intervention technology (LIT), designed to promote
      circadian entrainment, will improve sleep by aligning the two sleep processes (circadian and
      homeostatic) and, thus improve cognition. In addition to improving patients' lives, LIT has
      the potential to reduce the overnight burden on caregivers. Thus, an exploratory goal is to
      also measure the impact of LIT on caregivers' sleep, cognition, depression, and quality of
      life.

    <measure>Cognition using the Word Pairs Associates (WPA) Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be administered at baseline and the end of weeks 9, 17, 25 and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cognition of the MCI participant will be assessed by the Word Pairs Associate (WPA) task, in which subjects are visually presented with word-nonsense word pairs, to maximize the novel episodic and associative declarative memory demands of the task and minimize the semantic demands of the task. Participants are presented with 48 word-pairs in the evening WPA task session. Recognition tests are assessed both immediately following the encoding session, and delayed during retrieval (24 hours later to avoid circadian confounds). For the test, participants are presented with 40 intact word pairs (leaving off the first and last four pairs to avoid primacy and recency effects), as well as 40 rearranged word pairs (foils). Each word pair is displayed for 3000 milliseconds followed by a response prompt asking for a discrimination of whether the two words were shown together as a pair in the study list.</description>

    <measure>Cognition using the Working Memory (WM) Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be administered at baseline and the end of weeks 9,17, 25 and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cognition of the MCI participant will be assessed by the Working Memory (WM) task, comprised of nine practice and 20 test trials. Participants view a serial visual display of letters and math problems. They are asked to hold the letters in memory while simultaneously determining if the simple math problems are correct. Each of the simple math equation is on the screen for 3000 ms and each letter is presented for 1000 ms. Participants are instructed to press the &quot;M&quot; key with their right hand if the simple math equation is correct and press the &quot;V&quot; key with their left hand if the equation is not correct. Math performance is measured in percent correct. After each trial, a question mark appears on the screen to signal the response period. Participants are asked to enter the letters in the same order they were presented. Participants are tested in the WM task before a night of sleep and 24 hours later. Performance is assessed by calculating Accuracy and Reaction Time (RT).</description>

    <time_frame>Will be administered at baseline and the end of weeks 9, 17, 25 and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cognition of the MCI participant will be assessed utilizing the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive to capture subtler changes in cognitive performance. The ADAS-Cog is the most widely used general cognitive measure in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease.

    <measure>Sleep Quality in the MCI Participant using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be administered at baseline and the end of weeks 9, 17, 25 and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Change in sleep quality of the MCI participant will be assessed utilizing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is composed of 19 items that generate seven component scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction). The sum of the seven component scores yields a single global score. A global score &gt;5 is considered to indicate sleep disturbances. A lower score indicates improvement in sleep quality.</description>

    <description>Change in cognition of the MCI participant will be assessed by utilization of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool. The MoCA is a one-page, 30-point test that can be administered in 10 minutes. It assesses short-term memory, visuospatial abilities, executive functions, attention, concentration and working memory, language, and orientation to time and place. In a validation study, it was shown to be a promising tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease onset compared to the Mini Mental State Exam.</description>

    <description>Change in cognition of the MCI participant will be obtained using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes through semi-structured interviews where cognitive functioning will be rated in six domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The CDR-SOB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores. The CDR-SOB demonstrates good reliability and has been validated against neuropathologic finding.</description>

    <description>Change in depression of the caregiver will be assessed with the Depression using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). This 20-item test measures depressive symptoms, asking how often over the past week participants experienced symptoms associated with depression (restless sleep, poor appetite, feelings of loneliness). A lower score indicates a decrease in depressive symptoms.</description>
