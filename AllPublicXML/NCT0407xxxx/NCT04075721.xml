             and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that in the opinion of the
             Investigator, with concurrence with the Sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured
             with minimal risk of recurrence within 3 years).

             instability per clinical evaluation due to tumor involvement of the Central Nervous
             System

          -  Diagnosis of fever within 1 week prior to study intervention administration
