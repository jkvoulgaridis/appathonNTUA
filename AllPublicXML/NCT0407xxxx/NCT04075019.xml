  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Seattle Social Development Project (SSDP) included a three-part intervention for
      teachers, parents, and students in grades 1 to 6. It was a universal prevention program that
      was tested in elementary schools serving children from high crime urban areas. The
      intervention trained teachers in proactive classroom management, interactive teaching, and
      cooperative learning. SSDP also offered training to parents in child behavior management,
      academic support, and skills to reduce risks for drug use. It provided training to children
      designed to affect interpersonal problem solving and refusal skills. These interventions were
      designed to reduce risks and increase protection at the individual, peer, family and school
      levels. The package of interventions was guided theoretically by the social development
      model. We hypothesized that training teachers to teach and manage their classrooms in ways
      that promote bonding to school, training parents to manage their families in ways that
      promote bonding to family and to school, and providing children with training in skills for
      social interaction would positively affect children's attitudes toward school, behavior at
      school, and academic achievement. These methods further sought to reduce children's
      opportunities and rewards for antisocial involvement. We thought that these changes would, in
      turn, set children on a different developmental trajectory observable in higher school
      achievement and fewer health-risk behaviors later in adolescence.

      The study asked whether delivering the intervention package over the full course of
      elementary school from grades 1 through 6 (&quot;full intervention&quot;) had effects on academic and
      behavioral health outcomes; whether delivering the intervention just prior to adolescence in
      grades 5 and 6 only (&quot;late intervention&quot;) had effects on academic and behavioral health
      outcomes; and whether offering parenting interventions only when participants were in grades
      5 and 6 (&quot;parenting only intervention&quot;) had effects on academic and behavioral health
      outcomes when compared with outcomes for students who were not assigned to intervention
      classrooms. This study examined this question by comparing outcomes for four separate groups,
      a &quot;full intervention group&quot; exposed to the interventions through grades 1-6, a &quot;late
      intervention group&quot; exposed to the interventions only in grades 5 and 6, a minimal
      &quot;parent-training only group&quot; (grades 5 and 6), and a control group that received no special
      intervention. The intervention package consisted of the following components:

      Teacher Training In Classroom Instruction and Management included training in (a) proactive
      classroom management (establish consistent classroom expectations and routines at the
      beginning of the year; give clear, explicit instructions for behavior; recognize and reward
      desirable student behavior and efforts to comply; use methods that keep minor classroom
      disruptions from interrupting instruction); (b) interactive teaching (assess and activate
      foundation knowledge before teaching; teach to explicit learning objectives; model skills to
      be learned; frequently monitor student comprehension as material is presented; re-teach
      material when necessary); and (c) cooperative learning (involve small teams of students of
      different ability levels and backgrounds as learning partners; provide recognition to teams
      for academic improvement of individual members over past performance). Teacher training was
      provided to teachers of participants in full intervention classrooms in grades 1 through 6
      and to teachers of participants in late intervention classrooms in grades 5 and 6.

      Child Social and Emotional Skill Development included instruction in (a) interpersonal
      problem solving skills (communication; decision making; negotiation; conflict resolution)
      provided by teachers in classrooms assigned to the full intervention condition in grades 1
      and 2; and (b) refusal skills (recognize social influences to engage in problem behaviors;
      identify consequences of problem behaviors; generate and suggest alternatives; invite peer(s)
      to join in alternatives) provided to participants in both the full intervention condition and
      the late intervention condition in grades 5 and 6.

      Parent Training offered to parents of participants in the full intervention condition
      included instruction in (a) behavior management skills (observe and pinpoint desirable and
      undesirable child behaviors; teach expectations for behaviors; provide consistent positive
      reinforcement for desired behavior; provide consistent and moderate consequences for
      undesired behaviors) when participants were in grades 1 and 2; (b) academic support skills
      (initiate conversation with teachers about children's learning; help children develop reading
      and math skills; create a home environment supporting of learning) when participants were in
      grades 2 and 3; and (c) skills to reduce risks for drug use (establish a family policy on
      drug use; practice refusal skills with children; use self-control skills to reduce family
      conflict; create new opportunities in the family for children to contribute and learn) when
      participants were in grades 5 and 6. Parent training in skills to reduce risks for drug use
      was also offered to parents of participants in the late intervention condition and the
      parenting only condition when participants were in grades 5 and 6.

      This resulted in a nonrandomized controlled trial with 4 conditions. The full intervention
      group received the intervention package from grade 1 through grade 6. The late intervention
      group received the intervention package in grades 5 and 6 only. The parent intervention only
      condition included students in schools assigned to receive only parent training in skills to
      reduce risks for drug use when their children were in grades 5 and 6, and the control group
      received no special intervention. This design was created in 1985 by nesting an intervention
      initiated in 1981 at first-grade entry within the clinical trial. For the present study,
      schools were assigned nonrandomly to conditions in the fall of 1985, and from that point, all
      fifth-grade students in the full and late intervention conditions participated in the same
      interventions. New schools added for the clinical trial when students entered grade 5 were
      matched to the original intervention and control schools with respect to grades served and
      inclusion of students drawn from high-crime neighborhoods of Seattle. Schools added for the
      panel study were assigned to conditions to achieve balanced numbers across conditions. During
      this study the Seattle School District used mandatory busing to achieve racial equality in
      schools. As a result, all schools in this study served heterogeneous population of students
      drawn from at least 2 different neighborhoods of the city. This practice reduced the risk
      that outcomes observed in the trial reflected contextual or neighborhood differences in the
      populations attending different schools.
