  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional lower gastrointestinal disorder characterised by
      abdominal pain and altered bowel habit in the absence of organic pathology to explain the
      symptoms. Irritable bowel syndrome has a prevalence of approximately 10% in adults, shows a
      female preponderance, and is more common in younger individuals. In clinical practice,
      Irritable bowel syndrome accounts for almost a third of all gastroenterology cases seen in
      primary care, with a subsequent third of these being referred onto secondary-care for further
      evaluation. The economic burden of Irritable bowel syndrome, in terms of medical expense,
      work absenteeism and loss of productivity, is considerable.

      The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome is unknown. Accordingly there has been a huge
      surge in interest for dietary therapies to help manage Irritable bowel syndrome. To date,
      there are only a handful of small randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of
      dietary therapy in Irritable bowel syndrome. In light of this we plan to conduct the first
      randomized controlled trial directly comparing the effectiveness of the low-FODMAP diet,
      British Dietetic Association diet, and the gluten free diet in Irritable bowel syndrome.
      Moreover, such a trial allows for a direct comparison of nutritional and gut microbial
      changes, both of which can suffer detrimental consequences following the implementation of
      restrictive dietary therapies. This study is also unique in that it takes into consideration
      the patients' perspective with regards to the convenience and cost-effectiveness of
      implementing such diets into routine day-to-day life. The study will aim to recruit 100
      patients from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals gastrointestinal clinics. Following recruitment
      patients will be seen by a hospital dietitian where they will be randomized to one of the 3
      diets. Participants will complete a questionnaire portfolio weekly for one month as part of
      the study

    <description>A validated questionnaire to assess IBS symptoms and severity. The ranges of this questionnaire are included below:
How severe was your pain? 0 (no pain) -100 (very severe)
how severe is your abdominal (tummy) pain? 0 (no pain) - 100 (very severe)
how severe is your abdominal distention/tightness? 0 (no pain) - 100 (very severe)
How satisfied are you with your bowel habit? 0 (very happy) - 100 (very unhappy)
Please indicate with a cross on the line below how much your irritable bowel syndrome is affecting or interfering with your life in general. 0 (not at all) - 100 (completely)
a higher score on any scale represents a negative outcome.</description>
