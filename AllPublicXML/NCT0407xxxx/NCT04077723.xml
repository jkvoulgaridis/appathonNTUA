  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of RO7227166 in participants with relapsed/refractory
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (r/r NHL). RO7227166 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion
      in combination with obinutuzumab and in combination with glofitamab. A fixed dose of
      obinutuzumab (Gpt; pre-treatment) will be administered seven days prior to the first
      administration of RO7227166 and seven days prior to the first administration of glofitamab.
      This entry-into-human study is divided into a dose-escalation stage (Part I and Part II) and
      a dose expansion stage (Part III).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Depending upon study part: a history or status of a histologically-confirmed
             hematological malignancy that is expected to express CD19 and CD20; relapse after or
             failure to respond to at least one prior treatment regimen; and no available treatment
             options that are expected to prolong survival

          -  Must have at least one measureable target lesion (&gt;/= 1.5 cm) in its largest dimension
             by computed tomography scan

          -  Able and willing to provide a fresh biopsy from a safely accessible site, per
             Investigator's determination, providing the participant has more than one measurable
             target lesion

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;/= 12 weeks

          -  Adverse events from prior anti-cancer therapy must have resolved to Grade &lt;/= 1

          -  Negative test results for hepatitis C virus and HIV

          -  The contraception and abstinence requirements are intended to prevent exposure of an
             embryo to the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence for male and/or
             female enrollment eligibility needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the
             clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug exposure

          -  Female participants: A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not
             pregnant and not breastfeeding, and if at least one of the following applies: women of
             non-childbearing potential (WONCBP); women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) who
             agree to remain abstinent or use two highly effective contraceptive methods with a
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 18 months
             after obinutuzumab or 3.5 months after the last dose of RO7227166, 2 months after last
             dose of glofitamab, or 3 months after the last dose of tocilizumab, whichever is
             longer. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
             bilateral tubal occlusion/ ligation, male sexual partner who is sterilized,
             established proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation,
             hormone-releasing intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine devices. Hormonal
             contraceptive methods must be supplemented by a barrier method; have a negative
             pregnancy test (blood) within the 7 days prior to the first study treatment
             administration

          -  Male participants: During the treatment period and for at least 3 months after
             obinutuzumab, or 2 months after the last dose of RO7227166, glofitamab, or tocilizumab
             whichever is longer, agreement to: Remain abstinent or use contraceptive measures such
             as a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure
             rate of &lt; 1% per year, with a partner who is a women of childbearing potential. With
             pregnant female partner, remain abstinent or use contraceptive measures such as a
             condom to avoid exposing the embryo; refrain from donating sperm during this same
             period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Circulating lymphoma cells, defined by out of range (high) absolute lymphocyte count

          -  Participants with acute bacterial, viral, or fungal infection at baseline, confirmed
             by a positive blood culture within 72 hours prior to obinutuzumab infusion or by
             clinical judgment in the absence of a positive blood culture

          -  Participants with known active infection, or reactivation of a latent infection,
