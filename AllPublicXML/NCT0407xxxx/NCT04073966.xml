  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are a source of much morbidity and mortality in adults with primary solid
      malignant tumors. With improvements in systemic therapy that prolong survival but have
      limited central nervous system penetration, patients with brain metastases are at increasing
      risk of developing and experiencing long-term side effects from treatment of brain
      metastases. The overarching goal of this study is to better understand the determinants of
      RT-associated changes in white and gray matter function and associated neurocognitive
      decline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to provide novel and useful information for clinicians, both to help
      predict potential neurocognitive changes following SRS, and as a possible guide for SRS
      treatment alteration, whether through adjustment of dose or beam arrangements in relation to
      white matter tracts. In this observational pilot study of 20 patients, the association
      between RT-associated brain injury and neurocognitive function will be quantitatively
      assessed longitudinally over one year following SRS. The study team hypothesizes that, over
      this time, (1) there will be radiation dose-dependent reductions in regional white matter
      tract integrity and reduction in functional connectivity in the default mode network of gray
      matter, (2) there will be measurable decline in neurocognitive function, and (3) there will
      be an association between severity of radiation-induced brain injury on MRI and magnitude of
      neurocognitive functional decline. This association will relate, in part, to the location(s)
      affected.
