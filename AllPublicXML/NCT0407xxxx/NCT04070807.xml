  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center retrospective observational study. Every patient with Acute Myeloid
      Leukemia (AML) treated with anti-B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) treatment outside clinical trial
      from 1st January 2015 up to 01 April 2019 may be included in this study. No additional
      drug/procedures/patient visits in comparison with the usual clinical practice are planned for
      the study. The decision to treat patient with ant-BCL2 inhibitors is made by the physician
      based on his clinical judgment, independently from the decision to include the patient in
      this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In phase 1-2 studies, anti BCL-2 treatment has shown evidence of anti-leukemic activity as
      single agent and in combination and proved to be particularly effective in providing a deep
      response, with an acceptable safety profile. Since 2015 anti-BCL2 treatment has been
      available in other indications and in off-label use in Italy.

      In this non-interventional retrospective study, toxicity, effectiveness and costs assessment
      data will be collected from patients with AML, to improve the knowledge about anti-BCL2
      treatment in clinical practice. Collecting and analyzing data from a large unbiased
      patient-set receiving anti-BCL2, would enlarge our knowledge on therapies inhibiting BCL2.

      This is a multi-center retrospective observational study. Every patient with AML treated with
      anti-BCL2 treatment outside clinical trial from 1st January 2015 up to 01 April 2019 may be
      included in this study. No additional drug/procedures/patient visits in comparison with the
      usual clinical practice are planned for the study. The decision to treat patient with
      ant-BCL2 inhibitors is made by the physician based on his clinical judgment, independently
      from the decision to include the patient in this study. As this study is intended to be
      purely observational (not interventional), the patient's medical records will be the source
      of all data to be recorded. No additional procedures/patient visits should be planned in the
      study with respect to clinical practice.

      Clinical data (treatment, survival, adverse events) will be collected for patients enrolled.
