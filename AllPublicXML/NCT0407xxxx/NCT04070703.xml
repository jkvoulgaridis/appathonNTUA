      The primary aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of a cognitively enhanced exercise
      intervention - Tai Ji Quan: Moving to Maintain Brain Health, relative to a standard Tai Ji
      Quan intervention and an exercise stretching control, in improving global cognitive function
      and dual-task ability among community-dwelling older adults with amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment.

    <description>Change in quality of life from baseline to 24 weeks. The EQ-5D-3L version will be used that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The scores of EQ-5D-3L will be combined to generate a single utility value ranging from 1.00 for the &quot;best health&quot; state to -0.594 for the &quot;worst health&quot; state, where a score of 0 is indicative of death, and scores less than 0 are considered as &quot;worse than death.&quot; Participants who die during the trial period will be registered as 0 in utility terms for the assessment period from when the death occurred.</description>
