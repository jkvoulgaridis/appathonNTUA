  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overconsumption of carbohydrates has been implicated as a cause of significant public health
      problems including obesity and diabetes. The most effective approach to alter dietary pattern
      and improve public health is unknown. Gradual and abrupt changes in dietary pattern have been
      tried in small, uncontrolled trials, but it is not clear which approach is most effective.
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate different approaches to changing dietary
      pattern for altering flavor perception in foods and beverages and for altering preference for
      flavor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This comprehensive, well-controlled diet study aims to evaluate and compare different
      approaches to alter dietary pattern, especially macronutrient profile. The investigators
      propose a prospective, randomized trial that is designed to overcome the above limitations to
      test the hypothesis that changing dietary macronutrient profile can change taste perception
      and food preference. Data from this study will provide information that policy makers,
      regulators, and the food industry can use to develop successful approaches (gradual or
      otherwise) for providing healthy diets in the marketplace.
