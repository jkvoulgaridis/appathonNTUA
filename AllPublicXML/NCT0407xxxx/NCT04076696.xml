  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that will evaluate the utility of a scatter reduction technique in reducing
      dose and increasing the sensitivity of stationary digital chest tomosynthesis (s-DCT) in the
      detection of lung lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Digital tomosynthesis is an imaging modality that produces 3D sectional information using
      x-ray projections acquired over a limited scanning angle. Scatter is known to be the primary
      source of image degradation in x-ray based imaging.

      The investigators have developed an approach that measures scatter through a low dose (3% of
      the conventional scan) scatter measurement technique. Preliminary studies have shown that
      scatter reduction in DCT can significantly improve quality. The approach will characterize
      the reader confidence in lung nodule detection in a scatter corrected chest tomosynthesis
      imaging approach as compared to the conventional chest tomosynthesis.

      Fifty (50) patients who have undergone a clinical non-contrast CT with lung nodules will be
      asked to have an s-DCT (scan) within 4 weeks (+/- 2 week) of their clinical CT with no
      intervening procedures or therapies (i.e. biopsy of lung nodules). Investigators will then
      perform a reader study to evaluate the radiologist reader confidence in images generated from
      the scatter reduction technique versus more conventional chest tomosynthesis imaging.

    <description>The study scan, s-DCT and correction scan, will be performed within two weeks of the patient's clinical evaluations by chest CT and x-ray. The study scan may be done within 2 weeks prior or two weeks following standard of care imaging. There cannot be any intervening therapies or procedures (i.e. biopsy or excision of lesions) done in between the standard of care (SOC) imaging and the s-DCT. All patients will have a breath held s-DCT scan in an anterior-posterior direction.</description>
