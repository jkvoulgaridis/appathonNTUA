  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes contributes significantly to the burden of disease in Norway and cardiovascular
      disease is the main cause of mortality.

      Both lean and fatty fish are shown to have beneficial health effects. In addition to omega-3
      fatty acids, fish contain potential health-promoting components such as taurine, vitamin D,
      vitamin B12, iodine, selenium and more unspecified components such as bioactive peptides.
      With the expected growth in the aquaculture sector, more protein-rich by-products will become
      available.

      The overall aim of this project is to investigate physiological and molecular effects of fish
      protein in the form of salmon fishmeal compared to whey in a human intervention study with
      regard to carbohydrate- and fat metabolism, endocrine factors and inflammation.

      The investigators will include healthy subjects to a randomized controlled cross over study.
      The subjects will receive a single, oral dose of fishmeal or whey. Blood samples are taken
      before (fasting) and 30 and 60 minutes after intake. The molecular effects of fishmeal and
      whey are investigated ex vivo. This is done by incubating human cell lines (i.e hepatocytes,
      adipocytes, epithelial cells) with fasting and postprandial serum from the participants.
