    <textblock>
      The study is a Prospective, Randomized, Non-Inferiority Trial to Determine the Safety and
      Efficacy of the BA9™ Drug Coated Balloon for the Treatment of In-Stent Restenosis. It is a
      First-in-Man Trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will serve as a first-in-human (FIH) experience for the BA9™ DCB in a
      population of patients with coronary artery disease who have an indication for interventional
      treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR) in a bare-metal stent (BMS) or drug-eluting stent
      (DES).

      The study uses a prospective, multi-center, single blind, randomized controlled trial design
      to enroll 195 patients. The study will seek to prove that the BA9-DCB is non-inferior to the
      approved CE marked Sequent Please® Paclitaxel Coated Balloon with respect to % Diameter
      Stenosis and has similar safety characteristics.

    <description>A non-surgical procedure that uses a catheter to place a semi-compliant angioplasty drug coated balloon to open up coronary arteries that have been narrowed by atherosclerosis. The balloon is inflated to treat the stenosis and transfer the drug to arterial wall, and then is deflated and withdrawn.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting with in-stent restenosis (ISR) and clinical symptoms of ischemia
             and/or (i) evidence of ischemia on non-invasive testing or (ii) hemodynamically
             relevant lesion defined by FFR ≤ 0.80 or iFR ≤ 0.89 or &gt; 90% stenosis.

          -  Patient presenting with a lesion that can be fully covered with one DCB length. -
             Patients can have up to two index lesions with ISR, which can both be treated and
             evaluated.

          -  Patient has provided written informed consent

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the study procedures and follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient presents with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or had an acute MI
             within 48 hours prior to presentation (according to the universal definition of
             myocardial infarction).

          -  Patient has an ISR lesion that cannot be covered with one DCB length.

          -  Patient has an ISR in the target segment in a stent of a smaller diameter than 2.5mm.

          -  Severe calcification that might prevent a sufficient expansion of the DCB, if not
             pre-treated with rotablation or a shockwave application device.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to biolimus, paclitaxcel, aspirin,

          -  Pregnant and/or breast-feeding females or females who intend to become pregnant during
             the time of the study.

          -  Subject currently enrolled in other investigational device or drug trial in which the

          -  Anticipated difficulties to complete the angiographic follow-up study.

          -  Patient with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.

          -  Patients lacking mental capacity (i.e. patients suffering from dementia and others) to
