  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neuromodulation device that is FDA-approved for
      use in treating depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. TMS works by applying a safe,
      electromagnetic field on the scalp, which can either increase or decrease neuronal
      communication and activity (depending on the mode of stimulation). Although it is only
      approved for two disorders, there has been substantial research into the potential of TMS to
      treat a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders (SUDs).
      This project aims to develop an initial TMS protocol in a sample of healthy controls and to
      establish the feasibility and efficacy of using repetitive TMS (rTMS) to impact several
      carefully-selected cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic measures. This pilot project will
      enable the research team to gather baseline data using this new method and to plan
      longer-term programmatic studies focusing on populations with SUDs. The overarching aim of
      this project is to develop an rTMS protocol for use in the human laboratory setting with both
      healthy controls and individuals with SUDs. The investigators also hope to learn about the
      impact of high frequency rTMS over the DLPFC on multiple aspects of functioning including:
      cognitive control, impulsivity, thermal pain sensitivity, motivation, and mood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The short-term goal of this pilot project is to establish the feasibility and efficacy of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on cognitive, behavioral, and
      physiological measures in a healthy community-recruited sample to plan longer-term
      programmatic studies focusing on substance use disorder (SUD) populations. Primary Aims are
      to examine the effect of one session of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) rTMS
      high-frequency (10 Hz) stimulation vs. placebo stimulation (no electromagnetic field but
      similar auditory and tactile sensations) on: (1) cognitive control, (2), impulsivity, and (3)
      thermal pain sensitivity. Secondary Aims are to test effects of rTMS on behavioral motivation
      (monetary incentive delay task, effort choice task), mood (PANAS), peripheral biomarkers
      (prolactin, BDNF) and collect biosamples for future genotyping.

      The investigators recognize the proposed sample size is relatively small to adequately power
      a full analysis across all outcomes, so will use this study to determine effect sizes for any
      differences to plan future studies with adequate power. Generally speaking, data will be
      analyzed using repeated measures ANCOVAs; covariates will include TMS resting motor
      threshold, sex, and age. Based on sample size calculations, the investigators intend to
      complete up to 30 subjects. For some outcomes, the results of previous studies indicate that
      a lower sample size may be appropriate, therefore the investigators will conduct interim
      analyses at n=18 to calculate effect sizes to determine how many more participants are
      needed.

    <description>Active rTMS will be applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using an active figure of 8 coil (within-subject crossover). In the active rTMS condition, the investigators will use high-frequency (10Hz) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) stimulation with intensity of 110% of resting motor threshold. rTMS will consist of 120 trains with 50 stimuli per train (i.e. 5-sec long at 10 Hz) and 10-sec intertrain interval for a total of 6000 pulses. The entire protocol will last 30 min (120 trains with 5-sec on/10-sec off).</description>

    <description>The investigators will use the Figure of 8 coil, which affects ~10cm2 of cortical surface. The active condition will deliver stimulation at 110% of resting motor threshold (RMT). To determine RMT, the protocol will be: 10 trials of single-pulse TMS on the scalp position of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (which controls thumb flexion); RMT is the lowest TMS power setting yielding visible motor contraction on &gt;50% of trials.</description>

We note that, &quot;NIH recognizes that the investigators who collected the data have a legitimate interest in benefiting from their investment of time and effort. NIH continues to expect that the initial investigators may benefit from first and continuing use but not from prolonged exclusive use.&quot; The research team (PI, with advice from co-investigators) plans to share data from this project as follows. We will disseminate data using conventional means including published abstracts, conference presentations (posters and talks), news releases, and peer reviewed journal articles.</ipd_description>
