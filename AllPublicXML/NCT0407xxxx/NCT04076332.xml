      Shared decision-making helps patients to establish a treatment plan with clinicians together.
      Our goal was to determine if the tools we developed could reduced decisional conflict for

      Shared decision-making helps patients to establish a treatment plan with clinicians together.
      Our goal was to determine if the tools we developed could reduced decisional conflict for
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

      Inclusion criteria: include obstructive sleep apnea patient from the outpatient clinic of
      Dean Wu, the sleep center of Shuang-He Hospital, 20-80 years old, polysomnography showed
      moderate severity (AHI ≥ 15), can communicate in Chinese.

      Exclusion criteria: dementia, mental illness, language difficulties.

    <description>We'd like to measure the score of SURE test, which published by Légaré at 2008, as a decisional conflict scale. SURE includes 4 questions representing &quot;sure of myself, understand information, risk-benefit ratio, encouragement&quot;. Each question consisted of a typical five-level Likert item (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree).</description>

    <description>Self-evaluation score of health literacy. We measure health literacy via one question of SURE test (Sure of myself - Do you feel SURE about the best choice for you?). This question also consisted of a typical five-level Likert item (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree).</description>
