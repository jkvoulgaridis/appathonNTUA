  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV/AIDS is the second leading cause of death in Africa. Adolescents living with HIV (ALWH)
      are at increased risk for HIV-related morbidity and mortality due to poor retention in HIV
      care and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Despite having the world's
      largest population of ALWH (15-24 years, n=870,000), only 14% of South African ALWH are on
      ART, 12% are retained in HIV care 1-2 years after ART initiation, and 10% are virally
      suppressed. During treatment interruption, the effects of ART quickly reverse, increasing
      transmission risk, treatment resistance, and potentially fatal complications. Unless their
      treatment retention and adherence improves, ALWH will continue to transmit the virus to their
      sexual partners and die prematurely.

      While social support is often viewed as a bridge that joins ALWH to key resources within
      their environments, little is known about which types of social support are most impactful
      and from whom within their network, particularly among ALWH in endemic countries. Moreover,
      many South African ALWH lack social support from key social network members due to lack of
      HIV status disclosure, increasing their risk for poorer HIV-related outcomes when compare to
      their disclosed peers. Social network interventions (i.e., those that leverage the resources
      within one's network to improve behaviors and outcomes) that meet the needs of both ALWH who
      are disclosed and non-disclosed are needed, but lacking. Such inventions have the potential
      to facilitate appraisal support, during which ALWH receive targeted assistance with
      identifying appropriate and trustworthy people in their lives. More broadly, there exists a
      lack empirically supported interventions aimed at improving retention in HIV care and ART
      adherence for ALWH in low-middle income countries.

      This proposal follows the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), a comprehensive framework
      for optimizing and evaluating multicomponent behavioral interventions.

      This K08 focuses on the preparation phase, which consists of compiling information from
      various sources, including behavioral theory, scientific literature, secondary analyses of
      existing data, and formative research to inform a theoretical model. This model guides
      intervention-related decisions, such as the selection of intervention components. Piloting of
      intervention components and the identification and operationalization of an optimization
      criterion also occur in this phase. The investigators will first use social network analyses
      to elucidate network characteristics that influence ALWHs' retention and adherence (Aim 1),
      then use participatory methods to inform intervention development (Aim 2), and lastly assess
      intervention acceptability, feasibility, safety and evidence of efficacy (Aim 3). Aim 3 is
      the clinical trial component and described in detail below. Aim 1 will determine how ALWHs'
      social networks influence their retention in HIV care and ART adherence and Aim 2 will then
      focus on the development of a network-based, social support intervention to improve ALWH
      retention in HIV care and ART adherence informed by Aim 1 and other relevant information.

      The goal of aim 3 is to assess intervention acceptability, feasibility, safety and evidence
      of efficacy through open piloting. The investigators will assess intervention acceptability,
      feasibility, safety, and evidence of efficacy using an iterative process enabling feedback
      and continuing quality improvement over the course of implementation. This approach involves
      the piloting of the network intervention developed in Aim 2. The rationale is that the best
      interventions for ALWH will consider their unique needs and include tailored components. The
      outcome of this Aim will be a feasible and acceptable social network intervention that will
      be tested in an adaptive intervention using future grant funding. The hypothesis for aim 3 is
      that the intervention will be acceptable, feasible, and safe, with trends towards improved
      ALWH retention in HIV care and ART adherence.

    <description>The intervention is a network-based, social support intervention to improve ALWH retention in HIV care and ART adherence. The specific intervention will be developed during Aim 2 of the study and uses qualitative findings, along with data from Aim 1, to develop an interventions that integrates participant feedback and borrows components from two existing interventions: Masivukeni and LIFECommunity.</description>
