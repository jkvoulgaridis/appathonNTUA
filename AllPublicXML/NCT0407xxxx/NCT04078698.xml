      The objective of the study is the documentation of the safety and effectiveness profile of
      the CE-labeled immunoadsorbers GLOBAFFIN®, LIGASORB® and IgEnio® in clinical routine
      according to their intended use.

      The primary objective for the IgG adsorber GLOBAFFIN® and LIGASORB® is the estimation of the
      mean relative reduction in total IgG from pre- to post-treatment per treatment session. The
      primary objective for the IgE adsorber IgEnio® is the estimation of the mean relative
      reduction in total IgE from pre- to post-treatment per treatment session.
