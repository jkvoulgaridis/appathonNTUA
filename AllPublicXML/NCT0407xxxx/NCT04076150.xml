      The TAVI (Thubrikar Aortic Valve, Inc.) -1 Study: Safety and Performance Study of the Optimum
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve- First-in-human study to assess feasibility and safety of the
      Optimum Aortic Valve Implant
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and performance of the Optimum TAV
      (Transcatheter Aortic Valve) in patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who are
      deemed high-risk for SAVR (Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement) or have contraindications or
      deemed inoperable for SAVR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and capable to provide informed consent;

          2. 70 years of age or older;

          3. Echocardiographic or hemodynamic based evidence of calcific (senile) aortic stenosis
             with one of the following: aortic valve Effective Orifice Area (EAO) ≤ 1.0 cm2 or 0.6
             cm2/m2, mean aortic valve gradient ≥35 mmHg or peak aortic valve velocity &gt; 4 m/sec.

          4. Symptomatology due to native aortic stenosis resulting in a New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) functional classification of II or greater.

          5. Aortic valve annular diameter ≥ 21 and ≤ 23mm measured by MSCT (Multi-Slice Computed
             Tomography).

          6. A STS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons) score ≥ 8; or Logistic EuroScore I ≥ 15; or a
             determination by the local heart team that the co-morbidities not captured by the STS
             or EuroScore are expected to increase the operative mortality risk to &gt; 15%.

          7. Geographically available and willing to comply with follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

         14. Unfavorable peripheral vascular anatomy or disease (e.g. severe obstructive
             calcification, severe tortuosity or small vessels) that would preclude passage of
             catheters from the femoral arterial access to the aorta as evidenced by peripheral
             MSCT;

         15. Gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 30 days; *

         16. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within past 3 months;*

         17. Renal insufficiency as demonstrated by a serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL;

         18. End stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis;

         20. Need for emergent surgery or intervention other than the investigational procedure;

         21. Hypersensitivity or contraindication to procedural medication(s) and device
             material(s) (e.g. titanium, nickel, pork) which cannot be adequately pre-medicated;

         22. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due to non-cardiac co-morbid conditions;

         23. Currently participating in any other investigational drug or device study;

         24. Patient lacking capacity to provide informed consent (history of any cognitive or
             mental health status that would interfere with study participation)

         25. Subject found to have an International Normalized Ratio (INR) greater than 2.0 right
             before the procedure.

               -  At the time of procedure, if a subject's medical status has changed since
