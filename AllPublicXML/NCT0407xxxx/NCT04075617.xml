  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the use of electronic habit reminder and palatal crib in
      the cessation of thumb/finger sucking habit.

      Treatment of thumb/finger sucking by extraoral approaches are well accepted by school-age
      children (Adair, 1999). It was reported in a case study by Krishnappa et al that the use of
      an extraoral electronic habit reminder is a new method used for cessation of thumb/finger
      sucking habit in short time and it is more comfortable and acceptable to the child
      (Krishnappa et al, 2016).

      This study will be conducted in, Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department,
      Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University. Diagnosis and patient selection will be at outpatient
      clinic in the specific days of diagnosis. Impression taking, delivery of appliances and
      follow up will be at post graduate clinic under supervision of the main and assistant
      supervisor.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to form two groups, Intervention group: Treatment by
      using electronic habit reminder which will be constructed by taking impression for the
      thumb/finger using silicon impression material (putty consistency) and pouring it with dental
      stone. The replica of the finger is used to formulate a custom made cover for it, which
      consists of stainless steel wires with specific design and acrylic resin this is the first
      part of the reminder. The second part is in the shape of wrist watch which is connected to
      the first part by a wire. When the child puts his finger in his mouth the stainless steel
      wires touch each other and the watch produces alarming sound and counts how many times the
      alarm goes off. The child should wear the appliance most of the time except during eating and
      activities.

      Control group: Treatment by using palatal crib which will be constructed by taking impression
      for upper arch with alginate impression material, and then will be sent to the lab for
      fabrication. Cementation of the appliance and then follow up.

      Follow up will be at two weeks and 1, 3, 6 months.

    <time_frame>6 monthes</time_frame>
    <description>cessation of thumb/finger sucking habit is by asking the parent in every appointment during the follow up period if the notice that their child has stopped the habit or at least there is decrease in the duration</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>child acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 monthes</time_frame>
    <description>Child acceptance is simply by asking the child if he/she comfortable/happy with the appliance. The answer is by yes/no</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>parental acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 monthes</time_frame>
    <description>Parental acceptance, there is a questionnaire will be handed to the parent at the end of the treatment period to assess if they found that the device was easy to use, instructions was helpful, the appliance helped in the cessation of the habit and if they will recommend it to others all these questions will be answered by scale (very/somewhat/neutral /minimally/not).And the parents can list if there were any problems they faced with the appliance</description>
