    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify immunological mechanisms that contribute to
      normalization of liver inflammation in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients starting the
      antiviral nucleoside analogue, Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).

      Investigator-initiated, phase 4 study in which recruited patients will receive, TAF 25mg once
      daily, for 48 weeks (Figure 1 and Table 1). The total duration of the study to End of
      Follow-up (EOF) will be 48 weeks. After Week 48, participants will be offered 2 years of TAF
      therapy. Sample collection 0, 12, 24 w was chosen to analyze immune responses based on ALT
      normalization rates. This mono-center study will be conducted at Toronto Centre for Liver
      Disease, Canada.
