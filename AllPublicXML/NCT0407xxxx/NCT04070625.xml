      This study aims to evaluate, in communication tasks, the pragmatic effectiveness of the
      communication book in the general conditions of use and its maintenance in the implementation
      of the compensatory strategies of communication in severe aphasias.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data from the literature have demonstrated the effectiveness of speech therapy in aphasic
      vascular. In the face of sequelae, particularly in the most serious aphasia, a palliative
      approach aims to increase the functional effectiveness of communication in everyday life. The
      communication book has been developed in this perspective, addressing aphasics whose language
      communication skills are greatly reduced. Early use in this trial is warranted by
      implantation prior to the onset of potentially deleterious compensatory mechanisms seen in
      the late-stage aphasic sequelae.

      This study aims to evaluate, in communication tasks, the pragmatic effectiveness of the
      communication book in the general conditions of use and its maintenance in the implementation
      of the compensatory strategies of communication in severe aphasias.

        Patients will be recruited from the six participating neurological rehabilitation centers,
        each of which has significant recruitment of aphasic subjects and has a specialized team in
        the management of language disorders.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent after information. Information is also given to the person of trust
             when it exists.

          -  aphasic subjects admitted to hospital or seen in consultation following a 1st ischemic

          -  residual ability to understand clinical assessments and informed consent; information
             about the objectives and the procedure of the research will also be given to the

          -  motor capacity for comfortable sitting and transfers with help

          -  affiliation to health insurance

          -  no deficits in visual perceptual tests (researched using the visual decision of
             objects and Montreal protocol for the evaluation of visual gnosis), which allows the
             use of the communication book,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  refusal or impossibility of consent

          -  pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  administration after the occurrence of stroke of a product for which an effect on the
             recovery of aphasia has been reported: piracetam, bromocriptine, donepezil,
             dextroamphetamine (if treatment with these products has been performed, inclusion is
             possible after a weaning period of 15 days)

          -  simultaneous inclusion in another therapeutic protocol of language disorders
