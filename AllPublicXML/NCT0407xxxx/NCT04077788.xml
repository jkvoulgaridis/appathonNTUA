  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical experiences have shown that significant pain regression during a menstrual cycle has
      been often achieved by the use of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) indicated in women with
      primary dysmenorrhea with coexisting functional disorders of lumbosacral (LS) spine. Namely,
      by activation of the nociceptive and vegetative system, LS spine disorders, before all
      segmental dysfunction and degenerative changes, can induce referred pain and reflex
      disturbances of pelvic organs (somatovisceral reflexes). Since significant improvement or
      disappearance of pain during a menstrual cycle is often achieved with adequate therapy of
      coexisting vertebral disorders in women with primary dysmenorrhea, it is important to
      recognise latent or manifest vertebral disorders in dysmenorrheic women using clinical
      examination (Grgić, 2009).

    <description>ain will be assessed by visual analogue scale. It is 10 cm horizontal line with one end described as (no pain=0) and other end (worst pain=10). It was considered a valid way for assessing pain. It allowed graphic representation and numerical analysis of collected data (Boonstra et al., 2008) (Appendix III).</description>

        the participants will be divided randomly into two groups equal in numbers study group
        (group A) and control group (group B).

        • Study group (group A): It will consist of fifteen subjects who will receive osteopathic
        technique six treatment ( sessions) around three cycles two treatment every month first
        treatment after the end of menstruation.second treatment before the next cycle. In addition
        to their medical treatment if needed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NIAIDS).
