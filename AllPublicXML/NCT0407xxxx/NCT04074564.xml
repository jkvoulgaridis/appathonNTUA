      This is a single-center,Exploratory Research for evaluating the efficacy of MASCT-I With PD1
      Antibody and Apatinib in patients with advanced Advanced Osteosarcoma and Soft Tissue Sarcoma
      and preliminarily assessing the preliminary observation of immune response and safety. About
      20 cases of adult patients are to be recruited.

      The patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group received MASCT-I A+PD1
      antibody+Apatinib treatment, the other group received MASCT-I B+PD1 antibody+Apatinib
      treatment. In combination with MASCT-I, the dosage and cycle of PD1 antibody and Apatinib did
      not change.

      MASCT-I A and MASCT-I B are mainly administered with different frequencies of MASCT-I.

      After treatment, patients were assessed by CT imaging every 8 weeks. If the disease
      progressed or could not be tolerated, or when the end of treatment (104 weeks), the treatment
      would be discontinued, whichever happened first.

    <description>Multi-antigen autoimmune cell injection (MASCT-I) is an adoptive cellular immunotherapeutic product being developed by Heng Ruiyuan.
PD1 antibody is a blocking antibody of human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). It can bind to PD-1 receptor, block its interaction with PD-L 1 and PD-L2, release PD-1 pathway mediated inhibition of immune response, including anti-tumor immune response.
Apatinib is a small molecule targeted anti-angiogenesis drug. It can highly selectively compete for ATP binding sites of endothelial growth factor R-2, block downstream signal transduction and inhibit neovascularization in tumor tissues.</description>
