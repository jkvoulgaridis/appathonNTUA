  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      single and multiple doses of NNI-362 in healthy aged population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The early clinical development strategy consists of the initial evaluation of safety and
      tolerability of NNI-362. This FIH Phase I includes single and multiple ascending dose studies
      in healthy aged volunteers. Assessment of suicidal ideation/behavior will be performed at
      baseline and at all study visits and on days of inpatient confinement in conformance with FDA
      recommendations.
