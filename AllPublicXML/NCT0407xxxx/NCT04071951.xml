  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial testing a peri- and post-discharge pharmacist-led medication
      management intervention on post-discharge utilization, including both readmissions and
      emergency department visits within 30 days of discharge. The intervention incorporates
      evidence addressing three main areas: medication reconciliation, medication adherence, and
      polypharmacy. This study uses a pragmatic trial randomized at the patient level and conducted
      in two large hospitals to achieve the following aims:

      Aim 1: To test the effect of this intervention on post-discharge utilization among patients
      most at risk for post-discharge adverse drug events: recently discharged older adults taking
      ≥10 medications or ≥3 high-risk medications using a prospective, randomized, pragmatic
      multi-site study.

      Aim 2: To study barriers and facilitators of implementing this intervention using a
      qualitative study.

      Aim 3: To analyze the costs of this intervention, including the incremental cost per
      readmission averted and the net incremental cost from the health system perspective using a
      time-and-motion study and a cost-effectiveness analysis.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial testing a peri- and post-discharge pharmacist-led medication
      management intervention on post-discharge utilization, including both readmissions and
      emergency department visits within 30 days of discharge. The reason for targeting utilization
      as the primary outcome is that we believe prior work has already established the efficacy of
      this type of intervention in preventing adverse drug events, but that it has not been widely
      implemented because there is currently no business case for these types of services, from the
      perspective of the hospitals and health systems who would need to fund them. The intervention
      incorporates evidence addressing three main areas: medication reconciliation, medication
      adherence, and polypharmacy. This study uses a pragmatic trial randomized at the patient
      level and conducted in two large hospitals to achieve the following aims (stratified by
      site):

      Aim 1: To test the effect of this intervention on post-discharge utilization among patients
      most at risk for post-discharge adverse drug events: recently discharged older adults taking
      ≥10 medications or ≥3 high-risk medications using a prospective, randomized, pragmatic
      multi-site study.

      Aim 2: To study barriers and facilitators of implementing this intervention using a
      qualitative study.

      Aim 3: To analyze the costs of this intervention, including the incremental cost per
      readmission averted and the net incremental cost from the health system perspective using a
      time-and-motion study and a cost-effectiveness analysis.

      The study population includes individuals being discharged from the hospital at high risk for
      adverse drug events. Two sites will participate in this study: an academic medical center
      (Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts) and a university-affiliated community
      hospital (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California) that has some community
      physicians.

      Eligible pharmacists (those with training in transitions of care) at the two sites will
      receive a list of patients currently admitted to the hospital who have been randomized to the
      intervention. Randomization is stratified by site. Intervention patients will be offered
      intensive pharmacist services during and after discharge, most notably a chart review,
      in-person or phone visit(s) during hospitalization, medication reconciliation at hospital
      discharge, and a post-discharge phone call. Some or all of these activities may take place
      over the phone. Other intervention components (e.g. phone calls to community pharmacies and
      primary care physicians) may also be offered when indicated.

    <description>Pharmacists will address medication reconciliation, medication adherence, and polypharmacy issues as appropriate. Pharmacists will rely most on their prior training, but study investigators will also encourage the use of documentation templates with reminders, Beers list, deprescribing, motivational interviewing, the Medication Adherence and Literacy tool, and post-discharge phone calls.
Pharmacists will assess patient needs and customize accordingly. All patients will receive one discharge counseling visit and one post-discharge phone call, but pharmacists will find that some patients need further phone calls, interventions, referrals, or other interactions. Some or all of the pharmacist activities may take place over the phone.</description>
