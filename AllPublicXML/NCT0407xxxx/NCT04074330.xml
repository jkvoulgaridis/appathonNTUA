    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TAK-981 in
      combination with rituximab in participants with r/r CD20+ NHL in Phase 1b, and to evaluate
      the efficacy of TAK-981 in combination with rituximab in r/r CD20+ NHL in Phase 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981 in combination with rituximab. The
      study will determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of TAK-981 in combination with
      rituximab in participants with r/r CD20+ NHL. The study will include a dose escalation phase
      (Phase 1b) and an open label study (Phase 2).

      The study will enroll approximately 90 participants, approximately 34 participants in Phase
      1b and approximately 56 participants in Phase 2. The phase 1b will identify the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or pharmacologically active dose (PAD). In the dose escalation
      phase, the starting dose of TAK-981 will be 3 mg, however, a starting dose of TAK-981 that is
      greater than (&gt;) 3 mg may be considered if emerging preliminary safety experience from the
      ongoing TAK-981-1002 single agent study supports it. The starting dose level will be
      escalated based on available safety, PK and pharmacodynamic data, and after any early
      antitumor activity is observed.

      Participants in the Phase 2 will be enrolled once the Phase 1b of the study is completed, and
      MTD and/or PAD is determined. Participants in Phase 2 will be enrolled in 2 treatment arms:
      indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is approximately 36 months. Participants will make multiple
      visits to the clinic, and will attend the end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after
      receiving their last dose of drug or before the start of subsequent systemic anticancer
      therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow-up assessment.

             CD20+ B-cell lymphoma with intermediate features between DLBCL and Burkitt's lymphoma
             or with intermediate features between DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma
             grade 3B, and CD20+ aggressive B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable who must have previously
             received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine,
             (Oncovin) and prednisone (R-CHOP) (or equivalent anti-CD20 containing therapy) and 1
             additional line of therapy in the r/r setting.

          2. CD20+ iNHL (including follicular lymphoma of grades 1-3A and marginal zone lymphoma)
             refractory to rituximab or to any other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, who have
             received at least 1 prior systemic therapy for r/r iNHL:

             o Rituximab or anti-CD20 refractoriness is defined as failure to respond to, or
             progression during, any previous rituximab/anti-CD20-containing regimen (monotherapy
             or combined with chemotherapy), or progression within 6 months of the last rituximab
             or anti-CD20 dose.

               -  The minimum qualifying rituximab/anti-CD20 dose is 1 full cycle (that is,
                  weekly*4 doses monotherapy or 1 complete dose if combined with chemotherapy).

               -  Prior anti-CD20 antibody or cytotoxic drugs may have been administered as single
                  agents or as components of combination therapies. Each repeated course of the
                  same single-agent or combination is considered an independent regimen.

          3. Must be ineligible or refused autologous or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation or Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.

             (&lt;=) 2.

          5. Adequate bone marrow function per local laboratory reference range at screening as
             follows:

             o Platelet count &gt;=75.0*10^9/L, Grade 2 thrombocytopenia (platelet count &gt;=50.0*10^9
             per liter [/L]) is allowed if it is clearly due to marrow involvement with no evidence
             of myelodysplastic syndrome or hypoplastic bone marrow if found. Absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) &gt;=1.0*10^9/L. Hemoglobin &gt;=85 gram per liter (g/L) (red blood cell [RBC]
             transfusion allowed &gt;=14 days before assessment).

          6. Adequate renal and hepatic function, per local laboratory reference range at screening
             as follows:

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;=45 milliliter per minute (mL/min) using
                  measured 24-hour creatinine clearance or calculated with modified Cockcroft-Gault
                  formula. Participants can be enrolled based only on calculated glomerular
                  filtration rate; however, if creatinine clearance is measured, this value must be
                  used for inclusion.

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase &lt;=3.0*the upper limit of

                  between the investigator and the medical monitor.

          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=40 percent (%); as measured by
             echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA).

          8. Suitable venous access for safe drug administration and the study-required PK and
             pharmacodynamic sampling.

          9. Have at least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion per Lugano Classification (&gt;1.5

             are required, 1 for biopsy, and 1 for response.

         10. Willing to consent to 1 mandatory pretreatment and 1 on-treatment skin biopsy during
             phase 1b and 1 mandatory pretreatment and 1 on-treatment skin and tumor biopsies
             during phase 2. For fresh tumor biopsies, the lesion must be accessible for a low risk
             biopsy procedure (those occurring outside the brain, lung/mediastinum, and
             intra-abdominal, or obtained with endoscopic procedures beyond the stomach or bowel).
             The skin biopsy entry requirement may be discontinued by the sponsor once there is
             enough pharmacodynamic evidence of target engagement.

         11. Recovered to Grade 1, baseline or established as sequela, from all toxic effects of
             previous therapy (except alopecia, neuropathy, autoimmune endocrinopathies with stable

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
