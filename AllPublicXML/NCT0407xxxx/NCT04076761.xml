  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, single arm phase 2 study to assess the efficacy of
      TRIFLURIDINE/TIPIRACIL, in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma as measured by median
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      This study will enroll a total of 47 patients over a 12-month period, according to a two
      stage enrollment design. Nine patients will be enrolled during the first stage and the trial
      will be terminated if 4 or more out of the 9 have disease progression. If the trial goes on
      to the second stage, a total of 47 patients (38 in second stage) will be required.

      Patients will be seen prior to enrolment (within 28 days of treatment), every 4 weeks while
      on treatment, at the end of treatment, and 30 days post-treatment. Patients will remain on
      long-term follow-up and will be seen every 12 weeks (+/- 14 days) until 1 year post-treatment
      when they will enter into the survival follow-up period and will be contacted every 12 weeks
      by phone until progression or toxicity.

    <description>As measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ C30) Functioning, symptoms, and global health status scores will be calculated, graphed, and summarized at baseline and each follow-up visit. General linear mixed model will be conducted to detect significant changing over time for functioning, symptoms and global health status scores. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems</description>

    <description>FTD/TPI is an orally administered combination of a thymidine-based nucleic acid analogue, trifluridine, and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, tipiracil hydrochloride. Trifluridine is the active cytotoxic component of FTD/TPI; its triphosphate form is incorporated into DNA, with such incorporation appearing to result in its anti- tumor effects. Tipiracil hydrochloride is a potent inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylase and, when combined with trifluridine to form FTD/TPI, prevents the rapid degradation of the trifluridine, allowing for the maintenance of adequate plasma levels of the active drug.</description>
