  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent, morbid condition. Anticoagulation to prevent
      thromboembolic strokes is a foremost priority in AF but adherence is challenging for patients
      and lapses in anticoagulation are common. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a
      recognized program to enhance self-efficacy and improve adherence, quality of life, and
      patient-centered health outcomes. Rural patients with AF experience increased vulnerability
      to adverse outcomes due to geographic and social isolation, poor health care access, and
      limited health literacy. This study uses an innovative, scalable CDSM intervention to improve
      anticoagulation adherence in rural patients with AF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a smartphone-based intervention
      called an embodied conversational agent (ECA) on health outcomes in people with atrial
      fibrillation. The study will enroll 264 patients who reside in rural, Western Pennsylvania
      who have atrial fibrillation. Participants will be randomized to the intervention or control.
      Intervention participants will receive a smartphone with a relational agent, which simulates
      conversation and provides coaching, guidance, and assistance with chronic disease
      self-management. In addition participants will receive an AliveCor Kardia for heart rate and
      rhythm monitoring, an FDA-approved, widely used instrument that pairs with the relational
      agent. Control participants will receive a smartphone with as well, which will have the
      health application WebMD. The intervention will last 4 months and participants will have
      visits at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. The study will evaluate the improvement in adherence
      to anticoagulation, quality of life, and health care utilization resulting from the
      intervention.

    <measure>Medication possession ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) is obtained from electronic prescription and pharmacy fill data for oral anticoagulation. MPR is calculated as a percentage (0 to 100%) accounting for days of prescription and date of fill. MPR quantification accounts for days of hospitalization, switching to an alternative anticoagulant agent, and prescribing changes during 12-month follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A three-item instrument to ascertain self-reported non-adherence. Items are scored with a Likert scale from 0 (&quot;None fo the time.&quot;) to 5 (&quot;Every time.&quot;). The score is scaled as a continuous measure (0 to 15) and dichotomous categorization.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The AFEQT is a widely used measure of atrial fibrillation-specific health-related quality of life. Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating superior health-related quality of life in AF. The AFEQT measure consists of a global score and 4 domains (symptoms, daily activities, treatment concerns, and treatment satisfaction). We prioritize the global score because of its specificity to AF, our experience with this measure in our preliminary and pilot studies, extensive validation, and ease of administration. The AFEQT subdomains (symptoms, daily activities, treatment concerns, and treatment satisfaction) constitute secondary outcomes.</description>
