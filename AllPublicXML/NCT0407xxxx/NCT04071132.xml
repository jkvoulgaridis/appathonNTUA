  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A psychiatric diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is currently based mainly on
      non-quantitative elements, such as interviews and subjective impressions. PTSD has
      physiological manifestations, some of which are likely reflected in the levels and ratios of
      certain stress-related proteins in the interstitial fluid and plasma. Discernable patterns of
      such stress-related proteins may constitute a biochemical phenotype characteristic of PTSD,
      which may serve as a biomarker and support diagnostic decisions, as well as personalized
      treatment plans.

      The current study is a non-interventional observational study aimed at examining the
      possibility of basing a psychiatric diagnosis by measuring changes in the biochemical
      phenotype of participants with PTSD.
