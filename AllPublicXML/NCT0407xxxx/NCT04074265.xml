  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain management in pediatric patients presents a difficult challenge. Unlike adults,
      pediatric patients often cannot communicate their pain management needs clearly. Adequate
      pain control after surgery is pivotal for these patients in order to prevent negative
      physiologic and psychologic complications and to improve surgical outcomes. There is an
      ongoing shift away from the use of opioids in the post-operative setting due to both their
      negative side effects and their high potential for dependence and abuse.

      A variety of new techniques of multimodal pain management have been developed and utilized in
      elective orthopaedic procedures. Injection of local anesthetics is becoming a widely popular
      technique utilized in adult arthroplasty. This technique blocks pain directly at the site of
      injection, and therefore can improve post-operative pain while minimizing side effects.
      Evidence has demonstrated this technique to be both safe and effective, resulting in reduced
      opioid consumption post-operatively. However, this technique has not been studied for use in
      pediatric patients, a population in which reduced narcotic use is equally, if not more
      important than in adult patients.

      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms. The goal of
      this study is to assess the efficacy of a surgical-site pain injection administered in
      pediatric patients with cerebral palsy undergoing major hip surgery. Patients who are
      scheduled to undergo surgery will be randomized to either intervention (injection of a pain
      cocktail) or placebo (injection of normal saline). The pain cocktail includes three
      medications: ropivacaine (a local anesthetic), ketorolac (an anti-inflammatory medication),
      and epinephrine (a medication to constrict blood vessels and increase the duration of action
      of any co-administered medications). A surgeon who is blinded to treatment group will
      administer the injection at the end of the procedure, prior to the patient waking from
      anesthesia. The injection is in addition to our typical multi-modal pain control protocol,
      which includes epidural anesthesia, acetaminophen, anti-inflammatories, oral narcotics and
      anti-spasmodic agents. Patients will then be monitored post-operatively and pain medication
      consumption (both while in the hospital post-operatively and for the first two weeks
      following discharge), patient-reported and/or nurse-recorded pain scores, length of hospital
      stay, and adverse effects will be recorded. At the first post-operative visit, patients'
      parents will be asked to complete a survey designed to assess parent satisfaction with their
      child's pain management after surgery. Patients, parents, and surgeons will be blinded to
      treatment group allocation. Data will be collected while the patient is in the hospital,
      after surgery (average duration 3-4 days), and at the first post-operative visit two to three
      weeks after surgery.

    <textblock>
      With the ongoing opioid epidemic in the United States, there has been a shift toward the use
      of non-opioid alternatives for pain control in the post-operative period. The development of
      a multimodal approach to pain management has seen a rise in the use of local anesthesia,
      whether as a peripheral nerve block or as an peri/intra-articular injection. These techniques
      have shown to be very effective in the adult population for improving pain and reducing the
      need for opioid consumption post-operatively. However, these techniques have yet to be
      studied in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of
      a local anesthetic injection post-operatively in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy
      undergoing major surgery as part of a multi-modal pain control protocol. The investigators
      hypothesize that peri-articular injection of a pain cocktail containing a mix of local
      anesthetic, anti-inflammatory medication, and epinephrine at the end of surgery will result
      in decreased opioid use in the immediate peri-operative period in pediatric patients with
      cerebral palsy undergoing proximal femoral osteotomy when compared to an injection of normal
      saline. The investigators also hypothesize that the pain injection will result in decreased
      mean pain scores post-operatively, shorter hospital stays and improved parent satisfaction
      when compared to normal saline injection. With this study, the investigators hope to provide
      evidence to support the use of a minimally invasive, safe-to-use pain injection that will
      reduce the need for opioids in pediatric patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures.

      Study Design:

      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms. Patients will
      be randomly assigned to the 2 treatment groups: surgical-site injection with ropivacaine,
      ketorolac, and epinephrine, or surgical-site injection with normal saline. Randomization will
      be performed via random number generator and will be carried out by a research associate who
      will not participate in study recruitment or outcomes assessment. Allocations will be
      concealed on a password-protected database accessible only to the research associate.
      Patients, surgeons, and nursing staff who perform post-operative assessments will be blinded
      to treatment allocation.

      Surgical Procedure:

      Patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral hip proximal femoral osteotomies will be included
      in the study. All patients will be treated with standard-of-care techniques chosen by the
      treating surgeon. The addition of pelvic osteotomies and/or soft tissue procedures will be at
      the discretion of the treating surgeon and will not exclude the patient from the study.
      Written consent will be obtained for all patients prior to the surgical procedure. Parental
      consent will be obtained, in addition to patient assent for all patients of appropriate age
      and intellectual capability. All patients will have a general anesthetic with a lumbar
      epidural. No preemptive scheduled analgesic regimen will be employed. All medications
      administered during induction and maintenance of anesthesia will be managed by the
      anesthesiologist and titrated at their discretion.

      The local anesthetic group will be injected with a cocktail totaling 40 milliliters (mL)
      (20mL on each side) that will be composed of ropivicaine 2mg/mL (3mg/kg), epinephrine 1mg/mL
      (0.5mg), ketorolac 30mg/mL (0.5mg/kg). The control group will receive 40mL of 0.9% sodium
      chloride solution. The injection will be performed while the patient is still under general
      anesthesia, following wound closure, and will be injected evenly between the deep and
      superficial tissues in an extra-articular pattern (no injection of the synovium or capsule).
      All injections will be performed using a 20-gauge needle. All medications will be obtained
      from the hospital pharmacy. All injections will be prepared by an operating room nurse under
      the supervision of a research assistant, and placed in an unlabeled syringe to allow for
      blinding of the surgeon administering the injection.

      Post-Operative Protocol:

      The epidural anesthesia will be started at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist
      either before or on-arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit. Any additional medications
      administered during the immediate post-operative period in the post-anesthesia care unit will
      be prescribed by the attending anesthesiologist and will not be standardized. Beginning when
      the patient leaves the post-anesthesia care unit, all patients will be given the following
      pain regimen: acetaminophen (15mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours around the clock),
      ketorolac (0.5mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 3 doses) followed by ibuprofen (10mg/kg PO or per
      g-tube every 8 hours as needed for mild pain (pain score 1-3)), diazepam (0.1mg/kg PO or per
      g-tube every 6 hours around the clock for 36 hours followed by every 6 hours as needed for
      muscle spasms), and oxycodone (0.1mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours as needed for severe
      pain (pain score 7-10)). Nurses will be instructed to offer this as-needed medication to
      patients at standardized intervals every 4 hours when performing pain assessments. Additional
      medication for pain may be administered if the protocol does not result in adequate pain
      relief, at the discretion of the treating physician. The epidural will be titrated by the
      acute pain anesthesiology team for inadequate pain control, and all epidurals will be
      discontinued the morning of post-operative day two. All patients will be discharged on a
      standardized medication regimen as follows: diazepam (0.1mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours
      for 14 days), oxycodone (0.5mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours as needed for severe pain,
      20 doses), acetaminophen (15mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours for 14 days), and ibuprofen
      (10mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 8 hours for 14 days). Inpatient and outpatient narcotic
      consumption will be recorded as morphine equivalents per kilogram, to allow adjustment for
      the weight-based dosing used in pediatric patients.

      All other aspects of post-operative care, including (but not limited to) physical therapy,
      weight bearing status, mobilization, and bracing will be decided on a case-by-case basis by
      the treating surgeon.

      Data Collection and Protection:

      Data will be collected by approved research personnel via access to the medical record.
      Personal identifying information collected will include name, date of birth, medical record
      number, and telephone number. All data will be labeled with a code that can be linked to this
      personal identifying information. Data will be collected only from the hospitalization
      following the surgical procedure and from the first post-operative visit. This data will
      include: narcotic consumption, pain scores, complications or adverse events, and re-admission
      in the immediate post-operative period (first two weeks post-operatively). All data will be
      stored on a secure, encrypted data storage device or password protected and encrypted
      internet-based storage device.

Scores will be collected by nursing staff on the inpatient ward who are blinded to treatment allocation and recorded in the electronic medical record. The type of pain score collection will vary based on patient age and level of intellectual disability. In verbal children, either the visual analog scale (VAS) or faces pain scale will be employed. In non-verbal children, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale will be employed. All three scales measure a patient's pain on a scale of zero (no pain) to ten (the worst pain). Lower values are considered better than higher values. These scores will be combined into an average score for the hospitalization. A higher average score indicates more pain (worse outcome), while a lower average score indicates less pain (better outcome).</description>
