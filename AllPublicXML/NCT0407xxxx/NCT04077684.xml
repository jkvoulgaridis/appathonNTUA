  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is challenging due to the
      heterogeneous nature of the disease and lack of specific treatment. Current treatment
      regimens mainly rely on corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents which are associated
      with substantial adverse effects including various infections. Therefore, there is an unmet
      need for new therapies with better efficacy and less adverse effects.

      Defective IL-2 production contributes to the unbalanced immune system in SLE. Previous short
      term open-labelled trials showed that low-dose IL-2 was efficient and tolerated in active
      SLE. It was suggested that low-dose IL-2 treatment promoted regulatory T cells (Treg) and
      inhibited T helper 17 cells (Th17) and follicular helper T cells (Tfh). The immunological
      rebalancing was associated with the induction of remission in SLE patients.

      To establish that which low doses of IL-2 would be more efficacious and safe in active SLE,
      we carried out a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of three
      doses of IL2 (0.2 MIU, 0.5 MIU or 1 MIU) versus placebo.

      Five hundred patients with active SLE at 18 to 75 years of age were enrolled. Patients were
      randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of the four arms (placebo or IL-2 at 0.2 MIU,
      0.5 MIU or 1 MIU) in the study. IL-2 (0.2 MIU, 0.5 MIU or 1 MIU) or placebo was administered
      subcutaneously every other day for the first 12 weeks , and then was adjusted to once a week
      for the second 12 weeks. Follow-up visits occurred on weeks 4, 8,12,16,20 and 24. The end
      points were safety and clinical and immunologic response.
