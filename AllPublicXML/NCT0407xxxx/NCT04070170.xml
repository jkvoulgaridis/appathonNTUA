  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study will be to evaluate if a Lower Level Laser Therapy (LLLT): (1)
      enhances the levels of important pro-inflammatory chemokines involved in the bone remodeling
      process; (2) increases the rate of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) on human subjects.
