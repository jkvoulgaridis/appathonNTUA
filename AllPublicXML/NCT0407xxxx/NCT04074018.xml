      Introduction: Peripheral facial paresis (PFP) is a very common disease of various etiologies
      affecting average adults with no predominance of sex. In 70% of cases, motor recovery is
      rapid and complete, but in 30% of early PFP, motor symptoms such as paresis and/or abnormal
      movements (synkinesis, contractures and/or spasms) can live on and jeopardize patients
      quality of life at medium and even long term. Concerning therapeutic interventions, the
      rehabilitation patient care of PFP is often restricted to the early stage. A recent
      randomized controlled study showed that early rehabilitation had a positive impact on motor
      recovery, specifically in severe motor grades, and could also accelerate time of recovery
      without exacerbating synkinesis. At chronic stage of the pathology, there is no controlled
      study testing the effect of motor rehabilitation when deficiencies are often considered as
      fitted and permanents.

      Objective: It is well known in other domains that intensive motor strengthening increases
      cerebral plasticity in general, and particularly that of sensorimotor command. The main
      hypothesis of the study is that motor strengthening even at chronic stage of PFP could
      increase motor function and decrease abnormal motor movements through a self-rehabilitation
      motor program. The main objective is thus to compare the clinical, kinematic and
      quality-of-life related impacts of two different rehabilitation programs on motor recovery in
      unilateral PFP at chronic stage (i.e. at least 1 year after injury): a self-rehabilitation
      program guided by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) therapist versus facial
      rehabilitation involving physiotherapist or speech therapist specialized in facial
      rehabilitation. The main evaluation criterion is the evolution of the Sunnybrook Facial
      Grading Scale composite score between Day0 (before rehabilitation) and Day180 (after 6 months
      of facial rehabilitation).

      Method: National, Randomized simple blind controlled study, in two parallel groups: Both
      program have to be realized daily for 6 months (Day1 to Day180). The population is made of
      adults with unilateral PFP at chronic stage i.e. at least 1 year from injury. Evaluations and
      follow-up of patients will be accomplished in a single center: Service de Rééducation
      Neurolocomotrice de l'Hôpital Mondor in Créteil (France).
