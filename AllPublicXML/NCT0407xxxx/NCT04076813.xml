        Inclusion Criteria:

        For the first 200 patients in the registry, consecutive patients are entered in the
        registry if they are ≥ 18 years of age, underwent coronary angiography for a STEMI or
        NSTEMI, and received cangrelor at any time during the hospitalization or an oral P2Y12
        inhibitor during his/her first 48 hours of the hospitalization for MI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subsequent patients are eligible to be entered in the registry if they are ≥ 18 years of
        age and underwent coronary angiography for a STEMI or NSTEMI and meet at least 1 of the
        following criteria:

        The patient was hospitalized for STEMI and met one of the following inclusion criteria:

          -  The patient received cangrelor at any time during his/her hospitalization for MI.

          -  The patient received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor during his/her first 48 hours of
             hospitalization AND either of the following:

          -  The patient received a P2Y12 inhibitor and an opiate/opioid within 24 hours prior to
             or during primary PCI for STEMI presentation.

          -  The patient underwent coronary angiography followed by CABG during the index MI
             admission and received any P2Y12 inhibitor within 7 days prior to CABG.

        The patient was hospitalized for NSTEMI and met one of the following inclusion criteria:

          -  The patient received cangrelor during his/her hospitalization for MI.

          -  The patient received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor during his/her first 48 hours of
             hospitalization.

          -  The patient underwent coronary angiography followed by CABG during the index MI
             admission and received any P2Y12 inhibitor within 7 days prior to CABG.
