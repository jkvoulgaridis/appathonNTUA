      This study will observe the efficacy and toxicities of 3-dimensional printing noncoplanar
      template assisted CT guided radioactive iodine-125 seeds implantation in the treatment of
      patients with recurrent chest wall malignancies after external beam radiotherapy
      prospectively, and analyzes the influence of clinical and dosimetric factors on the outcomes.

      Radioactive Iodine-125 seed brachytherapy is a conventional treatment in Peking University
      Third Hospital. Radioactive Iodine-125 seed brachytherapy is the implantation of Iodine-125
      seed into tumors.The radioactive Iodine-125 seed can release low dose of irradiation
      persistently which kills tumors cell and causes less damage to normal tissue at the same
      time. This study will enroll the patients with recurrent chest wall malignancies after
      external beam radiotherapy (primary or metastasis) who underwent CT-guided radioactive
      iodine-125 seed implantation assisted by 3D-printing template from 2019 to 2021. The
      investigators evaluate the dose that covers 90% target volume(D90) and other parameters after
      the implantation. The efficacy and adverse events will be observed. Local control(LC) time
      and overall survival(OS) time are evaluated.

    <description>The radioactive Iodine-125 seed can release low dose of irradiation persistently which kills tumors cell and causes less damage to normal tissue at the same time. The treatment was performed under CT monitoring. 3D-printing template includes information on the path of the implantation needle, characteristics of the surface of the therapy area of the patient, and positioning and orientation effects which can make the operation more accurate.</description>
