  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of the &quot;Managing Your Health&quot; online
      self-management skills+peer mentoring intervention that focuses on overcoming survivor
      barriers to self-management of their survivorship care. We will conduct a pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention versus usual care with adolescent and young adult
      survivors of childhood cancer ages 18-25 years. Participants will complete survey measures at
      baseline, Time 2 (about 2 months after baseline), Time 3 (about 5 months after baseline), and
      Time 4 (about 12 months after baseline).

The RTQ yields a total mean score for responsibility.

    <description>The online educational component consists of 5 self-management educational modules:
(1) Understanding Your Survivorship Care Plan; (2) Managing Your Healthcare; (3) Family and Significant Other Involvement in Your Healthcare; (4) Emotions about Your Health and Follow-Up Care; (5) Staying Healthy.
Participants will be matched with a peer mentor and complete a total of six calls. The first call is to build a rapport and identify the participant's self-management strengths, weaknesses, and goals. The next five calls align with the topic of each module, which the mentee is expected to complete prior to their scheduled call.</description>
