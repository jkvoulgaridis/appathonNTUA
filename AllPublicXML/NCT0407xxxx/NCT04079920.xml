    <textblock>
      This is a 24-month, prospective, non-interventional, multi-center study with primary aim to
      identify baseline characteristics of patients that predict response at 6 months of treatment.
      The study also aims to describe the treatment patterns of RA patients prescribed tofacitinib
      in a real-world setting and assess the effect of treatment on patient quality of life and
      physical function. Finally the study will assess the use of healthcare resources and costs in
      patients with RA treated with tofacitinib in Greece.

      The planned recruitment period is 12 months. The planned observation period of each patient
      is 12 months. In this time period up to 4 visits will be documented.

      The study will be reviewed and approved by the Central Regulatory Committee for NIS and IRB
      Board of each participating site
