  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron is a nutritionally essential mineral required for optimal physical and cognitive
      performance. Endurance exercise often leads to declines in iron status; however, the reason
      for the decline is not known. The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine the
      effects of an acute bout of strenuous endurance exercise on iron absorption and status and
      markers of inflammation in human volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that an acute bout
      of strenuous endurance exercise, compared to rest, will reduce iron absorption, resulting in
      diminished iron status, and that reduced iron absorption will be negatively associated with
      markers of inflammation. A secondary objective is to monitor iron status throughout a season
      of competition.
