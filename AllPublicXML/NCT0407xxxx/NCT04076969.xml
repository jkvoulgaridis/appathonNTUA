    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the effect of an integrated educational session on enhancing
      compliance behavior among pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia.The anemic pregnant
      women in the study group received an integrated health education in one session. While
      pregnant women who were allocated to the control group received the routine antenatal care
      and follow up.

      In the present study, the pregnant women were assessed for their Hb levels during routine
      antenatal visit in the first interview. Women who were eligible and consented to participate
      were randomly assigned to the study group and the control group. They were informed about the
      study's aim and follow-up schedule. The baseline data were gathered included
      socio-demographic characteristics and obstetric history. Pregnant women in both groups were
      scheduled for three follow-up visits that took place at 28, 32 and 36 weeks of gestation. The
      anemic pregnant women in the study group received an integrated health education in one
      session. The educational session was steered as 40-minutes session in a personalized manner.
      The educational session content included; disease specific information, effect of anemia on
      maternal and neonatal outcome, management possibilities, the effectiveness, benefits and
      disadvantages of treatment options, identify diet rich with iron, false dietary habits
      prevent iron absorption and the balanced diet and meals. The researcher followed the
      nutritional recommendations based on The world Health Organization (WHO) pregnancy dietary
      guidelines. The pregnant women were given an opportunity to discuss the content of the
      educational session, so any doubts were clarified. Further, women were trained how to record
      all food and drink consumed in and out of the home (i.e. each meal/dish she received during
      the period of recording her diary, 24hrs recall for seven days),the exact food portion size
      by usual household measures (e.g. plates, bowls, cups, spoons and glasses) or by the kitchen
      scale. At the end of the educational session, the pregnant women received an educational
      brochure included all information that had been provided in that session. Each pregnant woman
      in both groups was evaluated twice at 28 and 36 weeks gestation for total dietary iron (i.e.
      The dietary iron intake recorded by woman has been calculated utilized the IRONIC-FFQ and
      revised by dietitian not involved in the study) and the degree of the adherence to the
      medication by counting the total numbers of pills have been received (i.e. The numbers of
      dosage units (pills) that have been taken between two scheduled appointments were counted).
      Further, at 36 weeks' gestation, the Morisky medication adherence scale was inserted, and Hb
      levels were checked for all pregnant women of the study and the control groups.Pregnant women
      who were allocated to the control group received the routine antenatal care and follow up

      Primary Outcome:

      Compliance degree

      Secondary Outcome:

      Iron food intake/mg, the hemoglobin level &amp; ferritin levels

    <measure>Eight-Item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 36 weeks gestation</time_frame>
    <description>It consisted of eight items, The first seven items are Yes/No responses while the last item is a 5-point Likert response. Each &quot;no&quot; response is rated as 1 and each &quot;yes&quot; response is rated as 0 except for item 5, in which each &quot;yes&quot; response is rated as 1 and each &quot;no&quot; response is rated as 0. For Item 8, the code (0-4) has to be standardized by dividing the result by four to calculate a summated score.</description>

    <description>Counting the total numbers of pills have been received (i.e. The numbers of dosage units (pills) that have been taken between two scheduled appointments were counted). Adherence to the supplementation regimen was calculated on the basis of the number of capsules remaining in the package at each return visit; adherence (%)=[30-number of pills left in the package/number of days between dispensing date and return date] ×100.</description>

    <measure>IRON Intake Calculation-Food Frequency Questionnaire (IRONIC-FFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 28 and 36 weeks gestation</time_frame>
    <description>It was based on an iron food frequency assessment.All food products were categorized into twelve groups and thirty two related sub-groups characterized by a similar range of iron content. It consisted of open ended questions that specified the exact number of the individual consumption of iron food products during a typical week. To calculate the daily number of servings, the number of servings was divided by seven. The iron intake from the products was estimated by multiplying the daily number of servings by the typical iron content in one serving. A correlation coefficient was more than 0.85. Both in the assessment of validity and of reproducibility, a Bland-Altman index of 6.7% was recorded (93.3% of compared pairs of results were in the acceptable range, attributed to differences within ± 2 SD limit).</description>
