  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clozapine may lead to various adverse reactions, including neutropenia and agranulocytosis.
      This study investigates reports of lymphoma and leukaemias for clozapine in the World Health
      Organization's (WHO) global database of individual safety case reports (VigiBase).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clozapine is responsible of a wide range of adverse side effects.The investigators use
      VigiBase, the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to
      identify cases of haematologic malignancies following treatment with clozapine.

    <description>Study the correlation between clozapine and haematologic malignancies by comparing the proportion of Individual Case Reports (ICSRs) of hematologic malignancies with liable clozapine with the proportion of ICSRs of hematologic malignancies with at least one liable antipsychotic.</description>

    <measure>investigate a potential dose-dependent effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to March 2019 ]</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate a potential dose-dependent effect, we will collect the clozapine daily dose from all clozapine ICSRs. In ICSRs with liable clozapine, the clozapine daily dose in mg will be divided into quartiles. A disproportionality analysis will be performed to evaluate the effect of the clozapine daily dose on the reporting of lymphomas and leukaemia. A significant difference of proportion of reports of haematologic malignancies between each quartile will be researched.</description>
