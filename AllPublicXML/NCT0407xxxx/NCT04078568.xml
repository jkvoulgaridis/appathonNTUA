  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of the addition of prednisolone to conventional initial
      treatment (intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG] plus aspirin) in reducing coronary artery lesion
      in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, blind-endpoints, randomized controlled trial at more than
      10 hospitals in China. The investigators enrolled KD children diagnosed within 10 days of
      onset. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the control group (receiving
      2g/kg IVIG and 30 mg/kg aspirin) or the intervention group (receiving 2 g/kg IVIG, 30 mg/kg
      aspirin and additional 2 mg/kg prednisolone). Baseline characteristics of each participant
      will be collected, including sex, age of onset, height, body weight, subtype of KD, fever
      days before initial IVIG, echocardiographic findings at enrolment, and a series of pre-IVIG
      laboratory tests. Two-dimensional echocardiography will be performed at admission, 2 weeks, 1
      month, 3 months, 6 months，and 12 months after onset of KD to assess the coronary artery
      lesions.

    <description>Two-dimensional echocardiography will be performed to evaluate CAL at 1 month of illness. The measurement of each patient included the diameter of the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the left anterior descending artery (LAD), the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX), and the proximal and middle segments of the right coronary artery (RCA). Z score of each coronary artery will be calculated（Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography, 2011, 24(1).）. CAL is defined as z≥2of any coronary artery of LMCA, LAD, LCX, and the proximal and middle segment of the RCA.</description>
