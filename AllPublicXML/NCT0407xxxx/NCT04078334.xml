  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of the iatrogenic functional decline is about 20 to 50% for the elderly after
      an hospitalization. The consequences are the functional incapacities, the mobility loss, the
      re-hospitalization falls and the important use of the health care and health services. In
      this regard, the Ministry of Health and Social Services adopted in 2011 a framework making
      mandatory the set up of interventions to prevent the functional decline of hospitalized
      elderly in every hospital centres in Quebec. The Geriatric Assessment Units (GAU) admit
      elderly around 80 years old that present complex health problems. The scientific literature
      present effective mobilisation programs to ensure the maintenance of functional capacities
      and the mobility of frail elderly. However, even with these knowledges, the prescription of
      physical exercises by the GAU does not seem to be integrated in a natural and systematic way
      by in the professional practices.

      Our research team would like to implant the clinical tool PATH 2.0 that is a unique process
      of systematic prescriptions of physical activity throughout hospitalization in the GAU
      adapted to the profile of these patients.

      The objective of this project is to evaluate the implementation of the clinical tool PATH 2.0
      in most of the GAU and to evaluate his efficiency and estimate the beneficial-cost on the use
      of post-hospitalization health services. Finally, the conclusions would help us refine the
      procedures to use in the short and medium term this clinical tool like a standard practice
      our GAU and to improve the health continuum of elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the population and the increase in longevity are associated with societal
      issues, both in terms of costs, and the health resources needed to meet the needs of seniors.
      Moreover, it is recognized that frail elderly people (defined as at risk of developing or
      aggravating functional limitations or disabilities) are the largest users of health care
      services. In Canada, as in other industrialized countries, more than a third of
      hospitalizations annually are among people aged 65 and over, even though they account for
      only 18% of the population .

      However, hospitalizations exacerbate the deterioration of fitness, muscle weakness, loss of
      balance, and physical inactivity that typically occur during aging and are precursors to
      functional decline and frailty. One explanation for this deterioration in the health of
      elderly people during hospital stays is bed rest and general immobility. Thus, the prevention
      of immobilization syndrome in elderly people in hospitals being a priority issue for both
      national and international health networks, a project was carried out between 2014 and 2016
      within the geriatric assessment unit (GAU) of a Canadian university-affiliated geriatric
      hospital (IUGM). This project aimed to implement in a pragmatic way (adjusted to the human
      and material resources in place) a physical activity (PA) program for hospitalization
      according to the functional capacities of the hospitalized patients. This project showed that
      the implementation of this program was feasible (at least 1 session of PA / day) and
      acceptable by health professionals, patients and their caregivers.

      At the same time, it is recognized that, following hospitalization, 22 to 50% of older people
      will experience a functional decline that will decrease their ability to perform activities
      of daily living and, consequently, their quality. of life. These tangible losses lead to a
      vicious circle as they contribute to readmission for 33% of those affected and additional use
      of health services in the majority of cases. Prescription of PA is one of the recognized
      solutions to prevent or reduce these deteriorations. PA, whether practiced in the community
      or at home, improves the mobility and functional level of pre-frail and frail seniors to
      moderate effect sizes (mobility).

      The post-hospitalization prescription of an PA program, however, does not appear to be
      integrated into standard care delivery practices, unlike the management of medications or
      assistance with the performance of activities of daily living, and this, despite the
      priorities established in this regard by governments and the World Health Organization (WHO).
      On average, 35% of GAU patients at discharge receive a prescription to maintain or improve
      the strength and balance (internal data of the Regroupement des Unités de courte durée
      gériatrique et des services hospitaliers de gériatrie-RUSHGQ), even if these communities have
      rehabilitation services. As part of a project (2016-2018), the research team has created an
      easy-to-implement decisional tree that can be used to prescribe appropriate programs for GAU
      at discharge, while inducing beneficial effects for patients.

      However, these two innovative projects, which aim to prevent functional decline through
      hospitalization and which meet the policy of the Ministry of Health and Social Services, are
      the&quot;Adapted Health Care Approach for Older Adults in Quebec Hospital Centres&quot; through
      systematic, specific and specialized interventions, have not been implemented in a combined
      and complementary way. However, the implementation of a proactive and adapted approach to
      prescribing PA per and post-hospitalization, through a simple tool based on the clinical
      measures available in practice settings, represents a real organizational innovation and
      should add value to current practices. Thus, the study of the cost-benefit of implementing
      such a practice is important to validate the scope of such a tool on the use of post-hospital
      health care services compared to an isolated intervention of PA per or post-hospitalization
      or usual care. In this sense, a study showed a savings of 22,000 $ / person in health
      services costs for seniors who improved their mobility via PA in post-hospitalization. Thus,
      the investigators can sense that preventing the loss of muscle function and mobility as well
      as falls, the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. In addition, from a
      collective point of view, this should lead to savings because of the reduction in the costs
      of care related to injuries caused by a fall or fall after hospitalization that may result in
      re-hospitalization or even a death.

      Considering 1) the importance of the negative impacts of sedentarity / immobilization on
      seniors, particularly per and post-hospitalization, as well as its potential economic and
      societal impact; 2) the recognized importance of PA prescription in the prevention of the
      functional decline of seniors per and post-hospitalization and 3) the absence of
      organizational processes favoring the implementation of systematic prescribing of PA per and
      post-hospitalization, The implementation of a systematic process of prescribing adapted,
      validated and integrated physical exercises in the usual per and post-hospitalization
      practices appears crucial to the preservation of the autonomy and quality of life of the
      elderly.

    <description>In the first days of hospitalization , the physiotherapist determines the score determining the patient's mobility profile using of a decision tree measuring the balance, the cardio-muscle, 4 meter test, comfortable walking speed and cognitive status. The PA program has 5 levels depending on the score obtained in the decisional tree: red, yellow, orange, green and blue. Each level of the PA program has 2 or 3 exercises to be done with or without supervision 3 times per week. day. The level of supervision required depends on the outcome of the MMSE and the presence or absence of a caregiver. These daily exercises are prescribed by the doctor and taught by the physiotherapist. A flyer explaining the instructions, a banner at the bedside of the patient's bed and a follow-up sheet are provided to facilitate the involvement of the entire heath team and the caregivers to encourage the patient to do his physical exercises with him according to his type of supervision.</description>
