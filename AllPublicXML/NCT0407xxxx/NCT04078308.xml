      Study Objects: Diabetes is an autoimmune disease which is mainly caused an immune reaction to
      beta cells in the pancreas. In this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be used for immune
      response modulation and improving regeneration. Study design and method: In a Triple blinded
      randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II clinical trial, 20 patients with newly diagnosed
      type-1 diabetes who would be visited in Children's Growth and Development Research Center of
      Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Royan Institute Cell Therapy Center, would be
      assessed through two groups including the case group and the placebo group. Participants:
      Patients of both sexes in a range of 8 to 40 years old who have been diagnosed to have type-1
      diabetes in no more than 6 weeks, antibody against beta cells diagnosed in their blood,
      fasting c-peptide more than or equal to 0.3 ng/ml, and are not suffered from other acute or
      chronic diseases and cancers, would be studied. Interventions: Intravascular transplantation
      of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in the case group; placebo injection in the control
      group. Outcome variables: safety and efficacy.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is an autoimmune disease which is mainly caused by an immune reaction to beta cells
      in the pancreas. Today, insulin injection is a routine treatment for diabetes. Although
      injected insulin maintains blood glucose, this method cannot result in physiologic reaction
      to blood glucose changes. Moreover, patients are encountered with diabetes complications like
      neuropathy, nephropathy, visual and cardiovascular problems, and hypoglycemic unawareness.
      Therefore, based on previous studies, a treatment option that leads to pancreatic beta cell
      restoration and inhibits the immune response to these cells could be a hopeful clinical
      choice. In this clinical trial, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells will be
      used for immune response modulation and improving regeneration. Hence, based on inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, 20 patients with type-1 diabetes will be selected and after clarifying
      the procedure and fulfilling the agreement to participate in this trial, they will be sorted
      in two groups. Bone marrow is aspirated from patients bone and after isolation of Mesenchymal
      stem cells and characterization of these cells, patients in case group will be intravenously
      injected by 1 million autologous mesenchymal stem cells per kg of patient's body weight in
      each dose in week 0 and 3, whereas the control group receives a placebo. Then patients will
      be followed up for 1 year. During this time, different parameters would be evaluated in weeks
      1, 2,4, and Months 2,3,6,9 and 12. Laboratory screenings will be done during this period to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment.
