  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will explore the effects of an online heart-focused breathing
      intervention on 20 informal caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) over a
      period of two weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers are often live-in, unpaid spouses, relatives, partners, or friends that
      help with a loved one's activities of daily living. As a result of caring for a person with
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD), many informal caregivers experience caregiver burden. The demanding
      physical, emotional, and financial responsibilities to care for an AD patient can be
      detrimental to the caregiver's health.

      A group of 20 men and women who consider themselves the primary caregiver of a person with AD
      will be recruited and enrolled into the study. Participants will be randomized into one of
      two study arms, (a) the modified-waitlist control arm or (b) the intervention arm. The study
      will explore the effects of an online heart-focused breathing intervention on heart rate
      variability (measured by the Welltory app on their smart device), perceived burden, stress,
      and quality of life in the intervention arm over a two-week period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver Burden will be measured by the Zarit Burden Interview short version (12 items, 5-point Likert scale; 0= never, 4= nearly always). Score range= 0 to 48. A score of 17 or higher indicates a high level of burden.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be measured by the Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale (AIOS) (2-items, visual analogue scale; 0 millimeters= worst you have ever been, 100 millimeters= best you have ever been). Score range= 0 to 200. The AIOS asks participants to reflect on their sense of well-being over the past 24 hours and over the past month.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress will be measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (10 items, 5-point Likert scale; 0= never, 4= very often). Score range= 0 to 40. The PSS has a general score by combining all item scores and reverse scoring items 4, 5, 7, and 8. The PSS has two subscales, one for perceived distress (items 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10) and one for perceived coping (4, 5, 7, 8). A higher general score is associated with a higher level of stress.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete the following components of baseline (T1) data collection: demographics, questionnaire, heart rate variability assessment. These participants will receive an online heart-focused breathing intervention. Participants will be asked to practice their breathing skills while monitoring their heart rate variability using the Welltory app on their smart device for the following two weeks. Participants will be instructed to maintain a log to record the date and time of each practice session. Research staff will make biweekly reminder calls to participants. After the two-week period, participants will complete post-intervention data collection (T2), which includes a questionnaire and HRV assessment.</description>
