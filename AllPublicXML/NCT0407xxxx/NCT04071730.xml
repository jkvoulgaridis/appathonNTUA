      This small, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled pilot study is aimed at determining
      the effects of four weeks of daily Immulina dietary supplementation (800 mg/day) versus four
      weeks of daily placebo on natural killer (NK) cell numbers and/or natural killer (NK) cell
      activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from human research
      participants who meet the trial's inclusion/exclusion criteria.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Normal, generally healthy adults between ages 18-64 and who may or may not have a
             controlled disease(s). Examples of controlled diseases are controlled Type-2 diabetes
             mellitus, controlled hypertension, controlled allergic rhinitis, etc.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with specific disease entities, which, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, could reasonably be assumed to have dysfunctional immune function as a
             component of their illness. These include HIV, AIDS, uncontrolled asthma, uncontrolled
             eczema, uncontrolled allergic rhinitis, uncontrolled urticaria, rheumatoid arthritis,
             lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, Type-1 diabetes mellitus,
             Guillain-Barre syndrome, psoriasis, Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis,
             myasthenia gravis or vasculitis.

          -  Individuals taking specific dietary supplements including probiotic, microalgae or
             beta glucan containing dietary supplements, fermented food products (such as yogurt,
             bean curd, etc.). If the potential participants reports usage of any of these
             products, they will be asked if they would be willing to withhold products for 30 days
             and then be re-screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria.

          -  Individuals who are unwilling to refrain for the duration of the trial from taking the
             specific dietary supplements and fermented food products including probiotic,
             microalgae or beta glucan containing dietary supplements, fermented food products
             (such as yogurt, bean curd, etc.).

          -  Pregnant females (because baseline immune responses, are altered by pregnancy)

          -  Individuals unable to speak, understand and read English
