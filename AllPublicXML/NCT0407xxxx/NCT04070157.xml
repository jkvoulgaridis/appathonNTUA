  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stopping prescription opioid pain medications can be difficult due to withdrawal symptoms.
      This study will test if LUCEMYRA helps reduce withdrawal symptoms and helps more people
      reduce their opioid dose compared to placebo.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of LUCEMYRA in the treatment of opioid withdrawal during an opioid taper in
      subjects with chronic non-cancer pain.

      Subjects will begin a planned 14-day complete taper of their pre-study opioid medications and
      will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either LUCEMYRA or matching placebo. Study drug will be
      administered through the opioid taper and for 5 days after the opioid taper is completed.
      Study drug will then be tapered over a 4-day period for a total of approximately 21 days
      exposure to study drug.
