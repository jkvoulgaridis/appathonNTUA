    <textblock>
      In a randomized, doubleblind and placebo-controlled trial we assess both clinical and
      cellular effects of atorvastatin in patients with liver cirrhosis.

      162 participants will be allocated to atorvastatin 10-20 mg or placebo for 18 months.
      Clinical outcomes of survival, hospitalizations and safety will be evaluated. Also, the trial
      will investigate cellular functions in the liver by mass spectrometry proteomics, and single
      cell transcriptomics as well as exploring atorvastatin effects on different fenotypes by
      metagenomics.

      Introduction Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of statins in vascular
      and heart disease. Statins have antithrombotic effects, decrease oxidative stress and
      inflammation at the vessel wall, and improve endothelial dysfunction by increasing Nitric
      Oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells.

      Statins may also inhibit fibrogenesis in cirrhotic rats. In recent years, a series of pilot
      studies have assessed the effects of simvastatin on portal hypertension and risk of variceal
      bleeding.

      Lately, a large randomized trial showed an effect of simvastatin on mortality, but not on
      rebleeding in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding. Only a few studies have
      evaluated the efficacy of statins in cirrhosis of mixed etiology and decompensated cirrhosis.
      High quality clinical trials have focused on the hemodynamic effects of simvastatin on portal
      hypertension. Evidence supporting the use of statins in a real-world clinical setting, and
      data on the effects on inflammation and generation of fibrosis in the liver in humans is in
      high demand.

      Study setting The trial will take place in university hospitals with tertiary referral from
      other hospitals, departments and general practice. Patients referred to the outpatient
      clinics or hospitalized in the Gastro Unit, Amager Hvidovre Hospital (AHH) and Department of
      Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH), all Denmark are eligible
      for inclusion.

      Criteria for discontinuation of intervention:

      Discontinuation of trial drug will be performed in case of:

        -  The participant withdraws informed consent.

        -  Participants reach a primary endpoint (death or liver transplantation).

        -  The participant experiences serious adverse events that cause a risk to the
           participant's life or viability.

        -  The participant develops toxicity, intolerance or allergy associated with intervention
           medication.

        -  The trial participant is admitted to hospital for other morbidity that is incompatible
           with further treatment with atorvastatin.

        -  Blinding is revealed.

        -  A trial participant will be classified as dropped out of the study if the participant
           has ingested less than 55 % of atorvastatin or placebo at days 180.

      Statistical methods Data will be analyzed as repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA).
      Independent groups will be compared using unpaired T-test or non-parametric tests depending
      on normality distribution of data. Survival analysis will be performed by Cox-regression
      analyses.

      Statistical analyses will be performed as per protocol and as intention to treat analyses.

      Missing data will not be replaced but left blank in statistical analysis. For intention to
      treat analyses on repeated measures, the last available value will be carried forward to last
      value.

      Auditing The trial will be approved by the Danish Authorities of Health and Medicine, and may
      be subject to auditing by this institution, independent of the sponsor and investigators.
      Investigator allows direct access to source data and documents (including patient records)
      used in the trial for monitoring, auditing and/or inspection from GCP-units and The Danish
      Medicines Agency.

      Bio bank A biobank containing blood and liver tissue is established for the trial. The bio
      bank contains both samples for planned analyses, and in case of excess material, samples will
      be stored in a bio bank for future research.

      All investigations and results derived from the bio bank for future research will serve the
      purpose of improving the life and health of patients with liver cirrhosis.

      Research ethics approval Registration by the Danish Data protection Agency was conducted
      April 9, 2019. Application for approval at the Scientific Ethics Committees of the Capital
      Region of Denmark was submitted by: May 6, 2019

      Legal assistance Legal advice for contracts and agreements is provided by Centre for
      Innovation and Research, The Capital Region of Denmark c/o Cobis, Ole Maaløes vej 3, DK-2200
      Copenhagen N.

      Declaration of interests Authors of this protocol have no financial interests (holds no
      stakes, no ownership, and do not provide academic services) to any medical companies involved
      in producing or marketing statins.

      Insurance Patients participating in this trial will be insured through the national patient
      insurance. Trial participants are informed of this relation in written information of trial
      participant's rights. Sponsor and investigators are covered by statutory insurance from AHH
      and AUH.

      Dissemination policy This study will support an open access policy and aims to prepare all
      collected data to publication in anonymized form in an open access database after
      dissemination of the pre-defined trial outcomes.
