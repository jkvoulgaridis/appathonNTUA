  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The device that is the subject of this investigation is a robotic assistance module for
      driving a semi-autonomous electric wheelchair. This module is designed to accessorize the
      electric wheelchair to improve the safety conditions when driving an electric wheelchair,
      thus reducing the wheelchair accident rate on the one hand and facilitating access to the
      wheelchair to persons who can not claim it without the use of a safety device of this type.

      Each patient included will test a wheelchair equipped with a collision avoidance assistance
      module in 2 conditions, assistance activated or not. This evaluation will be carried out in 3
      standardized test circuits of increasing difficulty, one week apart. At each session, the
      patient will perform the circuit 6 times, including 3 with activated assistance, in a random
      order established upstream.

    <masking_description>To minimize bias, this study will be randomized and conducted in single blind.

Indeed, the investigative team will be in charge of the activation of the robotic module.</masking_description>

    <description>The cognitive load of tests under both conditions will be measured by the NASA-Task Load Index. It is in the form of six scales where the participant must assign a score between zero and one hundred to each of them, score indicating a growing level of intensity. Three dimensions relate to the demands imposed on the subject (mental, physical and temporal demands) and three to the interaction of a subject with the task (effort, frustration and performance)</description>

    <measure>Ease of Use Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction of the use of the electric wheelchair under the conditions will be evaluated by the self-questionnaire Ease of Use Questionnaire. It measures the subjective usability of a product or service. It is a 30-item survey that examines four dimensions of usability: usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning, and satisfaction. The questionnaires were constructed as seven-point Likert rating scales. Users were asked to rate agreement with the statements, ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).</description>
