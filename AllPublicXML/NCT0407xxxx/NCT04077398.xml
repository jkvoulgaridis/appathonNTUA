  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quadratus lumborum has since 2016 become standard of care for abdominal and
      retroperitoneal surgeries at UPMC-Shadyside Hospital, replacing paravertebral blocks, and as
      part of a broader multimodal analgesia institutional Enhanced Recovery After surgery
      protocol. Since the first description of this technique, several approaches to and anatomic
      targets within the quadratus lumborum plane have been described although their mechanism of
      action, spread, and relative clinical effectiveness remain areas of some debate. What is
      proposed here is to investigate the relative clinical effectiveness of the relationship high
      volume/low concentration of local anesthetic or low volume/ high concentration of local
      anesthetic.

    <masking_description>Randomization will be performed with software excel or spss. This randomization will be kept in an envelope. After the patient consents participation in the study, the investigator and the care provider will open the envelope and will perform the block according to the established in the randomization. The patient or the outcomes assessor will not have access to the volume and concentration used during the block. Will be the responsibility of investigators to keep in a safe place the information about the block received by the patients.</masking_description>
