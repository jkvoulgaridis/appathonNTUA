  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this acute randomized control study is to assess the feasibility of a
      low-to-moderate intensity Yoga intervention (i.e. sun salutations), and examine its effect on
      cognitive functioning, compared to engaging in aerobic activity or seated rest. Participants
      will include individuals who are currently experiencing symptoms of psychosocial stress or
      general anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomized to one of three groups: 1. Sun salutations (Yoga),
      2. Aerobic exercise (walking on a treadmill), 3. Seated rest (watching educational videos).
      Each activity will be 30 minutes in duration. Immediately before and after the 30 minute
      intervention, participants will undergo psychosocial and cognitive assessments. Prior to the
      intervention, participant's physical activity will be tracked for one week, via a consumer
      grade accelerometer.

      Baseline and post-intervention testing will include a cognitive battery, psychosocial
      questionnaires, flexibility testing and physiological measures.

    <measure>n-back task (Working memory)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline performance on the n-back at 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a computerized task measuring the working memory domain of cognition. The task had 3 conditions, namely, 0-back, 1-back and 2-back. Participants are presented with a series of stimuli one after the other. They have to decide whether the stimulus currently presented is the same as the stimulus presented &quot;n&quot; items before. For the 1-back task, participants have to decide whether the stimulus matches the stimulus presented 1 earlier. For the 2- back task, they have to decide whether the stimulus matches the stimulus presented 2 earlier. Reaction time and accuracy of the response are recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making test A and B (Global cognition)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline performance at 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a paper pencil task having 2 parts- Trails A and Trails B, with Trails B being more complex. In Trails A, there are 25 circles on a piece of paper numbered 1-25. Participants have to join these numbers in ascending order, as quickly as they can, without lifting their pencil. In Trails B, the participants have to join 25 circles in an ascending order, but they have to alternate between numbers and letters (1-A-2-B-3-C). Time to complete the task correctly is recorded.</description>

    <measure>Digit Symbol Substitution Test (Processing Speed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline performance at 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>In this task, participants are presented with a code key, in which numbers 1-9 are matched with a unique symbol. Then, they are presented with a sheet of paper having a series of symbols on it. Using the codekey, participants have to read aloud, the numbers that the symbols are associated with, in 2 minutes. The accuracy is recorded.</description>

    <measure>State Trait Anxiety Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline performance at 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire has 20 items for assessing state anxiety. Participants respond on a 4-point scale (&quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Very much so&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline performance at 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants have to indicate how stressed they are currently feeling on a scale ranging from 0 (none) to 100 (as bad as it gets). Higher scores mean more stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Mental Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline performance at 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants self rate their present moment feelings on a scale from 1 - 5 (1=not true at all, 5=very true) yielding a mean score across all 7 items, with higher scores indicating greater mental fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Focus of Attention</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to self rate (1 item) their focus of attention while engaged in the previous activity. Responses range from 0 (Internal thoughts) to 10 (external thoughts), with higher scores representing external focus of attention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feeling Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline performance at 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures how a participant is feeling at the present moment (valence) after a bout of exercise. It is an 11-point one-item measure ranging from +5 (very good) to -5 (very bad). Higher scores represent positive affect.</description>

    <measure>Rating of Perceived Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to self rate their feeling of exertion on a 11 point scale, ranging from 6 (no exertion) to 20 (maximal exertion), for the activity they were engaged in during the intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rating of Enjoyment and Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their enjoyment in terms of the delivery method and the intervention. This will include questions such as 'Did you like the video instruction for sun salutations?', 'Would you recommend this activity to your family and friends?' This will also include a semi-structured interview with those in the sun salutation group. For example, 'What about this activity did you find challenging?', 'To what extent did you enjoy the sun salutations activity?'</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rating of Technology Ease of Use and Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>

    <description>This group will be asked to participate in 25 minutes of low-to-moderate intensity Yoga. This acute session will include engaging in sun salutations, breathing exercises and relaxation. Sun salutations involves performing 10 postures in a particular sequence, and then repeating that sequence. Some of the positions include bending over and touching one's toes, and lying belly-down on the ground and pushing up from ground while arching backwards. The activity will begin as a low intensity activity for the first 5 minutes, and the intensity will be gradually increased. Participants' heart rate will be measured before and after the intervention. The intervention will be delivered by a video displayed on a tablet device. An orientation session in the beginning will familiarize participants with the activity.</description>

    <intervention_name>Aerobic exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>This group will be asked to walk on the treadmill for the same amount of time (i.e. 25 minutes) at a moderate intensity (50-70% of their maximum heart rate). Participants will receive an initial 5-minute orientation and then begin at a self-selected speed for the first 5 minutes. Heart rate will be measured and monitored by an undergraduate research assistant. Speed will be increased after 5 minutes if participants have not reached the moderate zone. If participants still have not reached the target heart rate zone by the 10-min mark, the incline of the treadmill will be increased by a 5% grade until the zone is reached.</description>
