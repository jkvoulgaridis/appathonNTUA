  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a subclinical complication of liver cirrhosis with a
      relevant social impact. Thus, there is urgent need to implement easy to use diagnostic tools
      for the early identification of affected patients.

      This study was aimed to investigate cerebral blood flow, systemic hemodynamics as well as
      endothelial function of cirrhotic patients with MHE, and to verify their change after
      treatment with rifaximin.
