      Digestive endoscopy center of the second affiliated hospital of medical college of zhejiang
      university and engineers of naki medical co., ltd. in Hong Kong independently developed an
      ai-assisted diagnostic model of digestive endoscopy in the early stage, namely the deep
      learning model.The deep learning model through the early stage of the study, is able to
      identify lesions of digest tract.The sensitivity for the diagnosis of some diseases, such as
      colon polyps, is 99%. On the one hand, this auxiliary diagnostic model can guide endoscopic
      examination for beginners; on the other hand, it can improve the detection rate of lesions
      and reduce the rate of missed diagnosis; on the other hand, the overall operating efficiency
      of the endoscopic center is improved, which is conducive to the quality control of endoscopic
      examination. Now the AI-assisted diagnostic model has been further improved, and it is
      planned to carry out further clinical verification in the digestive endoscopy center of our
      hospital. It is connected to the endoscopic system of our hospital and used simultaneously
      with the existing image-text system of endoscopy to compare the practicability, sensitivity
      and specificity of AI-assisted diagnosis model in the diagnosis of digestive tract diseases,
      and focus on the quality control of endoscopic examination.

      ai-assisted diagnostic model of digestive endoscopy in the early stage, namely the deep
      learning model。The deep learning model through the early stage of the study, is able to
      identify lesions of colon polyps, colorectal cancer, colorectal apophysis lesions, colonic
      diverticulum, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcer, gastric polyps, submucosal uplift, reflux
      esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, esophageal polyp, esophageal erosion, esophageal ectopic
      gastric mucosa and esophagus varicosity, esophageal cancer, esophageal papilloma, etc.The
      sensitivity for the diagnosis of some diseases, such as colon polyps, is 99%. On the one
      hand, this auxiliary diagnostic model can guide endoscopic examination for beginners; on the
      other hand, it can improve the detection rate of lesions and reduce the rate of missed

    <measure>Changes of detection rate of digestive tract lesions assisted by artificial intelligence gastroenteroscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic examination has a high dependence on the clinical experience and status of endoscopists, and the quality of endoscopic examination of endoscopists can be reduced by high-load work, and problems such as incomplete examination site coverage, incomplete detection of lesions, and incomplete image collection are easy to occur. Artificial intelligence does not have this weakness. It does not reduce its ability to work over a long period of time, and its assistance is expected to improve the detection rate of lesions</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The accuracy of AI-assisted diagnostic model evaluating the intestinal readiness score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of intestinal preparation determines the quality of colonoscopy, which is evaluated by endoscopists through the Boston score. The ai-assisted diagnostic model can also be automatically graded.The Boston bowel score is used to determine whether the bowel is adequately prepared. The Boston bowel score is divided into 4 grades (0~3 points) from worst to cleanest. The higher the score is, the better the bowel is prepared and more conducive to colonoscopy.</description>

    <arm_group_label>A: Model A</arm_group_label>
    <description>Mode A was silent mode, back-to-back with endoscopic physicians to simultaneously display endoscopic images and record video, but did not interfere with the operation of endoscopic physicians.After the operation, the AI model automatically generates an endoscopy report, which is compared with the official report given by the endoscopy doctor in the endoscopy system. If the difference is large, video verification shall be played back immediately or endoscopic examination shall be performed again before the patient wakes up</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>B: Model B</arm_group_label>
    <description>Mode B is a delayed reminder mode. If the lesion is found during the operation, it is required to be moved to the middle of the visual field within 5 seconds. If the lesion has been detected by the AI model (the lesion has been circled in the picture), but the doctor does not move the lesion to the middle of the visual field within 5 seconds, the AI system will give an alarm prompt</description>

  <arm_group>

    <description>Mode C is a real-time reminder mode, which is an alarm prompt when the focus is captured in the visual field.</description>
