  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the study are to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate
      intervention to promote smoking cessation and reduce secondhand smoke exposure for Korean
      Americans using a family-based intervention approach targeting Korean Americans ages 18 and
      above in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, CA, and to evaluate efficacy of the proposed
      intervention. The study is a randomized control trial targeting a total of 8 lay health
      workers (LHW) and 48 dyads of a daily smoker and a partner who will attend intervention
      sessions together. The research question is: Can a family-based lay health worker outreach
      intervention promote smoking cessation and reduce SHS exposure among Korean Americans?
