  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of the study is that Bezlotoxumab is well tolerated and effective in
      reducing the recurrence of ICD (Clostridium Difficile infection) in patients with a high risk
      of recurrence in the first episode of ICD.

      As a consequence, the number of readmissions and hospital stays, will be reduced in patients
      treated with Bezlotoxumab.

      This is a comparative study of patients with a high risk of recurrence of ICD in the first
      episode, treated with Bezlotoxumab (together with standard ICD therapy), with patients with
      first episode of ICD from a paired retrospective cohort (1: 2) using a propensity score.
