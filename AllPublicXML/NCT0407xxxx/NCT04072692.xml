  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to comprehend the association between the trigger digit and
      carpal tunnel syndrome based on the quantification of the tendon and nerve characteristics.
      It includes three parts.

      The first part is an observational study. The aim of the first part is to attempts to measure
      the gliding and morphological characteristics of the flexor tendons and median nerve in the
      longitudinal or cross-sectional directions via the ultrasonographical images incorporating
      with the motion capture experiment of the wrist and fingers. The gliding and morphological
      features of the tendons and nerve will be compared under different postures or movement
      patterns of the wrist and hand.

      The second part is an interventional study. The aim of the first part is to establishes a
      novel hybrid rehabilitation protocol which combines the tendon gliding exercise with nerve
      mobilization to treat either the trigger digit or the carpal tunnel syndrome. A randomized
      controlled trial to investigate the short-term treatment effect and the follow-up examination
      will be carried out as well.

      The third part is an observational study. The aim of the first part is to investigate the
      effects of carpal tunnel release on the hand performances from functional perspectives. In
      addition, a novel wrist orthosis will be developed to eliminate the bowstringing effect of
      the flexor tendons after carpal tunnel release.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The program includes pre-test, 8 times training, post-test and follow-up test.
For pre-test, subjects perform the specific hand movement under different exerting force conditions and 4 different angles of phalangeal joints and be asked to do Phalen test, Grip strength test, Pinch test and SWMT test. It takes 40 minutes.
For post-test, the same procedure is repeated again after completing all training.
For follow-up, the same procedure is repeated again 6 months after completing all training.
After pre-test, 8 times hybrid rehabilitation training are asked. There are two times in a week, and all training will be completed in one month. Each time will take forty minutes.</description>
