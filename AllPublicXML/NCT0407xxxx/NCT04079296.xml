  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASP7517.

      This study will also evaluate the clinical response of ASP7517 as well as other measures of
      anticancer activity of ASP7517.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 parts: phase 1 dose escalation and phase 2 dose expansion.

      Phase 1 Dose Escalation:

      Approximately 18 subjects with either relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML or R/R higher risk MDS
      will be enrolled. Participants will receive 2 single doses of ASP7517 via intravenous
      infusion. Dosing will occur on day 1 of each cycle. Each cycle is defined as 28 days with a
      total of 2 treatment cycles.

      Participants must be managed under hospitalization for at least 7 days during the first cycle
      of the dose escalation phase. In addition, prior to hospital discharge, participant safety
      must be ensured by performing medical tests and procedures listed on day 8 of cycle 1 and
      tests considered clinically necessary to evaluate the participant's general condition and
      adverse event (AE) resolution. The participant should also be followed on an outpatient basis
      on planned visits during cycles 1 and 2 after hospital discharge during the dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) assessment period to closely monitor any AEs. Participants may be hospitalized
      days 1 to 7 during cycle 2 based on investigator opinion.

      Phase 2 Dose Expansion:

      Approximately 104 participants per dose level will be enrolled. Each dose level may enroll up
      to 52 R/R AML participants and up to 52 R/R higher risk MDS participants. Both groups of
      participants will enroll in parallel and independently. The number of dose levels
      investigated during phase 2 will be based upon the data from phase 1. When escalation and
      expansion cohorts are both open for enrollment, enrollment into escalation cohorts takes
      priority such that participants who are eligible for both will be preferentially enrolled in
      the escalation cohorts.

      Screening and enrollment are temporarily halted due to COVID-19.

    <measure>Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as any of the following events that occur within 28 days starting with the first dose on cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) and that is considered to be related to investigation product (IP). The severity of AEs will be assessed according to National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0. DLT is defined as follows: non-hematologic AEs that are ≥ grade 3; confirmed Hy's law case; new onset of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (with minimum of 2 grade worsening from baseline) within 24 hours of dosing; prolonged myelosuppression, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 500/μL for more than 28 days off therapy and in the absence of evidence of active leukemia or MDS in the marrow or blood, will be considered as a DLT.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs will be graded using NCI-CTCAE guidelines, version 5.0.</description>
