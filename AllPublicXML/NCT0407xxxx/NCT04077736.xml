  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare, systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by
      episodic inflammation of cartilaginous structures. Pro-inflammatory chemokines involved in
      the recruitment of monocytes and modulation of macrophage function, such as monocyte
      chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1β, and interleukin (IL)-8, are
      significantly elevated in active RP compared with controls.The activation of monocytes and
      macrophages may play an important role in the pathophysiology of RP. The levels of serum Th1
      cytokines (interferon, IL-2 (IL-2) and IL-12 (IL-12) were significantly correlated with
      disease status，which suggested that RP may be a Th1-mediated disease process. IL-2 is a kind
      of lymphocyte growth factor. At lower doses, regulatory T cells exhibit dominant
      amplification because of their more sensitivity to IL-2. Regulatory T cells can inhibit the
      growth of effector T cells and then play an immunosuppressive role. The investigators
      hypothesized that low-dose IL-2 could be a novel therapy in active RP patients. This clinical
      study will explore the efficacy and immunological evaluation of low dose IL-2 in the
      treatment of RP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten patients with active RP at 18 to 70 years of age were enrolled. Without changing the
      original treatment plan, IL-2 1 million units was administered subcutaneously five days every
      week for 4 weeks and then once a week for 8 weeks. All patients were followed up for 3 months
      after treatment. The clinical symptoms, disease score scale, laboratory parameters, immune
      cell subsets and cytokines should be monitored during the treatment and follow-up.
