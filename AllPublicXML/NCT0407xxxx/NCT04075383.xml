  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the research project will be to compare immediate and early unitary implants
      for the rehabilitation of missing teeth in the upper aesthetic region. A randomized
      controlled trial will be conducted in parallel with 120 individuals (60 per group) who are
      above 18 years of age, periodontally healthy, and who need to perform only one unit implant
      in the upper aesthetic region between the second premolars. In the immediate implant group,
      the tooth will be extracted in a minimally traumatic manner and the implant will be installed
      immediately after the fresh alveolus. Bovine bone replacement will be inserted into the gap
      between implant and vestibular wall of the alveolus, and an immediate temporary will be
      installed immediately. The provisional will be maintained for 3 months when the definitive
      crown will be made. In the early implant group, the tooth will be extracted, and after 2
      months the implant will be installed with the use of bovine bone substitute to restore the
      buccal bone contour. The implant will be submerged, and 3 months of osseointegration will be
      performed reopening and final crown making. In both groups, the individuals will be followed
      for 1 year after the installation of the definitive crown. The outcomes evaluated will be
      patient satisfaction (main outcome), gingival phenotype, visible plaque, depth of probing,
      submucosal bleeding, proximal radiographic bone level, tomographic vestibular bone volume,
      perimplant clinical aesthetic indexes (Esthetic Pink Score and Papillary Index), evaluation
      three-dimensional tissue from intra-oral scanning and 3D printing, implant-related quality of
      life, and early and late implantation failures. Linear and logistic models of generalized
      estimating equations that take into account the longitudinal character of the study will be
      used for data analysis.
