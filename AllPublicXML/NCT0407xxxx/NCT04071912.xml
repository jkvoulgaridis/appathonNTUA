  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in surgery and rehabilitation, the return to sport after anterior cruciate
      ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery remains a major challenge.

      challenge. Among the objective criteria retained, the isokinetic muscle strength assessment
      is an increasingly practiced evaluation and it is recommended to carry out follow-ups at 3-4
      months (intermediate) and at 6-8 months (final) after surgery. However, the factors
      associated with muscle imbalance are uncertain and the threshold values of the intermediate
      isokinetic strength test (3-4 months) are inconsistent. In a retrospective analysis, the
      investigators aim to assess the predictive criteria for muscle imbalance after ACL
      reconstruction surgery.

      The investigators aim to retrospectively studied all sports patients who had a muscle
      evaluation at 3-4 months and 6-8 months after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction
      surgery since January 2016. The objective criterion were based on the international
      guidelines for muscle imbalance after ACL surgery and return to sport, as a muscle deficit of
      less than 20% on knee extensor muslces and less than 10% on knee flexor muscles of the
      operated knee (vs. healthy).

      The investigators will study the predictive analysis of the intermediate muscle strength test
      to predict the risk of muscle imbalance on the final isokinetic muscle strength assessment.
      The investigators will also study the individual, injury and surgical criteria associated
      with muscle imbalance.
