  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the benefits of mindfulness training
      during an acute bout of physical activity. We will compare the combination of mindfulness
      training and physical activity to mindfulness training alone and physical activity alone in
      three 20 minute sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate whether mindfulness training during a single bout (20 minutes) of
      physical activity influences ratings of perceived exertion, feeling states and physiological
      response (blood pressure and heart rate) during physical activity. Changes in affect and
      cognitive function pre- and post- physical activity bout will also be assessed. The effects
      of mindfulness training during an acute bout of physical activity will be compared to
      mindfulness training alone and acute physical activity alone. This research will contribute
      to larger questions of how to increase rates of physical activity in the general population
      and make physical activity more enjoyable.

    <measure>Influence of mindfulness training on perceived exertion as measured by the Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion scale (RPE).</measure>
    <time_frame>36 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived exertion will be measured using Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion scale. Participants will be asked how hard they perceive they are working every minute during the intervention on a scale from 6 to 20, with 6 being no work and 20 being working very, very hard.</description>

    <measure>Influence of mindfulness training feeling state as measured by the Feeling Scale (FS).</measure>
    <time_frame>36 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate how they feel, using the Feeling Scale (FS), every minute during the intervention. The scale ranges from -5 to +5 with -5 being very bad and +5 being very good.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention effect on mindfulness as measured by the State Mindfulness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>36 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness will be assessed using the State Mindfulness Scale, after the intervention, at each study visit. Participants will rate their awareness of physical sensations and mental events (emotions, thoughts) on a scale of 1-5. 1=not at all, 2= a little, 3=somewhat, 4=well, 5=very well. There are 21 items on the scale. A higher score is indicative of greater mindfulness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention effect on affect as measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>36 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Affect will be measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) before and after the intervention. Participants rate how they have felt this week, in response to words describing feelings, on a scale from 1-5; 1=Very Slightly or Not at all, 2= A Little, 3= Moderately, 4= Quite a bit, 5= Extremely. PANAS is divided into two sub-scales for positive and negative affect. Positive affect scores range from 10-50 with a higher score representing higher levels of positive affect. Negative affect scores also range from 10-50 with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>

    <measure>Intervention effect on anxiety will be assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before and after the intervention. Participants will rate how they feel right now, in response to 20 statements about how people may feel, on a scale of 1-4; 1=Not at all, 2= Somewhat, 3=Moderately So, 4= Very much so. Total score ranges between 20 and 80 with 20-37 being no or low anxiety, moderate anxiety=38-44, and high anxiety=45-80.</description>

    <measure>Intervention effect on cognition as measured by NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (Flanker)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the NIH toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test on an iPad before and after the intervention. The Flanker test is scored as a combination of the accuracy score and reaction time score. Score range is 0-10 with a higher score indicating a better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>36 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test on an iPad before and after the intervention. The test is scored as the total number of items correctly recalled and sequenced. Score range is 0-26, with a higher score indicating a better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>36 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test on an iPad before and after the intervention. The test is a measure of cognitive flexibility. The test is scored as a combination of the accuracy score and reaction time score. Score range is 0-10 with a higher score indicating a better performance.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete the NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test on an iPad before and after the intervention. The test is scored as the sum of the number of items answered correctly in 90 seconds. Score range is 0-130. Higher scores indicate faster speed of processing.</description>
