  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CHORAL Flow is a randomised, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of
      evolocumab on coronary flow at 12 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evolocumab is a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor which has
      been shown in the Fourier Trial to reduce major cardiovascular events in statin-treated
      patients with raised LDL cholesterol compared to placebo. The precise mechanisms via which
      evolocumab therapy impacts cardiovascular outcomes remain unknown. Coronary blood flow is a
      powerful predictor of clinical outcomes across a wide range of cardio-circulatory disorders
      as well as within normal subjects. Improvement in coronary microvascular function and
      coronary flow, therefore, could potentially represent one of the core pathways via which
      evolocumab offers cardiovascular protection. In the CHORAL Flow Study patients will undergo
      invasive and non-invasive physiological assessment with coronary flow measurements before and
      after 12 weeks of therapy with evolocumab or placebo. Patients in the treatment arm will go
      on to have a further non-invasive assessment of coronary flow at 24 weeks of therapy in a
      single blinded fashion.
