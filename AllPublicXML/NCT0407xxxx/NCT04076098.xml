  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local drug delivery provides higher concentrations in the availability of the drug at the
      specific infected sites with the advantage of sustained release. Periocline is a long acting
      , sustained release local drug delivery system consisting of 2% minocycline hydrochloride in
      an ointment containing microcapsule type particles. Periocline contains 20mg of minocycline
      in 0.5 gm of gel in a disposable polypropylene applicator (2% minocycline HCl).

      Research has yielded promising results with the local application of minocycline in the
      treatment of periodontal disease, compared with other non-surgical therapies. However, there
      is scarcity of reports on the use of local delivery agents with respect to new range of
      putative pathogens in advanced periodontitis, wherein the tissue invasive anaerobic organisms
      are present and possibly compromised host response, hence resulting in an exaggerated
      breakdown of periodontal tissues at the affected sites. The effect of Minocycline on new
      putative pathogens, such as Filifactor alocis and oral phylotypes of phyla Synergistetes and
      TM7 (referred to hereafter as oral Synergistetes and oral TM7s), has not been investigated
      yet.

      Hence, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a local delivery agent
      containing minocycline (Periocline, Sunstar, Japan) as an adjunct to SRP in the treatment of
      deep periodontal pockets around teeth in advanced periodontitis and the antimicrobial effect
      on the red complex and the new putative pathogens.

      The subjects for this randomized controlled, parallel arm study will be selected from the
      primary health care in the Faculty of Dentistry, MAHSA University. In this clinical trial, 50
      patients with advanced periodontitis will be enrolled in the study.

    <description>Periodontal pocket is measured from the gingival margin to the base of the periodontal pocket using a UNC periodontal probe (which is graduated from 1mm to 15mm). The measurement of periodontal pocket depth is a continuous scale. PPD is taken at 6 points on each tooth. The mean of the PPD will be obtained for each patient and subjected to statistical analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change in the numbers of Periodontal pathogens</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque samples taken from periodontal pockets on paper points will be first stored and later analysed for the presence and number of periopathogens using quantative Polymerase Chain Reaction (q-PCR).
The following periodontal pathogens will be assessed:
Red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia,and Treponema denticola)
Filifactor alocis,
oral phylotypes of phyla Synergistetes
Phylum TM7</description>

    <measure>Plaque Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>change in Plaque scores (Silness and Loe Plaque index, 1964) The score ranges from 0-3 and it is a continuous scale. '0' - no plaque '1' - thin plaque which is not visible by naked eye '2' - Moderate accumulation plaque seen by naked eye '3' - abundance of plaque.
Calculation total score /number of surfaces examined = Index score for each patient. Mean plaque score is calculated for all the patients.</description>

    <measure>Bleeding Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>change in Bleeding scores (Papillary bleeding index, Muehlemann 1977) The score ranges from 0-4 and it is a continuous scale. '0' - no bleeding '1' - Single discrete bleeding point '2' - Single line of blood appears '3' - Interdental papilla fills with blood after probing '4' - profuse bleeding after probing
Calculation total score /number of surfaces examined = Index score for each patient. Mean plaque score is calculated for all the patients.</description>
