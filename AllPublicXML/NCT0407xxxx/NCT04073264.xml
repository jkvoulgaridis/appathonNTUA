  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery (CD) rates are rising globally. about 30% of women delivered by CD in 2015
      only in the USA. This increasing CD rate has stimulated an interest in the potential short-
      and long-term morbidity of CD scars. In more than 50% of women with history of CD, a uterine
      scar defect, also called a &quot;isthmocele,&quot; defined as a disruption of the myometrium in the CD
      uterine scar, can be observed when examined by gel instillation sonohysterography 6-12 months
      after the CD. Uterine scar defects detected on ultrasound have been associated with prolonged
      menstrual bleeding and postmenstrual spotting, as well as with an increased risk of several
      obstetrical complications in subsequent pregnancies, including uterine dehiscence and/or
      rupture, scar pregnancy and placenta previa and accreta. Another screening method associated
      with uterine scar rupture in women with prior CD is ultrasonographic measurement of the
      thickness of the lower uterine segment, as pioneered by Rozenberg et al. in 1996. A
      meta-analysis by Kok et al. supports the use of the residual myometrial thickness (RMT) for
      predicting uterine rupture during vaginal birth after cesarean. Uterine scar defects have
      been associated with lower RMT.

      A growing body of evidence suggests that the surgical technique for uterine closure
      influences uterine scar healing and the RMT, but there is still no consensus about optimal
      uterine closure and type of suture. It is imperative to have evidence-based guidelines for
      each surgical step before recommending one technique over another.

      The aim of our trial is to evaluate the incidence of cesarean scar defect according to type
      of suture at the time of cesarean
