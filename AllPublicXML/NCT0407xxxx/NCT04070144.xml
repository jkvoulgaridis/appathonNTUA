  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation aims to demonstrate the first puncture success rate, as proxy of clinical
      benefit and clinical performance, of bioimpedance spectroscopy based spinal needle guidance
      method among pediatric hemato-oncology patients requiring lumbar punctures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the investigation is to demonstrate the claimed clinical benefit and
      safety of Injeq IQ-Tip™ system.

      IQ-Tip™ is similar to common spinal needles with a custom-made stylet that enables the
      real-time bioimpedance measurement at the tip of the needle. The needle is connected to the
      analyzer device, which provides real-time CSF detection during lumbar puncture from the very
      tip of the needle and by these means assists conducting the medical procedure.

      The investigation aims to demonstrate the first puncture success rate, as proxy of clinical
      benefit and clinical performance, of bioimpedance spectroscopy based spinal needle guidance
      method among pediatric hemato-oncology patients requiring lumbar punctures.

      The investigation is conducted in the pediatric hematology and oncology units of three
      Finnish university hospitals

    <time_frame>The assessment immediately following each lumbar puncture procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Each individual lumbar puncture procedure is assessed as either 'first puncture success' or '-failure'.
Success rate = Successes / All procedures
Definition of the first puncture success:
Only one skin puncture with the needle is allowed;
Multiple stylet removals and reinsertions are allowed;
Multiple needle reorientations are allowed as long as needle tip remains inside the skin;
Physician must be able obtain a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample that is sent to a laboratory analysis or to inject the intended medication to the patient's subarachnoid space; and
Physician conducting the puncture remains the same during the procedure</description>

    <measure>Post-dural puncture headache rate (PDPH)</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment during 7-day follow-up after each lumbar puncture procedure</time_frame>
    <description>PDPH defined as headache that:
worsens in sitting or standing position
eases when lying down
occurs within 7 days after the lumbar puncture procedure
Possible symptoms are recording using a diary filled by the patient or parents and verified by the study nurse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Erythrocyte count of CSF samples</measure>
    <time_frame>The laboratory analysis within 3 hours of the lumbar puncture</time_frame>
    <description>Erythrocyte (red blood cell) count according to laboratory analysis in units of 10^6/liter or 1/mm3</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of other complications and adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment during 7-day and four-week follow ups</time_frame>
    <description>E.g. PDPH or backache
Possible symptoms are recorded using a diary filled by the patient or parents and verified by the study nurse. Diary is an open questionare that is intended for recording any possible complication. Possible complications are not considered as pre-determined outcome measures, with the exception of Outcome #3 (rate of PDPH)
Four-week follow up conducted by the study nurse from the hospital registers</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aggregate sensitivity of CSF detection</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment immediately following each lumbar puncture procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The CSF detection performance of the investigational device is assessed by the physician.
Each individual lumbar puncture procedure is classified as either 'True Positive CSF detection (TP)', 'False Negative CSF detection (FN)' or 'Procedure failed (Fail)' by the investigator.
The aggregate sensitivity = Number of TPs / Total number of procedures</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aggregate false detection rate of CSF detection</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment immediately following each lumbar puncture procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Each individual lumbar puncture procedure is classified as either 'One or more False Positive CSF detections (FP)' or 'No False Positive CSF detections (TN)'.
The aggregate false detection rate = Number of FPs / Total number of procedures</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of required attempts per successful lumbar puncture procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment immediately following each lumbar puncture procedure</time_frame>
    <description>In line with definition of 'the first puncture success rate', attempt is defined as: any new penetration of skin is considered a new attempt.
Lumbar puncture is considered successful irrespective of the number of punctures if the CSF sample was eventually obtained and/or the injection of medicine could be performed</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of failed lumbar puncture procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment immediately following each lumbar puncture procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Procedure is considered failed if physicians, even after multiple attempts, conclude that the lumbar puncture cannot be completed with available personnel or equipment due to any reason</description>
