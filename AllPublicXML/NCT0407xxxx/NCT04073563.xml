    <measure>Overall success at 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall success is defined as the participant who meet the following five criteria:
Pain/disability (ODI) success, defined as at least a 15-point improvement from baseline;
Fusion success as defined in primary outcome 2.
Neurological success, defined as maintenance or improvement in neurological status;
No SAE related to the TLIF grafting material or interbody device; and
No secondary surgeries at index level that are related to the TLIF grafting material or interbody device</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fusion success at 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Fusion success at each treatment level must demonstrate:
Evidence of bridging bone via CT. Solid fusion is based on evidence of continuous bone bridging from the superior to the inferior vertebral body at the target level(s) in at least 1 of the following locations: right lateral, left lateral, anterior, posterior, or through the PEEK implant.
No evidence of motion as defined by less than 3mm translational motion and less than 5o in angular motion at each treated level</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to fusion</measure>
    <time_frame>From surgery to 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The first time point when a subject's fusion status has been determined to be a success per the fusion success criteria</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ODI success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used. The ODI scale ranges from 0-100. The best score is 0 (no disability) and worst is 100 (maximum disability). Success will be defined as pain/disability improvement postoperatively according to the following definition: Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score ≥ 15 points</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leg pain success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scales (NRS 0-10) will be used to measure leg pain, with a score of 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as it could be. Success for leg pain is defined as at least 20% improvement from pre-operative score: (Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score) / Preoperative Score ≥ 20%</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Back pain success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scales (NRS 0-10) will be used to measure back pain, with a score of 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. Success for back pain is defined as at least 20% improvement from pre-operative score: (Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score) / Preoperative Score ≥ 20%</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall neurological success is defined as maintenance or improvement in four key neurological assessments: motor function, sensory function, reflexes, and straight leg raise. In order to be considered a success, each element in the motor, sensory, reflexes, and straight leg raise examinations must remain the same or improve from the time of the preoperative evaluation to the time period evaluated. Therefore, if any one motor, sensory, or reflexes element does not stay the same or improve, then a subject will not be considered a success for neurological status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serious Adverse Events related to TLIF grafting material or interbody device up to 24 months</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
