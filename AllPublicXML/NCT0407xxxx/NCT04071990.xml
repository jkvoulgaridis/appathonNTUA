  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With a lifetime prevalence of 1-3% Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and
      disabling psychiatric disorder with considerable burden for the individual and society.
      Cognitive-behavioural group therapy (CBGT) is effective in reducing the intensity of OCD
      symptoms and it improves the OCD patient's quality of life. There is also growing evidence
      that family accommodation (FA) maintains and/or facilitates OCD symptoms, reinforces fear and
      avoidance behaviours in patients with OCD and is associated with family burden. Considering
      the promising results of involvement of family in CBGT on OCD symptoms and FA, the current
      study aims at investigating the effects of the involvement of the family in a 12-week CBGT
      protocol on the OCD symptoms, FA, burden, QOL, anxiety and depressive symptoms in OCD
      patients and their live-in relatives. Eighty patients with OCD and their live-in family
      members (partner, parent, sibling, â€¦) between 18-65 years old will be included in this
      randomized controlled trial. Patients and family members will be randomly assigned to CBGT
      with the involvement of family or to CBGT without involvement of family. The primary goal of
      this study is to evaluate the effects of the involvement of live-in family members during a
      12-week CBGT on OCD symptomatology and family accommodation during a 12-month follow-up
      period. In a secondary stage, we will explore whether the involvement of live-in family
      members during a 12-week CBGT will ameliorate anxiety and depressive symptoms, QOL, family
      functioning and burden in the patients and their live-in family.

      Participants will be recruited at the Centre for OCD at the Ghent University Hospital (UZ
      Gent) located in Belgium. A group of 80 patients and 80 live-in family members (partner,
      parent, sibling), between 18 and 65 years old. The patients with OCD will be selected based
      on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive
      disorder using the semi-structured Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI
      screening version 7.0.2)(60). Other inclusion criteria are (a) the OCD patient with a score
      of at least 16 on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), (b) patient and family
      member fluent in Dutch and (c) both willing to attend all treatment sessions together. To
      maximize the generalizability of our sample, we did not exclude patients if they had comorbid
      mood or anxiety disorders, as long as OCD was the principal diagnosis. Patients and family
      members will be recruited before randomization, because the aim of this study is to
      investigate the impact of the involvement of the family in the CBGT. At the start of the
      experiment we will ask patients and their family members to sign the informed consent.
      Randomization occurs after oral and written informed consent and patients and family members
      will be notified about the treatment condition after randomization. After randomization the
      patient and family member will be allocated to one of the two treatment arms: (a) CBGT with
      involvement of family of family-based CBGT (FB-CBGT) (intervention) or (b) CBGT without
      involvement of family (control). The CBGT program exists of a fixed 12-week protocol,
      involving psycho-education, exposure and response prevention (ERP), cognitive restructuring,
      and the discussion about the family system.

    <description>The Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (BPNSFS) -addresses both need satisfaction and frustration in relationships. Whereas need satisfaction is associated with well-being, need frustration is associated with ill-being.
