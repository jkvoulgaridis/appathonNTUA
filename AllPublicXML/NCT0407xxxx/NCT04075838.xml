  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery-oriented approach has been promoted in psychiatric rehabilitation in recent years.
      This approach emphasizes that people with mental illness can live a hopeful life even though
      the symptoms still exist. However, few recovery-oriented programs are available in Taiwan.
      This study aimed to develop of a recovery-oriented program for people with mental illness and
      investigate its feasibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study participants with mental illness were from a community mental health center in the
      south of Taiwan. The recovery-oriented program was conducted by a group leader, a senior
      occupational therapist, with one supervisor and one observer. The program was designed based
      on Pathways to Recovery, a self-help book published by University of Kansas. Participants
      attended a 1-hour class per week. The teaching methods included didactic presentation, peer
      exchange, group discussion, and practice. The group leader, supervisor, and observer reviewed
      the content and participants' performance after each class and made content adjustments if
      needed.

    <measure>Stages of Recovery Scaleï¼šChange from Baseline at 10 weeks and 18 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 weeks, 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 45 items, with six subscales: the sense of hope, disability management/taking responsibility, regaining autonomy, social functioning/role performance, overall well-being, and willingness to help. It has good internal consistency and proper construct validity. The SRS utilizes a 4-point rating scale: never (0), seldom (1), sometimes (2), and often (3). Higher scores indicate better recovery. The developers also provide the cutoff scores for four recovery stages: Stage 1 (overwhelmed by the disability), 0-57; Stage 2 (struggling with disability), 58-90; Stage 3 (living with disability), 91-119; and Stage 4 (living beyond disability), 120-135.</description>
