  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of three different doses of
      candidate hexvalent vaccine in comparison to co-administration of EupentaTM Inj. and Imovax®
      Polio in separate injections at four weeks after completion of three-dose primary series at
      6-10-14 weeks of age when administered to healthy infants and thereby to select the optimal
      dose of candidate vaccine
