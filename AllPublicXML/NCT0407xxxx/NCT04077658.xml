  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two arm study comparing smartphone based heart rate variability biofeedback using
      the HeartMath app and InnerBalance sensor to waitlist control on migraine quality of life.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether there is any superiority between
      an 8-week program of app based HRV biofeedback (HeartMath) compared to wait list control in
      migraine quality of life. Investigators will also look:

        -  To determine whether there is any superiority between an 8-week program of app based HRV
           biofeedback (HeartMath) and wait list control in depression in people with migraine.

        -  To determine whether there is any superiority between an 8-week program of app based HRV
           biofeedback (HeartMath) and wait list control in anxiety in people with migraine.

        -  To determine whether there is any superiority between an 8-week program of app based HRV
           biofeedback (HeartMath) and wait list control in insomnia in people with migraine.

    <measure>Change in anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using slope of reduction in eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8), The PHQ-8 uses a 4-point Likert scale to assess depressive symptoms. The score range is 0 to 27. Scores 5-9 indicate &quot;mild&quot; symptoms, 10-14 &quot;moderate&quot;, and â‰¥20 &quot;severe&quot; depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change insomnia</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using slope of reduction in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The ISI is a 7-item questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning awakening problems; sleep dissatisfaction; interference of sleep problem with daytime functioning; noticeability of sleep problems by others; and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale (0-4) is used to rate each item, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>
