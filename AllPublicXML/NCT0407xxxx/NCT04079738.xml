  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study augmenting TAK-659 action in relapsed/refractory AML by addition
      of the proteasome inhibitor Ixazomib. Phase I of the study will determine the safety,
      tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of TAK-659 and Ixazomib.
      During the phase I, dose escalation will be conducted according to a standard 3+3 dose
      escalation schema, and up to 18 response-evaluable patients will be enrolled. Phase II of the
      study will evaluate the efficacy of the combination by measuring the overall response rate
      (ORR).

             a bone marrow aspirate during screening for submission to Foundation One, Mayo,
             Tempus, Quest, ARUP or an institutional CLIA-certified laboratory and ordered as
             standard of care. If bone marrow aspiration has failed, a peripheral blood sample with
             circulating blasts may be substituted. Screening reports on tumor cytogenetics and/or
             mutation assays (eg, FLT-3, and NGS) performed as part of the standard of care will be
             recorded in the study database or obtained at the time of screening if not previously
             available.

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through 180 days after the last dose of study drug, or

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are
                  not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be

             noncytotoxic agents, and patients have to have recovered from acute toxicities of
             these therapies. Patients who are on hydroxyurea may be included in the study and may
             continue on hydroxyurea for the first 21 days while participating in this study. NOTE:
             For patients with a white blood cell count &gt;50,000/uL, hydroxyurea may be used to
             control the level of circulating leukemic blast cell counts prior to study entry, and,
             if needed, concomitantly while on TAK-659 treatment during the first 21 days of the
             study.

          -  Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling, and transfusion support.

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the protocol; all screening labs to
             be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.

             could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially jeopardize the safety of the patient
             or interfere with the objectives of the study.

          -  Prior treatment with investigational agents ≤ 21 days or ≤ 5 half-lives (whichever is
             shorter) before the first dose of study treatment. A minimum of 10 days should elapse
             from prior investigational therapy to initiating protocol therapy.

          -  Persistent clinically significant toxicity from prior chemotherapy that is Grade 2 or

                  arrhythmias, angina, pulmonary hypertension, or electrocardiographic evidence of
                  acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.

               -  Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) (men) or &gt;475
                  msec (women) on a 12-lead ECG during the Screening period.

               -  Abnormalities on 12-lead ECG including, but not limited to, changes in rhythm and
                  intervals that, in the opinion of the treating physician, are considered to be
                  clinically significant.

          -  Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral
             absorption or tolerance to study drugs, including difficulty swallowing tablets,
             diarrhea &gt; Grade I despite supportive therapy.

          -  Use or consumption of any of the following medications, supplements, or
             foods/beverages that are inhibitors or inducers of P-gp or strong reversible
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A within the indicated timeframes below. Note that use
             or consumption of these substances is not permitted during the study.

               -  Inhibitors of P-gp and/or strong reversible inhibitors of CYP3A within 5 times
                  the inhibitor half-life (if a reasonable half-life estimate is known), or within
                  7 days (if a reasonable half-life estimate is unknown), before the first dose of
                  study drug. In general, the use of these agents is not permitted during the study
                  except in cases where an AE must be managed. See SPM for a nonexhaustive list of
                  strong CYP3A reversible inhibitors and/ or Pgp inhibitors based on the FDA Draft
                  DDI Guidance.

               -  Strong CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitors or strong CYP3A inducers and/or P-gp
                  inducers within 7 days, or within 5 times the inhibitor or inducer half-life
                  (whichever is longer), before the first dose of study drug. However, if a patient
                  has a strong indication for fungal prophylaxis, then the moderate CYP3A
                  inhibitors fluconazole or isovuconazole (mold-active) is recommended for
                  prophylaxis, and the TAK-659 dose should be reduced to 60mg, along with increased
                  scrutiny for toxicity. Similarly, if the patient develops a fungal infection
                  during a productive intervention with TAK-659/Ixazomib combination, isovuconazole
                  (mold-active) should be used, along with increased scrutiny for toxicity. In
                  general, the use of these agents is not recommended during the study except in
                  cases where such an AE must be managed, and the intermittent schedule of
                  TAK-659/Ixazomib combination will not prevent profound neutropenia. See SPM for a
                  non-exhaustive list of strong CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitors or strong CYP3A
                  inducers and/or P-gp inducers based on the FDA Draft DDI Guidance.

               -  Grapefruit-containing food or beverages within 5 days before the first dose of
                  study drug.

          -  Lack of suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling.

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before study enrollment or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are
             not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.

          -  Patient has Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, or Grade 2 with pain on clinical
             examination during the screening period.

          -  Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the
             various formulations of any agent.
