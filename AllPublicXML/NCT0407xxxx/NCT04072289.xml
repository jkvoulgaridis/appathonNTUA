      The Use of the VisuMaxTM Femtosecond Laser Small-Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE)
      Procedure for the Correction of Myopia with or without Astigmatism study is a prospective,
      non-randomized, multicenter clinical study that will be conducted by the Navy Refractive
      Surgery Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, CA in collaboration with the U.S. Air Force
      59th Medical Wing, Wilford Hall Eye Center, TX, and the U.S. Army Warfighter Refractive Eye
      Surgery Program and Research Center, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, VA.

      Prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial with bilateral commercial
      treatment for FDA approved indications and unilateral treatments for investigational
      refractive errors. Data from each treated eye of subjects will be treated independently.
      Monovision treatments and retreatments of the study eye will not be allowed during the course
      of the study. Successful bilateral treatment is required for performance based testing and
      patient reported outcome testing. Subjects will be randomized into the 0.25 and 0.50 sphere
      only and spherical cylinder bins using a sequential alternating randomization with an equal
      number assigned to both bins. Other subjects will be assigned to the bins they qualify for as
      they are enrolled into the study. Appointments are given to patients requesting refractive
      surgery randomly.

      Three military sites in the U.S.A.: Navy Refractive Surgery Center, Naval Medical Center San
      Diego, CA in collaboration with the U.S. Air Force 59th Medical Wing, Wilford Hall Eye
      Center, TX, and the U.S. Army Warfighter Refractive Eye Surgery Program and Research Center,
      Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, VA.
