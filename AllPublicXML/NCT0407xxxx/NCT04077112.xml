      The purpose to the current study was to examine the comparative efficacy of a more condensed
      intensive version of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT; 5 days/week over the course of
      2 weeks) versus a more traditional weekly PCIT format (1 day/week over the course of 10
      weeks) in treating early childhood externalizing behavior problems (EBP).

      The purpose to the current study was to examine the comparative efficacy of a more condensed
      intensive version of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT; 5 days/week over the course of
      2 weeks) versus a more traditional weekly PCIT format (1 day/week over the course of 10
      weeks) in treating early childhood externalizing behavior problems (EBP). Using a randomized
      trial design, 60 young children (M child age = 4.33 years; range 2-6.92; 65% male; 85%
      Latinx) with elevated levels of EBP and their mothers were assigned to either I-PCIT (n = 30)
      or traditional PCIT (n = 30). Families completed pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments
      as well as a follow-up assessment 6-9 months following treatment completion. Across all
      assessments, mothers completed measures of child behavior, discipline practices, and
      parenting stress. Observational data on child behavior and parenting was also collected
      during three 5-minute standard situations that vary in the degree of parental control
      (child-led play, parent-led play, &amp; clean-up).

    <description>Mothers completed the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI; Eyberg &amp; Ross, 1978), a 36-item questionnaire that is designed to assess the presence of externalizing problems in children ages 2 through 16 years. The total intensity scale t-score was used in the current study as the main measure of EBP (α's .84-.93).</description>

    <description>The Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-4th Edition (DPICS-IV; Eyberg, Nelson, Ginn, Bhuiyan, &amp; Boggs, 2013), an established behavioral coding system was used to measure the quality of parent-child interactions across all assessments. Consistent with prior PCIT research, we created a composite of do skills (behavior descriptions, reflections, praises) and don't skills (questions, commands, and negative talk) reflecting behaviors parents are taught during treatment to use and not use during a child-led play. Undergraduate student coders, who were masked to treatment status, were trained to 80% agreement with a criterion tape and coded 20% of the observations a second time to assess reliability. Reliability for the do (r's range from .87 to .94) and don't skills were excellent (r's .99).</description>

    <measure>Change in Parenting stress</measure>

    <description>Mothers completed the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF; Abidin, 1983). The PSI-SF is a widely used 36-item self-report instrument for parents of children ages 1 month to 12 years measuring parental stress (Abidin, 1983). The PSI-SF total raw score was used to measure overall parenting stress (α's .88-.94).</description>

    <measure>Change in Discipline Practices</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure was collected prior to the start of treatment, immediately following treatment, as well as 6-9 months upon treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers completed the Parenting Scale (PS; Arnold, O'Leary, Wolff, &amp; Acker, 1993), a 30-item self-report measure that assesses parental discipline practices of children as young as 18 months. The effectiveness of discipline techniques is measured based on three factor scores (Laxness, Over-Reactivity, Verbosity). The Laxness (α's = .82-.88) and Over-Reactivity (α's = .67-.83) scales were used to assess parenting practices. Due to poor reliability of the Verbosity scale (.33-.70), this scale was removed from all analyses.</description>
