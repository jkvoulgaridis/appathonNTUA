  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and tolerability of Durvalumab plus
      Tremelimumab followed by concurrent Durvalumab plus bladder radiation in patients with
      localized muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, who are either
      Decipher-Non-Basal OR Decipher-Basal and cisplatin-ineligible. Eligible subjects will receive
      2 cycles of Durvalumab plus Tremelimumab followed by imaging and cystoscopy. Subjects whose
      cancer responds or is stable will receive a combination of 2 cycles of Durvalumab plus 6.5
      weeks of radiation to the bladder followed by imaging and a TURBT. Subjects whose cancer
      continues to respond and meets certain criteria will continue to receive Durvalumab for up to
      12 months from initial dose or until the cancer recoccurs or progresses, whichever occurs
      earlier. During this time, subjects may also receive intravesicular therapy if clinically
      indicated. Subjects will be followed for 5 years from initial dose.
