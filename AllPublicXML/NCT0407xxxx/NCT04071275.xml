    <textblock>
      In this study we will examine assess if treatment with transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) improve the analgesic effects of mirror therapy for patients with phantom
      pain of lower extremity. The study will include 3 arms: only mirror therapy, mirror therapy +
      sham tDCS, and mirror therapy + active tDCS.

    <textblock>
      Phantom pain following amputation is difficult to treat, resulting in many patients who
      suffer. One of the mechanisms suspected to contribute to phantom pain is abnormal plasticity
      and reorganization of the cortex.

      Mirror therapy is a behavioral technique that proven useful for the treatment of phantom
      pain, yet the analgesic effects are unfortunately moderate and not long lasting. The assumed
      underlying mechanism of mirror therapy treatment is the induction of neuronal plasticity in
      the opposite direction than the abnormal reorganization of the cortex (due to the
      amputation), and by that relive pain.

      tDCS is a non-invasive technique that allow the administration of low currents directly to
      the scalp. The currents affect the cortex, and result in changes to the membrane potential of
      neurons in the stimulated area. This in turn affects the tendency of those neurons to
      generate action potentials.

      It was hypothesize that combination of mirror therapy and tDCS treatment could result in
      additive effects. According to this hypothesis, the effects of the mirror therapy could be
      enhanced by the tDCS treatment. The aim of the current study is to investigate this
      hypothesis.

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of the average Phantom Limb Pain in the past week will serve as primary measure. The primary outcome is the changes in the VAS score between baseline week and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. VAS is a widely used, continuous measure of pain intensity, with scores ranging between 0-10, higher scores reflecting higher pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Changes in short-form McGill total score between baseline week and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) is a self-reporting measure of pain used for patients with a number of diagnoses. It assesses both quality and intensity of subjective pain. The MPQ is composed of 78 words, of which respondents choose those that best describe their experience of pain. Scores are tabulated by summing values associated with each word. The short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) is a shorter version of the original MPQ. The pain rating index has 2 subscales: 1. Sensory subscale with 11 words, and 2. Affective subscale with 4 words from the original MPQ. These words or items are rated on an intensity scale as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe. There's also one item for present pain intensity.</description>
