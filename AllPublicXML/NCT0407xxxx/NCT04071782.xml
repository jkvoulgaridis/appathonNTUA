  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the 6-month outcome of the
      Selution Sirolimus-coated Balloon for the treatment of long tibial occlusive disease (TASC C
      and D) in patients with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive arterial occlusion significantly reduces arterial perfusion, and may eventually
      lead to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The pathology gives rise to symptoms such as ischemic
      pain, slow healing wounds at lower extremity and gangrene. It places patients with
      multi-segment occlusion at high risks of amputations and mortality.

      The treatment methods for such long occlusive lesions are limited. Traditionally, the
      standard of care would be surgical revascularization. This is because lesion length have bee
      identified in several studies as an independent risk factor for the development of restenosis
      after angioplasty and/or stenting. However, thanks to recent advances in endovascular
      techniques, such as the utilization of subintimal technique for crossing long segment
      occlusions, it is now possible to employ endovascular techniques for suitable patients.

      The re-establishment of an in-line flow, even if only temporary, can allow tissue healing,
      which is vital in achieving limb salvage. In addition, the use of Drug Coated Balloons (DCB)
      and Drug Eluting Stents (DES) can potentially reduce restenosis rate.

      To date, there are few studies that have evaluated the performance of DCB in lesions that are
      longer than 10cm. We hope to evaluate the performance of the Selution DCB when used in
      treatment of such lesions.
