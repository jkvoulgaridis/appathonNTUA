      Abstract

      Background: Exchange transfusion is a highly complex procedure that requires high levels of
      expertise. Paediatricians trainees do not have adequate training because opportunities to
      perform this procedure in practice are scarce. This protocol seeks to compare two educational
      interventions for exchange transfusions that allow the students to develop competencies to
      perform the technique in an appropriate and safe way.

      Methods/design: A randomized parallel single-blind clinical trial with allocation by simple
      randomization to the educational intervention (simulation or a digital didactic environment).
      Students from the paediatric specialization who volunteer to participate will be included. A
      practical evaluation of the procedure will be performed through a simulated scenario using a
      standardized clinical case. The main outcome is defined as the result of evaluation using the
      Objective Structured Clinical Examination; superior performance will be defined when the
      percentage is greater than or equal to 85%, and nonsuperior performance will be defined when
      the result is less than 84%. The chi-square independence test or the Fisher exact test will
      be used to evaluate the effect of the interventions. Multivariate analysis will be performed
      using a non-conditional logistic regression model. Stata 14 ® software will be used.

      Discussion: Exchange transfusion is a procedure that requires expertise to achieve adequate
      outcomes. The inclusion of new educational strategies, such as simulation and digital
      didactic environments, is seen as a training option that can improve performance in clinical
      skills, reduce adverse events and increase the level of trust.

    <intervention_model_description>For the assignment of the students to the study groups, a randomization sequence will be generated through a computer-generated process. This process will be centralized in the paediatric office of the Universidad de La Sabana (University of La Sabana). The sequence will be generated through the Research Randomizer page (www.randomizer.org), and a permuted blocks strategy with block size of eight (8) will be used. The permuted blocks strategy and the size of the blocks will not be known by the researcher. To ensure the concealment of the random sequence, it will be placed in opaque envelopes at the time of assignment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the interventions, masking cannot be applied to the researcher or the student. However, blinding will be applied to the research team responsible for data analysis and to the expert neonatologist who will perform the evaluations of the video recorded procedures using the checklist. The database will be coded, and the identification code will not be available to the analyst.</masking_description>

    <description>Students assigned to this group will receive access to a digital didactic environment where they will have at their disposal the exchange transfusion guide and a complete video explaining the indications, the preparation of supplies and the newborn for the procedure, the management of medical devices required and a step-by-step description of the exchange transfusion technique. Finally, the student will see an integrated clinical case. This video will be developed by the neonatology and paediatric medical education teaching team in the simulation laboratory of the university using neonatal high-fidelity simulators, a simulated mother and the necessary medical equipment and supplies.</description>
