  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether a computerized inhibitory control
      training (ICT) will improve CBT treatment outcomes for Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating
      Disorder.

      This study involves a brief phone screen and baseline assessment to determine eligibility.
      Participants who are eligible for the study will receive 12 sessions of CBT treatment and
      will be randomly assigned to an ICT or ICT sham condition which will consist of completing
      ICT computer tasks on a daily basis during the first four weeks of treatment and booster
      sessions following treatment. Participants will also complete research assessments at
      mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up intervals. Research assessments include
      a battery of questionnaires, computerized tasks, interviews, and behavioral tasks.
