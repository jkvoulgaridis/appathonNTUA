  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is clinically used as the gold standard for detection of colon cancer (CRC) and
      removal of adenomatous polyps. Despite the success of colonoscopy in reducing cancer-related
      deaths, there exists a disappointing level of adenomas missed at colonoscopy. &quot;Back-to-back&quot;
      colonoscopies have indicated significant miss rates of 27% for small adenomas (&lt; 5 mm) and 6%
      for adenomas of more than 10 mm in diameter. Studies performing both CT colonography and
      colonoscopy estimate that the colonoscopy miss rate for polyps over 10 mm in size may be as
      high as 12%. The clinical importance of missed lesions should be emphasized because these
      lesions may ultimately progress to CRC8.

      Limitations in human visual perception and other human biases such as fatigue, distraction,
      level of alertness during examination increases such recognition errors and way of mitigating
      them may be the key to improve polyp detection and further reduction in mortality from CRC.
      In the past years, a number of CAD systems for detection of polyps from endoscopy images have
      been described. However, the benefits of traditional CAD technologies in colonoscopy appear
      to be contradictory, therefore they should be improved to be ultimately considered useful.
      Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), and computer vision have
      shown potential to assist polyp detection during colonoscopy.

        Based on the observed prevalence of adenomas (35%) among patients undergoing colonoscopies
        at our center within the last 12 months, a sample size of 322 subjects per arm could allow
        for a 90% power to show the non-inferiority (primary end-point) of the AI-aided arm by
        excluding that the one-side 95% CI will exclude a difference of 10% in favour of the
        standard group. Such sample size will also have a 80% power to detect as statistical
        significant (Î±=0.05; two-sided test) a 10% absolute increase in the detection rate of
        adenomas in the AI-aided arm (secondary end-point).
