  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess preliminary efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      LYS006 in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and to determine if LYS006 has an
      adequate clinical profile for further development in this indication.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, subject and investigator blinded, multicenter,
      non-confirmatory, parallel group, proof of concept study in patients with mild to moderate
      ulcerative colitis. This study consists of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, and a 12 week
      treatment period followed by a 30 day post treatment period safety follow up. The maximum
      study duration for each such including the 4 week screening period is 20 weeks.

      At the beginning of the treatment period, subjects will be randomized to one of the two
      following treatment groups in 2:1 ratio

        -  LYS006

        -  matching placebo
