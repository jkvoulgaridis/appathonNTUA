  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and activity in the body of a new drug
      called SerpinPC.

      The study will be split into 3 parts: Part 1a will be conducted in healthy male volunteers in
      the UK (up to 15) and Parts 1b and 2 will be conducted in haemophilia A &amp; B patients in
      Moldova and Georgia.

      Part 1a of the study will look at how safe the drug is when given as single doses to healthy
      volunteers at different strengths and via 2 different routes of administration (through a
      vein or via an injection under the skin).

      The study will also investigate how the levels of the drug in the blood change over a period
      of time and how the drug acts in the body by taking blood samples. These blood samples will
      measure the concentration of the drug in the blood and measure certain aspects of the blood
      to determine how the drug affects them.

      The study sponsor (ApcinteX) is developing this drug for the treatment of haemophilia A and
      haemophilia B, which are 2 types of rare blood disorders which affect the body's ability to
      form blood clots. Patients who have haemophilia A and B do not have certain clotting factors
      in their blood which means that they experience difficulty in stopping bleeding after injury
      and can be prone to extended periods of bleeding.

      Current treatments for haemophilia involves injections which replace the missing factors in
      the blood. However these treatments are short term and therefore patients require regular
      treatments in order to manage the condition.

      Therefore, there is a need to develop more effective treatments which provide longer term
      benefits. The aim of SerpinPC is to prevent bleeding rather than to have to treat bleeds to
      minimise pain and damage after they have occurred.
