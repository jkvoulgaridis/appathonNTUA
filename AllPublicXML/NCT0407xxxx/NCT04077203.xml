  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research examines whether biofeedback of glucose (i.e., knowledge of one's own glucose
      levels) in non-diabetic participants affects their health behaviours (e.g., eating,
      nutrition, exercise, etc.). This study utilizes wearable continuous glucose (CGM) technology,
      which provides personalized feedback to participants to allow them to self-monitor their own
      glucose levels.

      The purpose of this research is to examine whether self-monitoring and biofeedback of glucose
      levels improves health outcomes in non-diabetic participants. All participants will receive a
      continuous flash glucose monitor (consisting of an adhesive patch sensor and a handheld
      reader device) to wear for 14 days. Participants will be randomized into one of 2 groups:
      those receiving biofeedback (the ability to visualize their glucose levels via the handheld
      device), and the control group (receiving no biofeedback because the handheld device monitor
      will be occluded with black tape). Participants' objective and self-report health metrics
      will be measured before and after the 14-day intervention. The goal is to examine whether the
      biofeedback condition influences any daily activities or physiological measurements compared
      to the control condition, as a direct result of self-monitoring glucose levels.

    <measure>Self-reported positive and negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988). The scale consists of 20 items (10 for Positive Affect; 10 for Negative Affect), with each item rated on a 5-point scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Items are summed for Positive affect and Negative affect, with higher scores indicating a higher level of affect in each respective scale.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported general health</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12; Ware et al., 1996). The scale measures overall general self-reported physical and mental health using 12 items, on 2 to 6-point ordinal scales. The range of possible total scores is 12 to 48, with higher scores indicating better health.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983; Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988). This is a 4-item scale that measures overall stress with each item evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale. The range of possible total scores is 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating more stress.</description>

    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse et al., 1989). This is a 19-item scale that measures self-reported sleep quality and sleep disturbances, comprised of open-ended questions and scaled items evaluated on a 4-point Likert scale. The range of possible total scores is 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality.</description>
