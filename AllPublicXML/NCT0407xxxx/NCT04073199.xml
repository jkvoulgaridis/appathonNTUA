  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The shoulder stability has always been related to the rotator cuff complex, although more and
      more is contemplated the Teres Major muscle and its affectation in the shape of the trigger
      points within this pathology. As non-invasive measures for the deactivation of these
      myofascial points, Travell and Simons recommended the pressure maintained along with muscular
      stretch.

      Stretching are usually a technique widely used in our practice as physiotherapists and it is
      necessary to study its effects in the clinic. As an objective we plan to compare the effect
      of passive stretching in short lever according to the Orthopaedic Manual Therapy concept if
      it produces better result in the pain, the rank of movement and in the Function, with the
      effect of stretching by means of a long lever in affected patients of subacromial syndrome.

      This is a randomized controlled study with blind evaluator approved by the Ethical Committee
      of the Institut d'Investigació en atenció Primaria Jordi Gol.

      After checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria, you will be asked, voluntarily, that the
      patient sign informed consent. The variables will then be valued independent and dependent on
      the study. It will randomly be assigned to one of the three groups in the study. The 3 groups
      receive the protocolized treatment for the service they consist of In superficial
      thermotherapy, an educational talk and kinesitherapy. The intervention groups will receive
      alternate days, with a total of six sessions, the stretch corresponding to the group to which
      they have been assigned.

      In the case of the Long Lever Group, the intervention consists in a rotary stretch through
      the humerus as a mobile point. And in the case of the Short Lever Group a stretch of
      translocation through the scapula as a mobile point.

      The main variables used will be: age, side effects, habits involving the shoulder, pain
      intensity, pain threshold at pressure and function, among others. The dependent variables
      will be measured: pain intensity by means of Analogue Scale Visual, the function through the
      Constant-Murley test, the Movement Range with Goniometer and the Pressure Threshold Pain with
      a pressure gauge brand Stech.

    <description>The patient will be placed in a chair with a table in front, where can support the elbow and forearm in shape comfortable. The physiotherapist takes a clamp without pushing the Teres Major muscle and will perform progressive pressure with the algometer until the patient refers pain sensation.
The subjects who perceive pain with a threshold of pressure below 2kg / cm2 will be included in the study according to Andersen et al</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes needed for explain the movements required and make de measurements.</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of active mobility (active flexion, active extension, active abduction, active external rotation, active internal rotation) will be done in standing position with the back supported in the framework of a door (to unify positions and allow us to carry out the extension) with a goniometer for flexion, extension, abduction and external rotation, and with a tape metric for internal rotation (measurement from the thumb to the spinous process of C7)</description>

    <measure>Function</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes needed for the realization of the test</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of the function will be performed through the constant Constant-Murley test.
The Constant-Murley test abbreviated is a scale that measures the function of the shoulder on the basis of three components: pain, mobility and activities of daily life, resulting in a value maximum of 75 points, in the case that there is no limitation.</description>

    <description>the physiotherapist wears the limb passively towards flexion, external rotation and abduction until the physiotherapist has perception of stretch of the tissues (sensation terminal elastic firm according to the concept of Orthopaedic Manual Therapy for the soft tissue treatment) The patient's own weight stabilizes the proximal segment, in case that the scapula is not stable, the physiotherapist fixes with his free hand the scapula.
The technique will be performed two days a week, at intervals of 20 seconds of technique and 20 rest periods for ten reps (estimated time per session is 7 minutes approximate).</description>
