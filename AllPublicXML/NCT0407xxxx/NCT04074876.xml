  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stratification of perioperative risk is an essential moment in the preoperative
      evaluation of the patient undergoing surgery especially in the setting of urgency. There is a
      very broad group of indexes used in the stratification of preoperative risk, like ASA-PS
      (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status), RCRI (Revised Cardiac Risk Index)
      and NSQIP MICA (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Myocardial Infarction or
      Cardiac Arrest). The role of some laboratory markers such as BNP has also been demonstrated.
      The fundamental point of all these scores is cardiocirculatory compensation.

      There are concerns about the value of certain preoperative exams, especially in an urgent
      setting. Of them all, mostly chest X-ray is questioned. Chest X-ray, indeed, needs special
      costs, not always short execution times and the need for X-ray exposition. Furthermore, its
      utility is questionable in asymptomatic patients, in which there are often no alterations to
      be detected. Sensibility, for Thorax x-ray, is 41% for apical flow inversion, 27% for
      interstitial and 6% for alveolar oedema. In chronic decompensated patients, radiographic
      signs of congestion have a small diagnostic accuracy, being absent in 53% of patients with
      capillary pulmonary pressure between 16 and 29 mmHg and in 39% of those with wedge pressure
      more of 30 mmHg.

      Pulmonary echography is a known method, that has different possible applications in diagnosis
      of the lung parenchymal and pleural disease.

      Lung is made up for 80% of water. Extravascular lung water is physiologically less than 500
      ml and it increases in the case of pathology. Augmentation of this water is detected reliably
      by echography.

      B-lines are an echographic artefact that allows recognition of interstitial syndrome, having
      a sensibility of 93,4% and specificity of 93%. Presence of 3 or more of B-lines in 2 out of 4
      fields of each hemithorax can identify a cardiac problem like pulmonary sub-oedema or chronic
      heart failure and it is known as Diffuse Interstitial Syndrome. Thorax X-ray, instead,
      detects these situations only when extravascular water exceeds 30%. That's why echography has
      been proposed as a method for evaluation of extravascular pulmonary water. Moreover, when
      lung air component is lost enough in subpleural area, it is possible to find little
      consolidations. A method of reporting different grades of loss of aeration of the lung
      (normal pattern, isolated B lines, coalescent B lines and consolidation) has been proposed as
      a tool for monitoring the aeration itself.

      Pleural effusion is another sign that echography could detect. It is perfectly transonic and
      easy to see. Also, in this case, therefore, ultrasound is superior to X-ray, that has got
      sensibility, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 67%, 70% and 67% respectively.

      All this information could provide useful elements for preoperative patient management.
      Echography, indeed, is a bedside and real-time method, that can give rapid information about
      the cardiocirculatory situation of patients.

      Using this method, that is non-invasive and easy, useful elements could be obtained, that
      could contribute to a better overview of clinical conditions of the patient in the
      preoperative setting.

      In the particular field of urgency and, among all, in the setting of orthopaedic urgency for
      femur fracture, there is a need for a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation, giving that
      the patient has to be operated within 24-48 hours. This timing is often incompatible with a
      long and time-consuming evaluation of the patients. Furthermore, a complete cardiologic
      examination is beyond the requirements of international guidelines for intermediate surgery,
      since it doesn't change the perioperative management.

      In this particular setting, hence, pulmonary echography could represent a more reliable and
      easier tool compared to thorax X-ray, often performed in non-optimal conditions (supine
      position, only anteroposterior chest X-ray).

      In recent studies, percentage of major adverse cardiovascular events (atrial fibrillation,
      flutter, acute heart failure and non-fatal acute myocardial infarction) after hip fracture
      has settled around 24.8%. This data confirms the importance of a valid preoperative
      stratification in this setting.

      From this perspective, this study aims to evaluate the utility of pulmonary echography as a
      preoperative method of investigation.

      The principal aim is to evaluate the utility of the pulmonary echography in predicting the
      risk of patients undergoing urgent surgery for femur fracture.

      Alternative objectives are:

        -  Evaluate the predictability of LUS (lung ultrasound score) on the occurrence of MACE
           (major adverse cardiovascular events)

        -  Verify feasibility of echographic evaluation in the estimation of fluid tolerance of
           patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery.

        -  Evaluation of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC)

During normal pre-operative evaluation and classification based on principal scores and laboratory data, patients will be subjected to bedside pulmonary ultrasound.
Pulmonary ultrasound will evaluate the presence of one of four patterns (normal pattern, isolated B lines, coalescent B lines and consolidation) defined by Lung Ultrasound Score in the 6 fields for each hemithorax of the patient.
These patients will be later subjected to spinal anaesthesia and orthopedic surgery.

    <description>Pulmonary echography during preoperative evaluation for patients undergoing urgency orthopedic surgery for femur fracture.
Pulmonary ultrasound will evaluate the presence of one of four patterns defined by Lung Ultrasound Score in the 6 fields for each hemithorax of the patient (2 anterior, 2 lateral and 2 posterior). Each region is defined by axillary lines (anterior and posterior) and then is divided into 2 subregions (superior and inferior), thus defining the 6 fields. For a comprehensive exam, all intercostal spaces in the setting of each field will have to be examined by sliding the probe along them . A score will be used for each field that will have this definition:
0: normal pattern (A-lines)
1: multiple B lines (at least 3 for field), well defined.
2: B lines coalescent
3: consolidation of any dimension</description>
