      This is the first pilot phase II trial assessing the response of SBRT layered on Darolutamide
      (BAY1841788) on RPFS and deferring palliative second line systemic therapy in M0CRPC with
      oligoprogression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastases-directed therapy with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is emerging as a
      new treatment option for solid tumor patients with a limited number of metastases (&lt; 5) at
      the time of recurrence/progression, so called oligoprogression therapy. As such,
      oligoprogression is defined as prostate cancer patients with castration resistance and no
      metastases (M0CRPC) who are receiving ADT and new generation hormonal therapy (enzalutamide,
      apalutamide or darolutamide) as standard of care, and who are then progressing to
      oligometastases. The new generation hormonal therapy used in this study will be darolutamide
      (ODM-201). The rationale behind this approach has been to delay the start of palliative
      systemic therapies that are most often toxic and associated with a negative impact on
      patient's quality of life, as well as being more costly. However, to date, there are no
      prospective published data or ongoing studies that are looking into non metastatic castration
      resistant prostate cancer (M0CRPC) patients who progress to oligometastases
      (oligoprogression). To this end, we are proposing this pilot phase II trial to assess the
      impact of SBRT on radiological progression-free survival (RPFS) of M0CRPC patients who are
      receiving darolutamide and progress to oligometastatic disease (oligoprogression).

      Prostate cancer patients with castration resistance and no metastases (M0CRPC) diagnosed by
      bone scan and CT scan or MRI will be recruited in this phase II and initiate darolutamide
      while continuing on ADT (Part 1 of the study). Patients who then progress to wide spread
      metastases or metastases situated at locations not amenable to ablative therapy will be
      excluded and treated with second line therapy as per the treating physician. Patients with
      oligoprogression (&lt; 5 mets) and amenable to ablative therapy will be then treated with SBRT
      or surgery as an ablative therapy if SBRT is not feasible (Part 2 of the study). All patients
      will continue to receive non-interrupted LHRH agonist, PSA testing every 6-12 weeks and
      re-imaging every 6 months. Imaging will also be repeated at the appearance of symptoms or at
      PSA progression, whichever occurs first and this schedule continues until disease
      progression.

      This is the first pilot phase II trial assessing the response of SBRT layered on darolutamide
      on RPFS and deferring palliative second line systemic therapy in M0CRPC with
      oligoprogression. This phase II will consist of 66 M0CRPC patients treated with darolutamide,
      of which we anticipate 48 will be eligible for SBRT.

        Inclusion Criteria (Part 1):

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine
             differentiation or small cell features;

          -  M0CRPC at study entry defined as follows:

               1. Ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a LHRH agonist or bilateral orchiectomy
                  (i.e., surgical or medical castration);

               2. Serum testosterone level â‰¤ 1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) at the Screening visit;

               3. PSA progression defined by a minimum of two subsequent rising PSA levels with an
                  interval of â‰¥ 1 week between each determination. Patients who received an
                  anti-androgen must have progression after withdrawal (â‰¥ 4 weeks since last
                  flutamide or â‰¥ 6 weeks since last bicalutamide or nilutamide). The PSA value at
                  the Screening visit should be â‰¥ 2 Î¼g/L (2 ng/mL)

               4. PSA doubling time of 10 months or less,

               5. M0 assessed by conventional imaging (CT/MRI + bone scan).

          -  Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer in adjuvant setting post radical
             therapy is allowed;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 or Karnofsky
             performance status of &gt; 80% or higher;

          -  Ability to swallow the study drug whole and comply with study.

          -  Patients should not have been previously exposed to other ARATs (Abiraterone,
             Enzalutamide, Apalutamide)

        Inclusion Criteria (Part 2):

          -  â‰¤ 5 metastatic sites (on conventional imaging);

          -  â‰¤ 4 tumors within any given organ system, excluding brain (e.g. up to 4 bone

          -  All sites of disease must be amenable to SBRT with no history of the metastases being
             irradiated (radiation exposure prior to the development of the metastases is permitted
             as long as the radiation exposure was not intended for the metastases. For example, if
             there is prior pelvic radiation to the prostate and a subsequent iliac metastasis
             develops within the previously irradiated pelvic radiation field, then the iliac
             metastasis would be eligible per the institution policy and practice);

          -  In the case of a suspicious lesion in an unusual location such as lung or thoracic
             lymph nodes (without other abdominal lymph nodes), a confirmatory imaging or biopsy is
             strongly recommended;

        Exclusion Criteria (Part 1):

             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment;

          -  Presence of distant metastasis, including previously treated (clinical stage M1) is
             exclusive, however isolated pelvic nodal disease below the iliac bifurcation (clinical
             stage N1) is not an exclusion criteria.

                  patients with history of congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 or 4 in the past,
                  unless a screening echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition scan performed
                  within three months results in a left ventricular ejection fraction that is â‰¥
                  45%;

               5. History of Mobitz II second degree or third degree heart block without a

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of enrollment (Day 1 Visit);

          -  Active viral hepatitis, active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or chronic liver
             disease

          -  Known or suspected contraindications or hypersensitivity to darolutamide or GnRH
             agonists or any of the components of the formulations;

          -  Use of an investigational agent within 4 weeks of enrollment (Day 1 visit);

          -  Use of herbal products that may have hormonal anti-prostate cancer activity and/or are

          -  Any condition or reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator, interferes with the
             ability of the patient to participate in the trial, which places the patient at undue
             risk, or complicates the interpretation of safety data;

          -  Unable to swallow study medications and comply with study requirements
