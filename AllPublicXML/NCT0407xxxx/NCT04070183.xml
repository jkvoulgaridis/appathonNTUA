  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to study the effects of Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST)
      Facilitation in a randomized controlled trial in a population of community dwelling older
      adults who qualify for POLST facilitation, including those with normal cognition and those
      with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The POLST paradigm, which stands for Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment, was
      developed to address inconsistencies between care received and patient and family wishes for
      treatment, with an aim to increase concordant care. The POLST paradigm is nationally
      recognized and implemented in a number of states under different names. In Indiana, for
      example, it is called &quot;Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment&quot; (POST). Because of this, all
      patient facing materials will refer to POST, however, we use the terms POST and POLST
      interchangeably in this proposal.

      POLST affects delivery of medical interventions and improved concordance between patient
      preferences and care received.

      Our specific aims are:

        1. To test the effect of high quality POLST Facilitation delivered in the home compared to
           attention control on:

           a.discordance between preferences for treatment and treatments received in the
           subsequent 12 months (primary outcome).

        2. To test the effect of POLST Facilitation on intermediate outcomes including:

             1. The proportion of patients with a completed POLST form in the electronic medical
                record within 3 months of POLST Facilitation

             2. Decision quality regarding ACP as measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale, the
                advance care planning (ACP) Engagement Survey,and the POLST knowledge survey

        3. To test the effect of a POLST Facilitation on secondary outcomes of cost and end-of-life
           care including:

             1. Receipt of life-sustaining interventions or hospice within the 30 days prior to
                death, for patients who die during the year after POLST Facilitation

             2. The psychological well-being (anxiety, depression,and post traumatic stress) of
                surrogate decision makers after the patient's death

             3. The cost effectiveness of POLST Facilitation for the prevention of ICU admissions
                and hospitalizations

TOTAL SCORE 16 items are: a) summed; b) divided by 16; and c) multiplied by 25 Other papers may present scores ranging from 1 [low decisional conflict] to 5 [high decisional conflict].</description>

    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder- 7 (GAD-7) (7 item inventory of anxiety)- assesses subject's self-reported anxiety for the last two weeks.
Scores range from 0-21 0= 'Not at all'; 1= 'Several Days'; 2= 'More than half the days'; 3= 'Nearly every day' Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively.
When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.
Using the threshold score of 10, the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82% for GAD.</description>

    <description>Advanced steps is initiated as a component of quality end-of-life care for frail elders and those whose death in the next 12 months would not be unexpected. The AS planning conversation is focused on goals of care to make timely, proactive, and specific end-of-life decisions. Ideally, these decisions are converted into medical orders that can be followed throughout the continuum of care. The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) program is the nationally recognized model for this stage of planning.</description>
