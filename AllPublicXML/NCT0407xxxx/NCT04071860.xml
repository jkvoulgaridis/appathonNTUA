  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnoea (SA) is a common condition in adults and children that causes disturbed sleep
      and daytime symptoms. It is characterised by disrupted breathing with disturbed sleep
      patterns. In adults this can lead to dangerous daytime sleepiness affecting for example
      driving performance. In children it may lead to hyperactivity in the day and poor school
      performance. There are a number of techniques for diagnosing the disorder but they can affect
      the quality of sleep which sometimes makes them inaccurate. Most are unsuitable for small
      children who cannot understand the value of the tests and tend to remove the monitoring wires
      and devices in the night. This study aims to validate a new non contact device &quot;Safescan&quot;,
      based on low power radar technology, which can be put under a bed and record breathing
      patterns with no measuring device in contact with the sleeper. In this initial study the
      device will be validated in adults, against the gold standard of polysomnography (PSG) in the
      sleep laboratory at Royal Papworth Hospital.
