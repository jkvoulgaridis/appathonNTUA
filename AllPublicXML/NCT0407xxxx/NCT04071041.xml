  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of death world-wide.
      Hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse outcomes. However, whether albumin administration
      would have a beneficial effect in outcome in patients with CAP remains uncertain.

      This project proposes to test the hypothesis of whether the administration of albumin in
      hypoalbuminemic patients with CAP would increase the proportion of clinical stable patients
      at day 5.

      This project will consist of a superiority, non-blinded, multicentre, randomized, phase 3,
      interventional controlled clinical trial. The estimated sample size is of 360 patients, who
      will be recruited from three Spanish hospitals. Hypoalbuminemic (≤30g/L) adult patients with
      CAP will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus albumin (20g in 100ml)
      every 12 hours for 4 days or standard care alone.

      The primary endpoint will be the proportion of clinical stable patients at day 5, defined as
      stable vital signs for at least 24h, analyzed by intention to treat.

      The secondary endpoints will be time to clinical stability; duration of intravenous and total
      antibiotic treatment; length of hospital stay; intensive care unit admission; duration of
      mechanical ventilation and vasopressor treatment; adverse events; readmission within 30 days
      and all-cause mortality.

Patients will receive empirical antibiotic therapy according to guidelines as soon as CAP is confirmed. All microbiological assessments and additional treatment (e.g. oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, analgesic drugs, vasoactive agents, fluid resuscitation, and mechanical ventilation) will be at the discretion of the treating physicians (not the study investigators).
