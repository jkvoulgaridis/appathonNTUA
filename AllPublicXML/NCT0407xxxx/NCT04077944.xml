      Objectives: To evaluate maternal serum trace elements and heavy metals namely, aluminum (Al),
      chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic
      (As), molybdenum (Mo), cadmium (Cd), tin (Sn), antimony (Sb), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) in
      pregnant women complicated by preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (pP-ROM) and to
      compare the results with healthy pregnancies.

      Methods: Maternal serum levels of Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hg, and Pb
      were measured in the study group, which included 55 pregnant women complicated with pP-ROM
      and 60 healthy pregnancies (control group) with respect to maternal age and gestational
      weeks. The maternal serum levels of trace elements and heavy metals in both groups were
      measured using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and compared.

      This current observational study was conducted at Cengiz Gokcek Women's and Children's
      Hospital Gaziantep, Turkey at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology between dates of
      August 2018 and March 2019. The experiment was conducted according to the Declaration of
      Helsinki. All subjects included in the study gave oral and written informed consents. The
      study population consisted of 55 women with a singleton pregnancy who were diagnosed with
      pP-ROM between 24+0 and 36+6 weeks of gestation. The control cases were recruited from the
      healthy pregnant women with a gestational age-matched cohort who admitted for routine
      obstetric care to our outpatient clinic. Sixty healthy pregnant women who delivered at term
      were included in the study as the control group. All patients will gave their oral and
      written informed consent before their inclusion in the study.

    <description>The primary endpoint in this analysis is to evaluate maternal serum trace elements and heavy metals namely, aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), molybdenum (Mo), cadmium (Cd), tin (Sn), antimony (Sb), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) in pregnant women complicated by preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes (pP-ROM) and to compare the results with healthy pregnancies.
The elements, Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hg and Pb were measured using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Thermo Scientific ICAPQc, USA).
In the present study, only the maternal serum levels of fourteen different TEs and HMs were evaluated in order to examine the association between the occurrence of pP-ROM and these elements.</description>

    <description>The diagnosis of Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes was made in the case of apparent spontaneous leakage of AF from the cervical canal during sterile speculum inspection before the onset of active labor at 37 weeks of pregnancy. The study population consisted of 55 women with a singleton pregnancy who were diagnosed with pP-ROM between 24+0 and 36+6 weeks of gestation.
The Amnisure test (AmniSure International LLC, Boston, MA) was used when there was inconclusive results to confirm the final diagnosis. The gestational age was determined by calculation from the last menstrual period and supported by the ultrasonography measurements at the first trimester of gestation.</description>
