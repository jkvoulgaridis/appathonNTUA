  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critical patients which requiring admission to intensive care (IT) are a special group of
      patients. In these patients the prevalence of anemia reported in studies is 75%. This
      prevalence is similar to that in the retrospective observational study conducted in our
      intensive care unit(ICU). Of the 783 patients included in the study, 551 (73.37%) had anemia
      on admission. Frequently anemia is present on discharge from ICU or hospital and may persist
      for an average of 11 weeks. Some studies have reported the presence of anemia as far as 6
      months after discharge. It is widely accepted that anemia has a negative impact on
      rehabilitation and quality of life, but the treatment can not be exclusively based on blood
      products due to the risks associated with transfusion. Alternative treatments such as
      injectable iron or erythropoietin should be considered.

      The Transfusion Management Initiative Group recently issued recommendations on perioperative
      anemia. Similar recommendations for ICU have not yet been developed in Romania. The current
      study has two main purposes. The first to adopt the perioperative anemia diagnostic algorithm
      and adapt it to anemic patients on ICU; the second to identify patients with mixed anemia
      (inflammatory and iron deficient anemia) who can benefit from treatment with iron.

    <description>Hepcidin is a peptide produced by the liver. It acts by binding to ferroportin, the sole exporter of iron. The hepcidin-ferroportin complex is sequestrated in the cytosol of cells followed by its degradation. Ferroportin degradation prevents iron from being exported from the cell.</description>
