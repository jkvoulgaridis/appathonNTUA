  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib hydrochloride is a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets
      angiogenesis-related kinases such as VEGFR1/2/3, FGFR1/2/3, and other tumor-associated
      kinases involved in cell proliferation such as PDGFRα/β, c-Kit, and Ret have significant
      inhibitory activities.
