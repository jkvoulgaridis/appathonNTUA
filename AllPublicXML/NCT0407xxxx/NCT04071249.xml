    <textblock>
      This study is a mere data collection without predefined intervention. Patients aged 12 years
      or older who suffer from allergic rhinitis induced by house dust mites, tree pollen or grass
      pollen and who are treated exclusively with anti-allergic medication may take part. The
      treatment follows the normal medical practice in accordance with national medical guidelines.
      During the study, data are collected during 3 visits with regard to allergic complaints of a
      patient and intake of anti-allergic medication. The first visit takes place before allergen
      exposure, the second visit at the peak of allergen exposure and the third visit after
      allergen exposure. The allergen exposure is defined as the enhanced exposure to house dust
      mites during the heating period or the respective pollen season. During the visits, the
      patients will be asked to complete questionnaires with regard to their quality of life and
      rhinitis control. Furthermore during allergen exposure, the patients document their allergic
      complaints and intake of anti-allergic medication in a diary. The diary entries are used to
      generate the Combined Symptom and Medication Score (CSMS) which will be validated in the
      course of this study. The validation will be performed by comparing the CSMS with the scores
      from the already validated questionnaires.

      This study is a prospective, mulit-center data collection without predefined intervention.
      Patients aged 12 years or older who suffer from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by house
      dust mites, tree pollen or grass pollen and who are treated exclusively with symptomatic
      medication may take part. The treatment follows the normal medical practice in accordance
      with national medical guidelines. During the study, data are collected during 3 visits with
      regard to allergic symptoms of a patient and intake of symptomatic medication. The first
      visit takes place before allergen exposure, the second visit at the peak of allergen exposure
      and the third visit after allergen exposure. The allergen exposure ist defined as the
      enhanced exposure to house dust mites during the heating period or the respective pollen
      season. During the visits, the patients will be asked to complete questionnaires [the
      rhinitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ, Visit 1, 2 and 3) and the rhinitis control
      assessment test (RCAT, visit 2)]. Furthermore during allergen exposure, the patients document
      allergic symptoms and intake of symptomatic medication in a diary. These diary entries are
      used to generate the Combined Symptom and Medication Score (CSMS) which will be validated in
      the course of this study. The validation will be performed by comparing the CSMS with the
      scores from the already validated RQLQ and RCAT.

    <time_frame>30 to 60 days during allergen exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The CSMS describes the severity of nasal and conjunctival symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis as well as the intake of symptomatic medication.
Four nasal and two conjunctival symptoms (itchy nose, sneezing, runny nose, blocked nose, itchy/red eyes, watery eyes) are evaluated using a score from 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms, 3 = severe symptoms).
The stepwise use of medication will be assessed as follows:
= Oral and/or topical (eyes or nose) nonsedative H1 antihistamines (H1A)
= Intranasal corticosteroids (INS) with/without H1A
= Oral corticosteroids with/without INS, with/without H1A
The combination of symptom and medication score based on an equal weight generates the daily CSMS with a range from 0 to 6.</description>
