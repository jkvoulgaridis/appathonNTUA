    <textblock>
      A randomized, open-label, single oral dose, one-treatment, two-period, two-sequence,
      crossover bioavailability study under fed and fasting conditions in healthy Thai volunteers
      with at least 7 days washout period between the administrations of investigational products
      of two consecutive periods.

      A: Fixed dose combination Zemimet® SR Tab. 50/1000 mg orally administered once without food
      (fasting conditions) B: Fixed dose combination Zemimet® SR Tab. 50/1000 mg orally
      administered once with food (fed conditions)

      [Objectives] Primary: To investigate the food-effect bioavailability of absorption of
      gemigliptin/metformin hydrochloride sustained release 50/1000 mg FDC tablet (Zemimet® SR Tab.
      50/1000 mg) in healthy subjects under fed and fasting conditions Secondary: To evaluate
      safety of investigational product under fed and fasting conditions

      [Admission and Confinement] Fed conditions: Subjects will be admitted the night before
      investigational product administration, supervised for at least 8 hours overnight fasting
      prior to consume standard HFHC breakfast and in-house stay until 24 hours post-dose.

      Fasting conditions: Subjects will be admitted a night before investigational product
      administration, supervised for at least 8 hours overnight fasting prior to dosing and
      in-house stay until 24 hours post-dose.
