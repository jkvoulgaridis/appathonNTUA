  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine malformations were initially described by Cruveilhier and Von Rokitansky in the
      1800s. Many proposed classifications had been presented over the years, although only two are
      mostly used worldwide: the first proposed by the American Fertility Society (AFS) and the one
      recently published by European Society on Gynecologic Endoscopy / European Society of Human
      Reproductive Endocrinology (ESGE/ESHRE). Both classifications describe a special type of
      uterus, with an abnormally shaped narrow uterine cavity. This type of uterus was initially
      defined, before the use of ultrasound, as &quot;hypoplasic uterus&quot; by K. Menge and K.V. Oettingen
      in 1930. Subsequently, the AFS in its classification defined it as type VII as
      Diethylstilbestrol-related and the ESGE/ESHRE classification defined it as class U1a or
      T-shaped uterus.

      At present there are no clear diagnostic criteria for this type of uterus and the only
      parameter widely accepted is that of &quot;narrow uterine cavity due to thickened lateral walls&quot;.
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a survey of gynecologists in active clinical practice
      and resident (in training) gynecologists to establish the degree of concordance when
      cataloging 3D ultrasound images of normal or dysmorphic uteri, with the aim to identify
      common parameters that allow to identify the dysmorphic uterus with narrowing of the side
      walls.

      The study will be carried out in two stages: in an initial step, participants will complete a
      survey evaluating their knowledge of uterine malformations and their involvement in assisted
      reproduction in their current clinical practice.

      In the second step, participants will then watch a video of hysteroscopies and 3D ultrasound
      images of different cases highlighting the hysteroscopic/ultrasound correlation of the
      different variants of the uterus with narrowing of the side walls. Each participant will be
      shown 40 (forty) 3D ultrasound images of uterus of normal women without infertility and 40
      (forty) infertile women with uterus with narrowing in the middle third diagnosed by
      hysteroscopy + 3D ultrasound and associated infertility (in T, Y or I shape). Once the survey
      is finished, the degree of concordance will be evaluated, with the aim to identify common
      parameters of diagnosis of dysmorphic uterus by 3D ultrasound.
