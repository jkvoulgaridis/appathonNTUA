  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary objective is designed to assess the safety and tolerability, and
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of both itacitinib and tocilizumab when given in
      combination to patients with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGVHD).

      The study's secondary objectives are to:

        -  Estimate the day 28 response rate (ORR) [complete response (CR), very good partial
           response (VGPR), and partial response (PR)] of the combination of itacitinib and
           tocilizumab for the treatment of SR-aGVHD

        -  Estimate the time to response and duration of response

        -  Estimate the incidence of primary disease relapse while on study treatment

        -  Estimate the incidence of infections including viral reactivation, bacterial infections
           and fungal infections while on study treatment

        -  Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), non-relapse
           mortality, GVHD-related mortality of study subjects

        -  Estimate the proportion of patients who successfully discontinue steroids by 6 months
           and 12 months after therapy initiation

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute and chronic GVHD consists mostly of steroids which has changed very
      little over the past 40 years. Response to current therapy for GVHD is far from perfect; only
      about 50% of patients respond to therapy and many of those responses are not durable.

      The current study is a phase I study dose de-escalation study where up to 6 patients will be
      enrolled into each dose level (2 levels), followed by an expansion cohort at the MTD. The
      goal of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of itacitinib
      and tocilizumab. Once the MTD is determined, the investigator will enroll 10 additional
      patients as an expansion cohort to further define the safety profile of the combination and
      estimate its response rate.

             also allowed.

          -  Severe organ dysfunction unrelated to GVHD that includes cholestatic disorders or
             unresolved VOD (defined as ongoing organ dysfunction and bilirubin elevation unrelated
             to GVHD &gt; 2.5 the institutional upper limit of normal), clinically significant or
             uncontrolled cardiac disease (including unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction

          -  Pregnant, breast-feeding, or unwilling or unable to avoid pregnancy or fathering a
             child. Pregnant women are excluded from this study as animal studies have shown that
             tocilizumab crosses the placenta and can interfere with fetal development in animal
             studies. Furthermore, itacitinib has been associated with embryo-fetal toxicity in
