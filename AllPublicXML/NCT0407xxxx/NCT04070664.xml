  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertigo is a common complaint in the Emergency Department (ED). The differential diagnosis of
      central and peripheral vertigo is a difficult issue that directly affects mortality. Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred diagnostic tool, but may not be suitable in all
      patients due to logistic and economic conditions. In this study, the investigators evaluated
      the role of thiol/disulfide homeostasis (TDH) parameters and ischemia modified albumin (IMA)
      levels to assist in the value of being used instead of MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted in the ED using a prospective, non-randomized method, and included
      patients with complaints of acute onset vertigo over 18 years of age and who underwent brain
      MRI. Pregnant women, smokers, and those with significant neurological signs were excluded.
      Patients with acute ischemia with MRI were included in the central vertigo group, and
      patients with normal MRI were included in the peripheral vertigo group. Blood samples for
      native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT), disulfide, and IMA were collected from all patients at
      admission. Statistical analyzes were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows 16.0
      Package Program.
