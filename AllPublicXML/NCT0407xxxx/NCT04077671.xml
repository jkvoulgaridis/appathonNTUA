             cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been definitively treated.

          5. Clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, endocrine, hepatic,
             neurological, psychiatric, immunological, gastrointestinal, haematological or
             metabolic disease that is, in the opinion of the Investigator, not stabilised or may
             otherwise impact subject safety or study results (in cases of doubt, the Sponsor's
             Clinical Research Physician should be consulted).

          6. Subject undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or with chronic renal
             insufficiency (plasma creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl).
