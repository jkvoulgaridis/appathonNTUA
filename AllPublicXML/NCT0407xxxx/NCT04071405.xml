    <textblock>
      As required for new medications approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, safety and
      efficacy information should be provided for a minimum of 600 patients treated in the setting
      of routine practice during 4 years following approval (until 19 September 2022). Out of all
      the enrolled patients, at least 120 cases (20%) will be followed up until the 52nd week to
      see the long term safety of Xeljanz.

      This is an open-label, non-comparative, non-interventional, prospective, and multi-center
      study conducted in Korean health care centers by accredited physicians (ie, investigators).
      The study population will be adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who have
      had an inadequate response or intolerance to the basic treatments or biological agents.
      Clinical Severity of Ulcerative Colitis is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on
      the Mayo score or partial Mayo score. Xeljanz will be administered according to the &quot;Dosage
      and Administration&quot; of the approved labeling. There is no visit or activity mandated by this
      study. The investigator will collect patient data and record the information on each
      patient's case report form (CRF).

    <description>General efficacy will be determined into 4 categories by the investigator based on clinical impression and patient's Mayo or partial Mayo score.
The 4 categories are as follows
Improved : Symptoms of ulcerative colitis have improved or showed adequate maintenance effect after taking Xeljanz Unchanged : Symptoms have not changed much since taking Xeljanz Aggravated : Symptoms have worsened after taking Xeljanz Not assessible : Reason written down seperately</description>

    <time_frame>At 8, 16, 24, 52 weeks after the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo score or partial Mayo score is calculated. Mayo Score is defined as sum of the following scores. Partial Mayo score excludes findings of endoscopy.
A. Stool frequency 0 : Normal number of stool
1-2 stools more than normal
3-4 stools more than normal
â‰¥5 stools more than normal
B. Rectal bleeding 0: No blood seen
Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time
Obvious blood with stool most of the time
Blood alone passed
C. Findings of endoscopy 0: Normal or inactive disease
Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability)
Moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosion)
Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)
D. Physician's global assessment 0: Normal
Mild
Moderate
