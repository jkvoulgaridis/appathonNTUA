  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely accepted in the literature that quality of acetabular fracture reduction is one
      of the most important factor for the outcome. To obtain best results, anatomical reduction
      has to be obtained. Intra-operative radiographic assessment depends mainly on plain x-ray.
      Plain x-ray alone is not enough for post-operative assessment as it depends mainly on
      reduction of the dome with concentricity of the hip.

      It is widely accepted in the literature that quality of acetabular fracture reduction is one
      of the most important factor for the outcome. To obtain best results, anatomical reduction
      has to be obtained. Intra-operative radiographic assessment depends mainly on plain x-ray.
      Plain x-ray alone is not enough for post-operative assessment as it depends mainly on
      reduction of the dome with concentricity of the hip. Complex fractures with multi-fragmentary
      fracture pattern, impacted fragments (marginal or roof), fractures with osteo-chondral loss
      and associated head of femur injuries, pose problems with reduction assessment using both
      Plain x-ray and CT due to lack of clear standardized way of assessment. Matta criteria has
      been used widely in the literature for assessment, however it lacks some important criteria
      which directly related to the functional outcome. Few papers in the literature address this
      problem and reporting some ways for assessment but with lack of testing and reproducibility.

      Since there is in our level 1 trauma center a lot of cases of acetabular fractures that is
      admitted yearly to our center Purpose of our study is to use those methods for our cases in
      order to test their validity and reproducibility

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>measurement was used to grade quality of reduction according to Matta's system . In accordance with prior studies, adequate (or anatomic) reductions with 0-1 mm of displacement were compared to inadequate (imperfect or poor) reductions with &gt; 1 mm displacement . For the CT-based method, postoperative pre-digital (prior to 2000) and digital CT images were independently assessed in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes, and residual gap and step displacement were measured along the articular surface at the level of the weight-bearing dome. Adequate reductions on postoperative CT were defined as &lt; 1 mm step and &lt; 5 mm gap displacement and inadequate reductions as ≥ 1 mm step and/or ≥ 5 mm gap displacement.</description>

        Patients included in our study will have postoperative plain X-rays and comparing it to CT
        scan to assess their quality of reduction and other criteria mentioned in the literature.

        10 observers with different years of experience will assess all fractures using plain x-ray
        and CT.
