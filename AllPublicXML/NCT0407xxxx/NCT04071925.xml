  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that urethroplasty should be considered the gold standard treatment
      for urethral stricture disease as it yields higher long-term success rates than endoscopic
      treatment options such as direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) or dilation. Many data
      about these procedures exist, although most of the publications about urethroplasty are
      retrospective and involve a tremendous risk of bias. To address these issues, this study is
      designed to prospectively gain evidence about this matter in all patient subgroups facing a
      potential treatment with urethroplasty: native men, native women, transmen, transwomen and
      children.
