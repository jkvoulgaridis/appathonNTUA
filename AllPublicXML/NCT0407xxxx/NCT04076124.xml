  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an association between brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF)
      polymorphisms and the antidepressant efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation device in
      patients with treatment-resistant depression. In a double-blind design, All patients are
      randomized to three groups, i.e.repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment,
      intermittent theta-burst stimulation treatment or sham treatment.
