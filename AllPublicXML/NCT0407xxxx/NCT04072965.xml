  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers recommended that NeuroMuscularControl (NMC) training should not begin immediately
      after an acute Lateral Ankle Sprain(LAS) because of pain and weight-bearing restrictions. So,
      there is a need for an alternative way by which we can begin NMC retraining sooner. By
      training the non-affected ankle (Cross education), clinicians can begin NMC retraining before
      the individuals can bear weight on the affected ankle, in the acute stage of healing, or even
      if there is any other precautions or contraindications to exercise due to the injuries.
      Athletes with more chronic injuries may be able to perform NMC and functional retraining at
      higher levels than otherwise would be possible by initiating the training on the non affected
      ankle. Initiating these activities on the non-affected ankle will result in earlier
      improvements in postural control and function in the affected ankle.

      By this way, the rehabilitation times will be short, athletes can return earlier to sport
      participation or work, health care costs will decrease. Up to the knowledge of the author,
      there is a gap in research investigating cross education effect of balance program in
      patients with ankle instability. So, the current study was conducted to reveal the role of
      this phenomena in such cases and add this phenomenon on the physical therapy field to manage
      patients with ankle instability (If Cross Education phenomena is effective, this phenomena
      will be used in rehabilitation).

      Thirty five females with Chronic Ankle Instability will be recruited from the Faculty of
      Physical Therapy, Cairo University by announcements to participate in this study. They will
      be randomly assigned into three groups; (A) Cross Education (balance training for the non
      affected side )(n=10), (B) Traditional training(balance training for the affected side)
      (n=10), (C) control group (no intervention) (n=15). stability indices measured by the Biodex
      Balance system , Single Leg Stance Test and scores of Star Excursion Balance Test will be
      assesssed before and after six weeks of Single Leg Balance training.
