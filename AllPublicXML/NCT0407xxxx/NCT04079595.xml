  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether open-face masks improve patient
      comfort/preference whilst maintaining immobilization performance as known for closed masks in
      patients undergoing whole or partial cranial radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon randomization, patients will be begin treatment either with an open-face mask (A) or
      closed mask (B). Two individual immobilization masks - the open-face and closed masks - will
      be fabricated for every single patient. During the 1st half of treatment the randomly
      assigned mask will be used followed by using another mask for the 2nd half of treatment.
      Discomfort/pain/anxiety and mask preference will be scored during treatment with a
      questionnaire.
