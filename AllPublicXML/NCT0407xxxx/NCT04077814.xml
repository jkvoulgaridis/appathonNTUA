  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of tDCS combined with foot drop
      stimulation (FDS) on gait rehabilitation of post-stroke subjects with mild and moderate
      compromise.

    <measure>Assessed by means of the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (SSQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome will assess at baseline and two weeks after the intervention. One month later that finished the intensive treatment subjects will re-evaluate.</time_frame>
    <description>The SSQOL questionnaire assesses the quality of life of stroke subject, and it contains 49 items with 12 domains (energy, family role, language, mobility, mood, personality, self-care, social role, reasoning, upper limb function, vision and work/productivity). There are three possible answers on the 5-point Likert scale.
The SSOOL questionnaire score reports a minimum of 49 points and a maximum of 245 points. The lower values represent the more dependence and difficulty to perform tasks.</description>

    <time_frame>The outcome will assess at baseline and two weeks after the intervention. One month later that finished the intensive treatment subjects will re-evaluate.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale. This scale consists of 5 ordinal values ranging from 0 (no tonus increase) to 4 (stiffness).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Sensorimotor Recovery After Stroke by Fugl-Meyer scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome will assess at baseline and two weeks after the intervention. One month later that finished the intensive treatment subjects will re-evaluate.</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer scale of lower limb impairment. The evaluation includes measurement of voluntary movement, velocity, coordination and reflex activity, through an ordinal scale applied to each item: 0- cannot be performed, 1- partially performed, and 2-performed completely. Participants were also classified according their LL motor impairment in severe (0 to19), moderate (20 to 28) or mild (&gt; 29 points).</description>
