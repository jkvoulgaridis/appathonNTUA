    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in Eye Movement Performance During Free-View Task at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and in 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The first fixated location and latency (msec) of each trial, the total dwell time (msec) in each interest area (IA) during the whole trial to assess the attentional bias in the experiment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in the Symptoms of Major Depression as Measured by BDI-II at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and in 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). BDI-II is a self-report questionnaire that measures the severity of depression on a scale of 0 to 63. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in the Symptoms of Major Depression as Measured by HAM-D at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and in 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). HAM-D is used by clinicians to rate the severity of depression and to evaluate recovery. HAM-D score ranges from 0 to 51, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in State Mindfulness at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and in 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). FFMQ measures five mindfulness skills through these subscales: Non-Reactivity to Inner Experience, Observing/Noticing, Acting With Awareness, Describing, and Non-Judging of Experience. The five subscale scores can be combined to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 195, measuring global mindfulness skills, with higher scores indicating higher level of global mindfulness skills. For FFMQ subscales, scores range from 8 to 40, except for Non-Reactivity to Experience scores, which range from 7 to 35. Higher subscale scores indicate higher level of respective mindfulness skills.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in Tendency to Engage in Ruminative Responses at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and in 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Ruminative Responses Scale of the Response Styles Questionnaire (RRS). RRS measures the tendency to ruminate. RRS score ranges from 22 to 88, with higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to engage in ruminative thoughts.</description>
