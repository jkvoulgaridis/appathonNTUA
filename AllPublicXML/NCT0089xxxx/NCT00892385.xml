      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methoxyamine and temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving methoxyamine together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of methoxyamine when
      given together with temozolomide in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of methoxyamine given in conjunction with
           temozolomide in patients with and without CNS disease.

        -  To determine the dose limiting toxicities of the combination of methoxyamine and
           temozolomide in patients with and without CNS disease.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of these two agents when given alone or in
           combination, as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of methoxyamine after single
           one-hour IV administration.

        -  To determine relative DNA damage, as single or double strand breaks by comet assay in
           blood mononuclear cells which will serve as a surrogate for tumor response to the drug
           combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of methoxyamine.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide for 5 days every 28 days and methoxyamine IV over 1 hour
      every 28 days. Methoxyamine IV administration will follow, within 5 minutes, initial
      administration of TMZ on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for
      methoxyamine and temozolomide pharmacokinetics, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, and DNA strand
      break determination by comet assay.

    <description>A total of 38 patients were analyzed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of methoxyamine in this study and this was determined in the non-CNS arm. An initial 6 patients received treatment with continuous dosing of methoxyamine and based on an assessment of pharmacokinetics, in this group, the study was revised to administer methoxyamine as a bolus dose. Thirty-eight patients received this type of dosing.</description>

    <description>A traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation design will be implemented. Successive cohorts of participants (3 participants/cohort) will be entered sequentially to each dose level. If 0/3 participants at a dose level experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) new participants may be entered at the next higher dose level. If 1 participant has a DLT, 3 more will be enrolled at the same dose level. If the 1st participant in the expanded cohort (4th at the given DL), experiences no DLT, the remaining 2 participants can start treatment. If 2 or more experience DLT in the first cycle, no further participants are started at that dose and the MTD is the highest dose level in which &lt;2 (of 6) participants develop DLT. If the final dose level is deemed the MTD, 6 participants will be treated at this dose level even if a DLT has not been observed.</description>

If 1/3 participants experience a non-CNS DLT in Cohort B dose level 6, dose escalation will continue to dose level 7, as 3 subjects have already been treated in Cohort A dose level 6 and 7 subjects in Cohort A dose level 7, none of whom experienced non-CNS toxicities. If 2 or more experience DLT in cycle 1, no more participants are started at that dose and the MTD is the highest dose where &lt;2/6 participants develop DLT. If the final dose level is deemed the MTD, 6 participants will be treated at this dose level even if no DLT has been observed.</description>
