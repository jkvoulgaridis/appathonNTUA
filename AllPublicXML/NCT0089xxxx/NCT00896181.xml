  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 trial is studying whether giving a combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and
      fluorouracil chemotherapy followed by the combination of cisplatin with radiation therapy
      works in treating patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy
      uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a
      high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage
      to normal tissue. Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To establish the progression free survival rate at 2 years, using RECIST criteria, to
      induction treatment with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) followed by
      chemoradiotherapy of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate complete response rates, safety and feasibility of TPF followed by
      chemoradiation in patients with NPC

      OUTLINE: This is a single site study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1; cisplatin IV over
      1-3 hours (or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes) on day 1; and fluorouracil IV continuously over
      24 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONCURRENT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Beginning within 3-6 weeks after initiating the last course of
      induction chemotherapy, patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy once daily for 6.5-7 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour (or
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes) once weekly in weeks 1-6 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma meeting the
             following criteria:

               -  WHO type I, II, or III

               -  Stage II to IVB disease (minimally T2a, N0, M0 or any T any, N1, M0)

               -  Measurable disease, defined as ≥ 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in ≥ 1
                  dimension as ≥ 20 mm by conventional techniques or as ≥ 10 mm by spiral CT scan

               -  Prior diagnostic surgery(s) at the primary site or neck allowed provided there is
                  still measurable disease present

               -  Without known brain metastases

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm³

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 times ULN

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 55 mL/min (NOTE: * Patients with
             creatinine &gt; grade 1 but &lt; grade 3, hearing loss ≥ grade 2, and peripheral neuropathy
             ≥ grade 2 are eligible provided they receive carboplatin in place of cisplatin
             throughout study treatment)

             obstruction, when the bone conduction in the audiogram is consistent with less than

             the best ear. If hearing loss is grade 2, patients are still eligible but should
             receive carboplatin throughout the protocol instead of cisplatin.

          -  Peripheral motor/sensory neuropathy &lt; grade 2. If peripheral neuropathy is grade 2,
             patients are still eligible but should receive carboplatin throughout the protocol
             instead of cisplatin.

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception prior to and during study treatment

        IEXLUSION CRITERIA
