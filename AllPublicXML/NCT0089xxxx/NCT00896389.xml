      The investigators of this study propose to examine the relationships between STK39 (Serine
      Threonine Kinase 39) genotypes and responses to salt loading and to thiazide diuretics,
      hydrochlorothiazide. The investigators hypothesize that STK39 genotypes will be associated
      with the outcome of both interventions and can contribute to personalized care for
      hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although hypertension can be easily diagnosed and there are many medications available to
      treat hypertension, this condition is poorly managed in many patients and is a leading cause
      of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Because a newly identified hypertension susceptibility
      gene, STK39 (Serine Threonine Kinase 39), plays a central role in kidney sodium transport,
      the investigators propose a pharmacogenetics study to examine the relationships between STK39
      genotypes and blood pressure responses to salt loading and to thiazide diuretics,
      hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, STK39 genotypes may also predict those hypertension
      patients more likely to develop thiazide-induced hyperglycemia. The investigators hypothesize
      that STK39 genotypes of those single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with
      baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hypertension
      status, will be associated with the outcome of both interventions. Therefore these SNPs can
      act as markers and contribute to personalized care for hypertension by identifying patients
      most likely to effectively control their blood pressure by adopting salt-reducing diet versus
      patients most likely to effectively and safely control their blood pressure by taking
      thiazide diuretics.

    <measure>Blood Pressure Change During Salt Loading</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 15 minutes for 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured every 15 minutes for 4 hours.
Blood pressure change is calculated by the trapezoid method. Essentially we use the average of blood pressure at each pair of time points (for example, DBP 30min + DBP 15min)/2 + (DBP 45min + DBP 30min)/2 + … up to 4 hours.) normalized by baseline SBP/DBP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plasma Renin Activity Due to Salt-loading</measure>
    <time_frame>Renin was measured from blood collected pre and post salt loading</time_frame>
    <description>Renin is an enzyme that mediates extracellular fluid and regulates blood pressure. Plasma renin activity (PRA) is a measure of the activity of the plasma enzyme renin. PRA is measured in the laboratory by incubating plasma at physiologic temperature in a buffer that facilitates its enzymatic activity. The natural substrate for the enzyme renin is angiotensinogen. Exogenous angiotensinogen is not added to the reaction mixture. This means that, in effect, the PRA results reported are dependent on both renin concentration and the concentration of its substrate in the patient's plasma. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to produce a decapeptide, angiotensin I, the concentration of which is assayed using liquid chromatography accompanied by tandem mass spectroscopic detection (LC/MS/MS). PRA levels are reported as the amount of angiotensin I generated per unit of time. Change is defined as the post-salt loading values minus the pre-salt loading values</description>

    <description>We will perform short-term HCTZ intervention on the same 120 subjects. After overnight fasting and having their height, weight, and BP measured, subjects are given seven 12.5 mg HCTZ tablets and instructed to take 1 tablet daily for one week. Ambulatory blood pressure will be measured and blood and urine will be collected on both day 1 and day 8. After a minimum 6-week wash-out period, the subjects will repeat the 7-day HCTZ intervention, taking 25 mg of HCTZ instead. Subjects with plasma potassium levels below 3.6 mmol/L on day 8 of 12.5 mg HCTZ will be given a daily supplement of 16 milliequivalents of potassium to prevent harmful loss of potassium while taking HCTZ.</description>

        <title>Blood Pressure Change During Salt Loading</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured every 15 minutes for 4 hours.
Blood pressure change is calculated by the trapezoid method. Essentially we use the average of blood pressure at each pair of time points (for example, DBP 30min + DBP 15min)/2 + (DBP 45min + DBP 30min)/2 + … up to 4 hours.) normalized by baseline SBP/DBP.</description>

        <population>124 subjects were divided into 3 genotype groups based on their rs35929607 genotypes. Genotype GG is homozygous for the minor allele G, genotype AG is heterozygous, and genotype AA is homozygous for the major allele A.</population>

            <title>rs35929607 SNP</title>
            <description>Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs35929607, located in an intron of serine threonine kinase 39 (STK39) gene, is associated with blood pressure in the Amish population.
This SNP, rs35929607, has 2 alleles, A and G. Allele G is found less frequently and has an allele frequency of approximately 0.2-0.4 in populations studied thus far. We genotyped all participants of this study and determine if they are homozygous for the G allele, i.e., have the GG genotype, or are heterozygous (AG genotype), or are homozygous for the A allele and have the AA genotype.</description>

            <description>SNP rs35929607, located in an intron of STK39 gene, is associated with blood pressure in the Amish population.
This SNP, rs35929607, has 2 alleles, A and G. Allele G is found less frequently and has an allele frequency of approximately 0.2-0.4 in populations studied thus far. We genotyped all participants of this study and determine if they are homozygous for the G allele, i.e., have the GG genotype, or are heterozygous (AG genotype), or are homozygous for the A allele and have the AA genotype.</description>

        <title>Change in Plasma Renin Activity Due to Salt-loading</title>
        <description>Renin is an enzyme that mediates extracellular fluid and regulates blood pressure. Plasma renin activity (PRA) is a measure of the activity of the plasma enzyme renin. PRA is measured in the laboratory by incubating plasma at physiologic temperature in a buffer that facilitates its enzymatic activity. The natural substrate for the enzyme renin is angiotensinogen. Exogenous angiotensinogen is not added to the reaction mixture. This means that, in effect, the PRA results reported are dependent on both renin concentration and the concentration of its substrate in the patient's plasma. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to produce a decapeptide, angiotensin I, the concentration of which is assayed using liquid chromatography accompanied by tandem mass spectroscopic detection (LC/MS/MS). PRA levels are reported as the amount of angiotensin I generated per unit of time. Change is defined as the post-salt loading values minus the pre-salt loading values</description>

            <description>SNP rs35929607, located in an intron of STK39 gene, is associated with blood pressure in the Amish population.
This SNP, rs35929607, has 2 alleles, A and G. Allele G is found less frequently and has an allele frequency of approximately 0.2-0.4 in populations studied thus far. We genotyped all participants of this study and determine if they are homozygous for the G allele, i.e., have the GG genotype, or are heterozygous (AG genotype), or are homozygous for the A allele and have the AA genotype.</description>

            <description>SNP rs35929607, located in an intron of STK39 gene, is associated with blood pressure in the Amish population.
This SNP, rs35929607, has 2 alleles, A and G. Allele G is found less frequently and has an allele frequency of approximately 0.2-0.4 in populations studied thus far. We genotyped all participants of this study and determine if they are homozygous for the G allele, i.e., have the GG genotype, or are heterozygous (AG genotype), or are homozygous for the A allele and have the AA genotype.</description>

          <description>Subjects will arrive at the Amish Research Clinics after overnight fasting. After taking height, weight, BP, and body temperature, subjects will receive 2 L of 0.9% NaCl (sodium chloride) saline over 4 hours while their blood pressure is monitored every 15 minutes. Blood pressure will be taken every 15 minutes during this procedure. Blood and urine samples will be collected from all subjects pre- and post-infusion.</description>

          <description>After overnight fasting and having their height, weight, and BP measured, subjects are given seven 12.5 mg HCTZ tablets and instructed to take 1 tablet daily for one week. Ambulatory blood pressure will be measured and blood and urine will be collected on both day 1 and day 8. After a minimum 6-week wash-out period, the subjects will repeat the 7-day HCTZ intervention, taking 25 mg of HCTZ instead. Subjects with plasma potassium levels below 3.6 mmol/L on day 8 of 12.5 mg HCTZ will be given a daily supplement of 16 milliequivalents of potassium to prevent harmful loss of potassium while taking HCTZ.</description>
