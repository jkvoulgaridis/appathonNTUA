      The primary aims of this clinical trial are:

        1. Determine the effectiveness of targeted learning and memory strategy remediation in
           students with sickle cell disease and cognitive deficits.

        2. Determine if there is improvement in academic achievement after targeted memory strategy
           remediation.

    <measure>Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) (WASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>After &gt;/= 50 hours of tutoring</time_frame>
    <description>The WASI is a brief, reliable measure of intelligence. Participants engage in 4 subtests: Block Design, Vocabulary, Similarities, and Matrix Reasoning. Participants receive a raw score on each of these 4 subtests. This raw score is converted to a T score using a score chart in the WASI manual. The T scores from all 4 subtests are summed together to obtain a Full Scale Sum of T Scores. This Full Scale Sum of T Scores is converted to a Full Scale IQ-4 Composite Score using a score chart published in the WASI manual. Higher scores indicate better intelligence. FSIQ-4 Range: 40-160. Average FSIQ-4 =100, standard deviation is +/- 15.</description>

    <description>The VIQ score is comprised from the Vocabulary and Similarities subtests of the WASI-4. The raw scores from these subtests are converted to T scores using score charts in the manual. The T scores are summed together for a Verbal Sum of T Scores. This score is converted to a Composite VIQ score using a score chart in the manual. Higher scores = better Verbal IQ. Range = 45-160. Average = 100; standard deviation +/- 15.</description>

    <description>The PIQ score is comprised from the Matrix Reasoning and Block Design subtests of the WASI-4. The raw scores from these subtests are converted to T scores using score charts in the manual. The T scores are summed together for a Performance Sum of T Scores. This score is converted to a Composite PIQ score using a score chart in the manual. Higher scores = better Performance IQ. Range = 45-160. Average = 100; standard deviation +/- 15.</description>

          -  Has a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) document reading by a neuroradiologist

          -  Cognitive deficits, which are defined by one standard deviation lower than the normal
             ranges of an age-based standard score in cognitive tests that are evaluated by a
             psychologist

          -  Must be a student who will remain in school for at least 2 years

          <description>Participants engage in 4 subtests: Block Design, Vocabulary, Similarities, and Matrix Reasoning. Participants receive a raw score on each of these 4 subtests. This raw score is converted to a T score using a score chart in the WASI manual. The T scores from all 4 subtests are summed together to obtain a Full Scale Sum of T Scores. This Full Scale Sum of T Scores is converted to a Full Scale IQ-4 Composite Score using a score chart published in the WASI manual. Higher scores indicate better intelligence. FSIQ-4 Range: 40-160. Average FSIQ-4 =100, standard deviation is +/- 15.</description>

The Raw scores from all trials (1-5) are summed to calculate a Total Raw Score for Trials 1-5. This Raw score is converted to a T score using the CVLT-II Comprehensive Scoring System (computer system). A higher T score indicates better performance. Range = 0-100. Average =50 with a standard deviation of =/- 10 points.</description>

Participants receive a raw score on each of these 4 subtests. This raw score is converted to a T score using a score chart in the WASI manual. The T scores from all 4 subtests are summed together to obtain a Full Scale Sum of T Scores. This Full Scale Sum of T Scores is converted to a Full Scale IQ-4 Composite Score using a score chart published in the WASI manual. Higher scores indicate better intelligence. FSIQ-4 Range: 40-160.

        <title>CVLT-C Trials 1-5 Long Delay Recall T Score</title>
        <description>The CVLT®-C measures multi-trial learning and long-term recall abilities for verbal information. The Raw scores from all trials (1-5) are summed to calculate a Total Raw Score for Trials 1-5. This Raw score is converted to a T score using the CVLT-II Comprehensive Scoring System (computer system). A higher T score indicates better performance. Range = 0-100. Average =50 with a standard deviation of =/- 10 points.</description>
        <time_frame>T scores were obtained at baseline and again at follow-up (after partcipant completed 50 hours of tutoring)</time_frame>

        <description>The D-KEFS allows for the assessment of executive functions. There are 9 stand alone tests that can be individually or group administered. The Number-Letter Switching condition of the Trails Making sub-test specifically assesses flexibility of thinking on a visual-motor sequencing task. A participant's raw score (# of items answered correctly) is converted to a T score using tables provided in the manual. Higher T scores = better performance. Range: 0-100.
