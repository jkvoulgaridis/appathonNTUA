  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the present study were to evaluate sAA responses to impacted third molar
      extractions at different time points in the patients under conscious sedation with local
      anesthesia and to examine the relationship between sAA, conscious sedation and dental
      anxiety. The null hypothesis was that conscious sedation could be considered to reduce
      salivary alpha amylase level during the wisdom tooth surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In oral and maxillofacial surgery, surgical extraction of impacted third molars is one of the
      most common surgical techniques performed in the oral cavity. Conscious intravenous sedation
      could be administered for the patients to provide anxiolysis, sedation, and analgesia for the
      patient. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) which reflect stress-related changes in the autonomic
      nervous system (ANS), has been proposed as a non-invasive stress biomarker. The aim of the
      present study was to investigate whether salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels could be
      decreased by conscious sedation in the patients undergoing impacted third molar extraction. A
      total of 18 male patients were recruited. All patients were administered Modified Dental
      Anxiety Scale (MDAS) test. Patients were divided into two groups: test group (procedures
      under sedation) and control group (procedures under local anesthesia). The following
      parameters were monitored at different study time-points: systolic blood pressure (SBP),
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP), oxygen saturation (SO2), and heart rate (HR). Five samples of
      saliva were taken from each patient: the first time patient came to clinic, the patient sat
      in the chair for extraction, before local anesthesia, immediately after extraction, at 4 h
      after extraction. The concentrations of sAA were measured and compared across the different
      stages of the study between two groups.

    <description>patients were asked to fill MDAS form which consists of five questions. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation , and heart rate were monitored at different time points: preoperative time ; intraoperative time-after local anesthesia , intraoperative time-after extraction , postoperative time . In this group removal of wisdom teeth was done under conscious sedation. During surgery procedures five saliva samples were collected. Due to the localization and position of the third molar, osteotomy was performed using a 20,000-rpm hand piece under irrigation for all patients. Some cases required tooth sectioning. 3-0 silk suture was used at the end of the surgery.
Ibuprofen (600 mg every 8 h for 7 days) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg every 8 h for 5 days) were prescribed. Detailed explanation of oral hygiene techniques and recommendations for the postoperative period were given to each patient.</description>

    <description>The first specimen of saliva was taken at the first time patient came to clinic (t1). Saliva was allowed to flow in the floor of mouth an 1 ml was then collected using a Pasteur pipette. First day after examination, patient was given an appointment. The second time of the saliva was taken was when the patient sat in the chair for extraction (t2). The other times of saliva samples were taken were before local anesthesia (t3), immediately after extraction (t4) and at 4 h after extraction (t5).
