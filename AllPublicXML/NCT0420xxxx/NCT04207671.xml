    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the viability and safety of two-lumen catheterization versus complete
      omission of chest tube in patients with lung wedge resection. Half of participants will
      receive complete omission of chest tube, while the other half will receive a two-lumen
      central venous catheterization along the midclavicular line, second intercostal space for
      remedial gas-remove.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the development of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques, minimally
      invasive thoracic surgery has evolved considerably over the last three decades. The concept
      of &quot;tubeless&quot; involves non-intubated anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation and no chest
      tube placement. Chest tube placement always causes pain, and its duration is known to be one
      of the most important factors influencing hospital stay and costs. Early tube removal allows
      patients to breathe deeply with less pain, which leads to more compliance with chest
      physiotherapy, as demonstrated by a concomitant improvement in patients' ventilatory
      function. Hence, more and more experienced surgeons choose the omission of chest tube
      placement after lung wedge resection. However, based on previous retrospective studies,
      residual pneumothorax was noted in about 10% cases, and some of them need re-intervention.
      Hence, the investigators designed a intra-operative two-lumen catheterization as improved
      drainage strategy. Therefore, this study evaluates the viability and safety of two-lumen
      catheterization versus omission of chest tube placement in patients with lung wedge
      resection.
