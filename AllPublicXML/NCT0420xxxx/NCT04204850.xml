  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study that will assess the investigational drug, cabozantinib, in patients
      with liver cancer (specifically hepatocellular carcinoma) and who had received a liver
      transplant as a part of curative care, but the cancer has come back (recurred). The purpose
      of this study is to see how useful cabozantinib is in controlling the disease of these
      patients.

      Cabozantinib blocks the function of various proteins found on the surface of the body's cells
      (called receptor tyrosine kinases) that are important in the development of cancer tumors.

      All participants will receive cabozantinib until they are no longer receiving benefit from
      the study drug or they experience an intolerable side effect.

      The study has three main parts:

      Screening: Participants will have test, procedures, and assessments done for safety and
      eligibility. Some may be done for research purposes only. Several visits may be needed to
      complete the screening part of the study.

      Study Drug Period: During this part, participants will take the study drug as prescribed by
      the study doctor. While on the study drug, participants will visit the clinic about once a
      week for tests, procedures, and assessments for safety, eligibility, and research only
      purposes.

      End of Study Drug Visit and Follow-up: Participants will be asked to make an End of Study
      Drug visit about 30 days after the last dose of study drugs for safety, eligibility, and
      research only purposes. After this visit, participants will continue to have follow-up visits
      about every 8 weeks. If participants are experiencing side effects, they will be followed
      weekly for about 4 weeks, then monthly until resolution or stabilization.
