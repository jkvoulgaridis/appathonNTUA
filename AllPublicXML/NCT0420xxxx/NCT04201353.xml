  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a 2-arm cluster, randomized controlled trial designed to test the
      effectiveness of a conditional cash transfer on viral suppression at 12 months post-ART
      initiation among PHWHIV who have initiated ART within the past 30 days. Randomization will
      take place at the clinic level (HIV primary care clinics), and eligible participants
      attending intervention clinics will have the opportunity to receive up to 6 consecutive
      monthly cash transfers of 22,500 TSH (~$10) each, conditional on visit attendance with the
      HIV care provider. The study will take place at 32 clinics across four regions in Tanzania:
      Gaeta, Mwanza, Kagera and Shinyanga. The primary endpoint is viral suppression at 12 months,
      defined as the proportion of people living with HIV (PLHIV) retained in HIV primary care and
      with suppressed HIV viral load 12 months after starting ART.

    <masking_description>Facility staff will not be blinded to intervention assignment. However, all other research staff will be blinded to intervention assignment. In addition, participants will not be told during the consent process that as part of the study there are intervention and control clinics. The rationale for this is to prevent patients transferring from intervention to control clinics if they find out that there are some clinics offering cash transfers to new ART clients. Large numbers of transferring patients will compromise the integrity of the study and will create an undue burden for facility staff at intervention clinics.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants attending intervention clinics will have the opportunity to receive up to 6 consecutive monthly cash transfers of 22,500 TSH (~$10) each, conditional on visit attendance with the HIV care provider. Cash transfers will be given once monthly for up to 6 months, spaced ≥25 days apart (consistent with National Guidelines for monthly or bimonthly visits) and are conditional on visit attendance. This means that the cash transfer is only given when the patient visits the clinic for their routine appointment, regardless of whether the visit is earlier or later than the scheduled appointment.</description>
