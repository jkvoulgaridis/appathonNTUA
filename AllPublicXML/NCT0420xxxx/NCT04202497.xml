    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine brain LSD1 enzyme occupancy and the relationship of
      occupancy to TAK-418 dose and plasma exposure after single oral dosing of TAK-418 in healthy
      participants using [18F]MNI-1054 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-418. TAK-418 is being tested to determine
      the relationship between brain LSD1 enzyme occupancy and TAK-418 plasma concentration. This
      study will utilize the PET radiotracer [18F]MNI-1054 to evaluate the brain LSD1 enzyme
      occupancy of TAK-418 after single dose oral administration in healthy adult participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. The TAK-418 starting dose with 1.5 mg,
      given on Day 1. Each participant will receive one dose of TAK-418 and up to 3 dynamic
      [18F]MNI-1054 PET scans to assess enzyme occupancy on baseline, Day 1 and Day 2 or 3
      post-TAK-418 dosing.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 62 days. Participants will be followed up on Day 14 for
      follow-up safety assessments.
