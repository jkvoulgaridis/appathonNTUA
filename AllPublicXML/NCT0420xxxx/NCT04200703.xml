  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Quality Improvement Center on Domestic Violence in Child Welfare (QIC-DVCW) is a
      five-year federal cooperative agreement with the Children's Bureau to test an approach to
      improve how child welfare agencies and their partners work collaboratively to help families
      experiencing domestic violence. The safety and well-being of child survivors of domestic
      violence and child maltreatment are closely connected to the safety and well-being of the
      adult survivor of domestic violence. For this reason, the QIC-DVCW is testing an Adult &amp;
      Child Survivor-Centered Approach to addressing the needs of both the parent and child, which
      includes effectively engaging and working with the person causing them harm. The following
      four research questions were developed to guide the work of the Recipient's evaluation of the
      QIC-DVCW, and Provider's data will help to answer these questions:

        1. Does a collaborative, adult and child survivor-centered approach—that includes safely
           engaging and establishing accountability of the DV offender—improve adult and child
           survivor safety, child permanence, and child and family well-being for child welfare
           involved families experiencing DV?

        2. For which families and in which social contexts does an adult and child
           survivor-centered approach improve these outcomes?

        3. What factors are associated with successful implementation and sustainability of an
           adult and child survivor-centered approach?

        4. What are the costs associated with the implementation and maintenance of an adult and
           child survivor-centered approach, and how do these costs compare to the costs of
           &quot;practice as usual&quot;?
