  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients highly allosensitized against HLA antigen awaiting for a kidney transplant have less
      compatible transplants to them, increasing their waitlist time and mortality. Current
      desensitization strategies need to be improved with a high remaining acute rejection rate in
      this population and a substantial survival benefit which is not uniformly reported in the
      literature. The investigators propose to use daratumumab, a human IgG1 (Immunoglobulin
      Gamma-1) monoclonal antibody directed against the CD38 molecule (cluster of differentiation
      38) witch induce response in refractory multiple myeloma by depleting plasma cells, as a new
      agent of desensitization. The study will address the hypothesis that daratumumab can lead to
      a significant decrease in calculated panel reactive antibodies by elimination of anti-HLA
      antibodies-producing plasma cells and facilitate the access to transplantation with a safety
      profile in highly sensitized patients registered in our kidney transplantation center.
