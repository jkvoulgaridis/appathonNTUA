  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase 3 study with phase
      1b portion designed to establish a recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D) and to evaluate the
      efficacy, PK, and safety of tazemetostat + doxorubicin vs placebo + doxorubicin in subjects
      with advanced epithelioid sarcoma (ES). This study will be conducted in 2 parts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open-label phase 1b portion is designed to evaluate the safety of the combination of
      tazemetostat + doxorubicin, as well as to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      RP3D. The phase 3 portion of the clinical trial aims to compare tazemetostat + doxorubicin to
      the current front-line standard treatment, single-agent doxorubicin + placebo, when used as
      first-line treatment in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic ES.
