      This 12-month study will evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole lauroxil compared to oral
      aripiprazole in preventing the re-emergence of psychotic symptoms in patients with a recent
      onset of schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site 12-month open-label randomized study comparing the efficacy of the
      FDA-approved long-acting formulation of aripiprazole lauroxil to the efficacy of oral
      aripiprazole among patients with a recent onset of schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or
      schizoaffective (depressed) disorder. All assessments and treatment will take place at the
      UCLA Aftercare Research Program (300 UCLA Medical Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095), which is a
      program that specializes in the treatment and study of individuals with a recent onset of
      schizophrenia. The primary goal is to evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole lauroxil compared
      to oral aripiprazole in preventing the re-emergence of psychotic symptoms in patients with a
      recent onset of schizophrenia. All patients on oral medications will, at least initially, be
      treated with oral aripiprazole.

    <description>Patients successfully completing the Stabilization period will be randomized to one of the two medications groups: For patients assigned to the AL-LAI (aripiprazole lauroxil- long-acting injections), initiation of AL-LAI will begin with a one-day initiation regimen (using AL-NCD IM (aripiprazole lauroxil NanoCrystal Dispersion)). Subsequent dosing of AL-LAI will be flexible based on clinician judgment. Treatment with AL-LAI can be initiated at a dose of 441mg or 661mg (administered monthly), 882mg (administered monthly or every 6 weeks), or 1064mg (administered every 2 months).</description>

    <description>Patients successfully completing the Stabilization period will be randomized to one of the two medications groups: Patients assigned to the oral medication condition will continue with ARI-ORAL. ARI-ORAL dosage will be flexible and dosage will be at the discretion of the treating psychiatrist. Patients discontinuing ARI-ORAL study drug after Randomization to oral antipsychotic medication, can remain in active treatment and follow-up within the study, and may be prescribed any of a number of first-line oral antipsychotics.</description>
