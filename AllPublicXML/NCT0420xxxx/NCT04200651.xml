  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are comparing dexamethasone ophthalmic insert (DEXTENZA®) to
      the current standard of care, prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops, in a glaucoma population
      receiving both cataract and minimally-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS). DEXTENZA® and
      prednisolone acetate 1% drops are both steroids used to control inflammation after eye
      surgery. DEXTENZA®'s method of delivery differs by offering a sustained release of steroid
      that does not necessitate postoperative anti-inflammatory eye drops. The investigators
      hypothesize that DEXTENZA® will be as safe as prednisolone acetate 1% drops and as effective
      at controlling postoperative inflammation following concomitant cataract-MIGS in a glaucoma
      population. The investigators also hypothesize that DEXTENZA® will be preferred by patients
      over prednisolone acetate 1% drops.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma and cataract surgery patients face an outsize postoperative burden. In addition to
      taking frequent anti-inflammatory eye drops, they often continue their glaucoma medications.
      This can cause patient confusion and nonadherence, potentially leading to poor healing,
      slower recovery period, and/or cystoid macular edema. DEXTENZA®, as a sustained release
      anti-inflammatory insert, could help preclude adherence difficulties and increase comfort by
      reducing eye drop load. However, glaucoma surgeons may hesitate to adopt DEXTENZA® due to
      concerns regarding safety with respect to elevated intraocular pressure. This prospective
      study will address those concerns directly, providing timely and high-quality clinical
      evidence comparing DEXTENZA® to standard-of-care steroid eye drops. For physicians and
      patients, the results of this study will prove immediately useful for therapeutic
      decision-making.
