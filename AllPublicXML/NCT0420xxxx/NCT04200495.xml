  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to collect data comparing the Zensorium Biosensing Wearable
      Device (zBWD) to polysomnography (PSG) in individuals with Sleep-Wake Disorders. zBWD is
      similar to other wearable devices (e.g., fitbit and apple watch) that use an optical light
      sensor and Tri-axis Accelerometer to record steps, activity, sleep/awake states, sleep
      staging, and statistical variation of pulse pressure to track stress. Specifically, it is
      designed to report sleep duration, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep duration.
      However, zBWD has not been validated against PSG for sleep tracking in healthy controls or in
      individuals with sleep-wake disorders.

      Subjects known to have or not have sleep-wake disorder, as well as healthy subjects, will be
      enrolled if they otherwise meet all the inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion
      criteria. Subject will be asked to complete several questionnaires and wear the zBWD for
      7-days, in an off-site (Home) study, followed by a single overnight PSG study to compare the
      zBWD data to the current gold standard of PSG. Subjects who have completed the study will
      also be sent a letter thanking them for their participation and offering a summary of the
      results of their sleep study.

    <description>A full clinical overnight polysomnography (PSG) study will be performed 7 - 10 days following visit 1. The subject will have EEG, EMG, EOG, and ECG electrodes, an adhesive body position sensor placed in standard locations. This equipment is standard for diagnostic PSG. The variables of interest from the PSG are stages of sleep as indicated by PSG including % rapid eye movement (REM; amount of time in REM sleep/Total sleep time) and % non-REM (amount of time in non-REM sleep/Total sleep time)</description>

    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a widely used measure of insomnia with well-established reliability and validity. The ISI consists of seven items, three of which assess severity of insomnia (i.e., degree of difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking too early). The remaining questions tap satisfaction with sleep pattern, effect of sleep on daytime and social functioning, and concern about current sleep difficulties. Ranges from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (Severe insomnia)</description>

    <measure>Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS) is a self-administered measure in which participants rate the intensity of experienced arousal for somatic (8 items) and cognitive (8 items) subscales. The PSAS shows strong internal consistency and reliability. Higher scores indicate worse pre-sleep arousal. Ratings range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely).</description>

    <measure>Berlin Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Berlin Questionnaire is a validated screening tool for sleep disordered breather. One question and four follow-up questions concern snoring; three questions address daytime sleepiness, with a subquestion about sleepiness behind the wheel. Lastly, the measure addresses history of high blood pressure, age, weight, height, sex, neck circumference, and ethnicity. High Risk is considered if there are 2 or more categories where the score is positive, where more categories endorsed equates to higher risk.</description>

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. The questions measure participants experiences of having dozed off or fallen asleep while engaged in eight different activities that differ widely in their somnificity (including sitting in traffic or watching television). can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'</description>
