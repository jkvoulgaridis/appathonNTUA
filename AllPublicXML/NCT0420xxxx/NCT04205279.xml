  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate and compare the effect of three different
      perturbation based training devices on the reactive balance control among healthy young
      adults, healthy older adults, and neurologically impaired stroke individuals. Furthermore,
      the project aims to determine the feasibility and tolerability of 30-minutes of perturbation
      training using the SureFooted Trainer. Overall, the project directs to find out the long term
      effect of training on fall risk reduction and fall prevention.

      This study investigates the effects of perturbation training (slip and trip) based on the
      principles of motor learning. Perturbations in the form of slips and trips induced by the
      three different types of perturbation devices will displace the center of mass outside the
      base of support and challenge the stability, thereby inducing a fall and demand compensatory
      strategies in order to prevent it. Such perturbation training would train the motor system to
      improve stability control and vertical limb support.

      The project design aims to examine the ability of the central nervous system to mitigate the
      interference in stability control (if any) that is induced by opposing types of
      perturbations. The hypothesis of this study if supported by the results, will provide the
      difference in motor learning with training on three different perturbation devices.
      Furthermore, it would help to determine which of the three training devices is the most
      effective in developing defense mechanisms necessary to reduce fall-risk among
      community-living older adults and the neurological population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 34% of the community-dwelling older population experience a detrimental fall each year.
      Moreover, 40% of the individuals who suffer from pathological conditions such as stroke
      experience falls. Age-related changes and post-stroke impairments often lead to impaired
      balance and gait that are highly associated with falls. Most of these falls have been
      reported to occur during dynamic and complex activities such as walking, reaching out for
      objects that are a part of daily living.

      There are various clinical balance tests used to evaluate the balance in individuals
      suffering from a stroke. However, most of the tests measure only the static balance ability
      while performing voluntary/ self-generated activities. Hence, these measures fail to
      determine the reactive balance control or compensatory strategies used to recover from
      unexpected perturbations. Perturbation induced by various perturbation based devices such as
      Activestep treadmill, a motorized, custom-designed free-sliding over-ground walkway that aims
      to cause a loss of balance by presenting a threat to stability, thereby, challenging the
      reactive balance response of an individual. This interventional paradigm has now been widely
      used to quality and trains reactive balance control in older adults and neurologically
      affected populations. Previously studied along with emerging researches and numerous ongoing
      clinical trials focusing on perturbation training using a treadmill and overground walking,
      have already indicated its effectiveness in reducing fall risk. Literature states that more
      than half of the elderly population did not experience any fall after the first exposure of a
      novel slip during over-ground walking. However, the efficacy of a newly introduced equipment,
      Surefooted Trainer, which is a customized, moveable slippery platform where an individual
      walks safely along protected by a harness, has not yet been explored. Surefooted Trainer
      consists of the platform which causes slip-like perturbations and obstacles which cause
      trip-perturbation. Further, both the Activestep and Surefooted Trainer are more compact and
      can be easily installed in clinical settings. While the Activestep is a treadmill based
      system the Surefooted Trainer is an overground walkway perturbation system. The study aims to
      establish feasibility and tolerability for 30 minutes of the Surefooted Trainer first and
      then gather pilot data for assessing the efficacy of these three perturbation training
      systems.

      The perturbation training paradigm is based on the principle that the central nervous system
      adapts and learns from previous experience of perturbation and employs motor learning to
      prospective perturbation induced loss of balance. This helps to reduce the number of falls
      and improves dynamic stability in the laboratory setting which is later translated to
      real-life situations. The dose and intensity necessary to induce motor learning are not
      clearly known and therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the results of
      perturbation training on three devices and identify the most effective training protocol with
      immediate and long term effects on the fall reduction. If the results from this study seem to
      be promising, it could help in translating the most beneficial protocol for clinical
      treatment for older adults and stroke population. To determine the long term effects in the
      community-dwelling, the study will monitor the physical activity of the elderly and stroke
      population during community ambulation.

      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of perturbation training between ActiveStep
      treadmill, a custom-designed over-ground walkway and the Sure-footed Trainer among healthy
      young adults, older adults, and neurologically impaired stroke survivors both immediately
      post-training and in long term on reduction in fall rate. Furthermore, to establish
      feasibility and tolerability of 30-minute training using Surefooted Trainer and then assess
      the efficacy of these three perturbation training systems.

    <description>Perturbation is induced successfully and safely to reproduce inadvertent falls in a protective laboratory environment. Falls will be measured by the amount of body weight supported by the full-body harness system and measured by a load cell attached to this system. Instability of the body's COM and poor limb support prior to touchdown of the recovery step account for 90~100% of subsequent falls (occurring ~500ms later) in both sit-to-stand-slip and in gait-slip, in the laboratory settings. Intervention consists of repeated perturbation training to induce a change in the laboratory induced falls immediately post-training and examine it's retention after the initial training session.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomly assigned to the treadmill training, would undergo either a stance or walking perturbation training protocol. The stroke subjects and older adults would be assigned to either the stance or walking perturbation training protocol. All the participants would be asked to perform voluntary stepping, backward and forward with both limbs pre and post perturbation training. Also, all the participants would perform walking trials with head mounted virtual reality system under three conditions: ice, beach and crowd.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomly assigned to overground slip will be made to walk at their comfortable natural walking speeds either for 5-8 trials on the instrumented walkway (7 m 1.5 m) at their self-selected preferred speed. All the participants would perform walking trials with head mounted virtual reality system under three conditions: ice, beach and crowd. After establishing baseline walking ability, a slip will be introduced without warning which will comprise the baseline slip test followed by a trip in the form of the trip plate. This is followed by a block of 8 trials for slip training, block of 8 trials for trip training and then the mixed block consisting of slip and trip trials interspersed with walking trials. Slips and trips could be induced under either of the limbs.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomly assigned to Surefooted (Surefooted LLC) would be donned a safety harness and instructed that &quot;when you experience slip-like or trip-like movements, try to keep walking on the platform&quot;. Subjects would undergo 4-minute training block on each of the 6 different conditions. The first 3 training blocks would be unidirectional perturbation (either slip or trip) followed by 3 training blocks of mixed directional perturbations while the subjects are walking on the platform. 3 surface conditions- slippery (vinyl surface plate), normal friction with obstacles (surface plate with 6&quot; tall structures embedded), and a foam surface with obstacles embedded would be used.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given thirteen slip and thirteen trip perturbation trials in stance (protocol for perturbation in stance) and during walking (protocol for perturbation in walking). Following the slip and trip training there will be two slip and two trip trials at a higher intensity as a post test assessment. Prior to the training, subjects would be consented if they would like to undergo fMRI which would be repeated again at the end of 3 day walk training protocol. Participants who are not willing to undergo imaging would not be excluded from the study. If participants are willing to participate, Vividness of mental imagery questionnaire would be provided to them followed by fMRI. After the fMRI, subjects would be called for a three day training consisting of blocks of five consecutive slipping trials at varying intensities of slip perturbation during walking.</description>

    <description>Slips and trips could be induced under either of the limbs. The specialized walkway consists of two sliding platforms, each of which is mounted on two rows of low friction linear bearings (friction coefficient = 0.02). The base plate of each platform is bolted separately onto the top of a force platform embedded in the floor. An electronic-mechanical latch system is used to control the 2 states of the support platform; that is, the &quot;locked&quot; state for regular walking and the &quot;release&quot; state to initiate slipping are carefully controlled. The sliding top of the platform is released after the heel strike (vertical force to exceed 2% of the body weight). The slip distance would be adjusted between 30 to 60 centimeters depending upon the different population and their physical capacity.</description>
