  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ENTAiER study is a multicentre randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety
      of eurythmy therapy and Tai Chi in comparison to standard care in chronically ill elderly
      patients with increased risk of falling. Subjects will be randomized to eurythmy therapy or
      Tai Chi or standard care alone. To investigate the changes in cardiovascular and sleep
      quality parameters under Eurythmy Therapy and Tai Chi in comparison to Standard Care in this
      trial, a substudy will be conducted only at the ARCIM Institute. The substudy will recruit
      enrolled participants from the ENTAiER trial to record various cardiovascular and sleep
      quality parameters. The aim is to compare changes in cardiovascular and sleep quality
      parameters under eurythmy therapy, Tai Chi and standard care alone in chronically ill elderly
      patients with increased risk of falling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an optional substudy of a multi-centre, parallel-group, three-arm randomized
      controlled trial - ENTAiER trial - to compare the changes in cardiovascular and sleep quality
      parameters under Eurythmy Therapy and Tai Chi in comparison to Standard Care in chronically
      ill elderly patients with increased risk of falling (see DRKS-ID: DRKS00016609). Subjects who
      consent to enroll in ENTAiER will be asked to participate in this substudy. The main focus of
      this substudy is on assessing the effects of Tai Chi and Eurythmy on the vegetative nervous
      system by measuring various parameters of heart rate variability and pulse wave analysis. In
      addition, the effects on sleep quality will be assessed. Participants of the substudy will
      undergo a measurement of heart rate variability with a long-term-ECG (Bittium Faros 360 TM),
      a pulse wave analysis, recorded with a vital function monitor (VitaGuard® 3100 monitor,
      getemed, Germany), and a blood pressure measurement and they fill in a sleep quality
      questionnaire (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI) at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12
      months.
