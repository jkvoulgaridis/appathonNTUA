  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is being conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of nabiximols, compared with
      placebo, in the treatment of muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial includes a 28-day Baseline period, a
      12-week treatment period (comprising a 2-week titration phase and a 10-week maintenance
      phase), and 2-week follow-up period.

      Eligible participants will enter the 28-day baseline period. During baseline, participants
      will maintain their optimized oral MS antispasticity medication regimen and record spasm
      count using an electronic daily diary. At screening (Day 1), eligible participants will be
      randomized to either nabiximols or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

      Participants will be advised to titrate the investigational medicinal product (IMP),
      beginning with 1 spray/day, to an optimized dose or to a maximum of 12 sprays/day over the
      first 14 days of treatment. Participants should continue at the same dose level achieved at
      the end of the titration phase ±1 spray divided into a morning dose and an evening dose for
      the remainder of the treatment period.

      Daily spasm count, the participant's symptom experiences, clinician's assessment of
      spasticity, functional outcomes, health-related quality of life, changes in mood, safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated during the treatment period.

      Participants who complete the trial will participate for a total of approximately 18 weeks
      (127 days), including the 28-day baseline period. Participants will have a maximum duration
      of 85 (±7) days on IMP treatment.
