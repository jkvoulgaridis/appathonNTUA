  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vinorelbine is the first line reference drug in the elderly patient with locally advanced /
      metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The introduction of the oral formulation of
      vinorelbine has determined a further impulse to its use in 1st line and above all to its use
      as &quot;metronomic&quot; therapy. Metronomic chemotherapy offers the advantage of increasing the
      overall dosage of the drug administered, but reducing the side effects or making them more
      easily manageable; it is practically a question of administering fractionated doses of the
      drug continuously for long periods (generally up to the progression of unacceptable disease
      or toxicity). This study collects data on the efficacy and tolerability of oral metronomic
      vinorelbine in elderly patients with NSCLC, performed as per normal clinical practice.

Starting from the third week, in the absence of any severe toxicity (≥ 3) and in the opinion of the clinician, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg (1 cps from 30 + 1 cps from 20 mg), three times a week ( Monday, Wednesday, Friday) continuously.
The dosage of 40 or 50 mg is continued until progression, patient refusal or unacceptable toxicity (in the clinician's opinion).</description>
