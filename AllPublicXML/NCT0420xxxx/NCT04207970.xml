  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust in London has a Personality Disorder Service (PDS)
      which offers a number of evidence-based interventions to people with a diagnosis of
      Personality Disorder. One team in the PDS, the Community Team, offers an adapted form of
      Structured Clinical Management (SCM; Bateman and Kravitz, 2013). As these adaptations are
      novel, this study aims to formally explore the effectiveness of this intervention, through a
      sample of clients under the team, with outcomes (proxy measures of distress such as inpatient
      admissions) pre- and post- intervention.
