  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigate the possible relationship about blood gas and
      bleeding disorders in healthy volunteers of blasters and no blasters groups of the Italian
      National Mountain and Cave Rescue who handled nitrogen compounds and nitroglycerine and then
      they were exposed to combustion products from an accidental uncontrolled detonation of
      micro-charges during a cave unblocking procedure.

      This was a field report of clinical data collected during an accidental uncontrolled
      detonation of micro-charges, while the cave unblocking procedure was performed by volunteers
      of blaster group and non blasters group of the Italian National Mountain and Cave Rescue, in
      a cave in Trieste (Italy; altitude entrance: 348 meters above sea level; total length: 413,5
      meters; total depth of 307 meters).

      Before going into the cave (Time 0), the following clinical data were collected: age, sex,
      body mass index; smoke (yes/no), heart rate, arterial blood pressure (mean arterial
      pressure), oxygen saturation measured with pulse oxymetry, epitympanic temperature, blood
      gases analyses and the haemostasis measures.

      After the accidental uncontrolled detonation of micro-charges, (Time 1) heart rate, arterial
      blood pressure, oxygen saturation measured with pulse oxymetry, epitympanic temperature,
      blood gases analyses and the haemostasis measures were recorded in each volunteers.
