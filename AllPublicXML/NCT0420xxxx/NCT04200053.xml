      Reflexology massage regulates blood circulation and energy, gives a feeling of relaxation and
      provides homeostasis. During reflexology massage, relaxation music is recommended because it
      contributes to the relaxation of the individual. In the literature, reflexology massage and
      music therapy are used in different pain management, and these methods reduce anxiety and
      improve sleep quality. However, there is no study in which reflexology massage and passive
      music therapy are used to reduce pain, anxiety and sleep problems associated with dressing of
      burn individuals. It is thought that reflexology massage and passive music therapy will
      reduce pain, anxiety and sleep problems in dressing changes of burned individuals.

    <description>The effect of reflexology massage and passive music on pain before burn dressing. The scale used is a scale in which the individual can score himself / herself. &quot;0&quot; means no pain, &quot;10&quot; means pain as bad as can be. In the study, patients' pain will be evaluated for 4 days before and after dressing.</description>

    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of reflexology massage and passive music on anxiety before burn dressing. Anxiety of patients will be measured with Visual analog scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.The Anxiety Inventory consists of two different sections and contains a total of 40 items, 20 each. Each item is scored between 1 and 4. A high score indicates that anxiety level is high. In the study, patients' anxiety will be evaluated for 4 days before and after dressing</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of reflexology massage and passive music on sleep qualty before burn dressing. Sleep quality of patients will be measured by Richard-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire.Each item of the scale is evaluated between 0-100. 0-25 points indicate &quot;very bad sleep&quot; and 76-100 points indicate &quot;very good sleep&quot;. The higher the scale score, the higher the sleep quality of the patient. In the study, patients' sleep will be evaluated for 4 days before and after dressing</description>
