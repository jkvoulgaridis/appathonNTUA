    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be assigned to receive IN or placebo according to a computer generated randomization list composed of randomized blocks of sizes of 2 or 4. Two separate sets of blocks will be created, one for subjects with alcoholic CP and the other for those with other causes of CP. Within each block, equal number of subjects will be assigned to IN and placebo. Separate sets of blocks will be provided for Mayo and Ohio State. The randomization lists will be computer generated by the study statistician (Dr Li), and kept in a secure computer file and paper study binder in the Mayo and Ohio State Research Pharmacies. No investigators or study personnel other than Dr Li will have knowledge of the randomization list. Dr Li will not participate in any aspect of subject recruitment, subject allocation, conduct of the study, or data ascertainment, but will perform data analysis.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinding: Study medication will be labelled &quot;indomethacin 50 mg or placebo capsule&quot; with the subject's name, hospital or clinic number, study IRB number, and subject number. Placebo and IN capsules will be identical in appearance. The investigators, study coordinator, and clinical caregivers will remain blinded to subject allocation throughout the data ascertainment and data entry phase of the study.
The success of blinding will be evaluated by asking the investigator, the study coordinator, and the subject the following question during each telephone follow-up visit: &quot;Which treatment group is this subject/were you assigned to: placebo, active drug, or unsure?&quot;</masking_description>

    <description>The study intervention is oral indomethacin. Indomethacin is an FDA approved, commonly prescribed NSAID. Commercially available indomethacin will be utilized in this study. One capsule orally BID for 28 days. Those in the indomethacin arm will receive indomethacin 50 mg BID. Participants will be advised not to make up missed doses. They will be advised to take a dose of study medication on the morning of their follow-up endoscopy, 2 hours prior to their scheduled procedure time, with a sip of water. At the time of follow-up endoscopy they will return any unused study medication.</description>
