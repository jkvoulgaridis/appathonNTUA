    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the possibility to reduce the total dose of dexamethasone, when
      administered with NEPA, to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving a cisplatin-based chemotherapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On day 1 (day of chemotherapy), all eligible patients will receive oral NEPA (300 mg
      netupitant/0.5 mg palonosetron), 60 minutes before chemotherapy, and intravenous
      dexamethasone 12 mg, 30 minutes before chemotherapy initiation.

      For the prevention of delayed CINV, patients will be assigned randomly to one of the
      following treatment arms:

        -  Test arm A: no further anti-emetic prophylaxis on days 2 thorough 4;

        -  Test arm B: oral dexamethasone 4 mg once per day in the morning of days 2 and 3;

        -  Reference arm C: oral dexamethasone 4 mg twice per day on days 2 thorough 4.

WL as classified according to WLGS, a grading system using the combination of %WL and BMI categories. The analysis will be laid out in a 5x5 matrix representing five different %WL categories within each of the five different BMI categories (25 possible combinations of WL and BMI).
Percentage of WL will be defined as follows: [(current weight in Kg - previous weight in Kg)/previous weight in Kg] x 100. Previous patient weight (i.e., the usual weight) within the last 6 months (or &quot;usual weight&quot;) will be also collected at baseline. BMI will be calculated as current weight/square of the body height (Kg/m2);</description>
