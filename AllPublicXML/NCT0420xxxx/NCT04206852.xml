  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is a potential treatment for non-operable patients with
      chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BPA in CTEPH patients not
      amenable to pulmonary endarterectomy(PEA) or suffered from persistent CTEPH after PEA.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center, long-term observational project to study the
      safety and efficacy of BPA. Clinical evaluation, including: functional capacity, 6-minutes
      walking test, biomarkers, cardiopulmonary exercise test, electrocardiography,
      echocardiography, haemodynamics, pulmonary angiography and lung scintigraphy was performed
      before the initiation therapy of BPA, and 3-12 months after last session of BPA.
