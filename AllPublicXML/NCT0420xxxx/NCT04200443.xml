      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib and temozolomide work in treating patients
      with leiomyosarcoma or other soft tissue sarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery
      (unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cabozantinib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving cabozantinib and temozolomide may work better than either one alone in
      treating patients with leiomyosarcoma or other soft tissue sarcoma. Cabozantinib is an
      investigational drug, which means that it has not been approved by the United States (US)
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory agencies for sale or use by the
      public for the indication under investigation in this study.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival (defined as complete response [CR]+partial
      response [PR]+stable disease [SD]) assessed at 12 weeks for subjects in Cohort 1
      (Leiomyosarcoma Arm) treated with cabozantinib and temozolomide as defined by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (defined as CR+PR) for subjects in Cohort 1 treated
      with a combination of cabozantinib and temozolomide.

      II. To determine the clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) for subjects in Cohort 1 treated with a
      combination of cabozantinib and temozolomide.

      III. To evaluate the median progression free rate for subjects with combination of
      cabozantinib and temozolomide.

      IV. To evaluate overall survival for subjects in Cohort 1 treated with a combination of
      cabozantinib and temozolomide.

      V. To assess safety and tolerability for subjects treated with a combination of cabozantinib
      and temozolomide.

      VI. To determine the overall response rate (defined as CR+PR) in Cohort 2 (other soft tissue
      sarcomas).

      VII. To assess Quality of Life (QoL) and subject-reported outcomes as measured by the
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the EuroQoL-Group Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the correlation of progression free rate (PFR) and overall survival (OS) to
      levels of sVEGFR2, PIGF, VEGF, HGF, sMET, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and soluble AXL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO QD
      on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients with progressive disease (PD) are followed up
      every 6 months for up to 2 years and patients without PD are followed up every 6 months for
      up to 5 years.

             for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening. Females
             of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of becoming
             pregnant (i.e., females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,
             with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been
             amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential
             if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body

          -  Subjects must be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements
             and must have signed the informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to swallow tablets

          -  Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment
             formulation or dacarbazine

          -  Subjects with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regiment are ineligible for this trial

          -  Pregnant or lactating females. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because
             cabozantinib and temozolomide are antineoplastic agents with potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and
             temozolomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             cabozantinib and temozolomide

          -  Prior treatment with cabozantinib or temozolomide

                  investigational) within 28 days before first dose of study treatment

                  treatment

               -  Any other radiation therapy within 28 days before first dose of study treatment

               -  Systemic treatment with radionuclides within 42 days before the first dose of
                  study treatment

                    -  Note: Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior

                       relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible

          -  Corrected QT interval calculated by the Bazetts formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms per
             electrocardiogram (ECG) within 28 days before first dose of study treatment

               -  Note: If a single electrocardiography (ECG) shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt;
                  500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed
                  within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive
                  results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility

          -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including,

                       (MI), or other ischemic event within 6 months before the first dose

               -  Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including those associated with a high risk of
                  perforation or fistula formation:

                    -  The subject has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer
                       disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease), diverticulitis,

               -  Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels

               -  Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study
                  participation
