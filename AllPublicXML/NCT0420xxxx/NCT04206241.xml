      This Unitaid-funded study aims to assess the feasibility and, acceptability and effects of
      implementing HIV testing at birth testing using point-of-care (POC) HIV nucleic acid testing
      (NAT) in maternity settings. Outcomes measures will include age at uptake of testing,
      turnaround time from testing to caregiver result receipt, HIV positivity rate, and timing of
      ART initiation for HIV-positive infants. This study will compare outcomes between HIV-exposed
      at high vs low risk of maternal HIV transmission. The study will also assess the impact of
      POC birth testing on retention in care and impact on subsequent testing at 6 weeks.
