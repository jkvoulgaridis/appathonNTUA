  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing incidence of chronic respiratory diseases is a public health problem affecting
      hundreds of thousands of people around the world, including children. Directly exposed to
      atmospheric aerocontaminants (pollution, allergens), the respiratory tracts represent a
      complex ecosystem that involves different cells that develop complex interactions with the
      surrounding connective tissue but also with their rich immune environment and with the
      microbiota. Although a pathophysiological continuum is postulated between the nasal and
      bronchial airways in certain diseases, such as allergic diseases, we have identified broad
      gradients in gene expression between nasal and bronchial samples. This is why cellular
      variability throughout the respiratory tree needs to be studied in detail.

      The sequencing of RNAs specifically present in a particular cell, and its comparison with
      neighboring cells, allows us to document precise cellular contributions and intercellular
      relationships. Our project will establish protocols to stabilize airway swabs by brushing
      and/or biopsy, under conditions that will then allow the analysis of gene expression profiles
      at the single cell level (single cell RNA sequencing).

      The development of the &quot;single cell&quot; stabilisation and analysis protocol will first be
      carried out on primary respiratory epithelium cultures and then extended to respiratory
      specimens taken from healthy volunteers. Through sampling at several levels of the
      respiratory tree, variations in expression along the tracheobronchial axis will be fully
      documented. Finally, the interaction between the epithelial compartment and the immunological
      compartment will be studied by analyzing gene expression on a single cell in different
      physiopathological contexts.
