  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis (OM) is an acute side effect of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC).
      OM associated pain affects oral functions and nutrition of the patient that may result in
      discontinuity of treatment.The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the therapeutic
      effects of Compound Kushen Injection (CoKS) on oral mucositis caused by radiotherapy of head
      and neck cancer.

Significant: no leukoplakia or ulcer of the oral mucosa, mild hyperemia(grade Ⅰ), able to eat regular diet.
Effective: moderate hyperemia of the oral mucosa, mild leukoplakia or patchy ulcerations(grade Ⅱ)，semi fluid intake, but not interfering with radiotherapy.
Ineffective: severe hyperemia of the oral mucosa, flaked leukoplakia or ulcer (grade III or above), fluid intake，severe symptoms interfering with radiation therapy , intravascular nutrition or antibiotic treatment.

Effective:dietary has improved (for example, changing from liquid food to semi liquid food, from semi liquid food to soft food, or from soft food to regular diet) Ineffective: the patients can not eat, or need tube feedings, or parenteral nutrition.</description>
