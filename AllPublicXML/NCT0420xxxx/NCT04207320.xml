    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a safe and curative stem cell transplant approach to
      treating sickle cell disease by assessing the safety of haploidentical hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation using αβ+ T-cell depletion for children and adolescents with severe
      sickle cell disease (SCD).
