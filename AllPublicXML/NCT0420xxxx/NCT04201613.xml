  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate two aspects of robotic therapy after stroke. One
      goal is to determine if early robotic rehabilitation of the upper limb (beginning 5-9 days
      post-stroke) is more effective than later robotic rehabilitation (beginning 21-25 days
      post-stroke). The other goal is to determine if higher intensity robotic rehabilitation (2
      hours/day) is more effective than lower intensity robotic rehabilitation (1 hour/day).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medically stable stroke subjects will be recruited in the first few days following their
      stroke. All participants will complete clinical and robotic assessments of neurologic
      function at 7 time points. Therapy will occur daily (Monday through Friday) for 20 days.

      Study participants will be randomly assigned to 1) start robot therapy early or late after
      stroke and 2)receive one or two hours of robot therapy per treatment day for four weeks, or
      3) control group that will receive the current standard of care.

      The participant's chart will be reviewed for information about their stroke and related
      health effects and medical treatments. Assessment points to track progress will occur at 7,
      18, 31,44,90,180, and 365 days after a stroke for all groups (give or take 2 days to account
      for weekends and holidays).

      Standard clinical assessments of neurologic function will be done at each assessment point
      and include: cognition, arm strength, muscle tone, spasticity, reflexes, dexterity, visual
      acuity and fields, the Behavioural Inattention Test, and tests of arm movement (Fugl-Meyer
      Upper-Extremity, Box and Block Test, Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment, and the Action
      Research Arm Test). These assessments can usually be done in about an hour. The assessment
      may be done over two sessions if needed due to fatigue or scheduling conflicts.

      Robotic therapy will be conducted using the Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered
      Reaching Movements (KINARM, Bkin Technologies, Kingston, ON). It will include several
      different tasks, each designed to train aspects of sensorimotor function of the proximal
      upper limb. Task performance will be monitored and difficulty will increase within and
      between sessions. The majority of the investigator's methods have been used previously to
      achieve equivalent or superior outcomes to standard rehabilitation.

      Robotic assessment will measure elbow and shoulder range of motion, reaching for targets, the
      ability to mirror match the position of an arm with the other arm, and the ability to use
      both arms to hit away moving targets. The robotic assessment will take approximately 1.5
      hours.

      Robotic tasks include:

      Visually guided reaching with assistance or resistance; Virtual Soccer; Shape Tracking;
      Whack-a-mole; Table Tennis Task; Ball on Bar Task; Proprioceptive Reaching; Hand Ball;
      Proprioceptive Shape Tracking.

    <measure>Change in Fugl-Meyer upper extremity motor function score (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 44 days</time_frame>
    <description>FMA scores upper extremity motor impairment based on 22 items and scores range from 0 (completely plegic) to 66 (normal).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>FIM rates subjects on 18 items across many functions such as eating, grooming, bathing and dressing on a scale from 1 (total assistance needed) to 7 (complete independence). Lowest possible score is 18 (lowest independence) and the best possible score is 126 (completely independent). The FIM is the standard measure used by rehabilitation facilities in Cananda and the United States to evaluate overall function and burden of care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>modified Rankin Scale (mRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The mRS is a disability rating scale from 0 (no symptoms at all) to 6 (deceased).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT assesses arm function to determine the quality of the arm movement, and the limitation of activity. The ARAT consists of 4 sub-tests; that examines and individual's grip, grasp, pinch and gross motor movement in order to determine upper extremity function. Objects of varying size, shape, and weight must be either grasped, handled or moved in a specific task in order to evaluate function. Low scores mean worse function with the minimum possible score being 0 and the highest possible score being 57 (normal function).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Robotic Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 180 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Robotic Assessments. The robotic assessment consists of a number of upper limb tests of neurologic function which have been validated against standard clinical measures. Tasks include: Range of Motion, Visually Guided Reaching, Limb Position Matching, Limb Kinesthesia, and Object Hit. These assessments use z-scores, based on normal distributions, as a measure of performance. Scores within 1.96 standard deviations away from 0 are considered normal and scores beyond 1.96 standard deviations are considered impaired.</description>
