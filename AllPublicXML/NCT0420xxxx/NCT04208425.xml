      Interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are almost uniformly costly and
      time-intensive, blunting dissemination of intervention and stymying opportunities to make
      scalable impact. This study offers the first pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
      whether a single session intervention, shown to reduce internalizing problems in
      typically-developing youth, may improve core and co-occuring symptoms of ASD.

      Interventions for core and co-occurring symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are
      almost uniformly costly and time-intensive, blunting dissemination of intervention and
      stymying opportunities to make scalable, population-level impact. One promising solution to
      this problem is a new class of evidence-based treatments, single-session interventions
      (SSIs), which have shown remarkable efficacy in treating a range of other developmental
      psychopathologies. No study to date has examined SSIs in youth with ASD, which, if even
      marginally effective, could dramatically reduce the cost and expand the public health impact
      of accessible intervention options for ASD. This study offers the first pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of whether an SSI shown to reduce internalizing problems in
      typically-developing youth may improve core and co-occurring symptoms of ASD.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be a two-arm randomized controlled trial, including one active intervention conditions and one active control condition. Adolescents (and one caregiver per adolescent participant) will visit the Social Competence and Treatment Lab in the Department of Psychology at Stony Brook University. This lab visit will last approximately 2.5 hours. Adolescents and parents will complete baseline questionnaires (see sections below for details). Participants will then be randomized to one of two intervention conditions, using Qualtrics built in functionality: the single session growth mindset intervention (SSI GMI), or an active control program, designed to replicate supportive therapy (ST) and tested in previous work. Immediately after intervention completion, adolescents will complete a brief post-intervention questionnaire battery. Adolescents and parents will then be asked to complete online follow-up questionnaire batteries 3-months post-intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Children's Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hour Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent depressive symptom severity will be assessed using the Children's Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2) Child and Parent forms. The CDI-2 is a reliable, valid measure of youth depression severity, normed for youth age and sex and yielding raw and T scores. Changes in youth CDI2 scores from baseline to each of the follow-up assessments will serve as the primary index of intervention effects. The CDI-2 will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Each item on the child form is scored 0-2, yielding a total score between 0 and 56 with a higher total score indicating increased depressive symptomatology and a lower total score indicating decreased depressive symptomatology. Each item on the parent form is scored 0-3, yielding a total score between 0 and 51 with a higher score indicating increased depressive symptomatology and a lower total score indicating decreased depressive symptomatology.</description>

    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second Edition (BRIEF-2) is a valid, reliable tool for assessing executive functioning skills in home and school environments. Changes in BRIEF-2 scores from baseline to the 3-month follow-up assessment will serve as the primary index of intervention effects. The BRIEF-2 will take approximately 10 minutes. Each item on the child form is scored 1-3 (1 = Never; 2 = Sometimes; 3 = Often), yielding a total score between 55 and 165 with a higher total score indicating more severe deficiency. Each item on the parent form is scored 1-3 (1 = Never; 2 = Sometimes; 3 = Often), yielding a total scored between 55 and 165 with a higher total score indicating more severe deficiency.</description>

    <description>The Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18) is a valid, reliable screening tool for adult (here, parental) psychological distress. Adult respondents rate endorsement of 18 physical and emotional complaints on a 0-4 Likert scale (0 = Not at all; 4 = Extremely), yielding a total between 0 and 72 with a higher score indicating increased parental stress. The BSI-18 includes 3 subscales for somatic, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively. The total sum score yields an additional total distress score.

Youth rate agreement with statements about their ability to exert primary control (e.g., &quot;I can do well on tests if I study hard&quot;; &quot;I can get other kids to like me if I try&quot;). This PCSC has shown acceptable internal consistency, 6-month test-retest reliability, and strong inverse relations to adolescent depressive symptoms.

    <description>The web-based growth mindset intervention, called Project Personality, is delivered entirely via Qualtrics and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.

    <description>The Sharing Feelings Intervention is delivered entirely via Qualtrics, is self-administered by youth, and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. It is structurally similar to the growth mindset intervention, but it is designed to mimic supportive therapy (ST). The goals of the ST intervention is to encourage youths to identify and express feelings to close others; the intervention does not teach or emphasize specific skills or beliefs. In previous clinical trials, ST has resulted in significantly fewer reductions in youth internalizing problems compared to cognitive-behavioral and growth mindset interventions.</description>

    <description>The intervention includes five components: 1. An introduction to the brain, including a lesson on the concept of neuroplasticity, describing how and why our behaviors are controlled by thoughts and feelings in their brains, which have potential for change; 2. Written testimonials from older youths who describe their beliefs that people's personal traits (e.g., sadness, anxiety) are malleable, given the brain's plasticity; 3. Additional vignettes written by older youths, describing times when they used &quot;growth mindsets&quot; to persevere through social and emotional setbacks; 4. A summary of selected scientific studies suggesting that personality can, and often does, change in positive ways over time; and 5. An exercise in which the participants write notes to younger students, drawing on scientific information to describe the malleability of people's personal traits (i.e., a &quot;self-persuasion&quot; exercise).</description>
