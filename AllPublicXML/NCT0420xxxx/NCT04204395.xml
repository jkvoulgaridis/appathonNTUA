      *Primary: To compare the control group, women in the experimental group will have lower level
      of labor pain after the intervention of peanut ball usage.

      *Secondary: To compare the control group, women in the experimental group will have higher
      level of support and control after the intervention of peanut ball usage; To compare the
      control group, women in the experimental group will have lower level of anxiety after
      intervention of peanut ball usage; To compare the control group, women in the experimental
      group will have shorter duration of labor after intervention of peanut ball usage.

      We will ask the participants to join this research on the department of obstetric OPD, and
      give the consent form to sign. Then we will allocate the participant into the experiment
      group or the control group, furthermore, we will give the sheet which includes the
      information about peanut ball usage, like the destination, method, position, duration, and QR
      code of the video.

      When they finish the admission process in the delivery room, we will give the peanut ball to
      the participants who is in the experimental group, and the participants of the control group
      will receive the routine care of delivery room.

    <measure>Changed perception of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>The baseline will be assessed when the cervical dilation is during 0 to 3 centimeters. The three post-tests will be assessed when 30 minutes after each intervention, and cervical dilation is during 5 to 7 centimeters, and during 8 to 10 centimeters.</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of Pain assessed by Visual analogue scale for pain(VAS-P). Range of the VAS-P score is 0 to 10, higher scores means worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Changed trajectory of Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>The baseline will be assessed when the cervical dilation is during 0 to 3 centimeters. The three post-tests will be assessed when 30 minutes after each intervention, and cervical dilation is during 5 to 7 centimeters, and during 8 to 10 centimeters.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate Variability assessed by Heart Rate Variability Device which indicates the sympathetic nervous system status.</description>

    <time_frame>The baseline will be assessed when the cervical dilation is during 0 to 3 centimeters. The post-test will be assessed within 24 hours after delivery.</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of Support and Control assessed by Chinese version support and control scale in birth(C-SCIB). The range of the score is from 33 to 165, higher score means better outcome.</description>
