  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the US, and COPD exacerbations result in
      approximately 700,000 hospitalizations annually. Patients who do not respond to
      pharmacotherapy are placed on invasive (IMV) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV).
      Studies have shown that patients treated with NIV are less likely to require IMV and have
      better mortality and length of hospital stay. NIV is recommended in all COPD guidelines as
      the first-line treatment for patients with severe exacerbation who have failed pharmacologic
      treatment. Yet, despite compelling evidence of benefit, there is substantial variation in the
      implementation of NIV across hospitals, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality. The
      main goal is to conduct a two-arm pragmatic type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness
      trial to compare two educational strategies in 20 hospitals with low NIV use in COPD:
      inter-professional education (IPE) which targets complex team-based care in NIV delivery and
      on-line education (OLE). The central hypothesis is that IPE will outperform OLE, leading to
      greater improvement in the uptake of NIV and that RT autonomy and team functionality will act
      as mediators.

      COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the US, and COPD exacerbations result in
      approximately 700,000 hospitalizations annually. Patients who do not respond to
      pharmacotherapy are placed on invasive (IMV) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV).
      Although IMV reverses hypercapnia/hypoxia, it causes significant morbidity and mortality. NIV
      is an alternative ventilatory option for acute respiratory failure that provides positive
      pressure ventilation via a mask. Multiple randomized controlled trials and analyses of
      real-world data have shown that patients treated with NIV are less likely to require IMV and
      have better mortality and length of hospital stay. NIV is recommended in all COPD guidelines
      as the first-line treatment for patients with severe exacerbation who have failed
      pharmacologic treatment. Yet, despite compelling evidence of benefit, we have previously
      demonstrated substantial variation in the implementation of NIV across hospitals, leading to
      preventable morbidity and mortality.

      Through a series of mixed-methods studies investigators have found that successful
      implementation of NIV requires physicians, respiratory therapists (RTs), and nurses to
      communicate and collaborate effectively to select appropriate patients for treatment, and to
      carefully manage patients after NIV initiation. These studies suggest that efforts to
      increase the use of NIV in COPD need to account for the complex and interdisciplinary nature
      of NIV delivery and the need for team coordination. The main goal is to conduct a two-arm
      pragmatic type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial to compare two educational
      strategies in 20 hospitals with low NIV use in COPD: interprofessional education (IPE) which
      targets complex team-based care in NIV delivery and on-line education (OLE). The primary
      outcome of the trial is change in the hospital rate of NIV use among patients with COPD
      requiring ventilatory support. The central hypothesis is that IPE will outperform OLE,
      leading to greater improvement in the uptake of NIV and that RT autonomy and team
      functionality will act as mediators. The goal will be accomplished by completing three
      specific aims. Aim 1 will compare the uptake change over time of NIV use among patients with
      COPD in hospitals enrolled in the two arms. Aim 2 will explore mediators' role (RT autonomy
      and team functionality) on the relationship between the implementation strategies and
      implementation effectiveness. Finally, Aim 3, will assess acceptability and feasibility of
      the educational training through interviews with providers. This proposal is significant
      because NIV is the only therapy that has been shown to improve short-term survival for
      patients hospitalized for exacerbation of COPD, yet a large number of hospitals still have
      not adopted this approach fully.

    <intervention_model_description>Cluster randomization: hospitals are the clusters. In this study, hospitals will be randomized to either the interprofessional educational (IPE) arm, or the online educational (OLE) training arm. In both arms of the study participants will be educated on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) knowledge and skills. For the IPE training, a team of nurses, respiratory therapists (RTs), and physicians from each hospital will have one day in person training which will include NIV knowledge and skills and the principles of interprofessional education. For the OPE hospitals, they will be granted access to online continuing education modules.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Each hospital needs to assign a 'COPD-NIV' team of champions who will lead the implementation strategy at the local level. We will provide one day in-person training for the COPD-NIV teams (one RT, one RN, and one MD) at a central location. The training will consist of 2 modules: 1) NIV knowledge and skills 2) principles of IPE and they will practice on how to deliver it. We will use the train the trainer principle; the team will return to their home institutions and hold training sessions for their peers. The sessions will be offered 2-4 times/month for 3 months. All sessions will include mixed groups of RTs, RNs and MDs. Full sessions will be offered once/ month every six months for the new staff. For the entirety of the study, there will be conference calls of the investigators with the teams every other month.</description>

    <description>The COPD-NIV team will be the first at their hospital to complete the on-line educational training and will then encourage the rest of their peers to complete the training. Sites will be given access to free 30 minute continuing education modules customized for each discipline (RN, RT, MD). The training will include 1) knowledge evidence-based indications, contraindication, monitoring and weaning for about NIV in COPD; and 2) skills to manage and monitor patients while on NIV. The training will be offered for the entire period of the study for all staff. The COPD-NIV team will distribute algorithms and printed materials. Conference calls between the investigators and the COPD-NIV team will continue every quarter for the duration of the study with a follow-up call at the end of the study. The calls will discuss distribution of the guidelines and NIV algorithm, problem-cases regarding NIV management, and strategies to recruit clinicians for the educational sessions.</description>
