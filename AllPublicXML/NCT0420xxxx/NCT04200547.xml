    <textblock>
      Study comparing 2 modalities of Crohn's disease patients postoperative follow-up treated with
      adalimumab (Humira® or biosimilar) : immunomonitoring of adalimumab serum levels versus
      standard follow-up, which is based on the clinical and biological activity of the disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the experimental arm will have a post-operative follow-up based on the
      immunomonitoring of serum levels of adalimumab. After ileocolic resection surgery, patients
      will have a therapeutic optimization of their adalimumab (Humira® or biosimilar) treatment,
      based on their serum residual rate of adalimumab.

      Patients in the control group will receive a standard post-operative follow-up, which is
      based on clinical and biological recurrence.

    <description>The primary endpoint will be measured by ileocolonoscopy under general anesthesia after standard preparation by PEG with video recording of the examination, carried out by one of the investigators of the study in each center. An ileocolonoscopy 6 months after intestinal resection remains the reference examination for the endoscopic diagnosis of recurrence according to the endoscopic Rutgeerts score (endoscopic recurrence if Rutgeerts score ≥ i2) and allows the adaptation or the introduction of a treatment to limit clinical recurrence at 18 months.</description>

    <description>Post-operative follow-up of Crohn's disease patients will be done through the measurement of the residual rate of the drug adalimumab in the serum. Patients will receive adalimumab treatment every other week, starting 1 month after the surgery. 3 months after the surgery, serum levels of adalimumab will be measured:
If the level is below 5ug/mL, adalimumab treatment will be increased to every other week until the end of the study.
If adalimumab level in the serum is above 5ug/mL, the treatment's frequency will be maintained until the end of the study.</description>
