  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells, T cells whose receptor has been
      genetically modified, is based on improving the immune response against the tumor. This
      approach is promising for patients with hematologic malignancies refractory to chemotherapy.
      Despite impressive results, too many patients are relapsing. The reasons for the relapse,
      after the injection of CAR T cells, need to be explored. In this context of newly introduced
      therapeutics, it is essential to better understand the factors associated with the response
      to treatment with CAR T Cells, especially the characteristics of the tumor and its
      microenvironment.

      The objective of this study is to understand the role of tumor biology, and its
      microenvironment, in the response to CAR-T Cells therapy in patients with hematologic
      malignancies
