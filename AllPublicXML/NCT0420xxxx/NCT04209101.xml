  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical students are heavy users of psychoactive substances, and even if levels of use vary
      depending on the universities, the average levels are higher than most other students.

      In France, however, the use of licit or illicit substance has not been precisely described in
      medical students. The aim of this study was therefore to define the different modes of
      consumption of medical students.

      Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey in medical students from the University of
      Montpellier, and the investigators performed a cluster analysis of data. Both medical
      students and residents were included. Socio-demographic, medico-psychological and
      addictological data were collected.
