  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the expected pain response timeline for patients receiving epidural steroid
      injections, our team plans to assess patient pain severity and degree of pain relief every 3
      days for 23 days.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are already planning to receive an epidural steroid injection from their
      physiatrist will be approached by study members on the day of their injection. If enrolled,
      the patients will be contacted every 3 days for 23 days to determine the severity of pain and
      degree of pain relief from the injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient schedule for an epidural steroid injection (ESI) at Stallworth
             Rehabilitation Hospital through the department of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation.

          -  The epidural steroid injection will be performed as part of standard clinical care,
             this study only aims to describe the clinical response to the procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ESI has been performed within the last 6 months

          -  Steroid injection elsewhere in body within last 8 weeks

          -  Oral or intramuscular steroids within last 8 weeks

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent

          -  Unable to comply with required follow up

          -  Please note that it is assumed that a patient scheduled for an epidural steroid
             injection clinically is assumed to not have any contraindications to the injection
             itself such as active systemic infection or pregnancy.
