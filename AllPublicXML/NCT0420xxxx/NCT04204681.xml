  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to detect tongue edema induced by the pressure exerted by tonsillar
      retractor; edema detection was made through tongue area measurement using ultrasonography
      (USG) in pediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tongue is an ideal organ for ultrasonography (USG) evaluation. This study aimed to detect
      the occurrence of tongue edema through USG examination and to educate clinicians about the
      association between subacute tongue edema and tonsillar retractor in pediatric patients.

    <description>Patients aged 16 years or younger who were to undergo tonsillectomy surgery were eligible for inclusion in this group. Tongue areas were measured twice by submental USG.The first measurements (TA2) were done immediately after endotracheal intubation but before insertion and placement of the tonsillar retractor. The second measurements (TA1) were done after tonsillectomy surgery and after removal of the tonsillar retractor but just before extubation. The difference between TA2 and TA1 (i.e., (TA2−TA1) was used to defined the occurrence of tongue edema.</description>

    <description>This group included patients aged 16 years or younger who did not need tonsillectomy surgery and any head and neck procedures. Tongue areas of the patients were measured twice by submental USG as in the study group. TA1s were done immediately after endotracheal intubation, and TA2s were done at the end of the surgical procedure just before extubation. The difference between TA2 and TA1 (i.e., (TA2−TA1) was used to defined the occurrence of tongue edema.</description>

        Patients aged 16 years or younger who were to undergo tonsillectomy surgery were eligible
        for inclusion in this group. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all the
        patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy (except
        adenoidectomy surgeries) and were to undergo tonsillectomy surgery.
