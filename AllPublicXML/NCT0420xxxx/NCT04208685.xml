      As basic and behavioral science identify new ways to improve cognition and behavior in
      individuals with Down syndrome (DS), the lack of rigorous outcome measures represents an
      important problem for interpreting findings. Null findings in clinical trials could result
      from insensitive outcome measures, rather than ineffectiveness of treatment.

      The long-term goal is to improve measurement of outcomes for children and adults with DS.
      Towards that goal, the investigators propose to test and refine a battery of cognitive
      measures that can be used in treatment studies focused on school-aged children and adults
      with Down syndrome. The batteries are designed to assess key domains of the DS phenotype
      where gaps remain in outcome measures, including attention, executive function, learning and
      memory, processing speed, and social cognition.

      The investigators will examine the psychometric properties of measures (test-retest,
      validity, sensitivity to change), and to evaluate differences in the psychometric properties
      of measures as a function of variations in participant age, gender, degree of ID, and the
      participants' physical health and medical comorbidities. The investigators will evaluate at
      least 80 children and 50 adults with Down syndrome, per site, at five time points to evaluate
      key domains with a diverse and novel range of methods. This proposal aims to provide a
      preliminary evaluation to support the enhancement of clinical outcome measures, which
      ultimately will increase the accuracy in documenting improvements in the lives of children
      and young adults with Down syndrome.

      The purpose of the proposed project is to test and refine a battery of cognitive measures
      that can be used in treatment studies focused on Down syndrome. The battery is designed to
      assess several key domains of the Down syndrome cognitive phenotype where gaps remain in
      outcome measures, including attention, executive function, learning and memory, processing
      speed, and social cognition, considering comorbid conditions that can potentially interfere
      with the development within these cognitive domains. Although a single battery for the entire
      lifespan of the individual with Down syndrome has obvious appeal, the investigators have
      focused their effort on the school-age years so that the investigators can capture a key time
      point in development of these cognitive domains. Moreover, new pharmaceutical treatments are
      transitioning from adults to the school-age population, making the need greatest for this
      portion of the lifespan.

      However, based on preliminary research from the ongoing study with children, a need was
      identified to evaluate measures with young adults with DS (ages 18-39). Supplementary funding
      will support the expansion of the project to include young adults with DS. Results will
      provide empirical guidance for refining a battery and form the foundation for a larger-scale
      study evaluating outcome measures.

      For participants 6-17 years, at least 160 children with Down syndrome will be recruited
      across two sites for the study, and participants will be enrolled over four (4) years.
      Following pre-screening and the consent visit to determine study eligibility, children will
      be assessed at 6 time points. The first assessment will be the baseline testing/Time 0 visit
      to assess IQ. At Time 1 baseline assessments for other functioning will be completed. A
      two-week interval will separate Time 1 and Time 2, at which time test-retest reliability
      assessments will be collected. Time 3 will occur three months following Time 2 to evaluate
      test sensitivity to change. Time 4 will occur 3 months following Time 3 and Time 5 will occur
      6 months after Time 4 to assess longitudinal changes. The time interval was selected to
      replicate the duration of many clinical trials.

      For participants 18-35 years, at least one hundred young adults aged 18-29 years with DS will
      be recruited across two sites to participate in the study. Adults will participate in
      neuropsychology assessments at 5 time points. Parents/Caregivers will complete behavioral
      measures at all time points. At Time 1 baseline assessments will be completed. A two-week
      interval (+/- 3 days) will separate Time 1 and Time 2, when test-retest reliability
      assessments will be collected. Time 3 will occur three months following Time 2 (+/- 2 weeks),
      Time 4 will occur three months following Time 3 (+/- 2 weeks), and Time 5 will occur 6 months
      following Time 4 (+/- 2 weeks) to evaluate sensitivity to change. The three and six-month
      time intervals were selected to replicate the duration of many clinical trials. The 12-month
      interval was selected to provide a time interval in which natural development should occur
      and allow the investigators to evaluate sensitivity to change. In this study, change will
      occur due to natural development, while in a clinical trial, change would be expected due to
      treatment. The ability to detect relatively small developmentally-based change over 12 months
      will allow the investigators to evaluate if the measures could detect similarly small changes
      in trials. Once recruitment goals are met for NIH standards for 100 young adults, aged 18-29,
      the study team may begin recruiting adults who are 29-35, as well.

    <ipd_description>The shared databases and corresponding dataset generated for statistical analysis will include demographic information, standardized, experimental and computerized assessment data, and information from parent- and teacher-rating scales. The dataset will include all composite variables and scores, with no identifying information included. The data and associated documentation will be available to users only under a data sharing agreement.
Prior to publication, findings from the project will be shared broadly at scientific meetings attended by ID researchers, especially those likely to be conducting clinical trials, such as meetings of the Down Syndrome Medical Interest Group, and International Down Syndrome Congress. In addition, the investigators will share information about the procedures freely with any investigators considering inclusion of cognitive outcome measures as a clinical endpoint.</ipd_description>
