  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,
      cross-over study with GERDOff Plus added on top of the current PPI treatment in patients with
      GERD. The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of GERDOff Plus, a class III
      medical device, consisting in a hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate and magnesium
      trisilicate, in addition to the PPIs, in patients with GERD not fully satisfied with their
      current treatment with PPIs.

      Patients will receive either GERDOff Plus or placebo q.i.d. for 21 days followed by a
      wash-out period of 3 weeks. After the wash-out period, the patients will receive either
      placebo or GERDOff Plus respectively
