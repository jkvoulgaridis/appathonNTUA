  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and responds only
      partially to pharmacotherapy and surgery. The investigators will explore long-term effects of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over right superior temporal
      gyrus, brain area known to be engaged in the feedback control of voiced speech. The project
      results will allow for the identification of potential therapeutic effects of rTMS as a tool
      that could contribute to the speech therapy of HD in PD patients. The results will also
      enhance our understanding of brain mechanisms underlying specific long-term effects of rTMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two parallel group, randomized, placebo controlled design will be used. Twenty PD patients
      will be stimulated in a two weeks long therapeutical sessions (10 sessions). Other twenty PD
      patients will be stimulated with the same protocol using sham stimulation. An MRI protocol
      consisting of T1, EPI BOLD, and DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) sequences and speech
      evaluation (acoustic signal processing and 3F test) will be performed prior to and after 10
      days of rTMS and then repeated after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.

    <description>The 3F Test Dysarthric Profile enables clinicians to characterize a wide range of signs and symptoms of dysarthria. The minimum value of this scale is 0 (anarthria), the maximum value is 90 (no disorder). Higher scores of this scale mean better outcome. This test will be administrated by speech pathologist.</description>
