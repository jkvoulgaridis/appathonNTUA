      INTRODUCTION The treatment of OA is mostly symptomatic and includes the use of analgesics,
      NSAIDs, exercise and even surgery. However, the use of long-term NSAIDs is associated with
      potentially serious side effects. As a result, the use of alternative and complementary
      therapies (CAM), such as nutritional therapies in patients with OA, is extremely frequent.

      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a dietary supplement
      based on curcumin, polydatin and beta-caryophyllene, on the reduction of pain and
      inflammatory component in individuals with knee OA.

      MATERIAL AND METHOD Study design Intervention study with two parallel arms, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled.

      Study population Participants in the study will be recruited at the Santo Stefano
      Rehabilitation Institute. The first group will be treated with curcumin-based supplement for
      6 weeks; the second group will be treated with placebo for 6 weeks.

      Inclusion/exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria

        -  Presence of osteoarthritis of the knee. Traditional American College of Rheumatology
           criteria, which are based on the presence of pain (knee pain) plus at least three of the
           following characteristics, will be used for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee:

        -  Age &gt; 50 years

        -  Stiffness in the morning &lt; 30 minutes

        -  Presence of articular rusting

        -  Painfulness of the bones

        -  Tumefaction of the bones

        -  Absence of palpable heat Knee pain in this study is defined as having experienced at
           least moderate pain in the most affected knee (a score of 30 mm or more on an analog
           visual scale - VAS - as assessed by the patient) for at least 25 of the previous 30
           days.

      Exclusion criteria

        -  pregnancy and breastfeeding

        -  other specific contraindications/intolerances to the compound

        -  intake of other supplements

        -  treatment with anti-inflammatory or pain-relieving drugs for other clinical conditions
           at the time of enrolment

        -  Participation in other clinical studies All participants will be allowed to use
           analgesics (e.g. paracetamol) to control pain when needed. The patient will, however, be
           required to avoid / suspend the use of analgesics at least 12 hours before the baseline
           visit and subsequent checkups.

      INTRODUCTION Gonarthrosis is the most common disorder of the musculoskeletal system, with an
      age-related prevalence varying between 12-55%. The treatment of OA is mostly symptomatic and
      includes the use of analgesics, NSAIDs, exercise and even surgery. However, the use of
      long-term NSAIDs is associated with potentially serious side effects, with a high risk of
      hospitalization and death. As a result, the use of alternative and complementary therapies
      (CAM), such as nutritional therapies in patients with OA, is extremely frequent.

      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a dietary supplement
      based on curcumin, polydatin and beta-caryophyllene (FENOXIDOL™-Mivell), on the reduction of
      pain and inflammatory component in individuals with knee OA.

      MATERIAL AND METHOD Study design Intervention study with two parallel arms, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled to assess the effectiveness of the dietary supplement in
      reducing perceived pain, will also be evaluated secondarily the improvement of joint
      function, changes in serum levels of PCR, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and
      nitrates / nitrites at the level of saliva and any change in the use of painkillers when
      needed.

      Intervention Intervention group: the study involves the intake of two capsules per day, one
      capsule to be taken before breakfast and one before dinner for a period of 6 weeks.

      The FENOXIDOL™ supplement and its placebo (visually identical capsules, but without active
      ingredients) will be supplied by the company Mivell Srls participating in the PrIntAge
      project. For the composition of the placebo, see the declaration attached to this document by
      Mivell Srls.

      FENOXIDOL™ is a natural anti-inflammatory supplement designed to counteract, without any
      known side effects, acute and chronic inflammatory phenomena, especially those associated
      with joints, muscles and bones. The product has been formulated using naturally derived
      extracts in the quantities shown in the table below.

      PHENOXIDOL CAPSULE COMPOSITION active substances for 1 capsule for 2 capsules Bio Curcumin
      200 mg 400 mg Polydatin 50 mg 100 mg Beta-Caryophyllene 24 mg 48 mg

      It should be noted that the product FENOXIDOL™ and its components have not been associated to
      date with any side effects, the active ingredients of the formula are all listed in Annex 1
      of the Italian Ministry Decree of 10 August 2018 governing the use in food supplements of
      herbal substances and preparations as updated by Decree 9 January 2019.

      It should also be noted that the FENOXIDOL™ product has no Gluten Free certification.

      Placebo group: the study involves taking two capsules per day of placebo, one capsule before
      breakfast and one before dinner for a period of 6 weeks.

      The placebo will consist of capsules with no active ingredients containing cellulose, fatty
      acid magnesium salts, and silicon dioxide.

      All participants will be allowed to use anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen up to 400 mg per
      2/day) to control pain, if needed. The patient will, however, be required to avoid / suspend
      the use of anti-inflammatory at least 12 hours before the visit to baseline and subsequent
      checkups and to record the use.

      Treatment, randomisation and blinding kits Mivell Srls will prepare patient kits containing
      treatment capsules in proportion to the time of administration and sample size considered and
      will send them by courier to the Pharmacy of the Istituto di Riabilitazione Santo Stefano. In
      order to carry out the double-blind study, these kits will be assigned, by Mivell Srls,
      identification codes based on the randomization lists generated by a statistical software.
      Blinding will be maintained for the entire duration of the study, until the analysis of the
      data and, possibly, interrupted only at the time of highlighting potential adverse winds in
      the participants.

      The patient's compliance with the treatment will be calculated on the basis of the percentage
      of residual doses at the end of the study and on the basis of the compilation of a diary.

      Biological samples and data collection Data will be collected on age, gender, educational
      level, BMI, employment, physical activity at work and in leisure time (IPAQ Questionnaire),
      tobacco habits, presence of comorbidity, type of diet (food frequency questionnaire related
      to the last week, with particular regard to the intake of substances with anti-inflammatory /
      antioxidant power, eg: seeds and dried fruit, dark chocolate, bananas, avocado, soya
      products, leafy vegetables, fish, garlic, curry, rosemary, ginger, saffron, (see Cavicchia,
      2009), use of drugs (with particular regard to the frequency of taking painkillers and
      anti-inflammatory drugs in the previous six weeks) and supplements. The following will also
      be evaluated: duration of the disease, presence of osteoporosis, orthopaedic-neurological
      comorbidity, trauma, type of work, obligatory postures, use of special shoes/touches.

      The objective examination will allow the evaluation of the degree of joint impairment, the
      completion of the WOMAC questionnaire, the pVAS scale (Visual Analogue Scale for pain), knee
      height from the ground, A diary of the frequency of use of pain control drugs (ibuprofen up
      to 400mg 2/day), to be completed by the patient or care-giver, will also be delivered.

      The volume of blood collected will be 5 ml, as part of the blood sample performed for
      chemical and clinical tests provided for in normal clinical practice.

      Blood sample testing will be performed immediately after collection at GSS Laboratories,
      using standard methods.

      The concentration of nitrites and nitrates, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha will be evaluated
      at the salivary level. Salivary collection will be done by means of Salivets. Dosages of
      nitrite and nitrate, IL-6 and TNF-alpha will be conducted on morning saliva sample. Salivary
      samples will be processed at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Hygiene Section of
      the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health - Polytechnic University of Marche,
      with delivery within the day or refrigerated for a maximum of 4 days before transport from
      GSS premises to the analysis laboratory.

      Adverse reactions There are currently no adverse reactions associated with taking FENOXIDOL™
      as a dietary supplement. However, in this study, all adverse reactions reported spontaneously
      by the patient or detected by the investigator will be reported on the Case Report Form
      (CRF).

      ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS The procedures in the study regarding conduct, conduct and
      documentation have been prepared to ensure compliance with the ethical principles set out in
      the Helsinki Declaration and its revisions. The design of the research also included
      guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP).
