  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Testosterone is a steroid widely known to improve physical performance due to its
      protein-anabolic effect. Like other androgenic anabolic steroids (EAA), testosterone is
      included on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of prohibited substances.

      EAA are the most detected banned substances in anti-doping controls. Therefore, different
      analytical strategies are required to improve its detection.

      Hypothesis:

      The intramuscular administration of 250 mg of testosterone (cypionate) in healthy subjects
      allows generating detectable concentrations of the drug in urine. Positive urine samples will
      enable to identify analytical strategies for doping control.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: To measure the concentrations of testosterone in urine for anti-doping
      control samples.

      Secondary objective: To identify metabolites and precursors of testosterone in urine. To
      assess safety and tolerability of the drug used.

      Methods:

      Phase I, open, non-randomized clinical trial, with a treatment condition (testosterone)
      administered via intramuscular injection to 4 subjects.

             clinical significance, do not pose a risk to the subject and do not interfere in the
             product evaluation. These variations and their non-relevance will be specifically
             justified in writing.

             excretion of the drug, or that are suggestive of gastrointestinal irritation by drugs.

          -  Clinical background or evidence of psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse or
             habitual consumption of psychoactive drugs.
