    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the prospective validity of neurocognitive functions and
      emotional factors in schoolchildren with ADHD and a control group of typically developing
      schoolchildren at baseline and after three years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of extensive research on children with ADHD, there is still insufficient
      understanding of the discriminative validity of neurocognitive tests and how test results of
      neurocognitive functions and ratings of emotional factors and ADHD symptoms change over time
      and interacts during development. The project is studying the validity of clinical assessment
      methods within the Swedish child and adolescent psychiatry service (CAP) related to the
      identification of ADHD, additional impairments, and comorbidity. The prospective validity of
      neurocognitive functions and emotional factors in schoolchildren with ADHD and a control
      group of typically developing schoolchildren at baseline and after three years will be
      investigated.

      Specific aims: Aim I: Study how attentiveness and impulsivity in ADHD change over three years
      by comparing the results of psychological tests and rating scales at baseline and after three
      years Aim II: Study intellectual development in ADHD by comparing the results of intelligence
      tests at baseline and after three years- Aim III: Study how emotional factors change over
      three years by comparing the results of rating scales at baseline and after three years

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional status assessed with the Beck Youth Inventory.</measure>
    <time_frame>2011-2012 and 2014-2015</time_frame>
    <description>The children were assessed with the Beck youth scales at two timepoints with a time interval of 3 years. Beck Youth Inventory consist of 5 subscales, Depression, Anxiety, Anger, Disruptive behaviour, Self-concept. It is standardized into percentiles and higher scores mean worse behaviour, except for Self-concept. In Self-concept higher scores mean better behaviour.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological status assesses with the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) II</measure>
    <time_frame>2011-2012 and 2014-2015</time_frame>
    <description>The children were assessed with the Conners'CPT II at two timepoints with a time interval of 3 years. Conners' CPT II is a performance based test measuring reaction time, reaction time variability, omissions and comissions. Conners' CPT II is standardised into T scores; mean=50, SD=10. Higher scores mean worse results.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive status assesses with the Weschsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>2011-2012 and 2014-2015</time_frame>
    <description>The children were assessed with the WISC-IV at two timepoints with a time interval of 3 years. The WISC-IV is a performance based test, measuring cognitive functioning. The WISC-IV consists of 10 core subtests, that form four composites (Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, Processing Speed) and Full Scale IQ. The WISC-IV is standardised into the IQ scale, mean=100, SD=15. Higher scores mean better results.</description>

    <description>Participants in the clinical group were recruited to the project when they were assessed for and diagnosed with ADHD at the Neuropsychiatric Unit of the CAP Clinic in Lund in 2011-2012. The ADHD group was treated as usual in the clinic and re-assessed during 2014-2015.</description>

    <description>Participants in the non-clinical group were recruited recruited 2012 from schools in the same district and among children of the same average age as the ADHD-group 2012. The non-clinical group did not have any intervention during the follow-up time. Th non-clinical group was re-assessed during 2015.</description>
