  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A web application decision support tool has been developed for adolescents and young adults
      (AYAs). The purpose of this pilot trial is to test the web application for adolescent and
      young adults (AYAs) with Ulcerative Colitis (UC). This research will assess acceptability,
      feasibility of the decision support intervention for AYA UC patients. Participants will be
      randomized to usual care or usual care plus the web application prior to an upcoming clinic
      visit in Gastroenterology. Participants will complete surveys one week after their clinic
      visit about decision making preferences and, for those in the intervention group, usability
      and acceptability of the web application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The iBDecide app provides participants with electronic tools to learn more about UC, track
      symptoms, create a nutrition diary, enter reminders for medication and clinic visits, as well
      as learn more about treatment options and compare UC medications.

      Participants will be provided instructions over the phone or via email to download the
      iBDecide app on their personal smartphone approximately two weeks prior to the scheduled
      clinic visit. When possible they will download the app during the consent call and the
      research staff member will review features of the app with the participant. For those unable
      to download it while talking on the phone, a follow-up phone call will be scheduled to review
      the features. During the consenting phone call or at the clinic visit, a time will be
      scheduled to collect additional information via a brief telephone survey approximately one
      week after the clinic visit. Participants will be sent emails and an electronic calendar
      invitation to confirm their scheduled telephone interview.
