  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center retrospective observational cohort study of consecutively operated
      patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty with a SYMBOL CUP DMR HA or a SYMBOL CUP DM CEM
      hemispherical dual mobility acetabular implant. The purpose of this study is to estimate the
      safety and efficacy of those two implants at two-year follow-up.

      Description according to PICOS framework:

      Patients:

      - Adult men and women requiring a total hip arthroplasty

      Intervention:

      - THA with SYMBOL CUP DMR HA or SYMBOL CUP DM CEM hemispherical dual mobility acetabular
      implants.

      Comparator: None

      Outcomes:

        -  Safety 1: Implant survival over 2-year follow-up.

        -  Safety 2: All adverse events, with focus on implant dislocation, infections, revision
           surgery

        -  Efficacy 1: Harris Hip Score (HHS) at baseline and 1-year follow-up.

        -  Efficacy 2: Modified HHS consisting of pain + functional subscores at baseline, 1-year
           and 2-year follow-ups.

        -  Efficacy 2: Devane score at baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-ups.

        -  Efficacy 3: Charnley classification at baseline, 1-year and 2-year followups.

      Study design:

        -  single-center retrospective observational cohort study of consecutively operated
           patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty 2 years prior to study start.

        -  Prospective 2-year follow-up letter and phone questionnaire.

    <measure>Implant survival: Ratio of the number of participants alive with the complete index hip prosthesis in position at 2-year follow-up, over their initial number</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years as of index operation</time_frame>
    <description>This is a the ratio of the number of participants who are alive with the complete index hip prosthesis in position at a given follow-up time (numerator) over the initial number of those participants from the date they received the index hip prosthesis (denominator). The cumulative ratio is recalculated at each event using the Kaplan-Meier method from the date of each participant index operation through the date of each participant's death or prosthetic removal surgery or loss-to-follow-up or last assessment alive with the hip prosthesis in place. The longest duration between the index operation and the final assessment is 2 years.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with one or several post-operative adverse events and count of each Serious adverse event and aggregate count of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years as of index operation</time_frame>
    <description>All serious post-operative adverse events are taken into account including implant dislocation, infections, revision surgery.</description>

    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS) at baseline and 1-year follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year as of index operation</time_frame>
    <description>The score is measured at each assessment in each patient. The mean and confidence interval of the score is measured at each assessment as well as for the within-patient difference between assessments</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The modified Harris Hip Score (modified HHS) at baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years as of index operation</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Harris Hip Score (modified HHS) is the sum of pain subscore and functional subscore of the Harris Hip Score. The score is measured at each assessment in each patient. The mean and confidence interval of the score is measured at each assessment as well as for the within-patient difference between assessments</description>
