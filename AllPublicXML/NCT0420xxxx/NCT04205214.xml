    <textblock>
      This Randomised Control Trial (RCT) aims to test a novel Alopecia-tailored, protocolled,
      integrative individual psychological intervention offered to patients with enduring Alopecia.
      The pilot study aims to assess the impact of the intervention on 8 patients, by assessing
      changes in their psychological and physical symptoms (stress, anxiety, depression, quality of
      life, scalp hair, and other bio-markers) compared to 7 patients in the wait-list control
      group.

      Alopecia is a stress-related auto-immune skin condition that results in hair-loss on the
      scalp and around the body. This pilot RCT aims to test a newly developed Alopecia-specific,
      psychological intervention with 8 patients diagnosed with enduring Alopecia. The intervention
      is an Integrative Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, implemented through a protocolled programme
      entailing 12 weeks of hourly individual sessions. The trial will be delivered at The
      Dermatology Department at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London. The pilot study aims
      to evaluate the impact of the intervention on patients' psychological and physical symptoms
      (stress, anxiety, depression, quality of life, scalp hair, and other bio-markers) compared to
      the wait-list control group.
