  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate the use of a simple cognitive task (a memory
      cue followed by playing the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) for decreasing the number of intrusive
      memories of trauma among trauma-exposed women in Iceland. This is a single case series using
      a within subject multiple baseline AB design. Participants will aim to complete a
      no-intervention phase ('A': baseline phase) of one week followed by a one-week intervention
      phase ('B'), including a one-session intervention with a researcher comprising the simple
      cognitive task, followed by instructions to continue using the technique self-guided in
      subsequent weeks. Participants will be asked to monitor the occurrence of intrusive memories
      of trauma in a daily diary. It is predicted that participants will report fewer intrusive
      memories during the intervention phase than during the preceding baseline phase and that the
      frequency of targeted intrusive memories is going to decrease relative to non-targeted
      intrusive memories. Furthermore, we will explore whether having fewer intrusive memories has
      an impact on function and/or PTSD, depressive or anxiety symptoms.

      Participants will attend 3-8 sessions with the researcher. In session one, the intrusive
      memories will be logged for monitoring their frequency in a daily diary for the following
      weeks. Baseline assessment questionnaires will also administered. In the second session, a
      memory will be selected and targeted with the intervention (memory reminder followed by 25
      min gameplay with mental rotation) followed by monitoring the frequency of both the targeted
      and non-targeted intrusive memories. Participants will also complete self-rated questions
      concerning the impact of their intrusive memories. The intervention session will be repeated
      for other intrusive memories (maximum 6 intervention sessions). In the last intervention
      session, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and self-rated questions
      assessing the impact of their intrusive memories. Participants will be asked to complete
      measures at 1 month follow-up and at 3 month follow-up. In the 1 month follow-up,
      participants complete questionnaires and monitor the frequency of intrusive memories for one
      week. In the 3 month follow-up, participants will be contacted via telephone to give an
      estimation of the frequency of intrusive memories in the previous week and answer questions
      about the impact associated with their intrusive memories.
