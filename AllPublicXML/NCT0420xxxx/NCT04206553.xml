  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that dupilumab is superior to placebo in
      achieving sustained remission off oral corticosteroids (OCS) in patients with bullous
      pemphigoid (BP).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the OCS-sparing effects of dupilumab in patients with BP

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on itch in patients with BP

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on health-related quality of life measures in
           patients with BP

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in circulating BP180 and BP230 autoantibody titers

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of dupilumab administered to patients with BP

        -  To characterize the trough concentrations of functional dupilumab over time following
           administration of dupilumab in patients with BP

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of dupilumab in patients with BP over time

             eczematous or erythematous plaques, bullae, pruritus) at the screening and baseline
             visits.

          -  Study participants are required to have histological and serological confirmation of
             BP by the baseline visit.

          -  Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI) activity score ≥24 at baseline and
             screening visits.

          -  Baseline peak pruritus NRS score for maximum itch intensity ≥4

          -  Karnofsky performance status score ≥50% at the screening visit.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Forms of pemphigoid other than classic BP (eg, mucous membrane-dominant BP,
             Brunsting-Perry cicatrial pemphigoid, anti-p200 pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa
             acquisita, or BP with concomitant pemphigus vulgaris)

          -  Patients who are receiving treatments known to cause or exacerbate BP (eg, angiotensin
             converting enzyme inhibitors, penicillamine, furosemide, phenacetin, dipeptidyl
             peptidase 4 inhibitor) who have not been on a stable dose of these medications for at
             least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit

          -  Have ever received treatment with an IL-4 or IL-13 antagonist such as dupilumab,

          -  Treatment with systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks before the baseline visit

          -  Treatment with topical corticosteroids of medium potency or higher, topical
             calcineurin inhibitor, or topical crisaborole within 1 week before the baseline visit

          -  Treatment with non-steroidal immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drug(s) (eg,
             mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or methotrexate) within 4 weeks before the

          -  Any cell-depleting agents including but not limited to rituximab: within 12 months
             before the baseline visit, or until lymphocyte and CD 19+ lymphocyte count returns to
             normal, whichever is longer

          -  Other biologics: within 5 half-lives (if known) or 16 weeks prior to the baseline
