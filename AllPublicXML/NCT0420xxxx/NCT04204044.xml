      Aim of the study is to compare the effect of myoinositol and metformin in the resumption of
      the spontaneous menstrual cycle in patients diagnosed with PCOS or having oligo/amenorrhea,
      reduction in weight and BMI, Improvement in the biochemical and clinical profile of patients
      with the polycystic syndrome.

      The secondary outcome measured will be the rate of pregnancy, miscarriage and term pregnancy
      among these patients inducted in the study.

      It will be a Three-arm prospective double-blind study. this clinical trial will be registered
      in Public registry. this RCT will be based on CONSORT statement. The patient coming to
      Gynecology OPD will be randomized into 3 groups GROUP A ( metformin 500 mg TDS), GROUP B(
      myoinositol 2mg x BD ), GROUP C.(both metformin,&amp; myoinositol).each group will take folic
      acid and will be asked for lifestyle modifications.

      PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age associated with insulin
      resistance. Metformin and Myo-inositol being insulin sensitizers improve biochemical
      parameters. it is aimed to compare the effect of myoinositol and metformin in the resumption
      of the spontaneous menstrual cycle in patients diagnosed with PCOS or having
      oligo/amenorrhea, reduction in weight and BMI, Improvement in the biochemical and clinical
      profile of patients with the polycystic syndrome.

      Inclusion criteria: will be based on the Rotterdam criteria of diagnosing PCO. Patients
      presenting with a history of secondary amenorrhea, irregular menstrual cycle, oligomenorrhea,
      weight gain, hirsutism, and already diagnosed cases of PCO will be included in this group.

      Patients with history of Hyperprolactinemia, Cushing's disease, Hypothyroidism/
      Hyperthyroidism, Pregnancy and nursing, Established type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, Any
      history of drug intake e.g. anti-diabetic or estrogen and progesterone, History of treatment
      for the same complaint taken in the last 3 months, Unable to come for regular follow-ups, Any
      pathological cause of bleeding e.g. Fibroid, Polyp, Cervical pathology and known allergic to
      these drugs would be excluded.
