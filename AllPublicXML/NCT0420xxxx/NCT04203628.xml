  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing interest for the use of stool samples as an alternative to respiratory
      samples for the diagnosis of intrathoracic TB in children unable to produce sputum. Unlike
      respiratory samples, stool samples require processing before molecular testing. Several
      groups have already evaluated different processing methods. However, it is difficult to know
      which method has the best accuracy and potential for use at Primary Health Care level, due to
      the difference in study designs and populations. Therefore, in this study, the investigators
      propose to evaluate the accuracy of different promising stool processing methods in the same
      population within the same study with an adapted design. Furthermore, no study has so far
      evaluated for stool testing the new Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra cartridge that has a lower level of
      detection than the previous Xpert MTB/RIF cartridge. The investigators propose to evaluate
      the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) performed on stool samples collected from
      children with presumptive TB and processed using four different processing methods (Standard
      sucrose flotation method, optimized sucrose flotation method, SPK, and SOS) against
      bacteriological results from respiratory specimens and to perform a head-to-head comparison
      of the diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of these different methods in Uganda and Zambia.
      The selection of processing methods was based on accuracy results, degree of simplification
      allowing their introduction at PHC level, and finding from the TB-Speed in-vitro stool
      processing study. The standard sucrose flotation method is kept to assess if results obtained
      with the optimised sucrose-flotation method in our in-vitro study can be reproduced in-vivo

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the Ultra assay in stools
      with a two-stage sequential design starting as a cohort of children with presumptive TB
      enriched in a second stage with Ultra positive TB cases on respiratory sample. It is both an
      ancillary to the TB-Speed HIV (C18-27) and the TB-Speed SAM (C18-28) studies and a study
      enrolling children from routine not enrolled in those two studies.

      This design was chosen to be able to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Ultra
      assay in a smaller sample size that is usually required by a &quot;classical&quot; prospective cohort
      design and avoiding the bias of overestimation of the sensitivity classically associated with
      the case-control design. In order to quickly generate data on appropriate stool processing
      method, and to contribute to the planned WHO recommendations for stool Ultra testing
      (expected 2nd semester 2020), a two-stage sequential design will be used. Indeed, knowing
      that on average only 10-15% of children with presumptive TB in a community-based setting will
      be confirmed, in order to reach the sample size of confirmed cases for the evaluation of
      sensitivity, 7 to 10 times more children with presumptive TB would need to be enrolled in a
      prospective design. On the other hand, the number of children with presumptive TB not
      confirmed with TB for the estimation of the specificity would be reached much earlier. In
      addition, based on the previous study results, it is known that the specificity of Xpert
      MTB/RIF assay in stool is high (99% CI:98-99;), which would result in a relatively small
      sample size to evaluate the specificity of the Ultra in stools.

      During the first stage, the investigators will offer to join all consecutive presumptive TB
      cases presenting at study sites to estimate specificity with the expected precision and
      calculate a preliminary sensitivity estimate. During the second stage, the investigators will
      keep enrolling only those from TB Speed studies and routine care who are Xpert positive on
      respiratory samples in order to estimate sensitivity with the expected precision.

      This two-stage sequential design first estimating specificity then sensitivity has been
      described by Wruck et al. as an efficient way of validating diagnostic tests when the
      prevalence of the disease is low. It would not be feasible to consecutively enrol all
      children with presumptive TB to describe an expected sensitivity of 60% with 10% precision as
      this would require over 900 patients, of which, approximately 800 would be culture negative.
      In the two-stage process described by Wruck, only reference standard positive samples from
      the original population are selected in stage 2. The investigators adapted this design to the
      TB context as culture results will only be available after enrollment (and if the child is
      positive, only after the child has started treatment), hence selecting only those who are
      Ultra positive on respiratory samples for the second cohort as a way of enriching the study
      population with a subpopulation that has a higher TB prevalence probability, before their
      true disease status is confirmed. Other comparable diagnostic studies have either used
      greater resources to include larger samples sizes or have resorted to reporting imprecise
      estimates of sensitivity. To our knowledge, this is a relatively unique approach to study
      design for accuracy studies, with few published examples.

      With such design, there should be no bias on the evaluation of the specificity similarly to a
      classical prospective design because this evaluation will be done among consecutively
      enrolled children with presumptive TB only. The sensitivity estimates may not be
      generalizable to all culture confirmed TB children due to the sampling approach. Xpert
      positive children will be more likely to have higher biological loads, causing a possible
      inflation of the sensitivity. However, the results will provide valuable information on
      variations of sensitivities of the different stool processing methods within this population.

      An interim analysis will be carried out after the completion of the prospective cohort in
      order to describe specificity and preliminary results of the sensitivity and the agreement
      between the processing methods. The recruitment of participants will not be put on hold
      during the interim analysis. A final analysis will be conducted at the end of the study to
      describe sensitivity as well as the secondary end points.

During stage 1 (prospective cohort stage), all consecutive children with presumptive TB enrolled in the TB-Speed HIV or TB-Speed SAM or seen in routine care if ineligible for those two studies will be proposed to participate in the study until we reach the number needed for the evaluation of specificity. All children with presumptive TB will have at least two respiratory samples collected (ES or GA ) tested with Ultra and mycobacterial culture. The cohort will be closed once the sample size of presumptive TB children with two negative Ultra results from respiratory samples will be reached.
During the 2nd phase (enrichment phase), only children with presumptive TB who are Xpert positive on at least one respiratory sample will be proposed to participate in the study in order to complement the number of confirmed TB cases required for the evaluation of the sensitivity.</intervention_model_description>

The assessment will be divided into 2 parts:
General characteristics of the stool processing method will be scored according to a rating system laying on 10 criteria describing the ease of use. The score range from 1 to 50, each criteria being scored from 1 to 5. A low score reflects the lowest levels of complexity of sample processing procedures.
Characteristic related to the opinion of the laboratory technician (rapidity and ease of performance, quality of instruction sheet, perceived feasibility at each step). The opinion of all study laboratory technicians will be assessed independently and using a short self-administered questionnaire containing open and multiple-choice questions</description>

For children identified from the routine practice, the nurse will collect 2 respiratory samples (sputum or GA) in consecutive children with presumptive TB to be tested using Ultra as done in routine care, record symptoms and refer the child for clinical exam and for chest X-ray. For the purpose of the study, 2 stool samples will be collected to be tested with Ultra. In addition, for study purpose the two respiratory samples will be tested with Mycobacterial culture as this test is not routinely prescribed for TB diagnosis in the study sites</description>
