  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine photos of CCCA patients taken before and after
      treatment to compare treatment outcomes between different treatment groups
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment groups that patients will be randomized to include 1) topical steroid plus oral
      antibiotic group, and topical minoxidil after 8 months 2) topical steroid plus intralesional
      steroid group and topical minoxidil after 8 months. Both these regimens are used as the
      first-line treatments by clinicians. The objective of this study is to examine photos of CCCA
      patients taken before and after treatment to compare treatment outcomes between different
      treatment groups.

      In this study, the investigators are looking to determine how standard treatment affects the
      outcome of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia; to determine if topical steroid with
      With Doxycycline has better outcome than topical steroids with intralesional steroids in
      central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, and to determine how the addition of topical
      minoxidil as a treatment changes the outcome of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia.

    <description>Questionnaire measures how CCCA and the symptoms associated have affected daily activities over the past week. A 5-point scale is used. It ranges from 'Very Much' to 'Not Relevant' with 'Very Much' meaning that it negatively affects their daily living and quality of life and 'Not Relevant' meaning that it has no effect on their daily living and quality of life.</description>
