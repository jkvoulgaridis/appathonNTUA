      This study evaluates the efficacy of PGx-guided medication in patients with depression
      treated with Venlafaxine and the efficacy of the combination of PGx and TDM in patients with
      depression treated with Venlafaxine. Half of participants will receive PGx-guided treatment,
      while the other half will receive routine treatment. After the 8th week, the PGx-guided
      treatment group would be randomly divided into two groups. Of which, half of participants
      will receive the combination of PGx and TDM, and the other half will receive PGx -guided
      medication only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current clinical medication is based on &quot;Trial and Error&quot;, while the traditional
      medication is mainly based on experience. The study mainly optimizes the treatment path from
      two perspectives: to help clinicians select drugs accurately through the detection of PGx; to
      help clinicians monitor the whole process of drug use through TDM and adjust the dosage in
      time to achieve better treatment.

      PGx tests take the information of metabolic, transporting and target genetic factors into
      account comprehensively. Furthermore, clinical effects depend on blood concentration rather
      than dose concentration. TDM aims to monitor blood concentration, which is related to drug
      efficacy and toxicity.

      Venlafaxine is an antidepressant drugs of the 5-hydroxytryptamine selective seratonin
      re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which has been approved by FDA for the treatment of depressive
      disorders, depressive disorders with anxiety symptoms, generalized anxiety disorders and
      social anxiety disorders since 1994.
