  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory performance is shown to be affected by age stereotypes among older adults. The purpose
      of the study is to examine the effects of age stereotype primes on episodic memory using
      priming intervention. The moderating effects of social participation is also examined.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants are community-dwelling older adults residing in Hong Kong. They are invited
      to review their social participation profile and given a brief psycho-education about memory.

      They are then randomly allocated to one of the two following conditions. Participants are
      primed either with age stereotypes or non-age stereotypes words by implicit priming
      intervention in the context of a reaction task prior to the episodic memory tasks. Other
      measures such as demographic variables and social participation rate are collected by
      questionnaire during the delayed recall interval.

    <description>The Hong Kong List Learning is a validated tool for assessing episodic memory for aged Chinese speaking adults (Chan, 2006). It was further taken for investigating differences among older adults with normal cognitive ability and older adults with mild cognitive impairment (Yeung et al., 2016). The random control list was taken in this study. It comprises 16 words formed by four categories:</description>

    <description>The priming intervention was performed using the E-prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). To ensure the primes flashed on screen were beyond awareness, the similar adjustment procedure was taken (see Levy, 1996; Stein et al., 2002). After the trial block, participants were asked to try to report any words viewed during each trial. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) will be reduced or enhanced whenever 2 words or above were correctly reported or no single word could be reported respectively. The priming SOA for this study ranged from 32 ms to 208 ms (M = 98.70 ms. SD = 48.60).</description>
