  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the link between muscle health and immune health in breast cancer
      survivors. Regular exercise is known to improve overall survival in cancer patients but the
      mechanism is not known. In this study the investigators will evaluate if improving muscle
      mass and strength via exercise improves the immune system's ability to fight cancer.

      This is a one armed study where in 30 breast cancer survivors will be recruited to a 4 month
      exercise intervention. Increase in muscle mass and strength will be correlated with immune
      cell frequency and function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer survivors with stronger and larger muscles have better overall survival and
      lower recurrence than women with weaker and smaller muscles. However, the mechanism for this
      association is currently unknown. A recent study from the investigators has shown that there
      is an association between the frequency of immune cell types that kill cancer and higher
      muscle mass and strength, with higher muscle mass and strength correlating with a higher
      frequency of cancer killing, effector memory, T cells. The investigators thus propose that
      increasing muscle mass and strength can improve overall survival and reduce recurrence by
      increasing the number of cancer killing immune T cells.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will recruit 30 breast cancer survivors to an
      exercise program designed to increase their muscle mass and strength. The program will be
      optimized to each participant's level of fitness and strength and will be designed by experts
      in the field. Personal trainers will teach the participants how to exercise and use muscle
      resistance training equipment using the correct technique and will monitor progress to avoid
      injuries and to maximize training benefits.

      The investigators will collect blood (to study immune cell subsets) and measure muscle
      strength and body composition (to measure muscle mass) for participants before and after the
      study.

      The duration of the exercise training protocol is 4 months and participants will be asked to
      exercise 4 days a week; 2 days at the gym and 2 days at home.

    <time_frame>16 weeks of muscle resistance training</time_frame>
    <description>Effector memory cells are immune cells that can kill cancer. We will measure the frequency of these cells before and after the 16 week training program to see if they increase. Flow Cytometry techniques will be used to determine the frequency of these cells.</description>

    <measure>Change in frequency of central memory immune cells</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of muscle resistance training</time_frame>
    <description>Central memory cells are immune cells that are linked to poor prognosis in patients with cancer. We will measure the frequency of these cells before and after the 16 week training program to see if they decrease. Flow Cytometry techniques will be used to determine the frequency of these cells.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in frequency of regulatory immune cells</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of muscle resistance training</time_frame>
    <description>Regulatory immune cells, also called Tregs, are a type of immune cell that keeps the immune system from becoming over active. However, people with too many Treg cells might be more susceptible to cancer growth. We will measure the frequency of Tregs by Flow Cytometry before and after the 16 week training program to see if exercise reduces their frequency.</description>

    <description>Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be used to measure the appendicular muscle mass (amount of muscle in the arms and legs) before and after the 16 week training program. The appendicular muscle mass index is calculated using the appendicular muscle mass divided by height square and is measured in kg/m^2.</description>

    <measure>Change in capacity to climb stairs</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of muscle resistance training</time_frame>
    <description>The stair climb test measures the amount of power used by a participant to climb a set of stairs. Power is measured in Watts (W) and is calculated using the time taken to climb the stairs (seconds), the vertical height of the stairs (meters) and the weight (kilograms) of the participant and is a standard measure of performance. The stair climb test will be performed before and after the 16 week training program.</description>
