      The initial subjecting handling experience of neophyte contact lens wearers with Precision1
      will be compared to that with a daily disposable lens which mas been on the market for
      numerous years (1-Day ACUVUE Moist).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is between 18 and 40 years of age inclusively and has full legal capacity to
             volunteer;

          2. Has read and signed an information consent letter;

          3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;

          4. Is a neophyte who has no history of any previous contact lens handling experience;

          5. Has a refraction cyl ≤1.00DC in either eye (after vertexing to corneal plane);

          6. Has visual acuity ≤0.20 logMAR each eye with study lenses;

          7. Demonstrates acceptable fit with study lenses;

          8. Demonstrates the ability to successfully insert and remove the study lenses 3 times
             for each eye (contralateral CL handling, so that each lens type inserted and removed
             3x on same eye);

          9. Is willing to wear study CLs at least 5 days per week and 6 hours per day throughout
             the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;

          2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study
             outcome variable;

          4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator
             may affect a study outcome variable;

          5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;

          6. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment (by
             self-report);

          7. Is aphakic;

          8. Has undergone refractive error surgery;

          9. Has taken part in another clinical research study within the last 14 days;

         10. Any ocular and/or systemic conditions or concomitant medication to contraindicate
             contact lens wear or be expected to interfere with the primary outcome variables.

               -  For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or
                  inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered
                  clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction,
                  papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered
                  active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of
                  previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.
