    <textblock>
      The Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence (CRTCE) is a healthcare facility
      principally focused on providing best practices of intravenous ketamine treatment to adult
      patients suffering from mental health conditions. The center focuses specifically on treating
      individuals suffering from major depression disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress
      disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder as their primary diagnosis. Herein, this
      retrospective analysis aims to look at past data in order to further develop our
      understanding of ketamine in the use of psychiatry.

    <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a self-report assessment used to evaluate depression severity in patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode. In total, there are 16 individual questions evaluating 9 DSM domains. The highest score is 27, indicating severe depression, while the lowest score is 0, which would suggest a complete absence of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist has been used for general anesthesia since the 1970s, however, reports and trials by the end of the twentieth century and onward using subanesthetic doses suggested robust and rapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects. Ketamine is available as a 50/50 racemic mixture of enantiomers (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine.</description>

        The investigators aim to analyze data from June 2018 (clinic opening) to present. Patients
        must have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-5) diagnosis of Major Depressive

        Compulsive Disorder (OCD) as determined by a psychiatrist. Patients must currently be
        experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE) as defined by the DSM-5.

             pharmacotherapeutic treatment options as suggested in the CANMAT MDD guidelines 2016,

          7. Uncontrolled medical disorders (i.e., uncontrolled and/or insufficiently treated
             hypertension, allergies to ketamine and/or previous intolerability of ketamine).

          8. Pregnancy.

          9. Medical contraindications to ketamine.
