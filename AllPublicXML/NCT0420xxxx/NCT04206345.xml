      Purpose of the study is; to investigate the acute effects of exercises combined with blood
      flow restriction on strength, proprioception and functional motor performance in healthy
      individuals. The investigators hypothesized that blood flow restriction exercises has a
      positive effect on strength, proprioception and functional motor performance.

      60 healthy individuals will randomized into 3 groups of 20 people each. Participants will be
      held in a familiarization session before 3-4 days the actual evaluation. Elbow bending
      exercises with blood flow restriction will be performed to the blood flow restriction (BFR)
      group, elbow bending exercises without blood flow restriction will be performed to the
      exercise group and control group will not receive any interventions. Participants will be
      evaluated before and after the exercise session. Control group is going to rest for 10
      minutes before the second evaluation. Evaluation protocol includes; muscle strength
      measurement with digital hand dynamometer, shoulder and elbow proprioception evaluation with
      inclinometer, Upper Extremity Closed Kinetic Chain Stabilization Test, Functional Throwing
      Performance Index and Modified Pull-Up Test.
