  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infraclavicular nerve catheter for postoperative analgesia will be included in the 70 adult
      patients undergoing upper extremity surgery included in the study. These patients will be
      randomized to the catheter tip configuration as CEMP (closed-ended multiport catheter) group
      and OESP (open-ended single port catheter) group. Patient controlled analgesia device will be
      attached to the peripheral nerve catheter of these patients. Demographic data of the number
      of pushing the button, the amount of bolus dose given, the total dose given in the patient
      controlled anesthesia device, the need for additional analgesia and the amount, pain scores,
      complications will be recorded for three days postoperatively. Records will be compared
      statistically.

      Ethics committee approval was received on 10 December 2019, numbered 19/398. The study was
      planned to include 70 adult patients undergoing upper extremity surgery at Gulhane Training
      and Research Hospital between 10 December 2019 and February 2020. Continue infraclavicular
      nerve catheter for postoperative analgesia will be included in the patients included in the
      study. These patients will be randomized to the catheter tip configuration as
      CEMP(closed-ended multiport catheter) group and OESP(open-ended single port catheter) group.
      Patient controlled analgesia device will be attached to the peripheral nerve catheter of
      these patients. Demographic data of the patients who have placed an infraclavicular catheter
      and used the catheter successfully for three days postoperatively, the number of pushing the
      button, the amount of bolus dose given and the total dose given in the patient controlled
      anesthesia device,the amounts of need for additional analgesia and pain scores(Numeric rating
      Scale), complications will be recorded. Records will be compared statistically.

After medial to lateral scanning, the branches of the brachial plexus will be seen as posterior, lateral and medial truncus around the axillary artery. Contiplex® FX Non-Stimulating Tuohy Set, 17Ga. x 3½ inches. the Non-Stimulating Needle and the closed-tip multiport catheter will be delivered through the needle and placed at the 6 o'clock position relative to the axillary artery and then secured by forming a tunnel under the skin. After negative aspiration, the location of the catheter will be confirmed by injecting 1-2 ml of local anesthetic under ultrasonic guidance.</description>
