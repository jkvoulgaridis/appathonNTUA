  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exosome deployment in patients
      with Craniofacial Neuralgia. Secondarily, this study is designed to rigorously evaluate for
      any adverse events that may be related to the administration and reception of exosomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to amplify the delivery of growth factors and anti-inflammatory
      agents to localized targets (determined by specific condition) by using focused transcranial
      ultrasound prior to intravenous infusion of exosomes. Exosomes delivered intravenously can be
      demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier naturally. Exosomes are thought to play a
      normal physiological role in intercellular signaling, and demonstrate anti-inflammatory and
      pro-growth effects in preclinical models and clinical cases reports. Clinical trials have
      deployed exosomes intravenously and with intracerebral and intrathecal injection, and have
      claimed safety and clinical efficacy.

      Focused ultrasound has been shown to enhance local blood flow and has been presented as a
      non-invasive means of targeting delivery of therapeutic agents.

    <intervention_model_description>The present study is being undertaken as an open label study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of exosomes as an intervention for patients with craniofacial neuralgia. Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize validated tests that are appropriate for repeated measures. The present study can be easily implemented because the neuropsychological testing instruments have been in routine clinical deployment providing for a high degree of availability and reliability. Quality assurance is tightly controlled. The study population is sufficiently broad and the conditions of interest are sufficiently prevalent so that recruitment of subjects is not a limiting factor.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a 9 item self-report questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. Self-report measure containing a composite pain score and functional interference score. The pain subscale contains 4 questions, each with answers ranging from 0 'no pain' to 10 'pain as bad as you can imagine.' Total possible score for the pain subscale is 40 points. The functional/interference subscale contains 7 questions, with each answer ranging from 0 'does not interfere' to 10 'completely interferes.' The maximum possible score for the interference subscale is 70 points. The total overall composite BPI score is out of 100 maximum points. A clinical improvement is considered a decrease in BPI overall composite score by at least 30% from baseline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Total possible score is 27 points. A clinical improvement is considered a decrease in BPI overall composite score by at least 30% from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Adverse Event Reporting</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) and any other untoward signs or symptoms were collected at each study timepoint starting at the treatment injection. Serious adverse events (SAEs) determined by the investigator to be related to the study treatment were formally recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change (GRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The GRC is a self-administered one-item Likert scale questionnaire on the patient's overall satisfaction with the treatment; with scores from &quot;-5&quot; (very much worse) to &quot;+5&quot; (very much better). A GRC of at least is considered to be clinically significant improvement.</description>
