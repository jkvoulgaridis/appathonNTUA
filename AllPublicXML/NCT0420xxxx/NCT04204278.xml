    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the clinical improvement and safety in patients
      treated with MONOVISC for ankle osteoarthritis. Specifically, this study will provide
      confirmation to the effectiveness and safety of MONOVISC at relieving ankle joint pain to 6
      months post-treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obtain real world, post market data to confirm the clinical improvement and safety in
      patients treated with a single injection of MONOVISC for the symptomatic relief of
      osteoarthritis in the ankle joint. The entire study duration from first subject in to last
      subject out will be approximately one and half years. The enrollment phase will be
      approximately 12 months with a follow-up phase of 6 months. Visits will be scheduled at
      screening, baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment.

          3. Diagnosis of symptomatic osteoarthritic joint in the index joint (Kellgren-Lawrence
             grade I to III) to be treated with MONOVISC injection.

          4. Failed conservative treatment for joint osteoarthritis.

          5. NRS pain on walking ≥4 and ≤9 in the index joint.

          6. Subject must be willing to abstain from other treatments of the index joint for the
             duration of the study.

          7. Subject is willing to discontinue all analgesics including NSAIDs, except
             acetaminophen/paracetamol, at least seven days before the treatment injection and

          8. Subject is willing to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to a maximum of 4.0 grams
             per day per the package insert) for the treatment of joint pain for the duration of
             the study. At least forty-eight hours prior to the Baseline Visit and each follow-up
             visit, the subject is willing to discontinue use of acetaminophen/paracetamol.

         14. Diagnosis of osteonecrosis in index joint

         15. Subject has significant varus or valgus deformity greater than 10 degrees in either
