      The aim of this project is to test the CARDIOSPACE II system that integrates several medical
      devices. This system is dedicated to physiological studies in space environment.

        -  Electrocardiogram

        -  Vascular doppler

        -  Laser doppler with iontophoresis

        -  Continuous blood pressure recording at the finger level

        -  Brachial blood pressure

        -  Ultrasound

        -  Ambulatory Electrocardiogram and SAO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) recorder
