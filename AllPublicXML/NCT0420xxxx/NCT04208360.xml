  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present trial, the StethoMe electronic stethoscope will be used for pulmonary
      auscultation and recording of lung sounds in the pediatric study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, international - 2 EU sites (max. 1 in Poland) and a single US site.

      Trial centers and investigators will be identified and selected based on their clinical and
      research experience.

      The trial objective is to assess whether use of the StethoMe AI lung sounds analysis software
      provides clinical benefit by improving the identification of abnormal lung sounds in the
      categories of wheezes, rhonchi, fine crackles and coarse as compared to pulmonary
      auscultation by experienced physicians (general practitioners (GPs) and pulmonologists).

      The recordings will be used to form a gold standard database of lung sounds as evaluated by
      an expert, independent panel according to the study protocol. The gold standard database will
      include approximately equal representation of wheezes, rhonchi, fine crackles and coarse
      crackles. Moreover, the database will also include recordings without any of the previous
      descripted pathological sounds. The results of these two analyses, by traditional physician
      listening and by the StethoMe AI software application, will be assessed for sensitivity and
      specificity to the gold standard database in detection of the four lung sounds and recordings
      without defined pathological sounds. The StethoMe AI will be considered to provide clinical
      benefit if it demonstrates statistically better sensitivity or specificity on any of the four
      lung sounds as compared to the traditional physician auscultation, together with F1 score
      analysis.

        It is planned to enroll 84 patients into the trial in three trial centers that will be
        participating in the study. Each center should recruit approximately 33% of study
        recordings (25-30 patients).
