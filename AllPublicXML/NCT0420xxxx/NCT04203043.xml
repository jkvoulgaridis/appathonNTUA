      To evaluate whether oral supplementation with Pycnogenol (Flebon®) can interfere with skin
      hyperpigmentation after polidocanol foam sclerotherapy in patients with mild to moderate
      chronic venous insufficiency (CEAP C2 and C3) compared with the use of Placebo.

      A randomized double-blind study with research centers in the state of São Paulo (Hospital das
      Clínicas de São Paulo (HC-SP)) is proposed. Treatment groups: Group 1: Elastic stockings +
      FlebonGroup 2: Use of elastic socks + Placebo de Flebon.1 Visit 1 - Screening and Selection

      days) • Evaluation of withdrawal criteria • Evaluated adherence to treatment by use diary •
      Return of control (eventual drainage) • Record of adverse events • Clinical evaluationVisit
      04 - D30 - Return 30 days after visit 2 (+/- 2 days) • Treatment adherence assessment by use

      assessment, if any • Aberdeen questionnaire application (without schematic drawing) •
      Medication suspension • Hyperpigmentation scale • Adverse event recording • Research
      participant satisfaction rating • Clinical assessmentPhotographic recording of the legs will
      be performed before 30, 60 and 90 days in 03 (three) incidences and evaluated by 01 blind
      observer. The photographic records will be made by camera following the same parameters,
      namely: 60 cm distance to 50 cm from the ground, not using flash, with artificial lighting
      (ceiling light), without zoom. All generated images will be archived in JPEG (Joint
      Photographic File Format) format. Images must be downloaded within 5 days of photographic
      registration and inserted into All images should be encoded as follows: IDENTIFICATION OF
      PARTICIPANTS + DATE OF PHOTOGRAPH REGISTRATION CO (00/00/0000) + VISIT. In addition, a
      sticker with the research participant's initials and date of photograph registration should
      be visible to the image. The blinded study medium will evaluate all photographs at the end of
      the study, making a comparison between them to inform the presence and the evolution of
      hyperpigmentation due to foam sclerotherapy, when they occur.For this, the Torok
      Hyperpigmentation Scale will be applied at D 30, D 60 and D90.
