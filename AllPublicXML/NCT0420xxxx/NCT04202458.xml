  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy are the most efficient treatments for acute
      ischemic stroke patients in time window. However, sufficient recanalization (mTICI2b-3) can
      't be acquired in all patients under thrombectomy. The EXTEND-IA TNK study indicated that
      tenecteplase before thrombectomy was associated with a higher incidence of reperfusion and
      better functional outcome than alteplase among patients with ischemic stroke treated within
      4.5 hours after symptom onset. This study intends to explore whether a combination of
      thrombectomy and intra-arterial TNK administration can increase recanalization rate after the
      first attempt of thrombectomy device pass for ischemic Stroke.
