  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis in cancer patients has improved over the years. Survivor rates have increased
      significantly, and paternity has become an important concern in more than 50% of young male
      survivors. Sperm cryopreservation before cancer treatment is highly recommendable in these
      patients, as a strategy to preserve their fertility due to is not possible to predict how the
      chemo or radiotherapy treatment will affect the spermatogenesis.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate if sperm after an antineoplastic treatment can be
      safely used. To determine the possible effects of oncological treatments in the
      spermatogenesis, three parameters will be analyzed, aneuploidy frequencies, DNA fragmentation
      in single and double-strand breaks and methylation levels to determine epigenetic changes
      before and after the therapy.

      If cancer treatment affect sperm genetic integrity, it would have a clinical impact in the
      offspring of these patients. Identify the different side effects of antineoplastic treatments
      in DNA sperm will provide a clinical improvement in order to select the best sperm sample in
      an IVF treatment and it will facilitate genetic counseling

    <description>The epigenetic analysis will be performed in the laboratories of the company &quot;Sequentia Biotech&quot;. The treatment of denatured DNA with sodium bisulfite will be carried out, causing the demining of the cytosine not methylated, preserving the integrity of the Metilcitosines. After DNA sequencing, treated with bisulfite, the methylation state can be inferred directly from the readings aligned against a reference genome: an unmodified cytosine will indicate the existence of methylation in that position, while A thymine (result of PCR amplification after demining) will mean the existence of a non-methylated cytosine. The methylation values will be calculated with the MethylDackel software and the statistical analysis with R package bsseq.</description>
