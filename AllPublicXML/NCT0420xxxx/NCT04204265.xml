      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the clinical improvement and safety in patients
      treated with MONOVISC for shoulder osteoarthritis. Specifically, this study will provide
      confirmation to the effectiveness and safety of MONOVISC at relieving shoulder joint pain to
      6 months post-treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 45 kg/m2

          3. Diagnosis of symptomatic osteoarthritic joint in the index joint (Kellgren Lawrence
             grade I to III or Guyette grade I to III) to be treated with MONOVISC injection.

          4. Failed conservative treatment for joint osteoarthritis.

          5. NRS pain ≥4 and ≤9 in the index joint.

          6. Subject must be willing to abstain from other treatments of the index joint for the
             duration of the study.

          7. Subject is willing to discontinue all analgesics including NSAIDs, except
             acetaminophen/paracetamol, at least seven days before the treatment injection and
             through the completion of the study.

          8. Subject is willing to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to a maximum of 4.0 grams
             per day per the package insert) for the treatment of joint pain for the duration of
             the study. At least forty-eight hours prior to the Baseline Visit and each follow-up
             visit, the subject is willing to discontinue use of acetaminophen/paracetamol.

          9. Subject is willing to maintain a stable dose of oral glucosamine and/or chondroitin
             sulfate products throughout the study, if taken prior to signing the informed consent
             form (ICF).

         10. Able and willing to provide signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the hyaluronan

          2. Infection or skin disease in the area of the injection site or index joint

          3. NRS pain &gt; 3 in the contralateral joint

          4. Subject received an injection of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and/or steroid in either joint
             within 6 months of signing the informed consent form (ICF). A subject will be excluded
             if they are planning to receive an HA or steroid injection (other than the study
             injection) in either joint during the course of this study.

          5. Known inflammatory or autoimmune disorders (including rheumatoid arthritis, gout), or
             other pre-existing medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             impact treatment of the index joint or affect the ability of the subject to accurately
             complete the study questionnaires and comply with the study requirements.

          6. Subject is taking medications at the time of signing the ICF which could interfere
             with the treatment procedure, healing and/or assessments. This includes but is not
             limited to oral or injectable anticoagulant treatments, anti-aggregant platelet
             treatment, chronic opioid analgesics. Low dose aspirin used for cardiovascular

          7. Subjects who had an oral, intramuscular, intravenous, rectal suppository or topical
             (excluded in index joint only) corticosteroid prior 30 days of signing the ICF are
             excluded. Topical corticosteroid use at any site other than the index joint is
             allowed.

          8. Significant trauma to the index shoulder within 26 weeks of screening

          9. Chronic use of narcotics or cannabis.

         10. Ligament instability or tear in index joint.

         11. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia

         12. Diagnosis of osteonecrosis in index joint

         13. Uncontrolled diabetes with HbA1c of &gt;7%.

         14. Subject is a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding at the Screening Visit or a woman
             of child bearing potential who refuses to use effective contraception during the
             course of the study.

         15. Subject is receiving or in litigation for worker's compensation.
