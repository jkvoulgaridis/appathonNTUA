  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well lorcaserin works in treating chemotherapy-induced
      peripheral neuropathy in patients with stage I-IV gastrointestinal or breast cancer.
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes pain, numbness,
      tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. This condition can
      occur in patients who have received taxane chemotherapy drugs, or the chemotherapy drug
      oxaliplatin. Lorcaserin may improve chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy by reducing
      pain, preventing or relieving joint symptoms, and improving balance.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of lorcaserin to improve balance decrements in patients
      with chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate patient reported outcomes (PROs) after a one time dose of lorcaserin in
      patients with chronic CIPN.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lorcaserin orally (PO) on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             includes methods such as oral contraceptives, double barrier method (condom plus
             spermicide or diaphragm), or abstaining from sexual intercourse

          -  Be willing and able to understand and sign the written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is beyond 24 months out from completion of oxaliplatin or paclitaxel

          -  Is asymptomatic for CIPN

          -  Is currently pregnant or breast feeding as there is an unknown but potential risk for
