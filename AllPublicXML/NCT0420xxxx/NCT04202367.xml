  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of different bupivacaine
      concentrations in pediatric patients undergoing ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane
      (TAP) block for unilateral inguinal hernia repair. In recruited 74 patients; Group 1 (n:37)
      received 1 mg/kg bupivakain 0.25% and Group 2 (n: 37) received 1 mg/kg bupivakain 0.125% for
      ultrasound-guided TAP block following standard general anaesthesia induction. FLACC (Face,
      Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) behavioral pain assessment scale was used for evaluating
      patients' postoperative pain levels at 15-, 30-, 45-minute and 1-, 2-, 6-, 24-hour. Tramadol
      1 mg/kg was administered intravenously as rescue analgesic when FLACC score was ≥4. Total
      analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay and side effects were recorded.

      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a safe and effective analgesia technique for
      paediatric patients. This study is designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of different
      bupivacaine concentrations in paediatric patients undergoing ultrasound-guided TAP blocks for
      unilateral inguinal hernia repair surgery. Seventy-four patients aging between 1 and 8 years,
      undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia surgery, were enrolled for this study after obtaining
      Institutional Ethics Committee approval and written informed consents from parents or legal
      guardians (2016/1281). Group 1 (n:37) received 1 mg/kg bupivakain 0.25% and Group 2 (n: 37)
      received 1 mg/kg bupivakain 0.125% for ultrasound-guided TAP block following standard general
      anaesthesia induction. All patients received remifentanil 0,1 μg/kg/h infusion and
      paracetamol 15 mg/kg intraoperatively, and paracetamol 4x15 mg/kg per day postoperatively.
      FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) behavioral pain assessment scale was used
      for evaluating patients' postoperative pain levels at 15-, 30-, 45-minute and 1-, 2-, 6-,
      24-hour. Tramadol 1 mg/kg was administered intravenously as rescue analgesic when FLACC score
      was ≥4. Total analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay and side effects were recorded.
