  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To evaluate the effect of a HIP-REP on the quality and independence in ADL
      ability (performance), measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) and
      health-related Quality of Life (QoL).

      Hypothesis: The HIP-REP will increase the quality and independence in ADL performance,
      measured with AMPS and health-related QoL measure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the effect of an intersectoral rehabilitation intervention aiming at
      reducing the decrease in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) ability for elderly with hip
      fractures. Despite positive surgical outcomes, one-quarter dies within a year after surgery,
      around eight percent are readmitted to hospital, and just one-third regain their pre-fracture
      level of physical functioning and ADL ability. After hip fracture, the loss of independence,
      and further decrease in ADL ability often persists beyond three months after surgery. This
      increases the risk of social isolation, depression and thus a decrease in QoL. Therefore, the
      investigators want to evaluate whether an activity-based rehabilitation intervention across
      sectors is effective and influences this fragile group of patients. The investigators hope to
      increase the ability to safely and independently perform ADL in elderly with hip fractures,
      and thereby enhance their health-related QoL.

    <time_frame>Change frombaseline at motor and process skills 3 and 6 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment measures the quality of a person's activity of daily living task performance. An observational assessment that allows for evaluation of change in motor and process skills and their effect on the ability of an individual to perform complex or instrumental and personal activities of daily living. The instrument consists of 16 motor and 20 process skill abilities that are rated on a 4-point scale. The rating scale is based on the following criteria (Quality of performance); 4 = Competent, 3 = Questionable, 2 = Ineffective or 1 = Severely deficient. In all, 36 discrete ratings of motor and process skills are made during observation.</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 and 6 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>A survey collecting information about health related quality of life comprising five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.</description>

    <measure>Functional Recovery Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3 and 6 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Recovery Score assess the level of function with eleven-items comprised of three main components: basic activities of daily living assessed by four items, instrumental activities of daily living assessed by six items, and mobility assessed by one item. Basic activities of daily living comprise 44 percent of the score; instrumental activities of daily living comprise 23 percent, and mobility comprises 33 percent. Complete independence in basic and instrumental activities of daily living and mobility results in a score of 100percent.</description>

    <description>The elderly in the control group will receive usual rehabilitation. with a focus on mobilization within 24 hours postoperative as an in-patient. In the municipality physiotherapy is offered twice a week for approximately 12 weeks postoperative focusing on neuromotor control over hip, activation and strengthening of muscles as well as increase mobility. When relevant, the elderly receives a home visit by an occupational therapist who assess ADL behaviours, the use of assistive devices and the environmental hazards, preparing and adapting the home environment to prevent falls.</description>
