  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers would like to know how long pregnant women spend in different positions
      during the night - and how often women change positions - across pregnancy. The researchers
      also want to see if the sleep monitor is able to improve sleep behaviors

    <measure>Proportion of sleep time spent in the supine position as measured by the Pregnancy Coach</measure>

    <measure>Proportion of sleep time spent with objective snoring as indicated by the Pregnancy Coach</measure>

    <measure>Proportion of participants where their 'going to sleep' position was the same as their dominant sleep position</measure>
    <time_frame>Until delivery, approximately 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be conducted using the naturalistic arm (deactivated device). We will determine whether the &quot;going to sleep&quot; position during each gestational week is predictive of the most dominant sleep position.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of sleep position changes following alert from Pregnancy Coach</measure>
    <time_frame>Until delivery, approximately 12 weeks</time_frame>
