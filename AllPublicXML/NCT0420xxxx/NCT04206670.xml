  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and evaluate new in-home supportive technology that is designed to
      alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers of individuals
      with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, refine, and evaluate a new hardware/software system designed to
      integrate in-home sensors and devices, Internet-of-Things technologies (i.e., devices that
      can be controlled and communicated with via the internet), and social networking to create a
      more safe and supportive home environment for caregivers and people who have Alzheimer's
      disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment. The system monitors troublesome
      behaviors in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (e.g., wandering), and targets
      mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in people with
      dementia or mild cognitive impairment with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines in health and
      well-being). The system is designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited time and
      energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care
      professionals.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Caregivers in the full operation condition will have fewer negative effects of
           caregiving (lower burden, better mental and physical health, higher well-being) than
           those in the control condition.

        2. Greater use of the social networking features of the system will be associated with
           fewer caregiver depressive symptoms.

        3. Greater utilization of the home safety features of the system will be associated with
           fewer caregiver anxiety symptoms.

Remote assistance will be provided to help with the installation. Sensors, warnings, messaging, and social networking features will be activated remotely.

During that six-month period, questionnaires (e.g., health and well-being) will be administered 3 times (at the start of the study and every 3 months thereafter). At the end of the six-month period, participants will receive and install the full system (sensors for entry, activity, temperature, water leak; voice control; digital display; local router) in their homes. Remote assistance will be provided to help with the installation. Sensors, warnings, messaging, and social networking features will be activated remotely.
