  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary
      combined clinic intervention compared to usual care in a population of patients with two or
      more Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurative,
      spondyloarthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, are associated with increased risk of
      somatic and psychiatric comorbidities as well as reduced socioeconomic status and a risk of
      further autoimmune diseases. The unmet needs in the care of patients with IMIDs are caused by
      a lack of patient-centricity in the usual unidisciplinary siloed approach to these diseases.
      The overall aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary
      combined clinic intervention compared to usual care in a population of patients with the
      IMIDs: psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, spondyloarthritis, ulcerative colitis, and
      Crohn's disease. This trial is designed to determine if the interdisciplinary intervention
      works in a real-world setting and thus has several pragmatic elements. The hypotheses will be
      tested in a randomized, usual care controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Consecutively
      enrolled subjects are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either treatment in the
      interdisciplinary combined clinic or usual care in a hospital clinical setting. 300 subjects
      will be randomized to either multidisciplinary combined clinic intervention (200 subjects) or
      usual care (100 subjects). The study will consist of a 24-Week active intervention period and
      an additional 24-Weeks follow-up period.
