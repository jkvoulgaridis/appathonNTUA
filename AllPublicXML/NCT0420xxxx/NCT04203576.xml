  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First in Human Clinical Investigation of the FIRE1 Device/System to evaluate the feasibility
      and safety of implanting the FIRE1 system in stable HF patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients must be stable HF patients, NYHA class III who were hospitalised/treated
      for an episode of worsening HF within the last 12 months. This non-randomised FIH trial will
      enrol a total of 10 patients and the primary safety and technical endpoints will be assessed
      at 3 months. Safety measures will include an assessment of all adverse events. Subjects will
      remain on this study for 24 months.

        Main Inclusion Criteria

          -  Adults 18 years or older with NYHA Class III heart failure with any of the following
             in the past 12 months: a decompensation due to heart failure resulting in a heart
             failure hospitalisation, heart failure treatment in a hospital day-care setting or
             urgent outpatient heart failure visit

          -  Diagnosis of heart failure and receiving heart failure medical therapy for &gt; 3 months

          -  On stable optimized HF therapy

          -  Signed patient informed consent form

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant comorbidity that would interfere with the ability to safely complete the
             clinical investigation protocol

          -  Patients with an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 ml/min

          -  Patients with IVC filter placement in situ, abnormal IVC or femoral venous anatomy or
             known congenital malformation or absence of IVC or occlusive or free-floating thrombus
             in the IVC

          -  Patients with implantable ventricular assist device (LVAD, RVAD, BiVAD) or prosthetic
             valves in situ

          -  Patients with Cardiac Resynchronization Device (CRT) or implantable
             cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implanted ≤ 3 months prior to enrolment

          -  Patients with conditions associated with occlusion of the IVC, iliac or common femoral
             veins (e.g. venous leg ulcers)
