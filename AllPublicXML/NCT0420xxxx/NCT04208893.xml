    <textblock>
      The investigators will explore the feasibility and safety of two exercise interventions
      delivered both in the hospital and in participants' homes. Preteens and adolescents who have
      had repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), will be grouped by age and randomly assigned to
      either an aerobic or strength training exercise program supervised for 12 weeks. An
      exploratory aim of this study will be to examine changes in fitness level, muscle strength,
      muscle oxygen extraction and quality of life after the intervention, and compare these
      measures between groups. At the end of the study, participants and parents will be
      interviewed to assess their satisfaction and ideas for improvements in the program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While adult cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an established clinical practice, the
      conceptualization, design and utility of pediatric CR programs have been poorly studied.
      Particular challenges for children with heart disease include uncertainties regarding
      physical activity restrictions imposed by clinicians and overprotection by caregivers. These
      challenges may lead to poor lifestyle and deconditioning, resulting in increased health risks
      associated with inactivity, such as adiposity, and reduced perceived general health and
      quality of life. Preliminary studies have shown therapeutic benefits of physical exercise as
      an add-on therapy in an effort to improve patients' functional outcome after cardiac surgery
      1; however, delivery of these programs has been variable, and it is not clear whether a
      combined program of facility and home-based exercise would yield higher patient adherence for
      children. The investigators hypothesize that a supervised exercise training program delivered
      both in the hospital and in participants' homes will be acceptable and feasible for children
      with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The investigators will conduct a pilot trial over 1
      year in which the investigators will randomize 20 participants to either aerobic exercise
      only or a combined aerobic and strength training program for 12 weeks. The investigators will
      conduct qualitative interviews to understand intervention acceptability. Results will support
      a larger definitive study aimed at determining efficacy.

CSAPPA is a 20-item scale designed to capture children's perceived adequacy to perform physical activities and preference to either physical activity engagement or sedentary pursuit. It is composed of 3 subscales related to physical activity: adequacy (7 items), predilection (9 items), and enjoyment of physical education class (3 items). Each item was structured in an alternative choice format whereby children will be asked to select an option that best describes them. For example, children will choose which of these two statements best identify them &quot;some kids can't wait to play active games after school&quot; or &quot;other kids would rather do something else&quot;, then indicate whether the selected claim was either &quot;sort of true for me&quot; or &quot;really true for me&quot;. Each response is scored from 1 to 4, where highest score indicate preference to more active endeavours.</description>

    <description>The aerobic training intervention will include 60 minutes/session, 3 times/week for 12 weeks at an intensity of 65% - 85% of participants' heart rate reserve (HRR), as determined by the CPET. Patients will be asked to wear a fitness-tracking device to monitor their heart rate response and in order to comply with the prescribed training intensity. All training sessions will start with a 10-minute warm up, 40-minute aerobic interventions, and ends with 10-minute of cool down. One study doctor will be on call during in-hospital training. Onsite supervised aerobic interventions will include play-based activities, whereas home-based aerobic activities will include stationary bikes and exercise activities that would target desired heart rate ranges. Home exercise equipment will be provided.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will perform a combination of aerobic and strength training activities for 60 minutes/session, 3 times/week for 12 weeks. Aerobic activities for this group will be similar to Arm 1. Strength training will be based on participant's individual assessment findings and developmental status. Resistance level will be set at approximately 50% of the patient maximal load and increased by 3 pounds (or the next level of resistance band) once the patient is able to perform 30 repetitions. Closed kinetic chain exercises such as pushups, squats, and lunges will be made more challenging by the addition of weight or change in body position. Training sessions will include a 10-minute warm up, 40-minute aerobic and strength exercises, and a 10-minute cooldown.</description>
