  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AK105 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specially binds to PD-1. Anlotinib is a small
      molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Based on the mechanism study, tumor vascular
      abnormalities promote tissue hypoxia and increase lactic acid, thereby activating
      immunosuppression and inhibiting T cell function. Anti-angiogenic drugs enhance the
      infiltration of effector immune cells by inducing normalization of blood vessels and reducing
      immunosuppression.
