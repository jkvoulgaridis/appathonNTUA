  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-site, non-randomized study of up to 40 treated subjects; subjects enrolled
      may be greater than subjects treated.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled to ensure a minimum number of subjects by skin type participate in
      the study as follows: FST I-II, at least 5 subjects; FST III, at least 10 subjects; FST IV,
      at least 5 subjects. Additionally, up to 20 training subjects will be enrolled that will be
      excluded from efficacy analysis, but will be included in safety analysis.

      Standardized baseline and follow-up images will be taken using the sites' preferred camera
      system. No pre-treatment medication prior to study treatment.

      Phase I: Study subjects will receive up to three treatments with the PicoPlus with the 595nm
      on one hand and the 660nm on the other hand. Subjects will receive the same wavelength for
      all treatments on each specific hand; treatments will alternate by subjects between the left
      side getting treated with the 595nm and the right side getting treated with the 660nm
      depending on enrollment. Treatments will be 30+7 days apart up to three treatments until
      desired clearance has been achieved.

      Phase II: Up to 2 balancing treatments may be done if needed based on the investigator's
      discretion to achieve equal clearance on each hand utilizing the wavelength of the
      investigator's choice. Phase II will not be considered for efficacy endpoints.

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Principal Investigator, sub-investigator or qualified clinician delegated by the principal investigator, will complete a Clinician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale assessing overall aesthetic improvement by wavelength at the 30-day visit following the last treatment visit for Phase I of the study. Scale ranging 1-Very Much Improved and 5-Worse.</description>

    <measure>Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>During all study treatments, the subject's pain levels will be monitored using a validated Numeric Rating Scale ranging from 0-10. The maximum and average pain score will be recorded by wavelength.</description>
