  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to assess the prevalence of common mental disorders and
      alcohol use disorders in a population of individuals seeking help from their Member of
      Parliament (MP) in the UK.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Members of Parliament (MP) in the United Kingdom (UK) represent the interests of their
      constituents. Constituents may contact their MP for assistance if they feel that they have
      been treated unfairly by a government department or agency, have concerns relating to their
      local area, or are wanting support from their MP for a campaign they are involved in. In
      order to fulfil their duty to constituents, MPs hold regular surgeries which allow anyone
      with a concern to meet with them to discuss the issue in question further. Given the role of
      the MP in representing people who may be in the midst of stressful events, such as a dispute,
      it is possible that mental health problems may be more prevalent in this population. However,
      at present MPs are not given any additional training in recognising mental distress, and may
      not know how to appropriately sign-post people to appropriate supportive services, nor do MPs
      receive advice in supporting such individuals. To the best of the investigator's knowledge,
      there have been no prior studies in this area. The findings of this study will inform
      initiatives to improve MP working practices, to and raise awareness of the mental health
      challenges faced by their constituents, with the aim of better meeting the mental health
      needs of constituents who attend MP surgeries in the future.

    <description>The GHQ-12 is a structured validated screening tool to assess for the presence of CMDs, administered to participants who have consented to take part in the study by completing responses either via survey monkey, or if they prefer through paper questionnaires posted to them.
