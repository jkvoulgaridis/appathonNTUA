    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have recurrent or advanced (Stage IIIB-IV) non-small cell lung cancer
             confirmed by histology or cytology.

          2. No prior systemic treatment. Subjects who have received prior neo-adjuvant, adjuvant
             chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for non-metastatic disease
             must have experienced a treatment free interval of at least 6 months from
             randomization since the last chemotherapy cycle.

          3. Subjects should not have a previously detected activating Epidermal Growth Factor
             Receptor (EFGR) mutation or Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene.

          4. Subjects must have measurable disease by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic
             Resonance Imaging (MRI) per RECIST 1.1 criteria;

          5. Freshly acquired samples or archived specimens within 6 months before randomization
             must be provided.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Radiologically confirmed central squamous cell carcinoma.

          2. Untreated central nervous system metastases (such as brain or meningeal metastases).

          3. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites with clinical symptoms that need
             drainage

          4. Past or present with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia,
             pneumoconiosis, radiation pneumonitis, tissue pneumonia (eg bronchitis, occlusive
             vasculitis), drug-induced pneumonia, active pneumonia during CT screening, or
             objective evidence of severe impairment of lung function

          5. Subjects with an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with type I
             diabetes who are receiving a stable dose of insulin, hypothyroidism who only needs
             hormone replacement therapy, and skin diseases (such as eczema, vitiligo, or
             psoriasis) that do not require systemic treatment and do not have acute deterioration
             within 1 year before the screening period, are allowed.

          6. Subjects with suspected active tuberculosis should be examined for chest X-rays,
             sputum, and ruled out by clinical signs and symptoms.

          7. Uncontrolled Cardiac Symptoms or Diseases.

          8. Subjects with high blood pressure who cannot be controlled well with antihypertensive
             drugs (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg).

          9. Arterial / venous thrombosis events, such as cerebrovascular accidents (including
             transient ischemic attacks, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction), deep vein
             thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, occurred within the first 6 months of
             randomization.

         10. Subjects who have previously received anti-PD-1 / PD-L1 monoclonal antibody,
             anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 monoclonal antibody, or vascular endothelial
             growth factor receptor (VEGFR) small molecule inhibitor therapy.
