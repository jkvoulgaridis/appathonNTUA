  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to be done at multiple sites in participants with advanced acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) that have a mutation in Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem
      duplications (FLT3-ITD). This study is to learn more about an investigational drug,
      quizartinib, being tested with the anti-cancer medicine CPX-351 (also called Vyxeos™), which
      is approved and widely used to treat AML.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and survival of patients
      receiving the combination of CPX-351 and quizartinib.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-part Phase II clinical trial in patients with relapsed or
      refractory FLT3-ITD mutation-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study is designed to
      assess the safety and tolerability as well as the efficacy of administering CPX-351
      (cytarabine:daunorubicin liposome complex) with quizartinib. CPX-351 is a formulation of two
      drugs, cytarabine and daunorubicin, that is administered as the first part of treatment to
      get rid of as many leukemia cells in your bone marrow as possible. Quizartinib is an
      investigational drug made of a protein that inhibits FLT3 and will be given after CPX-351 has
      been given. The plan for administration is divided into three phases: induction,
      consolidation, and maintenance.
