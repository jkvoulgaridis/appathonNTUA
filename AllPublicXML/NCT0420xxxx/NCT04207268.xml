  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of group-based nutrition advice plus
      gardening (intervention) versus group-based nutrition advice alone on dietary intake of
      fruits and vegetables, physical activity, and lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Carotenoids</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is between group differences in total plasma carotenoids from baseline to 16 weeks. Plasma carotenoids are a reliable bio-marker of dietary intake of F&amp;V.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported dietary intake</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will also test the between group differences in self-reported servings of fruits and vegetables as assessed by 24-hour recalls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiovascular disease risk score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk score based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) lifetime CVD risk score calculation (risk score range 0-100%). Higher scores indicate greater risk of a lifetime CVD-related event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Between group differences in minutes of physical activity as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), (range in minutes, 0-3000+). Higher scores indicate more physical activity.</description>
