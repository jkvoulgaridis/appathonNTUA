      Background: Pilonidal sinus is a very common disease. Malignant transformation occurs in 0,1%
      of patients. The investigators present a case of squamous cell carcinoma arised from
      recurrent pilonidal disease, managed by multimodal treatment.

      Case presentation: The investigators present a 70-year-old man with chronic pilonidal sinus.
      Inflammation had worsened in previous months and exploration revealed a large ulcerative mass
      which biopsy showed a squamous cell carcinoma. CT scan and MRI imaging showed tumoral
      invasion of the coccyx and both gluteus major muscles. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy
      as radiosensitizer and surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy was decided in the
      multidisciplinary tumor committee. Post neoadjuvant therapy MRI showed partial response with
      a decrease of the mass but persistence of the coccyx infiltration.

      Surgery consisted in en-bloc resection of the tumor with presacral tissues, coccyx and
      partial gluteal resection. Intraoperative radiotherapy was administered over the sacrum and
      in the bed of the coccyx resection. One week later, reconstructive surgery was practiced
      using a latissimus dorsi free flap, advancement of gluteal flaps and skin graft. Histological
      examination showed no residual tumor. The patient is currently asymptomatic and he has a
      satisfactory quality of life.

      Conclusions: Although squamous cell carcinoma is rare, it must be suspected in patients with
      recurrent pilonidal disease. Diagnosis is done by histological examination of biopsies. This
      type of tumors have a high local recurrence rate. The investigators propose a multimodal
      treatment that includes neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy as radiosensitizer and
      surgery plus intraoperative radiotherapy with the aim to decrease local recurrence rate.

        We describe the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of a patient with squamous cell
        carcinoma over pilonidal disease. The aim of the article is present the intraoperative
        radiotherapy plus en bloc surgery as a treatment in this cases with high recurrence rate.
