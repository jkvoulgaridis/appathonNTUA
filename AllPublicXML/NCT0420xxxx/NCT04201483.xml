  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to determine the value of adding real-time ultrasound imaging
      (RUSI) as an external feedback tool for teaching the contraction of the deep cervical
      extensors (DCE) in healthy subjects. The potential benefit of RUSI to facilitate activation
      of the DCE during a specific motor task as well as the retention capacity of this motor task
      after a short period of training will be investigated

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly allocated into two exercise groups: &quot;DCE exercise without RUSI
      feedback (DCE)&quot; and &quot;DCE exercise with RUSI feedback (DCE+RUSI)&quot;.

      Participants assigned to DCE will perform an exercise known to selectively activate the
      semispinalis cervicis muscles. By the other hand, participants in the DCE+RUSI group will
      perform the same exercise as the DCE group to selectively activate the semispinalis cervicis
      muscle but receiving RUSI feedback about correct performance. In both groups, a total of 10
      sets of 10 repetitions will be performed with one minute of rest between each set.

      Ultrasound measurement will be used to asses the antero-posterior dimension (thickness) of
      the DCE both at rest and during contraction at the level of C4 at baseline, immediately after
      the DCE exercise activation protocol and one-week follow-up in order to evaluate retention
      capacity.

      All participants will be asked to not perform any other cervical motor control exercise or
      exercise using RUSI feedback until the last time point assessment will be finished.

      All participants will be asked to avoid any exercises or treatments for neck pain between
      sessions.

      All ultrasound images will be analysed off-line using Image J software. Thickness and percent
      thickness change will be measured. The percent thickness change will be calculated by using
      the following equation: thickness contracted - thickness rest / thickness rest.

Participants will be randomized into two exercise groups: &quot;DCE exercise without RUSI feedback (DCE)&quot; and &quot;DCE exercise with RUSI feedback (DCE+RUSI)&quot;. Randomization will be conducted using computer-generated random numbers (EpidatÂ® version 3.1).
