  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      InnoSlim® has been studied for enhancing metabolic functions whereas many lab studies have
      demonstrated the potential efficacy of InnoSlim® for the blood sugar and blood lipids
      regulation. There has been no relevant human study on InnoSlim® on blood sugar and blood
      lipids regulation. There have reported that 2018 estimating the total costs of diagnosed
      diabetes have risen to $327 billion in 2017 from $245 billion in 2012. Although
      pharmacological methods have been developed to treat diabetes, these treatments can be costly
      and are not without potential adverse effects. The development of dietary agents for the
      prevention of diabetes could represent a cost-effective and safe means to deal with this
      growing public health crisis.

      In this study, the investigators are investigating the effects of InnoSlim® on blood sugar
      and blood lipids regulation in humans. The testing sample is orally administrated to
      participants with pre-diabetes and hyperlipidemia humans, the efficacy parameters of blood
      sugar, lipid profile and other parameters, as well as adverse effects to the healthy
      individual, are screened during the trial, the significant difference is shown and no adverse
      effect reported.
