  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness and
      feasibility of performing the ward round using a telepresence robot vs. a face-to-face ward
      round to discharge patients after bariatric surgery.

      This study is aimed to analyze the effectiveness and feasibility of performing the ward round
      using a telepresence robot (PadBot U, Inbot Technology Ltd, China), compared to the
      face-to-face ward round, for hospital discharge after bariatric surgery. Patients who
      underwent either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
      will be randomized to one of two groups: intervention group - who will be evaluated and
      discharged, on postoperative day (POD) 2, during ward rounds with the assistant team present,
      but the telepresent surgeon via robot; and control group - who will be evaluated and
      discharged, on POD 2, during ward rounds with the whole team physically present.

      The study main hypothesis is that the ward rounds with the surgeon telepresent by a robot are
      not inferior to the face to face ward rounds, to evaluate and discharge patients after
      bariatric surgery.

    <description>compare a validated questionnaire design to access patients' and team's impressions. There are 13 questions with answers valued from 1 to 5. The higher the score, the better the impression. The scores from the two groups are going to be compared in order to determine if patients' and team's impressions are similar with either robotic or face-to-face rounds.</description>
