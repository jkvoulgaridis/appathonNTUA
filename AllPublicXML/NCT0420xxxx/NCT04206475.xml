  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory deficits are common sequelae of pediatric Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). Only methods
      for non-focused cognitive remediation are available to the pediatric field. The aims of this
      feasibility trial are the description, implementation, and test of an intensive program
      specific to the training and re-adaptation of memory function in children (IM-FTP). Method:
      Eleven children and adolescents with ABI (mean age at injury=12.2 years, brain tumor
      survivors excluded) were clinically assessed and rehabilitated over 1-month through IM-FTP,
      including physio-kinesis/occupational, speech, and neuropsychology treatments. Each patient
      received a psychometric evaluation and a brain functional MRI at enrollment and at discharge.
      Ten pediatric controls with ABI (mean age at injury=13.8 years) were clinically assessed, and
      rehabilitated through a standard program.

    <description>the rehabilitation program consisted of an intensive treatment lasting 4 weeks, and including 3 daily interventions each working day (5 working days per week, for a total of 20 days of treatment and 60 sessions). The 3 daily sessions were organized as follows:
1 physio-kinesis and/or occupational therapy, 1 speech therapy, and 1 neuro-psychology treatment.
Each session lasted 45 minutes.</description>

    <description>During each session, the patient was engaged in a one-to-one interaction with the therapist.
