  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the status of ovarian reserve in patients with
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS) using anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) level and antral follicle
      count (AFC). Women with AS and women controls diagnosed according to the classification
      criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group will be included in the study.
      Ovarian reserve will be evaluated in terms of clinical findings, AFC and serum AMH and
      reproductive hormone levels.

      Researchers predict that the ovarian reserve may be reduced in patients with AS due to the
      autoimmune process and the pathophysiology of the disease. Serum AMH and ovarian AFC may be
      useful for assessing ovarian reserve. It is aimed to determine the course of ovarian reserve
      abnormalities and the best possible biomarkers of reduced ovarian reserve in patients with
      AS.
