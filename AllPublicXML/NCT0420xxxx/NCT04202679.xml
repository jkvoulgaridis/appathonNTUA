      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on itch response in patients with prurigo nodularis

      advisable To demonstrate efficacy of dupilumab on skin lesions of PN To demonstrate the
      improvement in health-related quality of life To evaluate safety outcome measures To evaluate
      immunogenicity of dupilumab

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

        Must be 18 to 80 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent.

        With a clinical diagnosis of PN defined by all of the following:

          -  Diagnosed by a dermatologist for at least 3 months before the Screening visit

          -  On the WI-NRS ranging from 0 to 10, patients must have an average worst itch score of
             ≥7 in the 7 days prior to Day1.

          -  Patients must have a minimum of 20 PN lesions in total on both legs, and/or both arms
             and/or trunk, at Screening visit and Day 1

          -  History of failing a 2-week course of medium-to-superpotent topical corticosteroids
             (TCS) or when TCS are not medically advisable

          -  Have applied a stable dose of topical emollient (moisturizer) once or twice daily for
             at least 5 out of the 7 consecutive days immediately before Day 1 Must be willing and
             able to complete a daily symptom eDiary for the duration of the study

        Exclusion criteria:

        Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

          -  Presence of skin morbidities other than PN and mild atopic dermatitis that may
             interfere with the assessment of the study outcomes

          -  PN secondary to medications

          -  PN secondary to medical conditions such as neuropathy or psychiatric disease

          -  Within 6 months before the screening visit, or documented diagnosis of moderate to
             severe AD from screening visit to randomization visit

          -  Severe concomitant illness(es) under poor control that, in the investigator's
             judgment, would adversely affect the patient's participation in the study

          -  Severe renal conditions (eg, patients with uremia and/or on dialysis)

          -  Participants with uncontrolled thyroid disease.

          -  Active tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, or a history of
             incompletely treated tuberculosis unless documented adequately treated

          -  Diagnosed active endoparasitic infections; suspected or high risk of endoparasitic
             infection, unless clinical and (if necessary) laboratory assessment have ruled out
             active infection before randomization.

          -  Active chronic or acute infection (except HIV) requiring treatment with systemic
             antibiotics, antivirals, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before the
             screening visit and during the screening period

          -  Known or suspected immunodeficiency

          -  Active malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years before the baseline visit,
             except completely treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, completely treated and
             resolved non-metastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
