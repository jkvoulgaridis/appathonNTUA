  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign Joint Hypermobility Syndrome is a hereditary connective tissue problem characterized
      by the emergence of multiple musculoskeletal problems in hypermobile individuals without a
      systemic rheumatologic disease. Studies have shown that hypermobility may also affect lung
      function. Playing wind instruments requires tiring breathing activity. The effect of wind
      instrument on lung function and how it affects lung function is a highly controversial issue.
      Given the distribution and importance of collagen tissue in the body, multiple effects of
      hypermobility are inevitable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of
      hypermobility in young healthy individuals; The aim of the study is to investigate the
      effects of hypermobility on the cardiovascular system and to provide training to the
      participants regarding the findings.The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship
      of hypermobility with respiratory functions in professional hypermobile musicians and to
      compare this relationship with healthy hypermobile individuals who are not engaged in music.

      Sociodemographic data and musical backgrounds of all cases will be recorded. In accordance
      with the objectives, erm Upper Extremity Hypermobility Assessment Questionnaire &quot;was used for
      hypermobility, pulmonary function test, respiratory and oral pressure measurement and
      respiratory muscle strength. The George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) will be used to
      assess the quality of life associated with respiration and the risk of asthma with the ile
      European Respiratory Health Survey, Phase 1 &quot;questionnaire.We believe that the effects of
      hypermobility on pulmonary functions in healthy individuals will be clarified if this study
      takes place.
