    <textblock>
      First-in Human study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ENB003 in
      combination with Pembrolizumab in solid tumors. The study is separated into two parts. Part A
      is a 3+3 dose escalation to define the recommended RP2D; this part will include metastatic
      melanoma, platinum resistant ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer patients subjects, but
      other solid tumors will be allowed. Once the RP2D is selected, the study will be expanded
      into metastatic melanoma, platinum resistant ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer subjects.
      A small number of sarcoma subjects will be included, as exploratory.

    <textblock>
      Part A: Dose Escalation (with Run-in) A 7-day run-in period of ENB-003 monotherapy, will be
      administered to all Part A subjects on Days -7, -5 and -3, prior to initiating combination
      therapy with pembrolizumab at Day 1. ENB-003 will also be administered on Days 1, 3 and 5 in
      Cycle 1. In subsequent cycles, ENB-003 will be administered on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of
      alternate 21-day treatment cycles, starting with Cycle 3.

      Dose escalation will follow a standard 3+3 design, with the following doses being
      administered during Part A:

        -  150 µg ENB-003

        -  300 µg ENB-003

        -  500 µg ENB-003

        -  750 µg ENB-003

        -  1000 µg ENB-003 Pembrolizumab will be administered as 200 mg on Day 1 of each 21-day
           cycle in all Part A cohorts.

      Part B: Dose Expansion Twelve (12) subjects with malignant melanoma, ovarian cancer, or
      pancreatic cancer will receive 1 x 21-day treatment cycle of ENB-003 at the recommended phase
      2 dose (RP2D) selected in Part A + pembrolizumab. If dose limiting toxicities (DLT) occur in
      no more than 3 subjects , Part B will be expanded with an additional 27 subjects, plus 6
      additional subjects with sarcoma. A review of efficacy will be conducted by a Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) in Part B once 39 RP2D subjects (including 9 malignant melanoma
      subjects, 16 ovarian cancer subjects and 14 pancreatic cancer subjects) have completed their
      scheduled 12 week CT/MRI scans. Upon approval by the DSMB, a maximum of 64 further subjects
      will be treated at the RP2D.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must fulfill all the following inclusion criteria relevant to their tumor
             type to be eligible for participation in the study:

        Malignant Melanoma

          1. Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, unresectable or metastatic
             malignant melanoma.

          2. Subjects must have progressed on treatment with an anti-PD1/Ligand 1 (L1) monoclonal
             antibody (mAb) administered either as monotherapy, or in combination with other
             checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by
             meeting all of the following criteria:

               1. Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.

               2. Has demonstrated disease progression (PD) after PD-1/L1 as defined by RECIST
                  Version 1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment
                  no less than four weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence
                  of rapid clinical progression.1

               3. Progressive disease has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of
                  anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.1

             i. This determination is made by the investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial
             date of PD documentation will be considered the date of PD.

             Pancreatic Cancer

          3. Histologically confirmed (previously obtained biopsied) metastatic unresectable
             pancreatic adenocarcinoma, including with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.

          4. Subjects with one or more prior treatments for their pancreatic cancer.

          5. If subjects have high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mismatch-repair deficiency
             (dMMR) phenotype they must have been previously treated with anti-PD1 and demonstrated
             either PD or disease stabilization.

             Ovarian Cancer

          6. Histologically proven diagnosis of high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear
             cell ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

          7. Recurrent platinum-resistant disease, defined as PD within 6 months (182 days) of the
             last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy OR greater than 6 months from completion
             of most recent platinum-based chemotherapy, but not suitable for further platinum
             therapy.

             Sarcoma

          8. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, poorly differentiated or
             dedifferentiated liposarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, malignant fibers
             histiocytoma, synovial sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, or dedifferentiated or
             mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.

          9. All cases should be classified histologically as being intermediate- or high grade.
             For soft-tissue sarcomas, this would correspond to Grade 2 or 3 according to the
             FNCLCC (Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer) grading system.

         10. Locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic disease not amenable to curative surgical
             resection.

         11. Receipt of at least 1 systemic line of therapy for advanced disease. For subjects
             diagnosed with diseases for which no standard therapy exists (e.g. dedifferentiated
             chondrosarcoma), this requirement is waived.

         12. Subjects may have received up to 3 previous lines of systemic anti-cancer therapy for
             advanced disease. Systemic therapy administered with neoadjuvant or adjuvant intent is
             not considered a therapy for advanced disease.

             metastatic solid tumors who have PD after treatment with at least 1 available therapy
             for metastatic disease that is known to confer clinical benefit, or are intolerant to
             treatment, or refuse standard treatment.

         16. For the dose-escalation phase (Part A), tumor vasculature, stroma and/or tumor cells
             are marker positive for ETBR, as determined by IHC staining &gt;25%. Subjects who do not
             satisfy this criterion may be enrolled in the dose expansion phase (Part B).

         17. Has a life expectancy of &gt;3 months.

         18. All subjects must have an archived tumor tissue biopsy sample obtained within 24
             months of Screening that is suitable for performing IHC and biomarker analyses.

         19. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

         20. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding,

             within 4 weeks prior to treatment.

             Note: Subjects must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤Grade 1
             severity or baseline. Subjects with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible at
             Investigator's discretion.

             Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the surgery prior to starting study treatment, as
             determined by the Investigator.

          5. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. Subjects
             must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not currently require
             corticosteroids, and have never had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is
             permitted for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous
             system (CNS) disease.

          6. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

             Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience

          7. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
             study treatment.

             Note: Subjects who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may
             participate provided it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous
             investigational agent.

             Diagnostic Assessments

          8. Average Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;460 msec for males and QTcF &gt;480 msec
             for females as measured by electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening.

          9. A family history of congenital long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or unexplained
             sudden cardiac death.

         10. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study drug.

         11. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment
             within the past 3 years.

             Note: Subjects with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, SCC of the skin, or carcinoma in
             situ (e.g., breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially
             curative therapy are not excluded.

         12. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
             stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to
             first dose of study treatment.

         13. Has severe hypersensitivity (≥ Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.

         14. Has severe hypersensitivity (≥ Grade 3) to ENB-003 and/or any of its excipients

         15. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years
             (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form
             of systemic treatment and is allowed.

         16. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

         17. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         18. Subjects with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or history of Hepatitis B
             or C infections or known to be positive for Hepatitis B antigen (HBcAb) or Hepatitis C
             Antibody (HCab).

         19. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or it is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

         20. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the
             subject's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.

         21. History of myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to Screening, or congestive heart
             failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular
             arrhythmias.

         22. Has a history of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension or Renovascular Hypertension

        Other Exclusions 23. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant. 24. Has previously
        participated in this protocol [ENB-003-101 (MK3475-951)] i.e. a subject previously enrolled
        in Part A cannot participate in Part B.
