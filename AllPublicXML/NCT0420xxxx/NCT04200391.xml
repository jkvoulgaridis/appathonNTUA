  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite major technological advances, management of type one diabetes mellitus (T1D) remains
      suboptimal, putting millions of people at risk for immediate and long-term complications.
      After meals, a mismatch between carbohydrate absorption rate and insulin action typically
      leads to alternating periods of hyper- and hypoglycemia. A conceptually promising approach to
      control both problems is dietary carbohydrate restriction to reduce postprandial blood
      glucose changes and insulin needs. In a prior survey study, the investigators documented
      exceptional glycemic control (HbA1c 5.67%) and low acute complication rates among 316
      children and adults with T1D consuming a very-low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet. Despite these
      promising preliminary results, the use of VLC diets for T1D remain controversial, because of
      their restrictive nature and theoretical concerns regarding growth, ketoacidosis and
      hypoglycemia risks and efficiency of glucagon treatment for hypoglycemia. Glucagon is used as
      a rescue medication during severe hypoglycemia and increases blood glucose levels by
      mobilizing liver glycogen stores. If these stores are depleted during carbohydrate
      restriction, glucagon response may be inadequate and put individuals at risk for refractory
      hypoglycemia. A physiologic study has shown a blunted but still adequate response to glucagon
      in n=10 participants after following a VLCD for 1 week. Longer-term studies have not been
      done.

      To test the hypotheses that glucagon response remains adequate while following a VLC diet in
      the longer term, the investigators will conduct a glucagon challenge in participants who are
      assigned to the VLC arm of a randomized-controlled feeding study in 32 young adults with T1D
      who will receive a VLC vs a standard diet for 12 weeks. After an overnight fast, twelve
      participants in the VLC arm will receive IV insulin to lower blood glucose levels to 60
      mg/dl, followed by a glucagon injection and monitoring of blood glucose levels and other
      metabolic fuels.

    <time_frame>week 5-12 on the very low carbohydrate diet</time_frame>
    <description>Recovery from hypoglycemia symptoms will be assessed using the Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Scale. At baseline; pre-dose;15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes following administration of glucagon. The Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Symptom Scale measures the intensity of 15 commonly experienced hypoglycemic symptoms on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not present, 7 = very intense). The higher the score, the more intense the hypoglycemia symptoms. The sum of each symptom score would yield a range of 15 to 105 (i.e., 15 x 7 =105). The total score will be calculated as the sum of each symptom score minus 15, and summarized at each time point by treatment group.</description>
