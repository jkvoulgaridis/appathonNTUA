    <textblock>
      The clinical study with UMC119-06 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. This will be a dose escalation, open label,
      single-center study in adult with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. UMC119-06 is ex vivo
      cultured human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells product which is intended
      for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide, predicted to be the third leading cause of death in adults by 2020. Patients with
      COPD are characterized with airflow limitation and chronic inflammation, which is caused by
      cigarette smoking, noxious particles or gases. These inhaled irritants will induce
      inflammation, emphysema and fibrosis though chronic exposure. The current pharmacological
      treatment of COPD is symptomatic and is mainly based on bronchodilators, such as selective
      β2-adrenergic agonists (short-and long-acting), anticholinergics, theophylline, or a
      combination of these drugs. In patients with continuing exacerbations, inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICSs) may be added in the form of a triple fixed dose combination inhaler
      that includes ICSs, long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) and inhaled long-acting muscarinic
      antagonists (LAMA). Although current clinical treatment strategies can improve and stabilize
      COPD states and quality of life, none of them are able to modify the progressive decline in
      lung function which is the hallmark of this disease. Therefore, development of new
      therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of COPD in adult
      patients is of urgent need. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, mesenchymal
      stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment of COPD.
