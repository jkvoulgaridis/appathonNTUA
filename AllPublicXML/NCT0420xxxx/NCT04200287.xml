  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to explore how a patient decision aid tool (website) given to
      patients prior to their survivorship care visits, may impact patient-provider communication
      about fertility and family-building after cancer; and assess the impact of using the tool on
      patient reported outcomes. The overall purpose of this research is to improve survivorship
      care by establishing a multi-disciplinary approach to managing cancer and fertility issues
      and prompt early referral to supportive and medical care resources.

      Objective 1: Establish feasibility and acceptability of conducting research with YA-F cancer
      survivors at the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
      (LPCH).

      Hypothesis 1: Study procedures will be feasible in the given timeframe and acceptable to
      patients, as evidence by recruitment, enrollment, and completion rates and participant
      feedback.

      Objective 2: Evaluate the impact of using the tool as a part of survivorship care on patient
      reported outcomes (PROs; i.e., information needs, fertility distress, decision-making
      uncertainty, and satisfaction with care).

      Hypothesis 2: In a single-arm pilot study (N=20), use of the decision aid tool will lead to
      improvements in fertility distress, decision-making uncertainty, and satisfaction with care.

    <measure>Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) is a validated survey that assesses personal uncertainty in making healthcare decisions; modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty; and the quality of the decision made. It is reliable and responsive to change, and the most widely used measure of decision-making quality. The survey has 16 questions, with responses on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;strongly agree&quot; (1) to &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (5).
Total scores range from 16 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater uncertainty (worse outcome). The outcome will be reported as the mean difference from baseline to 4-week and 6-week follow-up time points, with standard deviation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unmet Fertility Information</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This investigator-designed survey assesses perceived information needs about fertility topics such as the risk of infertility; risk of early menopause; options to assess fertility status; options to preserve fertility; and options for alternative family-building. The survey has 5 questions, each answered by a Yes / No response. Yes is scored as 1, and no is scored as 0. Total scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater perceived knowledge. The outcome will be reported as the mean difference from baseline to 4-week and 6-week follow-up time points, with standard deviation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reproductive Concerns After Cancer (RCAC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Reproductive Concerns After Cancer (RCAC) Scale is a validated survey of cancer survivors' fertility and health concerns. The survey has 18 questions, answered on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (1) to &quot;strongly agree&quot; (5). Total scores range from 18 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater distress (worse outcome). The outcome will be reported as the mean difference from baseline to 4-week and 6-week followup time points, with standard deviation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>COMRADE</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The COMRADE is a measure of patient-based outcomes of risk communication within patient-provider interactions and treatment decision-making effectiveness. It consists of two subscales: Satisfaction with Communication &amp; Confidence in Decision-making. Items were adapted to refer to fertility and reproductive health care options. The measure has 20 questions. Items are answered on a 5-point scale from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree,&quot; with high scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <description>YA-F cancer survivors will complete a baseline survey (T1) of sociodemographic and patient reported outcomes (PRO) and then will be sent a link to access the decision aid tool (website) with instructions to review the website before their upcoming visit. A follow-up survey (T2) will be emailed 4-weeks post-baseline, prior to their clinic visit, to evaluate website access and PROs. A post-visit survey (T3) will be emailed 6- weeks post-baseline (after their survivorship care visit) to assess PROs.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  completed cancer treatment at least 6-months prior, excluding long-term adjuvant or
             maintenance therapies

          -  report an interest in discussing fertility/family-building with a provider

          -  understands verbal and written English

          -  access to the Internet and use of a computer, tablet, or smartphone

          -  has a scheduled cancer survivorship visit within the study time frame

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior hospitalization for a mental disorder or history of psychosis

        Note: Survivors on adjuvant maintenance or endocrine treatment, such as tamoxifen, will not
        be excluded because clinical guidelines allow treatment delay or hiatus to accommodate
        fertility
