  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis Vulgaris is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin disease.
      Joint involvement is common along with skin involvement. However, metabolic diseases, such as
      cardiovascular diseases can be accompanied by many systemic diseases, chronic and repetitive
      due to the quality of life and psychological status of patients can affect. For this reason,
      patients carry out various research on their diseases on social media and follow programs on
      these issues in other media such as television and radio. However, there is no study on how
      much patients are interested in these publications, how much they trust them, and how they
      reach and organize information via social media. The aim of the study will be to clarify how
      and how patients with Psoriasis Vulgaris use social media to obtain information about the
      diagnosis and treatment of their disease, the interaction of patient groups with each other,
      and how often social media is used, especially in which group of patients.
