  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators need stronger feedback loops and a quality monitoring and management system
      to improve the quality of care in sustainable way. The Chair Sint-Trudo &quot;To a sustainable
      quality policy&quot; was established to scientifically develop prerequisites for a sustainable
      quality of care. In this study protocol, a monocentric mixed-method quasi-experimental study
      will be used to assess the impact of a rapid-cycle quality indicator feedback mechanism on
      both patients and professionals.

Q: Will you recommend our hospital? (scale min 0 until 10 with 0: not and 10: for sure).
For follow questions the scores are 'disagree', 'somewhat agree', 'largely agree', 'totally agree. The higher the score the better the outcome Q: This information was provided by my GP or by healthcare providers in the hospital.
Q: I understand the information I received about the cost of my stay. Q: I received sufficient information about the causes of my condition or about the possible treatment methods for my condition or about the consequences of my disease.
Q: Nurses or doctors explained things in a way I could understand or treated me with courtesy and respect.
Q: My privacy was respected during conversations with caregivers or during examinations, treatment and care.
Q: Before any treatment my identity was checked. Q: Hospital staff always introduced themselves</description>

    <description>Audit and feedback: A summary of clinical performance and hospital safety culture over a specified period of time.
Benchmarking Achievable: benchmarks are calculated from the performance of all members of a peer group and represents a realistic standard of excellence attained by the top performers in that group (i.e. comparing to the top 10% of peers).
Educational outreach: A trained independent person or investigator will meet with health professionals or managers in their practice setting to provide information (e.g. feedback of quality indicators).
Action planning: The purpose of action planning is to support quality improvement efforts by identifying opportunities for improvement, strategies and steps to accomplish the work.</description>
