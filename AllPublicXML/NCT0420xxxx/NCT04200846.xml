  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is common in patients with end-stage liver disease. It's characterized by reduced
      strength, low endurance and reduced physical function. While exercise intervention can
      improve frailty in geriatric patients without liver disease, whether or not exercise
      intervention can improve frailty in liver transplant candidates remains unknown.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to better understand how exercise impacts frailty in order to identify
      treatments that can improve both patient-oriented outcomes and access to liver
      transplantation for end-stage liver disease patients. The specific objective of this proposal
      is to generate pilot feasibility data required for future multicenter R01 application to the
      National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) which will test the
      novel central hypothesis that exercise improves frailty and lessens waiting-list mortality.
      Additionally, another goal of the study is to establish an optimal frailty tool for liver
      transplant candidates.

    <description>This study aims to examine the incidence of adverse events. If exercise in frail liver transplant candidates is safe. 5% serious adverse events or fewer will deem the trial as safe. If more than 5% serious adverse events occur, the trial is determined to be unsafe.</description>

    <description>Net enrollment rates, which are calculated by dividing the number of subjects approached by the number of subjects that enroll in the trial. The work with the ongoing NASHFit and completed ENACT Trials and the work of others performing exercise-based trials in patients with cirrhosis(50) has established &gt;50% enrollment of subjects approached as a threshold of acceptability.</description>

    <description>Private supervised strength training exercise (e.g., body weight or dumbbell exercises) will occur in the Cancer Center Exercise Medicine Unit or the Hershey Center for Applied Research (HCAR) two days a week. In addition, subjects will be instructed to exercise on their own, at home, three days a week doing 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (e.g., walking at 45-55% maximum heart rate determined by the formula max heart rate = 220bpm - 0.64*age in years).</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control condition will be instructed to continue their medical care at the discretion of their treating medical professional and to maintain their current exercise level. Weekly phone calls will be performed to ensure adherence to the protocol (no changes in activity). Subjects will report to Penn State on a monthly basis for interim history and physical to confirm self-reports. Subjects will also be given a FitBit ChargeHR3 and downloaded data review will be performed monthly at the in-person visits.</description>
