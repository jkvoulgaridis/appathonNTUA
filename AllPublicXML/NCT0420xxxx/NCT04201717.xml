    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. It is estimated that the recruitment time
      is 24 months and the number of cases is 354 in total. The cases in the experimental group and
      the control group are allocated according to the proportion of 1:1. The perioperative
      recovery data, complications and oncology index of total laparoscopic and laparoscopic
      assisted operation would be compared.

    <time_frame>one month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the incidence of SSI based on the definitions of CDC guidelines: superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space infections . Infections involving both organ/space and the incisional site (superficial or deep) were categorized as organ/space infections. Surgeons and nurses assessed the presence of infection daily during hospitalization. After hospital discharge, all patients were followed up until 30 days after surgery at outpatient clinics to check the wound.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale/Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>one day after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms.For example, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain ( from 0 to 10)</description>

    <description>Patients would receive endoscopic submucosal injection of indocyanine green before operation to image the lymph nodes in the drainage area. All patients underwent laparoscopic dissection according to the left hemicolon cancer resection standard. lymph nodes and blood vessels, are completely trimmed and resected in an en bloc fashion. The patients in the control group underwent with the traditional laparoscopic assisted technology. The free colon was taken out through a small incision in the middle of the abdomen or the outer edge of the left rectus abdominis. The mesentery was trimmed, the specimens were removed, and the anastomosis was completed.After the anastomosis, the whole surgical area was flushed and drainage tubes were left.</description>
