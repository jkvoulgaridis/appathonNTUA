      Objective: This study is to observe the safety and therapeutic effect of cryoablation
      combined with pd-1 antibody immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis therapy in multiple primary
      lung cancer (MPLC) patients.

      Methods: In this study, 20 patients with MPLC who conform to the admission criteria are
      enrolled and began to receive treatment with Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib after
      cryoablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who meet the admission criteria will be treated with Camrelizumab and Apatinib until
      disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of the patient or the
      researchers determined that the drug must be discontinued.

      The primary end point of this study is safety of cryoablation combined with carillizumab and
      apatinib for MPLC. The secondary endpoints include objective response rate, disease control
      rate, time to progression, progression free survival and overall survival. Exploratory
      endpoint is to explore biomarkers in tumor tissue and blood that could potentially predict
      the efficacy of Camrelizumab and Apatinib.
