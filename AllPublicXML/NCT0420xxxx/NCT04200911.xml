    <textblock>
      Evaluation of central nervous system penetration of orally administered Rapamune (RAPA) in
      older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
      investigate associated safety, tolerability, target engagement, cognition, and functional
      status as initial proof-of-concept study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label pilot study of orally administered RAPA to measure its target
      engagement in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and blood, and to establish the feasibility and
      safety of RAPA treatment in older adults with MCI and early stage AD as initial
      proof-of-concept for a larger Phase 2 clinical trial.
