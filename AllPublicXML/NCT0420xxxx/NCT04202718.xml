  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study will wear the VitalPatch with the added ECG Interpretation and
      arrhythmia detection features which will expedite the identification of patients whose
      condition may rapidly deteriorate as well as eliminate the majority of non-actionable alarms.

      This project intends to validate, through comparative study, the output of new technologies
      (ECG Interpretation and arrhythmia detection) to the VistaCenter platform, aiming to replace
      current telemetry monitoring equipment. The new technology, through the previous Mercy pilot
      study, has demonstrated greater accuracy in the detection of ventricular tachycardia patterns
      and other dysrhythmias/arrhythmias, as well as, reducing the volume of false alarms resulting
      in the mitigation of alarm fatigue experienced by bedside staff and monitor technicians.

    <description>Where a wearable biosensor is being considered for use in the health management of individuals at high-risk for poor health outcomes, and in the detection or prevention of adverse events within settings where traditional monitoring devices are not currently in use, the ECG interpretation will provide Arrhythmia detection which will help ensure that irregular rhythms will be reported quickly.</description>

    <description>The VitalPatch® is an IRB (791130) and FDA approved wearable device that allows for the constant monitoring of biometric measurements and may have utility in the health management of individuals at high-risk for poor health outcomes and in the detection or prevention of adverse events within settings where more traditional telemetry monitoring devices are not currently in use.</description>
