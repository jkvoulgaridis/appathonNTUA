      The purpose of this study is post-market, patient outcome research to evaluate medical device
      safety and effectiveness. The data collected will assess the safety of the FLXfit 15TM (study
      device) system, as measured by the rate of serious operative and post-operative
      complications. It will also assess the effectiveness as measured by radiographs (X-rays), CT
      scans, MRI scans, patient-reported, health-related quality of life questionnaires up to (24)
      months following the procedure, as compared to before surgery.

        involved level(s). Patients should be skeletally mature and have completed six months of
        non-operative treatment.

          -  Any other condition which would preclude the potential benefit of spinal implant
             surgery, such as the presence of tumors or congenital abnormalities, fracture local to

             count

          -  Neuromuscular disorder that would engender unacceptable risk of instability, implant
             fixation failure, or complications in postoperative care

          -  Active local infection in or near the operative region

          -  Active systemic infection and/or disease

          -  Severe osteoporosis or insufficient bone density, which in the medical opinion of the
             physician precludes surgery or contraindicates instrumentation

          -  Endocrine or metabolic disorders known to affect osteogenesis (e.g. Paget's disease,
             renal osteodystrophy, hypothyroidism)

          -  Systemic disease that requires the chronic administration of nonsteroidal anti-
             inflammatory or steroidal drugs

          -  Suspected or documented allergy or intolerance to implant's materials

          -  Symptomatic cardiac disease

          -  Patient unwilling to cooperate with postoperative instructions.

          -  Any case where the implant components selected for use would be too large or too small
             to achieve a successful result.

          -  Patient having inadequate tissue coverage over the operative site or inadequate bone
             stock or quality.

          -  Any patient in which implant utilization would interfere with anatomical structures or
             expected physiological performance.

          -  Prior fusion at the level to be treated.
