  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia affects at least a quarter of the population. This prevalence is increased in
      postmenopausal women and people over 65 years of age. Associated with age are systemic
      diseases such as Sj√∂gren's Syndrome, diabetes, Parkinson's disease or cancer. It handicaps
      the patient in his social life, but also in terms of his well-being by the consequences it
      generates in the oral cavity. This dryness may be the consequence of taking certain
      medications, head and neck radiotherapy, but also being a symptom of an underlying pathology
      whose screening will allow early treatment and avoid complications. Today, no single
      therapeutic solution is enough and patients are waiting for new therapeutic innovations in
      this area. This study proposes to evaluate the tolerance of an adhesive film containing
      prebiotics by comparing it to a placebo control film.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerance of an adhesive film containing
      prebiotics on the improvement of signs and symptoms related to dry mouth by comparing it to a
      placebo film.

      The primary endpoint is the assessment of tolerability assessed using a visual analogue scale
      (VAS) from 0 to 100 at the end of the 1-month period of both treatment periods (D30 and D90).
      In this study, the efficacy and tolerance of the adhesive film containing prebiotics will be
      analyzed.

      Each participant in this study will receive two galenic forms of the medical device whose
      allocation order was previously defined by a randomization list.
