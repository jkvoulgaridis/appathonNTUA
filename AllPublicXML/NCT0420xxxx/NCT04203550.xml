      FINISH-trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group non-inferiority trial
      comparing single burr-hole evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) with intraoperative
      irrigation (IR) and evacuation of CSDH without irrigation (N-IR).

      FINISH-trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group non-inferiority trial
      comparing single burr-hole evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) with intraoperative
      irrigation (IR) and evacuation of CSDH without irrigation (N-IR). In both groups, a passive
      subdural drain is used for 48 hours as a standard of treatment. The study will be conducted
      in all five neurosurgical departments in Finland. To determine whether operation without
      irrigation results in non-inferior outcome to operation with irrigation, we will randomize
      426 patients into two groups and follow them up for 6 months using recurrence rates as the
      primary outcome. Secondary outcomes in our study include mortality, neurological outcome and
      complications.

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the treatment, it is not possible to blind the surgeon and OR staff from the treatment allocation. Measures to minimize bias include:
The patient will not be informed of treatment allocation
Treatment allocation will not be documented in medical records i.e. all the personnel participating in patient care after operation will be blinded to allocation
The study group members collecting postoperative data and performing the statistical analyses will be blinded to treatment arm until the analyses are finished.</masking_description>

    <description>A burr-hole craniostomy is performed and the dura is opened sharply and 10 ml of subdural exudate is aspired with blunt aspiration needle for a CSDH sample to be stored in -70℃ to be used for later analysis. Subdural space is irrigated by repeated rinsing with body temperature saline solution with a syringe and blunt needle until surgeon considers exudate to be clear. Minimum volume of irrigation will be 200 ml per operated side. The subdural drain is inserted 3-5 cm underneath the skull and parallel to it. The total volume of irrigation as well as the duration of operation is recorded.</description>
