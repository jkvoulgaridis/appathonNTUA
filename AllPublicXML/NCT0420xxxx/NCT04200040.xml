    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Dacarbazine and
      OrienX010 therapy in Untreated Patients With Unresectable Stage IIIb/IIIc or Stage
      IV(Mla/Mlb) Melanoma.

      The study will be conducted in about 6 centres in China and total 165 patients will be
      enrolled. All eligible Patients will be randomized between Dacarbazine and OrienX010 in a 1:2
      ratio, so 1/3 (55) patients will receive the Dacarbazine and 2/3 (110) patients will receive
      the OrienX010.

      During the treatment phase, the patient will receive OrienX010 administration once biweekly
      or Dacarbazine once every 3 week until to the end of treatment (EOT). The duration of safety
      follow-up for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be to 90 days after
      the end of treatment. The details please refer to study schema.

      For patients who have completed the study treatment and no disease progression, follow-up
      visits will take place every 3 months after the end of treatment visit until the occurrence
      of disease progression. If disease progression occurred, the investigator will collect the
      anticancer treatment information and survival of individuals until 80% death event.

      After the end of study, if patient want to continue receiving the OrienX010 treatment and
      judged by investigator, sponsor will provide OrienX010 and Dacarbazine for free until disease
      progression/death or OrienX010 on marketing launch.
