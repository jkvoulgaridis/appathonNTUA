  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Strong People Strength Training study aims to assess whether a community-based
      progressive strength training program can improve risk factors for diabetes and heart disease
      in older rural adults.

      This study aims to evaluate the effects of a twice weekly, 12-week progressive strength
      training program, Strong People Strength Training, on cardiometabolic risk factors in a
      pragmatic, community-based randomized intervention trial among rural men and women 50 and
      older. We hypothesize that individuals randomized to the intervention group will demonstrate
      statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic risk
      factors as well as physical function, quality of life, and physical activity compared to
      those randomized to the delayed intervention control group.

    <description>The American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 score is comprised of seven cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors: physical activity, healthy diet score, blood glucose, BMI, blood cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking; each risk factor is categorized as ideal, intermediate, or poor.
Minimum value is 0, Maximum value is 14. Higher scores on the scale represent a better outcome.</description>
