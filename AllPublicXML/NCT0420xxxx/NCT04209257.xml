  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed work is to develop and to assess the feasibility of using
      functional electrical stimulation (FES) system to improve crouch gait in individuals with
      cerebral palsy that may prevent the typical downward spiral of walking function decline in
      individuals with CP that occurs from adolescence into adulthood.

      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of using a multiple channel FES system to produce an
      immediate neuroprosthetic effect to reduce crouch gait in children and adolescents with
      spastic diplegic CP.

      Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of using a multiple channel FES system as a therapeutic
      training tool to produce lasting neurotherapeutic effects of diminished crouch gait in
      children and adolescents with CP.

    <measure>Change in the Muscle Tone</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the baseline Modified Ashworth Scale at 14 weeks (post training)</time_frame>
    <description>We use the Modified Ashworth Scale to measure resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degree of velocity (Muscle tone/spasticity). Score ranges from 0-4, with 6 choices where score of 0 means no increase in tone and score of 4 means rigid limb with no flexion or extension. Our training approach using repetitive electrical stimulation may also lower spasticity, which can also facilitate improved functional mobility.</description>

    <description>Walking Energy Expenditure will be measured via indirect calorimetry at the subject's self-selected walking speed.

The tool consists of 60 items that require the respondent to respond by circling &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No.&quot; Raw scores are converted to standardized t-scores (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10) and percentile ranks. T-Score ranges for the total scale are: &lt;29T is very low, 30T-39T is low, 40T-44T is low average, 45T-55T average, 56T-59T- is high average, 60T-69T is high and &gt; 70T is very high. For the six subscales T-Score ranges &lt; 29T is very low, 30T-39T is low, 40T-44T is low average, 45T-55T is average and &gt; 56T is above average.</description>

    <ipd_description>The proposed experiments will generate data for publications in high quality peer reviewed journals. We will also present our findings at national meetings of neurorehabilitation scientists and clinicians and neuroscience and motor control meetings. To have the most impact, it is important that we present our findings to both clinicians and scientists, therefore, in addition to these standard approaches, we will seek out regular opportunities to present both the rationale and results of our work to local and regional clinicians as well as local and regional stroke support groups.
Once the primary hypotheses of the current proposal are tested, all data will be de-identified and be deposited in the DASH (The Data and Specimen Hub) repository.</ipd_description>
