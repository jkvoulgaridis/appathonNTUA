      This study asks the research question &quot;Does enabling families (particularly mothers and other
      caregivers) to 'assess and act' on drivers of malnutrition through a targeted SBC+ package
      succeed in a sustained reduction of risk factors thereby improving child health and
      nutrition?&quot; This study aims to implement and measure the effects of a multi-level
      multi-sectoral behavior change information intervention in Agago District of Northern Uganda
      and determine potential for scale up in a complex environment.

      The study design is a three-arm cluster randomized controlled superiority design (cRCT) with
      a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The study arms will be: Group 1: NIPP arm; Group 2: NIPP+ arm; and
      Group 3: Non-intervention control arm. A barrier analysis will be conducted to ensure
      appropriate targeting and contextualization of the NIPP and NIPP+ approaches prior to
      implementation. Each intervention arm will receive a 12-week intervention (NIPP or NIPP+)
      with active monitoring and longitudinal follow ups post intervention at 2, 6, and 12-months
      post-intervention. The total sample size for the Barrier Analysis will be a maximum of 450
      caregivers; for the main intervention, 900 households (300/arm) will be purposely sampled
      from the randomly selected communities. Respondents for the qualitative portion will be
      purposely selected.

      Objective: This study asks the research question &quot;Does enabling families (particularly
      mothers and other caregivers) to 'assess and act' on drivers of malnutrition through a
      targeted SBC+ package succeed in a sustained reduction of risk factors thereby improving
      child health and nutrition?&quot; This study aims to implement and measure the effects of a
      multi-level multi-sectoral behavior change information intervention in Agago District of
      Northern Uganda and determine potential for scale up in a complex environment.

      Intervention: Through a collaboration between Tufts University, GOAL International, CIMMYT,
      and Cornell University, GOAL will implement Nutrition Impact and Positive Practice (NIPP)
      circles as the standard SBC intervention against which the hypotheses will be tested. GOAL
      will also implement a NIPP+ approach which will integrate additional interventions for water,
      sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and use of improved agriculture inputs. These interventions
      will be measured by outcome indicators measuring aflatoxin exposure, water contamination, and
      knowledge transferred to action.

      Design: The study design is a three-arm cluster randomized controlled superiority design
      (cRCT) with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The study arms will be: Group 1: NIPP arm; Group 2:
      NIPP+ arm; and Group 3: Non-intervention control arm. A barrier analysis will be conducted to
      ensure appropriate targeting and contextualization of the NIPP and NIPP+ approaches prior to
      implementation. Each intervention arm will receive a 12-week intervention (NIPP or NIPP+)
      with active monitoring and longitudinal follow ups post intervention at 2, 6, and 12-months
      post-intervention. The total sample size for the Barrier Analysis will be a maximum of 450
      caregivers; for the main intervention, 900 households (300/arm) will be purposely sampled
      from the randomly selected communities. Respondents for the qualitative portion will be
      purposely selected.

      Analysis: This longitudinal study will collect data from all participants at 3 time points:
      baseline, endline, and sustainability (12-months post-intervention). The analysis will
      utilize Intent-to-Treat (ITT) approach using the initial randomization of the treatment arms.
      Using ITT will allow us to determine the overall impact of having the NIPP vs. NIPP+ vs.
      control, thus better mimicking real world program implementation and impact. Mixed effects
      models will be used to determine the role of time-variant and invariant individual (by
      gender) household, and community characteristics, as well as measures of exposure and
      integration on key outcome indicators. A difference-in-difference analysis (baseline/endline,
      baseline/sustainability, endline/sustainability) will also be used to triangulate findings.

    <description>The NIPP group is a standard social behavior change (SBCC) intervention that tackles a set of underlying causes of malnutrition, with the potential to have both a curative and preventative impact on child malnutrition. The approach in this group/arm involves training and pragmatic behavior change education reinforced by practical activities over a 12-week period to both men and women in selected communities. It aims to utilize easy, viable and accessible solutions within the community that can be used to improve and protect household health and nutrition. The 12-week lesson plans for the circles are divided into 3 components, i) hands-on behavior change sessions that focus on the key pre-identified causes of malnutrition to improve awareness and practice ii) micro-gardening for improved household nutrition security and iii) participatory cooking demonstrations to stimulate improvements in nutritional status and care practices.</description>

    <description>In addition to establishing the circles and implementing the three NIPP components also implemented in the NIPP arm, those randomized to the NIPP+ arm will be provided access to innovations to allow and encourage the households and communities to translate the knowledge into positive practices. The innovations and access to vendors who sell innovations will be made available during the training to the NIPP+ volunteers who will provide trainings and access to vendors during the circle meetings. Most of the additions will be made accessible at a subsidized/low cost. The NIPP+ officers from the program will support NIPP+ volunteers in collaboration with agricultural extension officers.</description>

    <description>GOAL's NIPP approach is a gendered, grass-roots SBC approach, tackling a package of underlying behavioral determinants of malnutrition, irrespective of the particular manifestation. The approach is multi-sectoral in nature. It also has a strong monitoring, evaluation and adaptive learning component by design. The intervention approach (based on GOAL's NIPP approach) involves the creation of community, male and female circles in each community with messaging and activities targeted towards the three groups in varying intensities. While the male and female circles meet 2-3 times per week for a maximum period of 12 weeks while the community circles will meet for approximately three hours at any one time over a period of 2-7 days. (See GOAL NIPP Implementation Guidelines)</description>
