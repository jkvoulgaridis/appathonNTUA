  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate potential beneficial
      effects of leukocyte-poor platelet rich plasma and bone marrow concentrate on the healing and
      health of critical joint tissues in the knee following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      reconstruction. Bone marrow contains stem cells which can change into cells of various
      different tissue types, while platelet rich plasma contains growth factors. This trial will
      compare the two procedures against placebo.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will be randomized into
      three groups: Concentrated Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMC), Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) or
      Placebo. BMC subjects will have bone marrow aspirated from the subjects iliac crests and the
      cellular rich portion will be concentrated and subsequently injected into the subjects'
      symptomatic knee during ACL reconstruction surgery. PRP subjects will have a venous blood
      draw and the resulting PRP will be injected into the symptomatic knee during ACL
      reconstruction surgery. Follow-up visits involving imaging and biomotion testing will take
      place at 2 weeks, 6 months and 18 months after the ACL reconstruction surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate potential beneficial effects of leukocyte-poor
      platelet-rich plasma (LP-PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) on the healing and health of
      all critical joint tissues (grafts/ligaments, meniscus and cartilage) in the knee following
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Key aspects of this proposal include our
      well-developed methodologies to quantify and correlate cytokines, chemokines, growth factors
      in PRP and progenitor cells in BMC, clinical outcomes and imaging following ACLR. The
      overarching goal of this randomized control trial is to establish a biological signature of
      PRP and BMC that will be indicative for optimal recovery after ACLR. The long-term goal of
      our research is to better understand the efficacy of orthobiologic approaches to improve
      clinical outcomes, enhance graft healing and mitigate post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in
      a cohort of patients that have undergone ACLR.

             that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational
             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of trial results and,
             in the judgment of the Principal Investigator or delegated clinician, would make the
             subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.

             Subjects will be withdrawn from the study (Screen Failures) after providing informed
             consent and/or at the time of ACLR surgery if they meet any of the following criteria:

         18. Concurrent reconstruction of any knee ligaments other than the ACL;

         19. ACLR which requires the following concomitant treatments: bone plating, metal implants
             (with the exception of titanium interference screws) or microfracture;

         20. Inability to collect sufficient research samples (e.g. less than the minimum required
             amount of BMA is harvested, or clotting occurs).
