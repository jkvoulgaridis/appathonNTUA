  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adductor canal catheters are being used to provide continuous postoperative analgesia after
      total knee arthroplasty surgery (TKA). There is much debate about where is the best position
      of continuous adductor canal block in patients undergoing TKA. Therefore, the investigators
      aim to compare the postoperative pain at three different level of continuous adductor canal
      block. Eighty-seven patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty will be randomly divided
      into the three groups. In group 1, the adductor canal catheter is inserted at femoral
      triangle apex (the proximal end of the adductor canal). In group 2, the adductor canal
      catheter is inserted femur length/15*2 cm above the location where the nerve block performed
      in group 1. In group 3, the adductor canal catheter is inserted femur length/15*2 cm below
      the location where the nerve block performed in group 1.

    <description>The visual analog scale(VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; (0) and &quot;worst pain.&quot; (10). The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured(symptom,pain,health) orientated from the left(0, worst) to the right(10, best).</description>
