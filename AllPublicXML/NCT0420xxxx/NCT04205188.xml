      this study evaluates the effects of therapeutic exercises on kinesiophobia and health-related
      quality of life in adult haemophilia patients. half of participants will receive therapeutic

    <textblock>
      in haemophilia patients recurrent musculoskeletal hemorrhage cause to arthropathy
      characterized by severe degeneration of joint cartilage and bones. arthropathy leads to
      decrease in the patient's health related quality of life. furthermore pain, risk of injury
      and lack of motivation lead to decreased physical activity and development of kinesiophobia.
