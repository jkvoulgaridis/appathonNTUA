      A Pilot clinical evaluation to study the performance, accuracy and safety of the Sanvita
      OneTouch Real Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring System compared to the YSI 2300 analyzer.
      The performance data will be obtained during onsite clinical study site visits where up to 25
      subjects will have glucose manipulations and glucose will be measured at predetermined
      intervals and the numerical data will be compared to values obtained with the YSI 2300
      analyzer. The study will have three arms: hypoglycemic clamp protocol, hyperglycemic clamp
      protocol and a standard protocol.
