  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaging the inside of coronary arteries (intravascular imaging) offers great insight into the
      assessment and treatment of coronary artery disease. Over time, substances such as fat,
      cholesterol and calcium can build up into 'plaques' in the arteries, causing narrowings or
      even blockages. These plaques can also rupture, causing cardiovascular events such as heart
      attacks or strokes. By using ultrasound and infrared technology, intravascular imaging can
      help assess these plaques, however this is an invasive technique involving angiography.
      Plaque composition, structure and stability can be affected by inflammation and the stress
      that the arteries are under. The investigators have pioneered novel minimally-invasive
      methods for modelling arterial stress using computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA),
      as well as imaging coronary arterial inflammation using a positron emission tomography (PET)
      scan. Before embarking upon a large-scale clinical outcome study to determine whether these
      novel methods can improve risk prediction, the aim is to perform a proof-of-principle study
      to further develop our methodology for hybrid image analysis, and to validate this technique
      against high-resolution intravascular imaging as a surrogate marker of histology.
