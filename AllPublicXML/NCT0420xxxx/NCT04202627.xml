  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this natural history study is to define the key LGMD2i phenotypes as
      measured by standard clinical outcome assessments (COAs), and to validate a muscle biomarker
      for LGMD 2i to support therapeutic development.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) 2i is an autosomal recessive form of LGMD that is due
      to missense mutations in the FKRP gene. Patients develop progressive proximal muscle weakness
      that leads to loss of ambulation. Patients will also commonly develop a cardiomyopathy and
      respiratory compromise.

      There are promising new therapies that have been developed and as a result therapeutic trials
      are approaching.

      The rationale for this study is to define appropriate COAs for LGMD 2i, which will facilitate
      therapeutic development and ensure properly powered clinical trials. In addition, measurement
      of dystroglycan in muscles represents a potential muscle biomarker that could be used in
      early phase clinical trials as a measure of target engagement. The clinical utility of
      changes in dystroglycan has not been validated in human samples.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10-Meter walk -mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete three trials of the 10-meter walk test. The fastest time will be recorded, in addition to the average of the three trials. The test will be conducted in a quiet hallway and the participant will be instructed to walk their normal self-selected pace from one cone to the next along the 10-meter course marked on the floor. No assistive devices or flip-flops are allowed, and the test will be performed either barefoot or in well-fitting shoes. Orthoses and ankle braces will be allowed.
The Time Frame provided is not specific. The Time Frame should indicate the specific time point(s) at which the outcome measure will be assessed and for which data will be reported. Examples:
&quot;baseline&quot; &quot;1 year&quot; &quot;up to 24 weeks&quot; &quot;through study completion, an average of 1 year&quot;.</description>

    <description>North Star Assessment for Dysferlinopathy (NSAD) is a functional scale specifically designed to measure motor performance in individuals with LGMD. It consists of 29 items that are considered clinically relevant items from the North Star Ambulatory Assessment and the Motor Function Measure 20 with a maximum score of 54 and higher scores indicate higher functional abilities.</description>

    <description>The TUG will be administered using the appropriate stable seating surface (i.e., cube chair or straight back chair) to achieve 90 degree of both hip and knee flexion when participant is seated with both feet flat on the floor to start. No flip flops will be allowed, and the test should be performed either barefoot or will well-fitting shoes on. Assistive devices, orthoses and ankle braces will be allowed.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will perform the 4-stair climb with instructions to ascend 4 steps as quickly as safely possible using handrails if needed. The time to ascend the 4 steps will be recorded. This will not be assessed in participants with a 10 meter walk time greater than 12 seconds.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance of Upper Limb (PUL 2.0) - limb function</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PUL is a tool designed for assessing upper limb function in persons with neuromuscular disorders.39 It was developed as a conceptual framework reflecting the progression of weakness and natural history of functional decline in DMD. There are 22scored items; a score of 42 indicates the highest level of independent function and 0 the lowest</description>
