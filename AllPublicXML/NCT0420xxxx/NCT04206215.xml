  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of tDCS in combination with TUS for the
      treatment of pain in subjects with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The investigators hypothesize that
      there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham
      stimulation.
