      inhibitors with closed loop control (CLC).

      The first five participants will be enrolled in a Pilot Study to use the Basal-IQ with
      Empagliflozin 10 mg daily for approximately two weeks. These participants will participate in
      an estimated 36-48-hour hotel admission to initiate use of Closed Loop Control. The safety
      data from the Pilot Study will be presented to the DSMB for review.

      Upon DSMB approval, approximately 40 participants will be randomized 1:1 in a crossover
      design. Participants will use Empagliflozin 5 mg daily. This main study is a randomized
      control trial where approximately 50 participants, aged 18 to less than 65 y.o. at time of
      consent, will be in the trial for up to 10 weeks.

      With Empagliflozin:

        -  Control-IQ (CiQ) x 4 weeks (CiQ-EMPA) then Basal-IQ x 2 weeks (BiQ-EMPA)

        -  Basal-IQ x 2 weeks (BiQ-EMPA) then CiQ x 4 weeks (CiQ-EMPA)

      Without Empagliflozin:

        -  CiQ x 4 weeks (CiQ-NO EMPA) then Basal-IQ x 2 weeks (BiQ-NO EMPA)

        -  Basal-IQ x 2 weeks (BiQ-NO EMPA) then CiQ x 4 weeks (CiQ-NO EMPA)
