    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Analyte concentration (Cmax) of JNJ 64417184</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 144 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is defined as maximum observed plasma analyte.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC [0-last]) of JNJ 64417184</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 144 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-last) is defined as the area under the plasma analyte concentration- time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the time of the last measurable (non-below qualification limit) concentration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to Infinity (AUC [0-infinity]) of JNJ 64417184</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 144 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-infinity) is defined as AUC from time 0 to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(0-last) and C(last)/ lambda(z), wherein C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration; extrapolations of more than 20 percent (%) of the total AUC.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 54 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (weight [kg]/height2 [m]2) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2, extremes
             included, and body weight not less than 50 kg at screening

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical and surgical history, and vital
             signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate [after the
             participant is supine for at least 5 minutes], respiratory rate, and oral body
             temperature) performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may
             be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically
             significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  Female participant must have a negative highly sensitive serum beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1

          -  Female participant must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of
             assisted reproduction during the study and for at least 90 days after the last study
             drug intake

          -  Must not use nicotine-containing substances including tobacco products (example,
             cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, gum, or patch) for at least 3
             months prior to screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of liver or renal dysfunction (calculated creatinine clearance/estimated
             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than (&lt;) 60 milliliter per minute (mL/min) at
             screening, calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula),
             significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant
             diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the investigator's opinion could
             influence drug absorption or bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic,
             rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or metabolic disturbances

          -  - Past history of cardiac arrhythmias (example, extrasystoli, tachycardia at rest),
             history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (example, hypokalemia, family
             history of long QT Syndrome)

          -  Any evidence of heart block or bundle branch block at screening

          -  Current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2 infection (confirmed by
             antibodies) at screening

          -  History of hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen,
             or hepatitis C virus antibody positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or
             tests positive for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M antibody, hepatitis B surface
             antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody at screening
