  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical study is designed to evaluate the 1 year local tumor control rates
      after the targeted therapy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy synchronized chemotherapy
      with nimotuzumab combined with S-1 in local advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinomas
      based on Nutritional Risk Screening NRS2002.
