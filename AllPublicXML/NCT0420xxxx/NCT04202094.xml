  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective comparative interventional cohort study.

      The study population consists of young adults (≥18 years) cured of childhood cancer or
      hematological disorders for which they received high-risk gonadotoxic treatment (with an ≥80%
      risk of later fertility problems) during childhood. In order to preserve their fertility,
      these patients were proposed to store their testicular tissue at a young age. These young
      adults will be invited by e-mail/letter/telephone to evaluate their fertility status (Tanner
      stage, testicular volume, hormones, semen analysis) at adult age and at least one year after
      the last received gonadotoxic treatment.

      A prospective analysis of data on their fertility status will be performed in order to
      identify differences between young adults who underwent a testicular tissue biopsy procedure
      (which is performed to harvest testicular tissue) at a young age and those who did not. The
      results of this prospective analysis will also be compared to the reproductive health of
      spontaneously conceived young adults.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a prospective comparative interventional cohort study.
The fertility status of young adults (≥18 years) cured of childhood cancer or hematological disorders for which they received high-risk gonadotoxic treatment (with an ≥80% risk of later fertility problems) during childhood will be compared between patients who did and those who did not undergo a testicular tissue biopsy procedure at a young age as a fertility preservation strategy in order to identify a possible association between the biopsy procedure (which is performed to harvest testicular tissue) and the later fertility outcome.
Their fertility status will also be compared to the reproductive health of spontaneously conceived young adults that has already been published (Belva F et al., 2016/2017/2019).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The patients' fertility status (Tanner stage, testicular volume, hormones, semen analysis) will be evaluated once a year. Only in case of infertility (azoospermia) or subfertility (oligo-, astheno- or teratozoospermia), the different interventions will be repeated one year later as the recovery of spermatogenesis with return of sperm production may occur several years after gonadotoxic treatment.</description>
