  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to contribute to the knowledge regarding immediate implant-based BR
      by investigating whether the one-stage technique with ADM is superior to the two-stage
      expander to implant technique. Primary endpoint in first publication is postoperative
      complications, secondary endpoint is patient and investigator assessed aesthetic outcome.
      Primary endpoint in second publication is cost, secondary endpoint is patient reported
      outcome measures.

    <measure>Patient reported outcome measures</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported assessment of pain and dysaesthesia in reconstructed breast, arm/shoulder function on reconstructed side. Described on a 6 point scale where lower score equals more pain/dysaesthesia/troubles with arm/shoulder function.
Body image (Hopwoods Body Image Scale) assessed in a 10-items each on 4 point Likert scale from 0 to 3. Sum provides a total score (range 0-30) and lower scores equals less body image troubles.
Furthermore, study specific questions as &quot;use of pain killers the last week&quot; (yes / no) and &quot;all in all assessment of health owning to the breast reconstruction&quot; (improved / diminished or unchanged). All obtained by questionnaire.</description>
