  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have generally investigated patellar tendon stiffness, cross-sectional area
      of patellar tendon, patellar tendon length, patellar force and patellafemoral forces during
      decline squat. However, there is just a few study about electromyographic (EMG) activity
      during the eccentric squating, which is about rectus femoris (RF) recruitment. In the present
      study the investigators primarly aimed to quantify the activation of RF, vastus lateralis
      (VL), and vastus medialis obliqus (VMO) during eccentric squat on different decline angle (0,
      5°, 10°, 15°, 20°). An additional purpose of our study was to compare the changes in muscle
      activation at various arc of knee flexion motion (degrees of 0-30, 30-60, 60-90, 0-60, 30-90,
      0-90).The investigators hypothesised that the recruitment of RF, VL, and VMO during eccentric
      squat would differ according to decline angle and arc of motion.

      The squat procedure in each condition will be repeated 10 times on a treadmill. The treadmill
      will be used to adjust the degree of decline in a standard manner. There will be a metronome
      to keep the speed of exercise in the same rhythm. All squats will be performed with a
      weighted barbell. The weight of it will be set as in ratio 30% of the participant's body
      weight

    <description>Surface electromyographic (EMG) system (Noraxon Telemyo DTS System, Scottsdale, USA) will be use to measure the muscle activation ratios of RF, VL, and VMO. Electrodes will be placed according to Surface EMG for noninvasive assessment of muscles (SENIAM) recommendations on the dominant leg.
The muscle activation during eccentric phase of the decline squat for RF, VL, and VMO will be determined. The decline squat will be performed under different conditions (various decline angle: 0, 5, 10,15, 20 degree) The muscle activation will also be investigated within various arc of motion of knee flexion (0-30, 30-60, 60-90, 0-60, 0-90, 30-90) which is determined using the motion analysis system (Noraxon, MYOmotion Scottsdale, USA).</description>

    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>MVICs for the RF, VL, and VMO at their manual muscle test positions will be assessed within 3 trials, which lasts 5 seconds. The muscle test position will be standardized 90 degrees hip flexion and 60 degrees knee flexion. One minute a rest period will be between each trial. The peak EMG amplitude will be used for the normalization.</description>
