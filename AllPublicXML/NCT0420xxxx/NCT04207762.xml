  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are generally slow growing, but some can be aggressive and
      resistant to treatment. Compared to healthy cells, the surface of these tumor cells has a
      greater number of special molecules called somatostatin receptors (SSTR). Somatostatin
      receptor scintigraphy and conventional imaging are used to detect NETs.

      This study proposes 18F-AmBF3-TATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)
      is superior to current imaging techniques. The goal is to evaluate the biodistribution and
      safety of 18F-AmBF3-TATE PET/CT for neuroendocrine tumour imaging.

      Each subject will have a PET/CT scan using 18F-AmBF3-TATE. The 18F-AmBF3-TATE radioactive
      tracer is manufactured for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health
      Canada.

      After providing informed written consent subjects will complete a medical history
      questionnaire.

      Monitoring of adverse events There will be short-term evaluation of adverse events by
      comparison of vital signs before and after administration of 18F-AmBF3-TATE . Eighteen to
      seventy-two hours after 18F-AmBF3-TATE administration the participant will return to the
      imaging department to perform a follow up safety assessment and routine blood draw. The study
      coordinator will ask the participant if they have experienced any adverse events during that
      time period and complete the adverse event questionnaire.

      Follow-up Assessments

      The following information will be collected up to 12 months following the PET/CT scans:

      Initiation of a new treatment, Laboratory results and pathology reports, Results of imaging
      studies, Final clinical diagnosis by physician and relevant clinical notes. The study is
      expected to take up to 1 year for accrual.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of radiotracer uptake at multiple time points following radiotracer injection. Calculation of radiation dosimetry using OLINDA 2.0 methodology. Determination of tumour uptake in terms of standardized uptake values and tumour/blood, tumour/liver and tumour/lung ratios (descriptive analysis). For accuracy determination, it is anticipated that only a subset of participants may have a complete gold standard for the determination of accuracy. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (along with the confidence interval) of 18F-AMBF3-TATE will be calculated for patients with an available gold standard. The proportion of participants with a complete gold standard is not yet known for this study.</description>

    <time_frame>Before injection, 1 hours post injection, 2 hours post injection and 2.5 hours post injection</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and pulse oximetry) will be measured at four time points. All values that fall outside of the normal parameters will be assessed by a physician and reported as an adverse event.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with self-reported 18F-AmBF3-TATE -related adverse event</measure>
    <time_frame>18-72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will return to the department 18-72 hours after the 18F-AmBF3-TATE PET/CT scan to see if they experienced any adverse events. These are recorded and evaluated for severity and likelihood they are related to the study drug. All adverse events will be recorded and summarized in the final report.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total number of lesions per anatomic location identified by 18F-AmBF3-TATE PET/CT</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>All lesions will be tabulated and classified by compartment (pancreas, liver, bowel, lung and mediastinum, abdomen and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, bone, other) for all imaging that has been done for that subject. A total number of lesions will be calculated and a proportion of lesions detected will be reported and will be compared by calculating the median and its confidence interval. This will assess the biodistribution of 18F-AmBF3-TATE PET/CT.</description>

    <description>Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels and EKG monitoring (vital signs) will be recorded prior to the injection and at three other stages of the scan visit. Each study subject will have an intravenous catheter inserted. Prior to the radiotracer injection an ultra low dose CT will be taken. Subjects are positioned supine, arms down. The subject will receive a bolus intravenous dose of the radiotracer from an approved study supplier site. A Dynamic PET scan will be taken of the heart. Then a serial whole body PET scan will be done. Vital signs will be taken again and the subject will have a bathroom break. The patient will return to the scanner bed for a standard low dose CT and whole body PET scan. Vital signs will be taken again, and subject will be allowed to use the washroom again. The subject will return to the scanner bed for the final time for an ultra low dose CT and whole body PET scan. A final set of vitals will be taken and the subject will be discharged.</description>
