  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to study the aspects of nutrition in children and adolescents with GERD
      compared to the sex and age-matched control group
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the differences in nutrition of pediatric patients with
      GERD compared to the control group. The secondary aim is to study possible associations of
      the data on nutritional habits revealed with the use of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
      and the data of 24-hours oesophageal pH-impedance examination.
