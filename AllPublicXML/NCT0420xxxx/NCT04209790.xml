  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative therapy has not been well studied in resectable glioblastoma. This study
      attempts to prospectively assess the feasibility and efficacy of preoperative chemo radiation
      in improving local control, as this is the predominant mode of failure in these patients
      leading to poor outcomes.

      This Phase II study design would be used to proceed with the study treatment after meeting
      pre-specified events in the initial phase, with goal being to determine whether the new
      treatment paradigm is sufficiently promising to warrant a major controlled clinical
      evaluation against the standard therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neo adjuvant, preoperative chemo radiation has consistently shown improvements in local
      disease control or organ preservation in many cancers including head and neck, esophageal,
      rectal, bladder cancers and sarcomas, leading to improvements in overall survival and limb or
      organ preservation.

      This interventional study will be done in two phases using the Simon two-stage Phase II study
      design. The median progression-free survival of these patients with current standard of care
      therapy is in the range of 6-8 months (6.9 months in the standard of care). With the proposed
      trial of surgical resection of the tumor after chemotherapy and radiation the median
      progression free survival is anticipated to be approximately 11-12 months from subset
      analysis of available literature and based on prior data on other disease sites. In other
      words, the 7-month local progression rates is anticipated to decrease from 50% to 25%, or
      progression free survival improve from 50-75%

    <intervention_model_description>After standard treatment of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with resection and adjuvant therapy, local failure the dominant pattern of failure. Neo adjuvant therapy consistently provides the potential for improved local control and removal of residual stem cell niches. The hypothesis is that earlier institution of neo adjuvant chemo radiation therapy in GBM would improve local control and potentially overall survival.
Involved field radiation is often employed to treat unresectable or sub totally resected GBM. Radiating native GBM is not uncommon as many tumors are not safely resectable due to its location in eloquent brain. Planned neoadjuvant chemo radiation prior to immediate surgical resection in glioblastoma is a novel approach in resectable tumors.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>During Concomitant Radiation Therapy on the same day as the first fraction of radiotherapy. Temozolomide will be administered continuously from day 1 of radiotherapy to the last day of radiation at a daily oral dose of 75 mg/m2 for a maximum of 49 days. The drug will be administered orally daily during radiotherapy, as best tolerated by the patient. During weekends without radiotherapy (Saturday and Sunday), the drug will be taken in the morning. The dose will be determined using actual body surface area (BSA) as calculated in square meters at the beginning of the concomitant treatment. The BSA will be calculated from the height obtained at the pretreatment visit. Capsules of temozolomide are available in 5, 20, 100, 140, 180, and 250 mg. The daily dose will be rounded to the nearest 5 mg.</description>

             28 days prior to step 2 registration.

          8. Ability to get multiplanar contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recurrent, unresectable or multifocal malignant gliomas.

          2. Any site of distant disease (for example, drop metastases from the GBM tumor site)

          4. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic.

             registration.

                  exception of the craniotomy for surgical resection

               5. Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration

               6. Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects;
                  note, however, that laboratory tests for coagulation parameters are not required
                  for entry into this protocol.

               7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness

                  Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for
                  entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this
                  protocol is because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly
                  immunosuppressive with potentially fatal outcomes in patients already
                  immunosuppressed.

               9. Any other severe immuno-compromised condition.

              10. Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma that in the
                  opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for radiation
                  toxicity.

              11. End-stage renal disease (i.e. on dialysis or dialysis has been recommended).

              12. Any other major medical illnesses or psychiatric treatments that in the
                  investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol
                  therapy.
