  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult subjects diagnosed with any form of an advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors including urothelial carcinoma for which standard therapy is no
      longer effective or is intolerable. This is a phase 1, multi-center, open label study
      designed to assess safety and tolerability of IK-175, to determine the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D). Disease response, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and response
      biomarkers will also be assessed.
