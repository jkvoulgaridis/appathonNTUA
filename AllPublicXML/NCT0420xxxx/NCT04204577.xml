      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of simple local ablation,
      local ablation combined with apatinib, local ablation combined with apatinib and PD-1
      antibody SHR-1210 for the treatment of advanced liver cancer.

    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancer is a common malignant tumor in the world. Its pathogenesis is concealed
      and clinically asymptomatic. It is mostly in the middle and late stages of the disease. It is
      often combined with different degrees of cirrhosis. The liver function reserve is poor.About
      80% of patients are in the first place. The operation has been lost at the time of diagnosis.

      Primary liver cancer is not sensitive to conventional treatments such as radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy because of its unique tissue type. For advanced liver cancer, ablation combined
      with other systemic treatments is expected to alleviate the patient's condition, prolong the
      patient's survival time, and benefit more patients. The long-term clinical efficacy of tumor
      thermal ablation has been reported more, the basic conclusion is consistent, hat is, the
      5-year survival rate of early stage tumors such as liver cancer less than 3cm is not inferior
      to surgical resection, or even better. Liver cancer is rich in blood supply and tumor blood
      vessels are dense. The formation and maintenance of these blood vessels requires
      pro-angiogenic signals, of which VEGFR is a key component. Apatinib is a small molecule
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR at very low concentrations. SHR-1210 is a
      humanized anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 antibody.

      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of simple local ablation, local
      ablation combined with apatinib, local ablation combined with apatinib and PD-1 antibody
      SHR-1210 for the treatment of advanced liver cancer.
