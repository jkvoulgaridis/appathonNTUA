  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a multicenter cross-sectional study to discover symptom
      characteristics, quality of life, severity of anxiety and depression, status of lactose
      intolerance and treatment satisfaction of current Chinese Medicine (CM) regimens of
      outpatients with FGIDs. In the meanwhile, the investigators will also analyze the characters
      of CM patterns and corresponding elements, then explore the potential relationship between CM
      patterns and FGIDs' subtypes.

      This is a multicenter cross-sectional study to discover symptom characteristics, quality of
      life, severity of anxiety and depression, status of lactose intolerance and treatment
      satisfaction of current Chinese Medicine (CM) regimens of outpatients with FGIDs. Afterwards,
      the investigators will explore the potential relationship between CM patterns and FGIDs'
      subtypes based on collected information. It is estimated that 4,632 outpatients from 18
      centers across China will be recruited. Various demographic and disease-related information
      will be documented, including name, gender, age, education level, marital status, job
      category, disease course, medical consultation experience, current CM regimens and rationale,
      and treatment satisfaction. Patients will also complete a series of scales, containing, Rome
      IV Diagnostic Questionnaire, Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) scale, the 36-Item Short Form
      Survey (SF-36), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), lactose food
      frequency questionnaire (Lactose FFQ) and CM pattern scale. The primary outcome will be the
      symptom characteristics of outpatients with FGIDs. Secondary outcomes include population
      characteristics of FGID patients (quality of life, emotional status, lactose intolerance
      status, and satisfaction level of CM interventions), and potential association between CM
      patterns and FGIDs' subtypes.
