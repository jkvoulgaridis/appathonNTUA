  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, monocentric, open-label, controlled phase III clinical
      study conducted in Fortaleza, Brazil, from April 2017 to October 2018. The local
      Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol and informed consent, which was
      obtained from all participants. The research was conducted in accordance with the 1975
      Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments.

      The study population consisted of 115, both male and female, participants, who were recruited
      from a local burn treatment center. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18 and ≤60 years; the
      presence of dermatological wounds caused by superficial partial-thickness burns (SPTB)
      affecting up to 15% of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) and with indication for outpatient
      treatment; the absence of previous treatment for the current burn and an absence of other
      significant diseases that could impact the volunteer's participation in the study (coronary
      artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, among others).
      Exclusion criteria included hypersensitivity to materials used in the study or to related
      compounds; history of severe adverse reactions; drug addiction, including alcohol; use of
      medications that could have an impact on wound healing (e.g., steroids) and pregnancy, labor
      or miscarriage in the 12 weeks before the scheduled start of treatment.

      In the test group, the treatment was Nile Tilapia Fish Skin, which have a patent registered
      at the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) under number BR 10 2015 021435 9.
      Nile Tilapia Fish Skin was subjected to a rigorous process of chemical sterilization,
      glycerolization and irradiation, followed by microbiological tests for bacteria and fungi,
      before storage in sterile refrigerated packaging. Prior to its use in the patient, the skin
      was washed in sterile 0.9% saline for 5 minutes, with this process being repeated three times
      in a row. In the control group, conventional treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream 1% was
      applied. Randomization was performed using a predefined computer-generated list, with 57
      patients being allocated in the test group and 58 patients being allocated in the control
      group.

    <description>In the control group, a dressing change was defined as the act of cleaning the wound and reapplying the Silver Sulfadiazine Cream 1%, which was performed every 48 hours. In the test group, a dressing change was defined as the act of replacing the Nile Tilapia Fish Skin which did not adhere properly and/or replacing gauze and bandage that is full of exudate.</description>

    <measure>Amount of anesthetics used throughout the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>In order to audit analgesic intake, apart from the medication prescription (dipyrone and/or tramadol), the patients received a daily record card. They were asked to take the medication only if they felt pain, always respecting instructions in the prescription, and to register the amount of medication taken and the date on the card. Upon returning for medical evaluation, the remaining medication was checked and compared to the daily record card.</description>

    <measure>Treatment cost per patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>Consumption of materials of the burn treatment center was controlled by the completion of a specific form, an activity performed at the end of each patient visit by the nursing staff. The resources consumed were divided into three categories: a) products used for wound management (either Nile Tilapia Fish Skin or Silver Sulfadiazine Cream 1%); (b) hospital material required for dressing preparation (such as sterile gloves, chlorhexidine, gauze, and bandage); and c) analgesic medication required throughout treatment (dipyrone and/or tramadol). Human resources were not evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Pain intensity evaluation via Visual Analogue Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were informed that the left end of the 10 cm horizontal line (with a &quot;0&quot;) represented &quot;no pain&quot; and that the right end (with a &quot;10&quot;) represented the &quot;most severe pain imaginable.&quot; They were asked to make a mark on the line that represented their current pain intensity, and the Visual Analogue Scale pain intensity level was scored by measurement of the distance from the mark to the &quot;no pain&quot; end of the line.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity evaluation via Electronic von Frey</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11</time_frame>
    <description>In the Electronic von Frey, a rigid tip of 0.7 mm in diameter is connected to an electronic system, which displays the test readings in grams (from 0.1 to 1000 g). Initially, 4 different points around the burn were chosen, each one with a distance of around 1 cm from the wound bed. The tip was applied perpendicularly to the skin surface in each of these points, with the application rate controlled entirely by the observer. The participants gave a verbal signal when the pressure was felt to be unpleasant: this measure was taken as the Mechanical Pain Threshold of that point. Subsequently, the process was repeated in a similar region of the contralateral healthy side of the body. The mean of the measures of the 4 points in each area was taken as the mean Mechanical Pain Threshold of that area. Finally, the difference between the nociception threshold of healthy skin and of the edge of the burn, expressed in grams, was determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Burns Specific Pain Anxiety Scale (BSPAS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 and 11</time_frame>
    <description>The Brazilian version of the 9-item Burns Specific Pain Anxiety Scale (BSPAS) was employed. Each item in the BSPAS is scored on a 10 cm visual analogue line with two reference points given values of 0 and 10. The patient is asked how much the assertions relate to their current pain situation, with 0 corresponding to ''not at all'' and 10 corresponding to ''the worst imaginable way''. The total score is calculated by adding up the scores for all items, with a maximum of 90 points.</description>

    <measure>Burn improvement on the day of dressing removal evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I). The CGI-I is evaluated by the physician responsible and answers the following question: &quot;Compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project, this patient's condition is: 1 - very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2 - much improved; 3 - minimally improved; 4 - no change from baseline; 5 - minimally worse; 6 - much worse; 7 - very much worse since the initiation of treatment&quot;.</description>

Nile Tilapia Fish Skin was subjected to a rigorous process of chemical sterilization, glycerolization and irradiation, followed by microbiological tests for bacteria and fungi, before storage in sterile refrigerated packaging. Prior to its use in the patient, the skin was washed thrice in sterile 0.9% saline for 5 minutes, in order to remove glycerol. Regarding application in the study patients, after cleaning the lesion with tap water and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, Nile Tilapia Fish Skin was applied and covered with gauze and bandage. Throughout the treatment, dressings with Nile Tilapia Fish Skin were only changed if the biomaterial was not properly adhered to the wound bed. The patients were evaluated every 48 hours for the study parameters.</description>

    <description>In the search of new therapies for burns, the skin of Brazil's most cultivated fish, the Nile tilapia, which was mostly a waste product (although sometimes used as a resistant material for artisanal handicraft), was suggested as a possibility for the development of a low-cost xenograft. Apart from non-infectious microbiota, Nile Tilapia Fish Skin presented histomorphological similarities with human skin in pre-clinical studies. It was shown to have a deep dermis formed by thick collagen fibers organized on parallel/horizontal and transversal/vertical arrangement and composed, in comparison, by larger amounts of type I collagen. Nile Tilapia Fish Skin did not present variations in its microscopic structure and tensile strength after glycerolization, irradiation and posterior rehydration, recovering its natural consistency after glycerol removal.</description>
