  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HSCT is currently the only curative option for SCD but less than 20% of SCD patients have a
      MD donor available. So far, all curative approaches beyond a MSD HSCT at young age are
      non-satisfactory. With the lack of a suitable donor for the vast majority of patients, the
      major question of this trial is, if a haploidentical αß/CD19+ T-cell depleted HSCT can be a
      valid alternative to a MSD HSCT. The main challenge in non-malignant diseases is to offer a
      safe and GvHD-free HSCT without rejection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Can an α/ß depleted T-Haplo-HSCT with regard to disease free survival, adverse events and
      safety be considered equivalent to a matched sibling donor transplantation (MSD), in order to
      offer cure for the majority of patients with sickle cell disease.

      The main questions of this trial are:

        -  Safety of a α/ß T-depleted haploidentical HSCT

        -  Incidence of acute and chronic GvHD

        -  Rate of rejection

        -  Immune reconstitution

        -  Fertility It is expected that the use of TCRαβ+ and CD19+ depleted haploidentical cell
           grafts in combination with the less aggressive and well tolerated conditioning regimen
           needed for patient preparation will be associated with a low risk of grade II-IV aGVHD
           and no extensive cGvHD, no graft failure and increase speed, spectrum and functionality
           of immune system reconstitution. This is supposed to reduce the incidence of severe
           infections leading to lower rates of transplantation related mortality (TRM).

    <description>Adult patients ≥18 years. The European Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire has two components: health state description and evaluation.
In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are.</description>
