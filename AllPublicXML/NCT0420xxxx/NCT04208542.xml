  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study intended to assess the efficacy of erector spinae
      plane analgesia on acute and chronic postoperative pain for VATS procedures. It will include
      72 patients presenting to Severance hospital for a VATS procedure. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either ESP block and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV
      PCA) or IV PCA only. Ropivacaine will be used in nerve block, and injected at the end of
      surgery. The primary outcome will be to compare analgesic efficacy between the two groups as
      defined by immediate postoperative pain scores on the numeric pain rating scale. Secondary
      outcomes include total opioid consumption, painDETECT score, and chronic pain scores.

      Postoperative pain control for thoracic surgery is key to allow faster recovery and diminish
      postoperative complications. Poorly controlled acute pain may contribute to the impairment of
      respiratory function and the development of chronic post-thoracotomy pain.

      Recently, an increasing number of erector spinae plane (ESP) nerve blocks are being performed
      as it has been demonstrated, and via case reports that the blocks provide clinical
      effectiveness, but may have a better side-effect profile than the paravertebral nerve block
      and epidural analgesia. Moreover, there is an advantage for novice because ESP block is
      simpler and safer to proceed than conventional nerve blocks.
