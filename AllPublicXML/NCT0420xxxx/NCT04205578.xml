  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC) revascularization is the most widely used treatment
      to improve cerebral perfusion in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD), and it has been shown
      to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke and neurological deficit. However, perioperative
      changes in cerebral hemodynamics can induce fluctuations in cerebral perfusion that may lead
      to transient or irreversible neurological deficits. Our preliminary single-center study
      suggests that postoperative intravenous administration of dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) may
      alleviate perioperative neurological deficits and improve the neurological outcomes after
      EC-IC revascularization for MMD. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      single-controlled, add-on to standard of care study of NBP in patients with MMD of high risk
      for ischemic cerebrovascular events after EC-IC revascularization surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, singe-blinded, placebo parallel controlled,
      multiple-center trial.

      A total of approximately 450 patients (age between18 years and 60 years) with moyamoya
      disease after EC-IC revascularization will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two groups
      after offering informed content: 1) one group will receive butylphthalide in 100 mL of normal
      saline twice daily since the day of surgery and continued for 14 postoperative days; 2) the
      other group will receive 100 mL of normal saline twice daily since the day of surgery and
      continued for 14 postoperative days.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the rate and severity of ischemic cerebral event in MMD
      patients with butylphthalide after EC-IC bypass surgery. The study consists of four visits
      including the day of randomization(baseline), postoperative day 1 before the first injection,
      14 days after surgery when the injection therapy is done, and 30 after suryery. Demographic
      information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging assessment, neurological
      function scale will be recorded during the program. The rate of stroke event, neurological
      deficit and severity of neurological deficits will be assessed by modified Rankin scale. The
      trial is anticipated to last from January 2020 to December 2022 with subjects recruited form
      two neurosurgical centers in Beijing, China.
