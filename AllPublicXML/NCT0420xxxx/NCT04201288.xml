  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this program of research is to test a newly developed intervention,
      Acceptance-Based Behavior Therapy (ABBT), to improve HIV patients' commitment to medical
      care.

      The purpose of the proposed project is to establish the efficacy of ABBT and examine its
      mechanisms of action. To achieve the specific aims, the investigators will conduct a
      randomized clinical trial (n = 270), with two treatment arms: ABBT vs. an attention-matched
      HIV education control condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drop-out rates from medical clinics in the first months following linkage to HIV care are as
      high as 50%, with 31-46% of patients dropping out after the first visit. People Living with
      HIV (PLWH) who are not consistently retained in care are at risk for: delayed antiretroviral
      treatment (ART) initiation, reduced ART adherence, unsuppressed viremia, and mortality.
      Moreover, poor retention means effective ART cannot be leveraged to prevent further HIV
      transmission. The objective of this study is to conduct a fully powered, randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of a brief, 2-session acceptance-based
      behavioral therapy (ABBT) intervention to enhance retention in HIV care.

      The aims of this proposal are: (1) To test, in a 2-arm RCT, the efficacy of the ABBT
      intervention on retention in care and virologic suppression (primary outcomes); and, ART
      adherence, disclosure of HIV status, perceived social support, HIV stigmatization (secondary
      outcomes), relative to an Enhanced-Treatment-as-Usual condition; and, (2) To examine the
      degree to which retention in HIV care and virologic suppression are mediated by (a) increased
      HIV acceptance (and decreased HIV experiential avoidance) and (b) increased willingness to
      disclose HIV status. The sample will consist of 270 HIV patients who are new to care.

    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Objective data from participants' electronic health records will be obtained to examine how many medical appointments they attended in the past year at their HIV treatment clinic. Participants will be deemed as sufficiently retained if they attend at least 3 medical visits during this period.</description>

    <description>Objective data from participants' electronic health records will be obtained to examine their viral load, which is a blood-based measure of the amount of HIV viruses in the person's body. If participants are not currently retained in medical care and blood sample results are not available in their electronic health record, they will submit 1-3ml of blood at each assessment through the study's research phlebotomist.</description>

    <measure>Self-Rating Scale Item (SRSI) - Antiretroviral Treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report data of participants' HIV antiretroviral treatment adherence will be obtained with the SRSI. Scores range from 0 to 5, which correspond to &quot;very poor&quot; to &quot;excellent&quot; medication adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Brief HIV Disclosure and Safer Sex Self-Efficacy Scales (BHD)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BHD HIV disclosure subscale will be used to assess for willingness to make informed disclosure and for actual disclosure of HIV status. Scores range from 8-32, with higher scores indicating increased willingness to disclose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MSPSS will be used to measure perceived social support. Scores range from 1-84, with higher scores indicating greater perceived social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV Stigma Scale (HSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HSS will be used to measure self-reported experiences, fear, and perception of stigmatization due to being HIV+. Scores range from 6-24, with lower scores indicating less fear or concern about stigmatization.</description>

    <description>Acceptance-Based Behavior Therapy (ABBT) In the first session, the interventionist will introduce the concept of acceptance and its possible benefits in the context of life values and participant-identified barriers to retention in care. Interventionists will help participants identify potential challenges to acceptance, including disclosure concerns. At the second session, participants will practice acceptance-based coping skills and a behavioral plan will be developed to target barriers identified in the first session. These discussions will help the participant clarify how best to align their values with decisions on how to manage their HIV.</description>
