  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurocognitive disorder associated with dementia,
      with a constantly increasing prevalence associated with an aging population. Amyloid
      deposition is considered as the first molecular event on the onset of Alzheimer's disease. It
      has already been demonstrated that low-dose radiotherapy is capable of reducing Alzheimer's
      disease-associated amyloid-β plaques and improving cognitive function in an animal model. In
      human, low-dose radiotherapy has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing bronchial
      amyloidosis.

      The present study aims to conduct research by including 10 patients with a diagnosis of mild
      or moderately severe Alzheimer's disease and with evidence of amyloid pathology. Furthermore,
      the aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of low-dose radiotherapy in reducing amyloid
      deposits in the human brain using molecular imaging (Flutemetamol(18F) PET) along with
      treatment of the specific target.

      The investigators decided to use fractionated whole brain radiation doses of 1.8 Gy x 5 and
      1.8 Gy x 3. Subjects will be followed with neurocognitive testing at 6 months post
      radiotherapy.

      subjects 1-5 - 9Gy in 5 daily fractions

      subjects 6-10 - 5.4Gy in 3 daily fractions
