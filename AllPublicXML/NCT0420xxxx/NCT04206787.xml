  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to observe the sequential strategy with afatinib as first-line treatment and
      to find the optimal treatment strategy for long-term chemotherapy-free regimens in Chinese
      patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, this study can also assess the
      effectiveness and safety of afatinib as first-line treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR
             sensitive mutation positive

          -  Patients who will initiate afatinib as first-line treatment for EGFR mutation-positive
             NSCLC

          -  Male and female patients with age ≥18 years

          -  Written informed consent per local regulatory requirement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received previous systemic therapy (previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant
             therapies are permitted)

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases (patients with brain metastases, who were
             previously treated, are eligible provided they have asymptomatic brain metastasis for
             at least 4 weeks on stable doses of medication) at the start of afatinib treatment

          -  Patients with concurrent participation in an interventional oncology clinical trial
             during the first-line treatment phase or within the last 30 days prior to the
             first-line treatment phase. If patients join another interventional study during the
             period of second-line treatment or later-line treatment, this patient should not be
             excluded from this study
