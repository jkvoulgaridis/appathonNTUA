  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the impact of an intervention, known as SNAPS, to expand
      Preexposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) prescriptions at Health + Hospitals (H+H)/Bellevue. In
      addition, evaluating whether this intervention, ie SNAPS, helps patients get on PrEP and stay
      on PrEP to prevent STIs like HIV. PrEP is a medication that needs to be taken on a regular
      basis in order to be effective to prevent HIV transmission.

      The objective of the investigator's proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of an
      intervention to (1) increase PrEP initiation overall, (2) increase uptake among groups
      disproportionately impacted by the HIV pandemic, and (3) to preserve high PrEP retention
      while expanding use. In addition, the proposal includes innovative secondary outcomes of (4)
      identifying barriers and facilitators of PrEP use that may be unique to urban safety-net
      populations, and (5) estimating the HIV infections averted due to greater PrEP uptake from
      the intervention.

      The intervention is multi-level yet, targets the &quot;weakest chains in the link&quot; of PrEP
      initiation at safety-net hospitals designed for scalability, sustainability, and
      implementability across a wide range of settings. It consists of Surveillance by STI testing,
      Navigation by unannounced patient navigators to the Sexual Health Clinic (SHC), Accelerated
      follow-up with providers with PrEP expertise, Point-of-care PrEP counseling and laboratory
      testing, and Seamless, consistent, longitudinal, comprehensive care (SNAPS).

    <description>The intervention is multi-level yet, targets the &quot;weakest chains in the link&quot; of PrEP initiation at safety-net hospitals designed for scalability, sustainability, and implementability across a wide range of settings. It consists of Surveillance by STI testing, Navigation by unannounced patient navigators to the Sexual Health Clinic (SHC), Accelerated follow-up with providers with PrEP expertise, Point-of-care PrEP counseling and laboratory testing, and Seamless, consistent, longitudinal, comprehensive care (SNAPS). SNAPS will selectively target those care settings where PrEP prescribing is particularly rare or absent (eg, OB/GYN). Study team will utilize a quasi- experimental design to compare rates of PrEP uptake overall, PrEP initiation in disproportionately-impacted groups, and PrEP retention pre-versus post-initiation of SNAPS, controlling for secular trends.</description>
