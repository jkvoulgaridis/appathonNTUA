  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this formative research is to examine whether, and in what
      combination, contingency management (CM) and motivational interviewing (MI) can facilitate
      entry of stimulant-using men who have sex with men (MSM) into the pre-exposure prophylaxis
      (PrEP) care continuum.

      In Stage 1, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) three months of CM; or 2)
      four sessions of MI. All participants will be assessed at three months post-randomization for
      non-response. In Stage 2, a second randomization where non-responders are assigned to: 1)
      Switch to sequentially receive the other intervention (i.e., CM+MI or MI+CM); or 2) Continue
      with assessments only (i.e., CM-Only or MI-Only). All participants will complete a final
      assessment at 6 months.
