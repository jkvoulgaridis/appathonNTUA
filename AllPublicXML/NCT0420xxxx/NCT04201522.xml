  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise intolerance is one of the key disabling factors in patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). Although multifactorial, exercise intolerance involves
      physiological interactions between respiratory and locomotor muscles that may contribute to
      further reducing exercise tolerance in COPD. The respiratory muscle work during exercise is
      closely related to breathing and could induce respiratory muscle fatigue in patients with
      COPD.

      Respiratory muscle training is an intervention strategy that is sometimes proposed for some
      patients with COPD, especially whose with inspiratory muscle weakness. It was reported that
      inspiratory muscle training improves inspiratory muscle endurance and strength, dyspnea and
      exercise tolerance. There are two types of inspiratory muscle training, inspiratory muscle
      training against a resistive loading and normocapnic hyperpnoea. The advantage of normocapnic
      hyperpnoea compared to resistive training is the possibility to simulate the exercise
      ventilation level while maintaining stable the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide
      and end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide and to solicit the inspiratory and expiratory
      muscles together, which could increase respiratory muscle tolerance and avoid their fatigue
      during whole-body exercise.

      Therefore, the aim of this project is to study the effect of normocapnic hyperpnoea training
      on exercise tolerance in patients with COPD.

      We hypothesize that greater improvement in cycling exercise tolerance will be observed
      following 6-weeks normocapnic hyperpnoea training compared to a sham intervention in patients
      with COPD.
