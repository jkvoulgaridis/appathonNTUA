    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that dupilumab treatment improves
      exercise capacity in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To demonstrate that dupilumab treatment increases physical activity of daily living in
           patients with moderate-to-severe asthma

        -  To demonstrate that dupilumab treatment improves pre- and post-exercise lung function in
           patients with moderate-to-severe asthma

          -  Stable background therapy for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥4 weeks prior to
             the baseline visit of a medium-to-high dose ICS [fluticasone &gt;250 to 1000 μg BID or
             equivalent] in combination with at least a second controller medication (eg,
             long-acting beta agonist [LABA], long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], leukotriene
             receptor antagonist [LTRA], theophylline, etc.); a third controller is allowed and
             with the same stabilization requirements

          -  Blood eosinophil count ≥300 cells/μL or on maintenance OCS at the screening visit

          -  ACQ-5 score ≥1.5 at the screening and baseline visits

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index &gt;35 kg/m2 at screening

          -  Current smoking, vaping or tobacco chewing or cessation of any of these within 6
             months prior to randomization, or &gt;10 pack years smoking history
