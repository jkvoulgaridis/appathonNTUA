  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines feasibility of R&amp;D activities in the planned randomized controlled trial
      where effectiveness of somatocognitive therapy intervention will be compared to treatment as
      usual in provoked vestibulodynia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Provoked vestibulodynia is a multifactorial, persistent pain condition, affecting young
      women. It represents the most common cause of pain during sexual intercourse. Existing
      treatment approaches are predominantly based on clinical experience, observational studies,
      or reports of expert committees. Although, physiotherapy is one of the most commonly
      recommended treatments, high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to assess its
      effectiveness.

      This is a phase I, feasibility study with the purpose of testing R&amp;D activities for a planned
      full size RCT. Additionally, patients experiences with the somatocognitive therapy
      intervention, assessment measures and condition itself will be collected using qualitative
      interviews. The results will be applied to adjust time-line of the treatment, outcome
      measures and therapeutic approach before commencing full scale RCT.

    <description>Participants perform Tampon test 3 times in course of 14 days (day1, 7 and 14) at each of the 3 time points (baseline, post-treatment, 8 months after baseline), 9 scores in total. Numerical rating scale (0-10) will be used to score pain intensity. Intra-individual score variance will be estimated as difference between the min and max score at each time point for every participant. Lower variability is better.</description>

    <description>All participants are asked in individual qualitative interviews if they experience a Tampon test as a relevant instrument for assessing pain sensitivity experienced during intercourse.</description>

    <measure>Implementation and acceptability of the somatocogntive therapy intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked in qualitative interviews about their experiences with somatocogntitve therapy intervention. Global Rating of Change scale will be used to provide quantitative estimation of participants' satisfaction with the treatment effect directly after treatment and at 8 months follow-up. The scale ranges from 1 to 6. Score of 1 means that treatment helped a lot and the score of 6 means that the treatment made the condition much worse.</description>

    <description>Somatocognitive physiotherapy (SCT) is a multimodal physical therapy approach that has been developed in an attempt at alleviating the burden of longstanding pain. The main foci of SCT include: (1) bodily exercises and techniques increasing body awareness, ability to relax and control muscle tension in different situations; (2) education about the vulvodynia and factors influencing pain experience; (3) coping with emotions and thoughts related to bodily experiences; and (4) structured homework assignments promoting application of the learned techniques in daily situation and gradual exposure to activities associated with pain. An important goal of SCT is to facilitate integration of new bodily habits into the patient`s daily activities. The most important learning process thus occurs in the space between the treatment sessions. The therapeutic techniques are to be rehearsed in everyday situations.</description>
