      1. Patients The study included 30 patients with chronic kidney failure on dialysis
           treatment at the Center for Nephrology and Dialysis of the Clinical Center Kragujevac.
           Inclusion criteria were: regular dialysis treatment for more than 3 months, 3 times a
           week and hemoglobin values lower than 110g / L. Exclusion criteria were: hemoglobin
           values lower than 80g/L, the use of antioxidant and immunosuppressive therapy,
           uncontrolled malignancies, proven active bleeding and presence of systemic inflammation
           or active infection.

        2. Ethical approval The research was conducted with respect to the Helsinki Declaration on
           Medical Research, the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Center Kragujevac
           No 01-14-3039. All subjects provided written informed consent before study enrollment.

        3. Used plant extract Standardized Aronia extract (SAE) is official product of
           pharmaceutical company Pharmanova (Belgrade, Serbia); nevertheless, procedure of
           extraction was done by EU-Chem company (Belgrade, Serbia). This product contains
           400mg/30ml of polyphenols, while the recommended daily dosage is 30ml.

        4. Blood sampling Patients included in the study consumed standardized Aronia melanocarpa
           extract (30ml/day) for 30 days. On the day 0, before SAE consumption, blood samples from
           all patients were collected for hematologic analyzes, inflammation parameters, oxidative
           stress parameters and antioxidant protection before the dialysis procedure. All
           mentioned parameters were determined again after consuming the product, ie. on the 30th
           day of the study.

        5. Analytic Procedures Venous blood samples (2 x 4.5ml) were taken before the start of
           supplementation (zero day) and at the end of supplementation (30th day). Vacuum tubes
           with sodium citrate were used for blood sampling. The first sample was used for routine
           hematologic analyzes, the second sample was used for plasma and erythrocyte lysate
           extraction in order to determinate redox and inflammatory status.

        6. Evaluation of Systemic Redox State Plasma samples were used for determination of the
           levels of the following pro-oxidants: superoxide anion radical (O2−), hydrogen peroxide
           (H2O2), nitrites (NO2−) and index of lipid peroxidation measured as thiobarbituric acid
           reactive substances (TBARS), while the parameters of antioxidative defence system, such
           as activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and level of reduced
           glutathione (GSH) were determined in erythrocytes lysates samples.

           A) Index of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) determination The degree of lipid peroxidation in
           the plasma samples was estimated by measuring TBARS, using 1% thiobarbituric acid in
           0.05 NaOH, which was incubated with the sample at 100°C for 15 min and measured at 530
           nm. TBA extract was obtained by combining 0.8 ml sample and 0.4 ml trichloro acetic acid
           (TCA); afterwards, the samples were put on ice for 10 min and centrifuged for 15 min at
           6000 rpm. (1).

           b) Nitrite determination (NO2-)

           Nitric oxide (NO) decomposes rapidly to form stable nitrite/nitrate products. The NO2−
           level was measured and used as an index of NO production, using Griess's reagent. For
           NO2 − determination in plasma 0.1 ml 3 N PCA (perchloride acid), 0.4 ml 20 mM
           ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.2 ml plasma were put on ice for 15 min,
           then centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 rpm. After pouring off the supernatant, 220 μl K2CO3
           was added. Nitrites were measured at 550 nm. (2)

             1. Superoxide anion radical determination (O2-)

                Superoxide anion radical concentrations in plasma samples were measured using the
                NTB (Nitro Blue Tetrazolium) reagent in TRIS buffer (assay mixture). The
                measurement was performed at a wavelength of 530 nm. (3).

             2. Hydrogen peroxide determination (H2O2)

                The measurement of H2O2 was based on the oxidation of phenol red by H2O2 in a
                reaction catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase. Two hundred microlitres of perfusate
                or plasma was precipitated using 800 mL of freshly prepared phenol red solution; 10
                μL of (1:20) horseradish peroxidase (made immediately before use) was subsequently
                added. The level of H2O2 was measured at 610 nm (4).

             3. Determination of reduced glutathione (GSH)

                The level of reduced glutathione (GSH) was determined based on GSH oxidation via
                5,5-dithiobis-6,2-nitrobenzoic acid. GSH extract was obtained by combining 0.1 ml
                0.1% EDTA, 400 μl hemolysate, and 750 μl precipitation solution (containing 1.67 g
                metaphosphoric acid, 0.2 g EDTA, 30 g NaCl, and filled with distilled water until
                100 ml; the solution is stable for 3 weeks at +4C°). The level of GSH was measured
                at 420 nm (5).

             4. Determination of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT)

           Isolated RBCs were washed three times with three volumes of ice-cold 0.9 mmol/l NaCl,
           and hemolysates containing about 50 g Hb/l were used for the determination of CAT
           activity. CAT buffer, prepared hemolysate sample, and 10 mM H2O2 were used for CAT
           determination. Detection was performed at 360 nm. SOD activity was determined by the
           epinephrine method. Hemolysate was mixed with carbonate buffer, and then epinephrine was
           added. Detection was performed at 470 nm (6-10).

        7. Evaluation of the inflammatory status In order to evaluate the inflammatory status of
           patients, following parameters were measured at both points of interest (0 and 30th
           day): serum C-reactive protein concentration - CRP and tumor necrosis factor
           concentration - TNF-α.

           The serum C- reactive protein (CRP) concentration was determined by the turbidimetric
           method on the Olympus AU680. The normal serum CRP concentration is ≤ 5 mg/L.
           Microinflammation is defined as the concentration of CRP in the serum of 5 mg/L.

           Plasma TNF-α concentrations were determined by enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay
           (ELISA) using commercially available high sensitivity indirect sandwich enzyme-linked
           immunosorbent assay (Sigma Aldrich).

        8. Evaluation of the hematological parameters

           At both points of interest, the values of the following haematological parameters in all
           patients were analyzed:

           Erythrocytes (Er), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), erythrocyte index- mean
           corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin
           concentration (MCHC), serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration (LDH), serum haptoglobin
           concentration and iron status: serum iron concentration, ferritin; total iron binding
           capacity (TIBC), unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), transferrin saturation
           (TSAT), haptoglobin.

        9. Statistical Analysis IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 Desktop for Windows was used for
           statistical analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check the distribution of data.
           Statistical comparisons were performed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
           tests with a Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparisons, in the case of normal
           distribution of data between groups, while Kruskal-Wallis was used for comparison
           between groups where the distribution of data was different than normal. Values of p &lt;
           0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
