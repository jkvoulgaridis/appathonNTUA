  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open-label study to determine the safety and efficacy of
      β-globin restored autologous hematopoietic stem cells in β- thalassemia major patients with
      CVS-654 mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      β-globin restored autologous hematopoietic stem cells will be manufactured using Crispr/Cas9
      gene editing system. Subject participation for this study will be 1 year. Subjects who enroll
      in this study will be asked to participate in a subsequent long-term follow up study that
      will monitor the safety and efficacy of the treatment they receive for up to 15 years
      post-transplant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  5-15 years old. Clinically diagnosed as β-thalassemia major with IVS-654 gene mutation
             phenotype;

          -  Subjects or at least one legal guardian/agent understand and voluntarily sign informed
             consent.

          -  Subjects with no affection with EBV, HIV, CMV, TP, HAV, HBV and HCV.

          -  Subjects body condition

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Subjects acceptable for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and have an
        available fully matched related donor.

        Active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. Treated with erythropoietin prior 3 months.
        Immediate family member with any known hematological tumor. Subjects with severe
        psychiatric disorders to be unable to cooperate. Recently diagnosed as malaria. History of
        complex autoimmune disease. Persistent aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase
        (ALT), or total bilirubin value &gt;3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN).

        Subjects with severe heart, lung and kidney diseases. With serious iron overload. Any other
        condition that would render the subject ineligible for HSCT, as determined by the attending
        transplant physician or Investigator.

        Subjects who are receiving treatment from another clinical study, or have received another
        gene therapy.

        Subjects or guardians had resisted the guidance of the attending doctor. Subjects whom the
        investigators do not consider appropriate for participating in this clinical study.
