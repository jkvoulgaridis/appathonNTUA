      Prospective registry study of endoscopic submucosal injection of indocyanine green before
      laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To observe the imaging result of endoscopic submucosal injection of indocyanine green before
      laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer, and analyze the relevant factors, so as
      to guide the submucosal injection of preoperative indocyanine green better.

      This study is prospective and observational. In order to analyze the related factors that
      affect the imaging effect, we enrolled patients who were to undergo indocyanine green
      fluorescence imaging for laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer.

    <description>The imaging effect was evaluated by indocyanine green fluorescence imaging system during the operation. According to the imaging effect, it can be divided into local imaging and lymphatic drainage imaging. Tumor body: 0, no imaging; 1, full imaging; 2, diffuse imaging, overflow, interference with other areas of observation. Lymph drainage area imaging 0, no imaging; 1, full imaging; 2, diffuse imaging, overflow, interference with other areas of observation.</description>

    <description>Indocyanine green was injected under endoscope within 24 hours before operation. Four points were evenlyinjected in four quadrants at the edge of the tumor. The patients with obstruction were injected at two points on the anal side of the tumor. The diluted concentration of indocyanine green was 0.625mg/ml or 1.25mg/ml. The injection method was direct submucosal injection and sandwich method. According to the imaging effect, it can be divided into local imaging and lymphatic drainage imaging. Tumor body: 0, no imaging; 1, full imaging; 2, diffuse imaging, overflow, interference with other areas of observation. Lymph drainage area imaging 0, no imaging; 1, full imaging; 2, diffuse imaging, overflow, interference with other areas of observation.</description>
