    <textblock>
      This pilot trial study uses a structural support program for adoption of cancer screening
      interventions at a rural community-based organization. Rural communities face unique barriers
      in implementation of evidence-based interventions due to a lack of infrastructure, community
      capacity, and expertise as academic and research centers are often clustered in urban areas.
      The support program may help a rural community-based organization select, adapt, and
      implement cancer prevention and control evidence-based interventions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Develop the content of the structural program focused on facilitating the selection,
      adaptation, and implementation of cancer prevention and control evidence-based interventions.

      II. Conduct a training program to assist one rural community-based organization to select,
      adapt, and implement evidence-based interventions to promote cancer screening.

      III. Examine the impact of the evidence-based intervention on intention to get screened for
      cancer via pre/post pilot trial design.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Objective II COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION: Located in the Yakima Valley of Washington
             State

          -  Objective II COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION: Serve community members who are 18 and
             older

          -  Objective II COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION: Willing to commit to the 6-month program

          -  Objective II PARTICIPANTS: Receiving services from the recruited community-based
             organization

          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: Not up-to-date for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer
             screening according to current U.S. Preventive Services Tasks Force (USPSTF)
             guidelines. The current USPSTF recommendations for breast, cervical, and colorectal
             cancer are:

               -  Breast Cancer Screening: Women ages 50-74 should be screened for breast cancer
                  with mammography every 2 years.

               -  Cervical Cancer Screening: Women ages 21-29 should be screened for cervical
                  cancer every 3 years with cervical cancer cytology alone. For women ages 30-65,
                  the USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every
                  5 years or every 5 years with high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing in
                  combination of cytology.

               -  Colorectal Cancer Screening: Individuals ages 50-75 should be screened for
                  colorectal cancer with guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) or fecal
                  immunochemical test (FIT) once a year, or colonoscopy every 10 years (USPSTF
                  approves additional screening tests, but these are the most commonly used).

          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects breast cancer
             screening, we will recruit women ages 50-74.

          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects cervical
             cancer screening, we will recruit women ages 21-65.

          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects colorectal
             cancer screening, we will recruit women and men ages 50-75.

          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: Average risk for breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer
