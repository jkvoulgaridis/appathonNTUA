  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a brief telephonic health coaching intervention to improve adherence to
      positive airway pressure therapy for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will carry out a pilot study in which patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive health coaching or usual care. Participants are English- and Spanish-speaking
      patients from a county-based public health system who have received a positive airway
      pressure device for the treatment of sleep apnea. An unlicensed, trained health coach will
      call patients three times to resolve barriers to adherence. Primary outcomes include both
      adherence measures collected by the device modem at baseline and 4 months, and
      patient-reported outcomes such as daytime sleepiness.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients are randomly assigned to receive health coaching or usual care. Patients assigned to usual care have access to all existing resources, including technical support from durable medical equipment providers, respiratory therapist visits with the Sleep Clinic, group visits, or visits with their primary care provider. Patients in the health coaching arm have access to all usual care resources. In addition, they will be assigned an unlicensed, trained health coach who will call them up to five times to identify and resolve barriers to adherence, including lack of understanding of their condition or the treatment, discomfort in acclimating to treatment, technical difficulties in mask fit or device settings, and challenges in navigating durable medical equipment providers.</intervention_model_description>
