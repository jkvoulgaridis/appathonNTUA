  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The guideline requires clinical works to screen for primary aldosteronism(PA) in young adults
      with family history of stroke at early onset. But the prevalence of PA in young adults with
      stroke onset before 45 years old had never been investigated. The study aimed to discover the
      prevalence as well as the clinical characteristics between patients with PA and those without
      PA during stroke attack. In order to fulfill this objective, investigators intended to
      conduct a cross-sectional study by taking screening and confirmatory tests among young adults
      who once admitted due to early onset of acute stroke.
