  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with MPS IIIA have a clinical disorder marked by severe and progressive brain
      disease and neurological symptoms due to the accumulation of undigested glycosaminoglycans in
      all cells of the body.

      This study will be the first in human clinical trial to explore the safety, tolerability and
      clinical efficacy of ex vivo gene therapy (autologous CD34+ cells transduced with a
      lentiviral vector containing the human SGSH gene) in MPSIIIA patients. Following treatment
      with the gene therapy patients will be followed up for a minimum of 3 years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPS IIIA is caused by a deficiency of the heparan-N-sulfatase (SGSH) enzyme, leading to the
      accumulation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate in the lysosomes. Untreated patients
      of MPS IIIA experience rapid and progressive neurologic deterioration. To date, there is no
      effective disease-modifying treatment for patients suffering from MPS IIIA.

      This study aims to recruit 3 to 5 patients with MPS IIIA who satisfy the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and provide full consent, between 3 months and 24 months of age. The
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be a cell-based gene therapy that uses
      genetically modified autologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells transduced with a lentiviral
      vector containing the human SGSH gene. Patients will be followed up for a minimum of 3 years
      after gene therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has received stem cell, gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy (any

          6. The subject is currently receiving psychotropic or other medications which, in the
             CI's opinion, would be likely to substantially confound test results.

             neurodevelopmental testing.

         13. Severe behavioural disturbances due to reasons other than MPS IIIA and likely to
