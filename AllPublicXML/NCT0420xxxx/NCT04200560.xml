  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is inevitable and is the primary risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. The
      molecular mechanisms that drive vascular dysfunction in the context of aging are incompletely
      understood. The overall hypothesis is that the age-related decline in endothelial cell (EC)
      autophagy leads to arterial dysfunction. This study will determine whether physiological
      shear-stress affects autophagosome formation and nitrous oxide (NO) generation in ECs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that genetic autophagy suppression prevents shear-stress induced
      purinergic signaling to endothelial nitrous oxide synthase (eNOS) and this pathway will be
      evaluated in primary arterial ECs obtained from older adult (&gt; 60 years) and adult (18-30
      years) subjects before and following rhythmic handgrip exercise that elevates brachial artery
      shear-rate similarly in both groups. ECs will be used to quantify markers of EC autophagy,
      eNOS activation, and NO generation. The study will also determine whether exercise-training
      attenuates the aging-associated decline in EC autophagy, and whether intact autophagy is
      required for training-induced vascular improvements. To evaluate this potential, it will be
      determined whether one-limb rhythmic handgrip exercise training by older adult (&gt; 60 y) human
      subjects is sufficient to elevate basal and shear-induced EC autophagy initiation, eNOS
      activation, and NO generation vs. the contralateral sedentary limb. Results from this work
      have tremendous potential to reveal a new therapeutic target and approach for restoring /
      maintaining vascular function in the aging population.
