      RATIONALE: heat shock protein gp96-peptide complex made from a person's tumor cells may help
      the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      Overall Goals:

      - to evaluate the safety and induction of anti-tumor immunity by administration of an
      immunogenic human tumor cell vaccine, and assess immune response in relation to clinical
      outcome.

      Primary Aim:

      - to further evaluate effectiveness of autologous gp96 treatment of liver cancer on the basis
      of preliminary work.

      Secondary Aims:

      to study the immune response to vaccination, to monitor clinical responses , to further the
      safety of vaccine.
