      To compare a complex induction multimodality protocol (ESPATUE) + concurrent immunotherapy
      with PD-L1 antibody Durvalumab given every three weeks to the same induction multimodality
      protocol without Durvalumab immunotherapy induction followed by definitive local treatment
      (surgery for those considered resectable or chemoradiation boost for those not considered to
      be R0-resectable) followed by consolidation Durvalumab treatment in both arms.

             Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to
             90 days after the last dose of IP.
