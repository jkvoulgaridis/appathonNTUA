  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autonomic neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Symptoms from
      cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy include, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension and
      insufficient heart rate and blood pressure (BP) regulation during physical exertion. The
      degree of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is most commonly measured as cardiac autonomic
      neuropathy based on at least two abnormal cardiac reflex tests, which primarily measures
      parasympathetic indices of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).

      Few measures are available for quantifying the sympathetic/adrenergic branch of the ANS.

      Circadian changes in BP is a documented measure of BP variability, regulated centrally by a
      multitude of centers. A growing number of studies indicate that a diminished BP variability
      is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and injury. The ANS plays a pivotal role in
      the execution of these circadian BP changes, mainly through sympathetic adrenergic nerve
      fibers

      Few studies have investigated the applicability of 24-hour indices as predictor for autonomic
      adrenergic dysfunction. No previous studies have investigated the association between
      clinical markers of adrenergic function, and 24-hour blood pressure indices in type 2
      diabetes.
