  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obtain real world, post market data to confirm the clinical improvement and safety in
      patients treated with a single injection of MONOVISC for the symptomatic relief of
      osteoarthritis in the hip joint.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) multi-center, open-label study
      to evaluate the residual risk of injections of MONOVISC for relief of pain in patients with a
      diagnosis of an osteoarthritic hip joint.

      The subjects in this study will be patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritic (OA) joint who
      the investigator determines are appropriate candidates for treatment with a viscoelastic
      injection of MONOVISC.

      Up to 25 subjects will be enrolled at up to 20 investigational sites in the EU. Subject
      participation will last approximately 6 Months, with visits scheduled at Screening, Baseline,
      1 month, 3 month and 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 35 kg/m2

          3. Diagnosis of symptomatic osteoarthritic joint in the index joint (Kellgren-Lawrence
             grade I to III) to be treated with MONOVISC injection.

          4. Failed conservative treatment for joint osteoarthritis.

          5. NRS pain on walking ≥4 and ≤ 9 in index joint.

          6. Subject must be willing to abstain from other treatments of the index joint for the
             duration of the study.

          7. Subject is willing to discontinue all analgesics including NSAIDs, except
             acetaminophen/paracetamol, at least seven days before the treatment injection and
             through the completion of the study.

          8. Subject is willing to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to a maximum of 4.0 grams
             per day per the package insert) for the treatment of joint pain for the duration of
             the study. At least forty-eight hours prior to the Baseline Visit and each follow-up
             visit, the subject is willing to discontinue use of acetaminophen/paracetamol.

          9. Subject is willing to maintain a stable dose of oral glucosamine and/or chondroitin
             sulfate products throughout the study, if taken prior to signing the informed consent
             form (ICF).

         10. Able and willing to provide signed informed consent.

         14. Subject has significant varus or valgus deformity greater than 10 degrees in either
             knee.

         15. Subject requires consistent use of an assistive device (e.g. wheelchair, walker, etc.)
             Occasional use of a cane is acceptable.
