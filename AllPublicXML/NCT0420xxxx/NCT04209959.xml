    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common tachyarrhythmias with substantial
      morbidity, disability and mortality. It is estimated that the number of patients with AF is
      expected to reach 7 million by 2050. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) are the
      effective treatment for patients with drug-refractory symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent
      AF. However, the successful rate of RFCA for persistent AF during the first procedure still
      relatively low, the investigators also need pharmacological cardioversion or external
      electrical conversion. Several studies showed intravenous nifekalant injection after RFCA
      provided relative high rate of sinus conversion during catheter ablation in paroxysmal or
      persistent AF. Nevertheless, there is still no acceptable universal opinion on which dosage
      of nifekalant is preferable for converting AF during the operation. In order to address this
      issue, the investigators initiated the study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different
      doses of intravenous nifekalant injection in the rapid cardioversion of persistent AF during
      radiofrequency catheter ablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common tachyarrhythmias with substantial
      morbidity, disability and mortality. Its prevalence increases with advanced age. About one
      percent of patients suffering from AF are younger than sixty years, twelve percent are
      between seventy-five and eighty-five years, and about thirty-three percent are older than
      eighty years. It is estimated that the number of patients with AF is expected to reach 7
      million by 2050. At present, the medical anti-arrhythmic therapy and radiofrequency ablation
      have been as important treatment for patients with AF. Compared with the treatment of
      anti-arrhythmia therapy, radiofrequency ablation could significantly improve the rate of
      long-term AF-free survival. Thus, radiofrequency ablation has become the radical method for
      patients suffering AF.

      However, the successful rate of first radiofrequency ablation for patients with persistent AF
      was only about 65%. Due to low sinus maintenance rate after catheter ablation,
      anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) or external electric cardioversion was used to converting atrial
      fibrillation during the procedure. Compared with traditional AADs for pharmacologic
      cardioversion, such as quinidine, propafenone and amiodarone, nifekalant is a new class III
      AADs for rapid cardioversion of persistent AF during radiofrequency ablation, and its
      prevalence of AF termination during procedure was approximately 64.6%. Nevertheless, the
      efficacy and safety of different doses of intravenous nifekalant injection in the rapid
      cardioversion of persistent AF during radiofrequency catheter ablation has not been tested in
      large, randomized, controlled trials, and guidelines provide no clear consensus regarding the
      best dose recommended.

      In order to address this issue, the investigators initiated the study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of different doses of intravenous nifekalant injection in the rapid
      cardioversion of persistent AF during radiofrequency catheter ablation.

    <description>Nifekalant was randomly given intravenously as a loading dose of 0.3 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, or 0.5 mg/kg for five minutes without the continuous infusion for all study population, while blood pressure, surface electrocardiograms (ECG), intracardiac electrograms were monitored for half an hour. While nifekalant was given intravenously, QT interval, QTc interval and RR interval were recorded at 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30minutes, respectively, because drug action almost disappeared within 30minutes since a single dose of intravenous nifekalant injection. These doses of nifekalant were determined based on the results of the previous study and the medicine operation instruction. Once AF continued after administration or Torsade de points was observed, external electrical cardioversion was given immediately.</description>
