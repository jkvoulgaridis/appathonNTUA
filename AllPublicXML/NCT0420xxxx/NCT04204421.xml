  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Reliable patient reported outcome measures (PROM's) for symptom assessment in functional
      dyspepsia (FD) are essential in order to evaluate dyspeptic symptoms, identify potential
      symptom triggers and optimize therapeutic strategies, since biological markers are
      unavailable. Currently used symptom assessment methods, i.e. end-of-day or end-of-week
      questionnaires, have considerable limitations. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM), an
      electronic questioning method characterized by random and repeated, momentary assessments in
      the subject's current state and environment, might overcome these limitations. The aim of
      this study is to assess the validity and reliability of an FD-specific electronic
      patient-reported outcome measure (ePRO), based on the Experience Sampling Method-principle,
      for symptom assessment and identification of symptom triggers in patients with functional
      dyspepsia.

      Objective:

      The aim of this study is to assess the validity and reliability of an FD-specific electronic
      patient-reported outcome measure (ePRO), based on the Experience Sampling Method-principle,
      for symptom assessment and identification of symptom triggers in patients with functional
      dyspepsia. In order to measure this, internal consistency, test-retest reliability,
      concurrent validity and the accuracy to differentiate between dyspeptic patients and healthy
      controls of the developed ePRO will be assessed. In addition, to objectify specific triggers
      for the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms in dyspepsia, using the FD-specific ESM tool.
