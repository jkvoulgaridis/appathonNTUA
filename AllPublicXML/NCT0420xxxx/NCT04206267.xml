  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether vibrational applications, as an adjunct to
      orthodontic forces, increases the rate of tooth movement in patients with fixed orthodontic
      appliances.

      Nineteen patients who had class 2 division 1 malocclusion or severe crowding and needed first
      premolar extractions as a treatment modality were included to the study. The patients were
      divided into two groups, 8 in control and 11 in the study. The subjects assigned to study
      group were applied suplementary vibrational forces for 20 min/daily. 3-dimensional digital
      models were generated just before canine distalization and after space closure by 3Shape
      TRİOS R700 (3Shape Inc., Copenhagen, Denmark) device. The linear measurements between molars
      and canines were evaluated. The results were assessed with SPSS 23.0 programme (lBM SPSS
      Statistics for Windows, NY, USA). The amount of tooth movement for all samples were measured
      twice by the responsible investigator at one week interval. Interclass correlation
      coefficient-ICC was used to asses intraobserver accuracy and reliability.Mann- Whitney U test
      was used to assess treatment effect in terms of time to reach canine distalization.
      Correlation between measurements were described with Spearman Correlation Coefficient.
      Interclass correlation was 95%, which is in the range of excellent measurement agreement.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects were randomly allocated to either the AcceleDent group or the control group. The randomization was achieved by coin-tossing by one investigator. This method is equivalent to tossing a coin for each subject that enters a trial, such as Heads = control group, Tails = AcceleDent group.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>canine retraction rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>İnitial measurements were conducted after levelling stage and prior to retraction of the canine tooth. Linear measurements were performed between mesial edges of molar tubes and distal edges of canine brackets. Due to using TADs as direct anchorage it is considered that the molars remained constant during the retraction process. After retraction stage, measurements were performed between the mesial edges of the molar tubes and the distal edges of the canine brackets, and the monthly tooth movement rates were detected according to the difference between initial and second measurements.</description>
