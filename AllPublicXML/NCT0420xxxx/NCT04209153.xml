    <textblock>
      In summary, there are currently many therapeutic tools for achieving some degree of control
      or even cessation of tobacco addictive use. No single therapy seems to have proven itself
      sufficiently effective to be the preferred treatment axis in the management of this
      addiction. We can also point out that so far the main treatments aimed at reducing or
      controlling the craving phenomenon are of a pharmacological nature, thus exposing the
      participants to the side effects inherent to this type of treatment. In this perspective, the
      establishment of non invasive brain stimulation (TdCS), acting in a targeted manner on
      craving and whose effects would be mild and transient, appears quite justified, especially in
      addition to psychotherapy. In the context of the management of addictive pathologies, the
      choice of smoking dependence seems relevant to us insofar as this addiction represents a
      major public health problem.
