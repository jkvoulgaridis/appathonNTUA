  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the current leading cause of disability worldwide and
      adolescence is an especially vulnerable period for the onset of depression. Non-pharmacologic
      approaches are particularly attractive as treatment of adolescent depression due to the
      elevated risks of side effects related to the use of psychotropic drugs during development. A
      recent meta-analysis detected a positive and significant effect of non-deceptive placebos
      (open-label placebo, OLP) for a series of clinical conditions, including adult depression. To
      the investigators' knowledge, no studies of OLP have been conducted in depressed adolescents
      to date, although placebo response rates in adolescent depression are especially high,
      accounting for over 80% of the actual response to antidepressant treatment. The study's main
      objective is to estimate the effectiveness and understand the mechanism of OLP in depressed
      adolescents. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism by which OLP exerts its action in
      adolescent depression is by forming a positive expectation, which activates endogenous
      mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated neurotransmission in a network of regions implicated in
      emotion, stress regulation, and the pathophysiology of MDD, namely, the anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC) - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network. The hypothesis has been formulated on
      the basis of published research and preliminary data. The investigators will test the
      hypothesis by performing structural and functional neuroimaging in 60 untreated 13-18
      year-old adolescents with mild to moderate depression. The proposed research is significant,
      because it is expected to elucidate the mechanism of action of OLP and advance the
      understanding of the neural underpinnings of positive expectations in adolescent depression.

      This is a randomized controlled study to investigate non-deceptive placebos (open-label
      placebo, OLP) in depressed adolescents. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned
      to one of three groups: OLP with the 4-point rationale group (n=20), OLP without rationale
      group (n=20), and controls (n=20) who will receive the same level of supportive attention
      from the study clinician. MRI scanning and clinical assessments will be performed at the
      baseline and after the 2-week treatment or waiting period. The main objective here is to
      estimate the effectiveness and understand the mechanism of OLP in depressed adolescents. The
      central hypothesis is that the mechanism by which OLP exerts its action in adolescent
      depression is by forming a positive expectation, which activates endogenous mu-opioid
      receptor (MOR)-mediated neurotransmission in a network of regions implicated in emotion,
      stress regulation, and the pathophysiology of depression, namely, the anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC) - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network. The investigators plan to test the
      central hypothesis in 60 13-18 year-old adolescents with mild to moderate depression by
      pursuing the following Aims:

      AIM 1: To test the effectiveness of OLP in depressed adolescents. Depressed adolescents will
      be randomly assigned for two weeks to an OLP with the 4-point rationale group (n=20), OLP
      without rationale group (n=20), and controls (n=20) who will receive the same level of
      supportive attention from the study clinician. Hypothesis 1: The improvement in depression
      symptoms measured by the self-report Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS-2) in the OLP
      + rationale group (that combines conscious positive expectation with conditioned response to
      the ingestion of medication) will be higher than in the OLP without rationale group
      (conditioned response only) and controls. Positive expectation of recovery will be assessed
      before and after group assignment and accounted for in the analyses.

      AIM 2: To measure neural response to OLP. The OLP groups will receive the first dose of the
      OLP in the MRI scanner and changes in the cerebral blood perfusion (CBP) will be measured
      using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Mechanistically, the investigators expect that the
      MOR-mediated neurotransmission activated by placebo will be associated with a CBP increase,
      specifically: Hypothesis 2a: The CBP increase in the ACC - striato - amygdalo - thalamic
      network after the administration of the OLP + rationale to be higher than in the OLP group
      and controls. Hypothesis 2b: This CBP increase will correlate with the improvement in RADS-2
      scores after two weeks.

      AIM 3: To test neural network normalization in depressed adolescents (by comparing to the
      existing database of MRI scans of healthy teens). The second MRI will be performed after the
      two weeks. Mechanistically, the investigators expect that through the regular activation by
      OLP, myelination of the ACC - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network will increase, leading to
      a normalization of the previously demonstrated hypoconnectivity. Hypothesis 3: The increases
      in structural and functional connectivity of the ACC - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network
      after two weeks will correlate with decreases in RADS-2 depression total scores.

    <description>The investigators will be looking at changes in the RADS-2 scores scores. RADS-2 was selected as the primary clinical outcome measure because it is a widely used, well-established, and standardized self-report measure of adolescent depression. The RADS-2 has a possible range of 30 to 120. Higher scores represent higher levels of depression.</description>

    <description>In the OLP + rationale group, the participants will be prescribed to take placebos for 2 weeks with the standard 4-point accompanying rationale: (1) the placebo effect is powerful, e.g. in clinical trials placebos are roughly 80% as effective as antidepressants; (2) classical conditioning is a possible mechanism for automatic self-healing - meaning that the body can automatically respond to taking placebo pills like Pavlov's dogs who salivated when they heard a bell; (3) placebo-treated patients who are more compliant have better outcomes, therefore the placebos should be taken faithfully; and (4) positive expectations increase placebo effects, but it is OK to have doubts.</description>
