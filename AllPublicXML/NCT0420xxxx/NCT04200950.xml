    <textblock>
      Previse is a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system that predicts acute
      kidney injury (AKI). Previse uses machine learning methods and information drawn from the
      electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury; by doing
      so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse can give clinicians the
      time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the
      sequelae of AKI. It has been demonstrated in retrospective work that Previse can predict AKI
      with high accuracy at long prediction horizons, but the tool has yet to be validated in
      prospective settings; therefore, in this project, the clinical utility of Previse will be
      assessed through an individually randomized controlled multicenter trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as an individually randomized, controlled, and non-blinded multicenter
      prevention trial with a baseline period and a primary endpoint of proportion of patients
      meeting one or more criteria for the Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days (MAKE30)
      composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent creatinine elevation ≥ 200%
      of baseline, all censored at the first of hospital discharge or 30 days. The trial will
      evaluate the efficacy of a machine learning algorithm for AKI prediction, in approximately
      8,574 patients aged ≥ 18 years admitted to one of three participating study hospitals.
      Individual patient randomization will be performed at the time of the alert with a 1:1
      allocation ratio. Patients will be evaluated for inclusion in the trial upon admission, and
      will be automatically enrolled upon meeting inclusion criteria. Because data collection will
      be conducted through noninvasive procedures that are routinely employed in clinical practice,
      it will require a waiver of informed consent. Trial efficacy will be assessed at regularly
      scheduled study visits, and safety will be monitored on an ongoing basis for all patients.
      Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events, laboratory tests, vital
      signs, and physical examinations throughout the study. An independent Data Monitoring
      Committee (DMC) will be formed to assist in the periodic monitoring of safety, data quality,
      and integrity of study conduct. In addition, the DMC will review the interim efficacy
      analysis performed to determine whether the primary endpoint has been met. Total trial
      duration is expected to be approximately 12 months.
