  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Vitamin D has both direct effects on bone metabolism and an antimicrobial effect
      on periodontopathogens. It also inhibits inflammatory mediators that contribute to
      periodontal destruction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between
      serum 1.25-hydroxyvitamin D (1.25(OH)2D3) and 25(OH)D levels and periodontal inflammation.

      Methods. This study included 28 subjects with chronic gingivitis, 29 subjects with chronic
      periodontitis and 25 periodontally healthy subjects. Blood samples were collected from the
      participants to determine serum levels of 25(OH)D, 1.25(OH)2D3, tumour necrosis factor α
      (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Clinical parameters were
      recorded. Results were statistically analysed with a Shapiro-Wilk's test, Mann-Whitney U
      test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Wilcoxon test and post-hoc multiple comparison test.

      The subjects included in the study were selected from among patients who applied to our
      clinic, for routine periodontal examinations. Individuals who had been using
      immunosuppressive drugs and antibiotics for the past three months, smokers, individuals who
      had periodontal treatment within the past six months, and individuals with additional or
      supplementary vitamin D and systemic diseases were excluded from the study. In addition,
      since the region's level of sunlight exposure may have an effect on the level of vitamin D,
      participants were required to live in the region for the last five years.

      A total of 82 subjects, including 25 as a periodontally healthy control group, 28 with
      chronic gingivitis and 29 with chronic periodontitis, were included in the study. Clinical
      criteria for chronic periodontitis are the formation of plaque and calculus and ≥ 5 milimeter
      (mm) pocket depth or attachment loss in more than 30% of the teeth. Diagnosis criteria for
      chronic gingivitis are the formation of plaque and/or calculus in the mouth, bleeding, and no
      loss of pocket or attachment. The diagnosis criteria for periodontally healthy individuals
      are having clinically healthy periodontal tissues or minimal periodontal inflammation, with
      no loss of pocket or attachment.

    <description>Attachment loss and pocket depth were measured from the six surfaces of the teeth (buccal, palatal/lingual, mesiobuccal, mesiolingual, distobuccal and distolingual) except for the third molars. These values were calculated in millimeters (mm).</description>

    <description>Venous blood samples were collected from the patients on the examination day that were allowed to rest for half an hour and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Serum samples were separated into Eppendorf tubes and stored at -20°C until the experiment day. On the day of biochemical analysis, serum samples were thawed at room temperature and studied according to the manufacturer's instructions. TNF-a, 1,25(OH)2D3, IL-6 were calculated in pg/mL, 25(OH)D was calculated ng/mL and CRP was calculated mg/dL.</description>
