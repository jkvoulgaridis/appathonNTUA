  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic disease with high incidence rate, high recurrent
      rate and need whole course medical management. Varied clinical symptoms and unclear
      pathogenesis cause a series of clinical problem, such as low diagnostic rate and low
      effective treatment rate. Based on neuroimmune mechanisms of MDD, our previous study
      indicates that kynurenine pathway (KP) in serum may be the connections between central immune
      and peripheral immune, that key factors of KP may change the brain structure and function
      through affecting the central immune. The core research issue of this project are the
      inherent associations between metabonomics of inflammatory factors in KP, clinical phenotypes
      of MDD, and neuroimaging features. This project will focus on first-episode MDD, mass
      spectrometry analysis of KP factors will be conducted first, also multi-modal neuroimaging
      techniques will be applied to detect topological characteristics of brain structure and
      function in MDD and extract standard models, then correlation analyses will be performed
      between these molecular biological features and multi-dimensional clinical data in order to
      integrate KP metabonomics, core clinical characteristics (depressed mood, energy loss,
      interest loss and so on), neuroimaging biomarkers, and finally construct the deep learning
      based standard diagnostic technique of MDD. Additionally, this project will follow up MDD
      patients with different core clinical characteristics to certificate the aforementioned
      diagnostic technique as well as explore optimized treatment for different clinical subtypes.
