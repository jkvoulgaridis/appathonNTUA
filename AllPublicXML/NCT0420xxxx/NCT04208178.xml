  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two parts multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      Phase III study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alpelisib compared to alpelisib
      matching-placebo in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab as maintenance treatment of
      patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer whose tumor harbors a PIK3CA mutation
      following induction therapy with a taxane in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.
      Part 1 is the open-label, safety run-in part of the study, designed to confirm the
      recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D) dose of alpelisib in combination with trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab. Following Part 1, Part 2 will be initiated, which is the randomized, Phase III
      part of the study.

             medical history of chronic pancreatitis

          -  Subject has clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent cardiac
             events

          -  Subject has a history of Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme (EM) or
             Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).
