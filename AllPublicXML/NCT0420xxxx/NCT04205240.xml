  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well a reduced intensity conditioning regimen after donor
      stem cell transplant works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back
      (relapsed). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, and
      mycophenolate mofetil, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving a reduce intensity conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide,
      tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and daratumumab after donor stem cell transplant may
      improve survival and reduce the risk of multiple myeloma coming back.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) for haploidentical, matched or
      mismatched, related or unrelated reduce intensity allogenic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (allo HSCT) in relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine 2 year overall survival (OS). II. To determine the cumulative incidence of
      grade II-IV acute-graft-versushost-disease (aGVHD) at day 100 and 180.

      III. To determine the 100 days, 1 year and 2 year cumulative incidence of treatment-related
      mortality (TRM).

      IV. To assess one-year GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS). V. To determine the cumulative
      incidence of chronic graft-versus-hostdisease (cGVHD) Va. To assess overall and best response
      rates 100 days after allo HCT, 3 months, 6 months and every 6 months thereafter until end of
      daratumumab maintenance.

      VI. To determine rate of relapse after allo HSCT followed by maintenance. VII. To determine
      rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity using next generation sequencing (Food and
      Drug Administration [FDA] approved) in patients achieving a very good partial response (VGPR)
      or better.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine immune reconstitution pattern on days +30, +100, +180 and +365 following allo
      HSCT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) on days -5 to -2 and melphalan IV on days -3
      to -2, then undergo stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive cyclophosphamide on
      days 3 and 4, tacrolimus orally (PO) or twice daily (BID) or IV starting on day 5, and
      mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO three times daily (TID) on days 5 to 35. Patients also receive
      daratumumab IV starting between day 90-150 for up to 1 year. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years
      post stem cell transplantation.

    <time_frame>From the date of transplant until the date of relapse or date of death from any cause, assessed at 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who do not relapse or die will be censored at the date of last clinical assessment. Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated to estimate the PFS rates at 2 years posttransplant. To evaluate the potential association between patient characteristics and PFS, the log-rank test will be used to compare the PFS curves and Cox proportional hazard regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events by grade will be summarized. The occurrence of grade 3+ adverse events according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be summarized as well. Adverse events will initially be reviewed regardless of attribution, but also according to whether adverse events are possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus host disease (GvHD (aGVHD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The event will be onset of grade II-IV aGvHD and time to aGvHD will be defined as the period of time from transplantation to the event of aGvHD. Death and early relapse without aGvHD will be competing risks. Cumulative incidence rate of aGVHD with 95% confidence intervals will be estimated from the cumulative incidence curves. To evaluate the association between patient characteristics and aGVHD, the Gray's test accounting for competing risks will be used to compare the cumulative incidence curves and a proportional hazards model for the sub distribution of competing risks will be used to estimate the hazard ratio. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) will be similarly analyzed.</description>
