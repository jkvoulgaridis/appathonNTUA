  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of pulmonary pathogens and reduce the
      adverse impact of excessive BAL volume on patients, this study intends to explore the most
      optimal lavage volume in the middle lobe and the lower lobe of critical patients as well as
      seeking for the best way to manage BALF samples by means of detecting alveolar proteins and
      bacterial composition in BALF samples. The hypothesis is that the optimal lavage volume in
      the middle lobe and the lower lobe might be different. And to sample BALF separately through
      sequential lavage might be a better way to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of pneumonia
      pathogens.

      This is a self-control study consisted of three parts. Firstly, searching for the optimal
      lavage volume in the middle lobe and the lower lobe of critical patients by exploring the
      differences between the concentration of alveolar proteins among BALF samples of every
      participant. Several BALF samples are seperately collected from every single participant
      through sequential lavage(an initial 20 ml saline lavage at main bronchus and 5 aliquots of
      20 ml saline lavage at the subsegment of the right middle lobe or 6 aliquots of 20 ml saline
      lavage at the lower lobe) . The concentration of Alveolar proteins including Surfactant
      protein B (SP-B), Surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Human typeⅠprotein (HTⅠ-56) will be
      determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, the amount of living
      cells as well as the proportion of squamous cells and columnar cells in BALF samples will be
      counted. Secondly, to confirm the optimal lavage volume through quantitative bacterial
      culture of BALF and sputum samples of participants. And BALF samples will also be tested by
      next generation sequencing（NGS） to identify microorganism. Thirdly, to observe the effect of
      BAL on respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The Vital signs, arterial gas analysis,
      ventilator parameters and respiratory mechanical parameters of patients before and within 24
      hours after the BAL procedure will be recorded.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The optimal lavage volume at the middle lobe and the lower lobe, evaluated by the detection of SP-B, SP-D and HTⅠ-56 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>For the reason that SP-B, SP-D and HTⅠ-56 only exists in terminal airway and alveolus, the concentrations of them in BALF indicates the abundance of terminal airway materials obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage. SP-B, SP-D and HTⅠ-56 will be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The best way to manage BALF samples, evaluated by comparing the bacterial diversity and abundance in separately collected BALF specimens and mixed BALF specimen.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Mixed BALF specimen was a mixture of one tenth of separately collected BALF specimens. The BALF specimens will be cultured at 37℃，5% carbon dioxide for 18 to 24 hours, using blood ager, chocolate ager and MacConkey ager. Bacterial species will be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and the colony counts will be recorded. Besides, BALF specimens will also be dectected by Next Generation Sequencing for the bacterial diversity and abundance. As a reference, culture of the endotracheal aspiration will be conducted.</description>
