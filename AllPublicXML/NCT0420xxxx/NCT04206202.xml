  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to design a patient-specific instrumentation to be used in total knee
      arthroplasty and evaluate its accuracy of femoral component rotation and intramedullary guide
      so as to explore its clinical effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the most universal and effective means for treating terminal
      stage osteoarthritis (OA) of knee. With the development of three-dimensional printing (3DP)
      technology in the medical domain, the application of patient-specific instrumentation (PSI)
      in arthroplasty has become more common. The aim of this study was to design a PSI to achieve
      appropriate femoral resection and accurate component rotation for a successful TKA, and to
      explore its clinical effects.

    <time_frame>Postoperative 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The radiological outcomes include the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), posterior condylar angle (PCA), patella transverse axis-femoral transepicondylar axis angle (PFA) of the patients. The data were collected to evaluate the accuracy of the 3DP-designed PSI.</description>

    <measure>Hospital for Special Surgery knee score (HSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative 1,6,12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital for Special Surgery knee score (HSS) was used to evaluate postoperative recovery of knee function in an adult population. The HSS score system mainly includes 6 aspects as pain, function, muscle force, deformity, stability, and the range of motion. The score standard had a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome). A total score &lt;60 is considered a poor score, 60-69 fair,70-85 is good and 86-100 excellent.</description>

    <time_frame>Postoperative 1,6,12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The AKS was used to evaluate postoperative recovery of knee function in an adult population. The HSS score system mainly includes 4 aspects as pain, stability, range of motion and the function. The score standard had a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome). A total score &lt;60 is considered a poor score, 60-69 fair,70-85 is good and 86-100 excellent.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with advanced OA of the knee, varus deformity of no more than 15 degrees,
             flexion-contracture deformity of no more than 10 degrees, without extra-articular
             deformity of the knee;
