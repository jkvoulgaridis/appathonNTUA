  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is a language impairment caused by brain injury such as stroke that affects the
      ability to understand and express language, read and write due to damage in the language
      regions of the brain. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques like transcranial
      direct-current stimulation (tDCS) have been found to improve aphasia treatment effects in
      post stroke patient populations such as improved naming abilities.

      However, the effect of tDCS on more functional, higher level language skills such as
      discourse production (i.e. story telling, giving instructions) has yet to be
      understood.Therefore the aim of this study is to determine the potential effectiveness of
      tDCS as an adjunct to speech and language therapy (SLT) to improve discourse speech
      production in people with post-stroke aphasia. It is hypothesised that SLT combined with tDCS
      will result in greater improvements in discourse language production compared to SLT on its
      own.

    <measure>Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>CETI is a valid and reliable measure of change in functional communication ability in adults with aphasia. This assessment includes 16 everyday situations such as having a one to one conversation and giving yes or no answers appropriately. Participants are asked to rate their ability in each particular communication situation using a rating scale with one end labelled as 'not at all able and the other 'as able as before</description>

    <measure>Aphasia Impact Questionnaire-21 (AIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>AIQ is a self-report questionnaire which utilises pictures to enable people with aphasia to communicate their experiences of aphasia. There are 8 questionnaires to select from with scales that vary in relation to gender and race. Pictorial responses can be translated into numerical scores, and then documented on a summary score sheet. The questionnaire has three sections; communication, participation and well-being/emotional state. The first section looks at activities which are commonly difficult for people with aphasia such as talking and understanding. The participation section looks at how communication difficulties arising from aphasia impact the person's ability to complete tasks in everyday life such as shopping and work. The last section looks at the emotional effect of aphasia.</description>

Different aspects of cognition such as memory, executive function, language, visual-spatial ability and orientation are assessed. Scores range from 0-30, where the recommended cut-off score for identifying multi-domain cognitive impairment in persons with chronic stroke is 20/30.</description>

The treatment goals for this block of treatment are to 1) improve verb retrieval and language quantity and complexity in discourse production 2) improve functional communication skills and; 3) improve quality of life and psychological state in people with post-stroke chronic aphasia.</description>

    <description>Transcranial direct-current stimulation is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that can modify spontaneous cortical activity in targeted brain regions. Anodal tDCS delivered through a positively charged electrode has been found to increase cortical excitability in a targeted brain region. The use of tDCS as an adjunct to speech and language therapy has been found to improve aphasia treatment effects in post stroke patient populations.</description>
