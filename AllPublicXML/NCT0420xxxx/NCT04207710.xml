  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if Gebauer's Pain Ease or Gebauer's Ethyl Chloride topical
      anesthetic sprays are safe for use as numbing agents prior to placing epidurals and arterial
      lines, based on whether they introduce increased microbial growth after application to skin.
      Due to the recent national shortage of lidocaine, we hope to find a suitable alternative to
      lidocaine for topical analgesia when placing arterial lines and epidurals. Our hypothesis is
      that the sprays will not affect the sterility of the area. We will compare microbial growth
      from three subsequent swabs taken from a single area of skin on the wrist and lower back: one
      with no treatment, the second after treatment with ChloraPrep, and the third after applying
      one of the numbing sprays. If there is significantly higher growth in the swabs containing
      the topical anesthetic spray versus the ChloraPrep alone, this will indicate that the sprays
      introduce microbes to the sites of skin.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Gebauer's Pain Ease and Ethyl Chloride
      topical anesthetic sprays are safe for application on the areas of skin where epidurals
      (lower back) and arterial lines (wrist) are placed, based on whether they introduce microbial
      growth to these areas. The investigators will compare microbial growth by swabbing both of
      these skin sites following: 1) no treatment 2) ChloraPrep treatment and 3) ChloraPrep plus
      numbing spray (Ethyl Chloride or Pain Ease) treatment. The cultures will then be incubated to
      test for anaerobic bacteria, aerobic bacteria, and mold growth. The microbial growth will be
      compared between the three treatment groups based on the number of colony forming units
      present.

      Funding for the project will be from the manufacturer of the numbing sprays, Gebauer Company.

      Based on power analysis, for each of the numbing sprays, a total of 72 subjects must be
      enrolled, with 6 swabs taken per subject (untreated, ChloraPrep, and topical anesthetic spray
      samples will be taken from both the wrist and lower back of each subject). A sample size of
      72 pairs achieves 80 % power to detect an odds ratio of 24 using a two-sided McNemar test
      with a significance level of 0.05.

    <intervention_model_description>72 participants will have an area of skin on the wrist and lower back swabbed three times each. First, the untreated patch of skin will be swabbed, then it will be treated with ChloraPep and swabbed, then Pain Ease spray will be applied and the area will be swabbed again. The same process will be performed using Ethyl Chloride spray instead of Pain Ease on the opposite wrist and adjacent area on the lower back. The bacterial growth will be compared amongst the different treatments, based on the number of colony forming units that are present.</intervention_model_description>
