  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the continued safety and efficacy in a
      real-world setting of transcatheter device closure of the PDA in premature infants less than
      2kg in weight at the time of device implant using the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder device and
      other devices performed in the USA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the IMPACT registry, there are over 6000 transcatheter device closures of PDA that
      occurs in the United States annually. However, there are no comprehensive data collection
      tools for this procedure. The current databases do not include multiple data points, or
      follow-up data, or a section for specific adverse events to be documented. Moreover, until
      now, there has been no approved devices for PDA closure in children &lt; 2kg. This clinical
      study is the first of its kind to collect data from all transcatheter device closure of PDA
      in children &lt; 2kg performed in the USA.This study will be limited to children between 700 to
      2000 grams who are the most vulnerable population undergoing this procedure. This will allow
      us to understand the real world experience (efficacy and safety) of using the Amplatzer
      Piccolo Occluder and other devices in an extremely vulnerable, yet highly underserved
      population. The study will allow for standardization of this procedure throughout the country
      for the small children (&lt;2 kg) with a PDA. This is a multi-center, single arm, observational
      data collection study. This will be a large population study to help analyze outcomes in
      subjects &lt;2 kg. The trial has two primary endpoints for safety and effectiveness without
      formal hypothesis. The safety and effectiveness results will be compared with data reported
      in the ADO II AS IDE and Continued Access Protocol studies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vascular Access Complications (Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Access vessel complications include femoral arterial or femoral/jugular venous complications noted during the procedure, immediately after the procedure or delayed (&gt;24 hours). They range from bleeding from access sites, arterial or venous thrombosis with or without the need for treatment to loss of limb secondary to arterial occlusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Valvular Injury (Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Valvular injury includes damage to the tricuspid valve or other cardiac valve resulting in immediate post-procedural valvular dysfunction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Embolization (Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Device embolization includes malposition of the device either during or after the procedure or delayed (&gt;24 hours). The outcome of device embolization ranges from observation, transcatheter retrieval at time of procedure or at a separate time, surgical retrieval, other end organ damage, to mortality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary or Aortic Vessel Stenosis (Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adjacent vessel stenosis includes a narrowing of the aorta or the left pulmonary artery directly as a consequence of device implantation for PDA closure. Vessel stenosis could happen either during or after the procedure or delayed (&gt;24 hours). The outcome of vessel stenosis ranges from no intervention needed to repeated transcatheter and surgical therapies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Effective PDA Closure (Effectiveness)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness endpoint is the rate of effective closure of the PDA using a transcatheter device within six months post procedure. If more than one attempt is required, or multiple devices are required during the same procedure, it is still considered effective if there is Grade 0 or Grade 1 shunt, as defined below, at follow-up by transthoracic echocardiography or if a second procedure is not required following the initial attempt. If there is device embolization, adjacent vessel stenosis that required retrieval of the device and replacement during the same procedure with less than Grade 1 shunt during follow-up, it is still considered effective. Conversely, if an AE is noted after the procedure that requires a second procedure for treatment that results in greater than Grade 1 shunt, then the procedure is considered not effective, even if the initial attempt was effective. See protocol for PDA shunt definitions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Significant obstruction of the left pulmonary artery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Significant obstruction of the left pulmonary artery is defined as less than 30% flow to the left lung by lung perfusion scan or a peak instantaneous gradient in left pulmonary artery
≥35 mmHg by echocardiogram if lung perfusion scan is not available or as determined by the interventional cardiologist based on angiographic appearance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Significant obstruction of the aorta</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Significant obstruction of the aorta is defined as a gradient of ≥20 mmHg in the aortic isthmus by invasive aortic catheterization or a mean gradient ≥20 mmHg in the aortic isthmus by echocardiogram if invasive aortic catheterization is not available.</description>
