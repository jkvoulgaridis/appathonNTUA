      Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of transcutaneous electrostimulation of the
      posterior tibial nerve alone and combined with standard pharmacological treatment, in men
      with primary premature ejaculation, compared to standard pharmacological treatment.

      Patients and methods: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients diagnosed with premature
      ejaculation attending Boston Medical Group clinics in Colombia and Spain will be included.
      Participants will be assigned by randomization to one of three treatment groups:

        -  Group 1: Tens + placebo drug therapy

        -  Group 2: Standard treatment (paroxetine 20 mg) + placebo therapy

        -  Group 3: Tens therapy + standard treatment (paroxetine mg)

      The change in intravaginal latency time measured with the couple's sustained stopwatch, the
      change in the PEDT scale, the perception of the change in their initial condition after
      treatment (Global Clinical impression of change scale), and the change in different domains
      of the EP (PEP Scale - Profile Ejaculation Premature) at the end of treatment (week 12) and
      at three months of follow-up (week 24).

    <description>Patients with a change in Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool questionnaire score at weeks 12 and 24. A score of 11 or more suggests PE. A score of 9 or 10 may be found in men with PE; it is a &quot;borderline&quot; score. A score of 8 or less suggests that a man does not have PE. The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 20, respectively.</description>
