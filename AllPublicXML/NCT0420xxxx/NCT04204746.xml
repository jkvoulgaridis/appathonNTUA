  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no literature information about the flow rate of fresh gas mixture (air+O2) in the
      patients who underwent general anesthesia. Different flow rates of fresh gas mixture are used
      in both the investigator's hospital and the experiences of the anesthesiologists. It is aimed
      to study the effects of different fresh gas flow rates on the rate of temperature and
      moisture of the airway of patients who underwent general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Under physiological conditions, inhaled air is heated and humidified as it passes through the
      nose and upper airways until reaching the alveoli. This mechanism is bypassed by endotracheal
      intubation. Ventilation with dry and cold compressed gases leads to loss of water and heat
      from the respiratory tract. Drying of the respiratory tract can lead to destruction of the
      cilia and mucous membranes, resulting in decreased mucociliary transport and increased
      concentration of secretions.There is no definitive literature on fresh gas mix (oxygen + air)
      flow rates in patients under general anesthesia. This study aimed to investigate whether two
      fresh gas flow rates routinely employed in the authors' practice affected airway temperature
      and humidity.

    <description>Patients in the study were divided into two main groups according to the standard fresh gas flow administered (3-6 L/min). Each main group was then divided into subgroups as follows: sevoflurane + remifentanil, desflurane + remifentanil, or propofol + remifentanil (TIVA). These six groups were further divided into two groups according to use or non-use of a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter.</description>
