      To know the association of postoperative pain after gallbladder removal from umbilical port
      site versus epigastric portsite, after four ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy,and the
      epigastric port site was found to be friendly for the patients in terms of less pain after
      gallbladder removal from this site after surgery.

      Objective: To know the association of postoperative pain after gallbladder removal from
      umbilical port site versus epigastric port site, after four ports laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy.

      Randomized controlled trial was performed during 1-year period from January 2017 till January
      2018, at a private hospital setup. Both male and female patients, with age group 18 and
      above, in years, were considered, who were planned four ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy
      after typical cholelithiasis. Those patients with polyps , mucocele or empyema in gallbladder
      or perforated gallbladder requiring emergency surgery were omitted from the study. The
      patients were randomly selected, 65 in which gallbladder was removed from umbilical region
      (group A) and 65 from epigastric region (group B) respectively. Determination of
      postoperative pain was done on day one, at the time of release from the hospital and at
      follow-up time one-month post-surgery, with the help of Numerical Analogue Scale (NAS).
