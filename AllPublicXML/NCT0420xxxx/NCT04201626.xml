    <textblock>
      Background: In recent decades, the new concept of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
      program has been well accepted in the fields of gynecologic surgery. Many studies have shown
      the effectiveness of ERAS protocol in reducing hospital's length of stay, patient's
      morbidity, and rate of postoperative complications while cutting back on health care cost.
      Thus, standard guidelines such as ACOG has strongly recommended ERAS protocol implementation
      into each institution. However, institutions have self-limitations on adapting the standard
      ERAS pathway published from ERAS society due to the demand in resources. The concept of
      partial implementation of ERAS protocol has been raised and was mentioned in guidelines that
      ERAS implementation should be individualized to each institution. Nevertheless, the
      effectiveness of adapted ERAS protocol itself has not been well researched.

      Objectives: To examine the effect of partial implementation of ERAS protocol adapted to our
      institution on patient's recovery (based on hospital length of stay, pain score, time to
      flatulence, postoperative complications, and re-visits) compared to standard routine care in
      women diagnosed with gynecologic malignancy (cervix, endometrium, and ovary) undergoing
      elective open surgery.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial in gynecologic cancers (cervix, endometrium, and ovary)
      women, age 18-75 years, undergoing elective open gynecologic oncology surgery at Faculty of
      Medicine, Chiang Mai University hospital. The participants will be randomly assigned into one
      of two study groups: intervention (adapted ERAS protocol) and control (standard routine
      care).

      For the intervention group, each woman will be brought through the adapted ERAS protocol step
      by step starting from preoperative counseling and preparation, intraoperative management, and
      postoperative management standard according to the adapted ERAS protocol. For the control
      group, each woman will be cared for using routine standard care.

      The primary outcome is length of hospital stay.

    <description>Each woman in the intervention group will attend a preoperative counseling session with nurse and doctors. In addition to the standard preoperative counseling, explaining the purpose, process, and the importance of ERAS protocol compliance will be added to the session. Preoperative nutrition and laboratory assessment will be done according to adapted ERAS protocol on that same visit.
During admission, the intervention group participants are provided with care according to adapted ERAS protocol including no bowel preparation, no extended fasting before surgery, balanced intravenous crystalloid, thromboprophylaxis, multimodal pain control reducing opioid usage, multimodal anti-emetics medications, stepping diet up to regular diet within 24 hours, chewing gum for post-operative ileus prevention, early removal of Foley's catheter, and promote early ambulation using care checklist plan.</description>
