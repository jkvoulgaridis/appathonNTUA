    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study designed to evaluate the effect of Estetrol (E4) 15 or 20 mg, or
      placebo on the severity and frequency of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (Efficacy Study Part) and
      the safety of E4 20 mg (Endometrial and General Safety Study Part)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study:

        -  The Efficacy Study Part is designed to evaluate the frequency and severity of vasomotor
           symptoms [VMS] in both hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized postmenopausal
           participants after treatment with E4 15 mg or 20 mg or placebo for up to 13 consecutive
           weeks. For endometrial protection, all non-hysterectomized participants will be treated
           with 200 mg progesterone (P4) once daily for 14 consecutive days, after completion of
           the E4/placebo treatment.

        -  The Endometrial and General Safety Study Part (Safety Part) is designed to evaluate the
           general safety, endometrial safety, secondary efficacy (lipid, glucose metabolism,
           health-related quality of life [HRQoL] and treatment satisfaction of E4 in
           non-hysterectomized participants. All participants will receive E4 20 mg in combination
           with 100 mg P4 continuously for up to 53 weeks.
