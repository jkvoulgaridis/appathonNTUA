      therapy outpatient clinic. After recorded sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of
      the individuals, some evaluations will be done only once. The evaluations to be used in the
      study are as follows: Pain Assesment will be evaluated with McGill Pain Questionnaire, Sleep
      disorders will be evaluated with Pitsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue level will be
      assessed by the Fatigue Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) will be used to
      determine depression levels. The quality of life of the subjects wiil be evaluate by using

    <description>to reported determining factors affecting their quality of life Short form-SF36 .All questions are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible. Aggregate scores are compiled as a percentage of the total points possible, using the RAND scoring table (STEP I chart).
The scores from those questions that address each specific area of functional health status (STEP II chart) are then averaged together, for a final score within each of the 8 dimensions measured. (eg pain, physical functioning etc.)</description>

    <description>MCMcGill Pain Questionnaire will be used to report pain.The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) is a three-part pain assessment tool that measures several dimensions of the patient's pain experience. The first part consists of an anatomic drawing of the human form on which the patient marks where his or her pain is located. The second part of the MPQ is a VDS that allows the patient to record the intensity level of his or her current pain experience. The third part of the MPQ is a pain verbal descriptor inventory consisting of 72 descriptive adjectives. The patient is asked to review this list of pain descriptors and circle the ones that serve to best describe his or her current pain experience. Each part or dimension of the MPQ is individually scored and a cumulative total score is also recorded.</description>

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in the older adult. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The client self rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper</description>

Likert or bimodal rating scales with 4 response options. For the Likert Scale: better than usual = 0, no more than usual = 1, worse than usual = 2, much worse than usual = 3. For the bimodal scale: better than usual = 0, no more than usual = 0, worse than usual = 1, much worse than usual = 1. Sum all items for a total score.</description>
