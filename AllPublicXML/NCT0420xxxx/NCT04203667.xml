  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EndoRotor® is intended for use (USA labeling) in endoscopic procedures by a trained
      gastroenterologist to resect and remove tissue, not intended for biopsy, of the
      gastrointestinal (GI) system including post-endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) tissue
      persistence with a scarred base and residual tissue from the peripheral margins following
      EMR.

      In this trial investigators will conduct a post-market, prospective, non-randomized,
      multi-center study for the treatment of subjects with the need for resection of recurrent
      flat or sessile colorectal lesions where EndoRotor is the primary resection modality of
      persistent adenoma with a scarred base.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the majority of polyps are non-malignant, it is known that the risk of malignancy
      increases with polyp size, with polyps &lt; 10 mm having &lt; 1% risk of cancer, polyps of 10 mm
      having a 10% risk of cancer and polyps of 20 mm having a greater than 10% risk of cancer. It
      is also understood that a polyp of &lt; 1 cm takes approximately 10 years to transform into
      invasive colorectal carcinoma. Therefore, adenomas greater than 5 mm are normally treated.
      Polyps with tethered bases resulting from scarring are often the most challenging to resect
      endoscopically. The scarring can be caused by previous attempts at resection, previous deep
      biopsies, or tattoos placed too closely. These polyps often do not lift and can be impossible
      to snare even when stiff snares are used. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and
      knife-assisted resection (KAR) are techniques that have been shown effective in the
      management of scarred polyps, however these techniques have not been widely adopted in the
      West. Argon plasma coagulation has been more commonly used to ablate adenomatous tissue in
      scarred polyps but this technique does not allow for the histological assessment of the
      scarred polyp and is less effective than ESD. The EndoRotor provides a technique whereby the
      lesion can be effectively removed without adjunct procedures with collection of tissue for
      histological assessment.

          4. Favorable anatomy that allows the investigator to access the lesion.

          5. Subject is able and willing to comply with site standard medical follow-up, including
             the 90-day follow-up visit.

          6. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to participate and has
             signed the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             concomitant resection modality

          5. Medical reasons the procedure cannot be performed (i.e. labile blood pressure,
             anticoagulation laboratory levels that are too high and risk excessive bleeding,
             systemic infection, etc.)

             autoimmune disorders or conditions of severe immunosuppression).

         10. Any clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the subject at increased
             risk with the deployment of the device.

         11. Subject is participating in another study of a device, medication, biologic, or other
             agent within 90 days and could, in the opinion of the investigator, impact the results
             of this study.

         12. Subject has other medical, social or psychological problems that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude them from receiving this treatment and the procedures and
             participating in evaluations pre- and post-treatment.
