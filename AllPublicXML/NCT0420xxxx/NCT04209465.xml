  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study with an orally administered drug, BDTX-189 in participants with
      advanced solid tumors that have select mutations or alterations in human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2/ErbB2) genes or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1). The
      main goals of this study are to:

        -  Find the recommended dose of BDTX-189 that can be given safely to participants

        -  Learn more about the side effects of BDTX-189

        -  Learn what the body does to BDTX-189 after it has been taken (pharmacokinetics or PK)

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of BDTX-189 in participants with select allosteric ErbB
           gene mutations
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BDTX-189 is an irreversible, small molecular inhibitor that is highly selective versus
      wild-type EGFR and potent for cancer driver mutations of the ErbB family, including
      extracellular, transmembrane, and kinase domain allosteric mutations of HER2, as well as EGFR
      and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. These allosteric ErbB mutations are found in 1 - 2 % of
      most solid tumors and enriched in some cancers with a prevalence of about 2 - 7% such as in
      non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and endometrial
      cancer. Currently approved HER2 and EGFR directed therapies are not active against the
      spectrum of allosteric mutations at relevant and tolerated exposure levels.

      This Phase 1/2 multi-center, open-label trial is a first-in-human study that will evaluate
      BDTX-189 orally administered daily as a single agent in patients with solid tumors harboring
      select mutations or alterations. The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation primarily designed
      to assess the safety and tolerability of BDTX-189 and to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). Phase 1 will focus on patients with a solid tumor with alterations such as:

        -  Allosteric HER2 or HER3 mutation(s)

        -  EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation(s)

        -  HER2 amplified or overexpressing tumors

        -  EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation

      Following selection of the RP2D, a Phase 2 portion will be initiated to further evaluate the
      clinical activity of BDTX-189. Phase 2 will focus on patients with a solid tumor harboring
      an:

        -  Allosteric HER2 mutation (including but not limited to S310F/Y, R678Q, L755S/P, V777L,
           V842I)

        -  EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation

      Eligible mutations must be determined by a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) test
      routinely used by each institution and performed in a CLIA-certified or equivalent
      laboratory.
