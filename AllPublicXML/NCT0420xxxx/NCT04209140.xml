  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD), especially BD type I, is a highly prevalent mental disorder and a is a
      highly prevalent mental disorder and an important factor for suicide. Lithium is the key
      treatment for prevention of BD relapse and has a proven suicide prevention effect. Whilst
      many cases become asymptomatic with lithium treatment, the majority show sub-optimal
      response.

      The objectives of this project are to:

        -  improve outcomes of bipolar I disorder (BDI) cases prescribed lithium through the
           application of stratified approaches

        -  optimize the early prediction of lithium response using a set of multi-modal biomarkers
           (&quot;blood omics&quot;, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Li7-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
           derived-markers)

        -  develop a multidisciplinary multinational network of experts to undertake this and
           future projects on personalized diagnostics and therapeutics and

        -  implement new, powerful technologies to characterize brain lithium distribution and the
           blood molecular signature of lithium in responders and non-responders.

      This cutting edge approach will identify the eligibility criteria for treatment with lithium
      in BD in terms of response, safety and tolerability.

    <description>Good Responder The individual meets criteria for sustained remission, namely they experience euthymia (defined as a score on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (qIDS)&lt;6 and the Bech Rafaelson Mania Scale (BRMS)&lt;7) for at least 8 weeks during the two-year follow-up period without evidence of relapse into a syndromal episode of BD at any time after achieving sustained euthymia. AND No addition of a new mood stabilizer with the purpose of promoting mood stabilisation after lithium initiation

    <description>Decisions relating to treatment are also considered the clinician's responsibility to be made according to bipolar treatment guidelines and international standards of care (e.g. discontinuation, co-prescriptions, and according to SmPC in force). After the clinician has confirmed the indication of Lithium treatment as well as the absence of contra-indicated concomintant medication (NSAIDs and Diuretics) and after pre-
Lithium evaluations confirm the absence of contra-indication, Lithium is initiated following standard of care:
progressive titration to reach therapeutic plasma levels. Clinicians will use the therapeutic range provided by the laboratory they use in their usual clinical practice and according to the type of Lithium they prescribe.</description>
