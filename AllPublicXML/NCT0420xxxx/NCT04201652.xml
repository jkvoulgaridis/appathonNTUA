      Hypothesis: When comparing superficial infiltration of local anesthetic to superficial and
      deep infiltration of local anesthetic in the setting of carpal tunnel release, the null
      hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference between the two techniques.

      Background and study rationale: Carpal tunnel syndrome is a very common clinical problem with
      significant patient burden that can be reliably treated with surgical carpal tunnel release.
      To minimize operating room time burdens and to improve patient recovery time, this procedure
      is generally performed with the patient wide awake using local anesthetic. While the majority
      of patients are able to tolerate this type of procedure, there is always a possibility of
      some discomfort or pain experienced during the procedure. The investigators would like to
      compare two local anesthetic infiltration techniques to determine which is best to provide
      the least amount of pain or discomfort during a carpal tunnel release. The two methods are
      subcutaneous infiltration alone (superficial) and subcutaneous infiltration with infiltration
      into the carpal tunnel (deep).

      Research Design: This study design is a prospective randomized control trial.

      Methodology: Patients will be recruited and randomized on the morning of their surgery to
      undergo either superficial or superficial and deep local anesthetic infiltration using 10cc
      of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. They will be blinded
      as to which group they are in.

      Participants will complete the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire as a baseline for
      comparison as well as a brief questionnaire on demographics. After the procedure,
      participants will complete a short questionnaire about any pain experienced during the
      administration of the local anesthetic and during the procedure. Presence and intensity of
      pain during the procedure are the primary outcome of this study.

      Secondary outcomes include pain rating at 2, 8, and 24 hours post-procedure and a follow up
      Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire score at 3 months. The surgeon will also make note whether
      there is any visible evidence of damage to the median nerve from deep infiltration at the
      time of surgery.

      Statistical Analysis: The two groups (superficial vs. deep) will be compared directly for
      each of the outcomes listed in the methodology.
