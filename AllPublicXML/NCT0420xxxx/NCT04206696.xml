  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive oesophagectomy is a technically demanding procedure; thus, the learning
      curve of this procedure should be explored. Then the mature minimally invasive oesophagectomy
      procedure should be contrasted with the open procedure.

      Between July 2010 and August 2016, 214 patients underwent MIE (thoracoscopic-laparoscopic
      oesophagectomy) for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the Thoracic Department, The
      Second Hospital of Shandong University. Eight of these 214 patients were converted to
      thoracotomy or laparotomy, one patient was unable to tolerate single-lung ventilation due to
      a history of left upper lobectomy, and the other seven patients were due to bleeding
      controlling. Among the 214 patients enrolled, there were 182 males and 32 females in the MIE
      group. A total of 170 patients underwent oesophagectomy by open thoracotomy from August 2014
      to August 2016, and these patients were defined as the open group. The data from the patients
      in the open group were compared with those of the patients who underwent
      thoracoscopic-laparoscopic oesophagectomy during the same clinical period. All patients were
      preoperatively diagnosed with oesophageal cancer by endoscopy and biopsy, with routine
      thoracic and abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans and endoscopic ultrasonography
      to evaluate the clinical TNM stage. The operations were performed by a single surgical team.
      This study was approved by the ethics committee and Medical Administration Division of the
      Second Hospital of Shandong University. Written informed consent was obtained from each of
      the enrolled patients. All methods performed in the investigator's study were conducted in
      accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
