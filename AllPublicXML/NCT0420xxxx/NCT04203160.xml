  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and efficacy of CPI-613
      (devimistat) in the treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer when used in combination with
      standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) compared to gemcitabine plus
      cisplatin alone.

      This research study has two parts:

      In the phase 1 portion of this study, patients will receive a combination of CPI-613 and
      standard of care chemotherapy. Dose levels of CPI-613 will be adjusted to find the best dose,
      which will be the recommended phase 2 dose level.

      In the phase 2 portion of this study, patients will be randomized into two arms. Patients in
      Arm A will receive the combination of the recommended dose level of CPI-613 and standard of
      care chemotherapy. Patients in Arm B will receive standard of care chemotherapy.

      At the end of the study, researchers will compare the health outcomes of the patients that
      received CPI-613 + standard care to the outcomes of patients that received only standard
      care.

    <description>Objective response assessment will be determined by review of CT or MR scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. ORR (Partial Response + Complete Response) will be assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, during active study treatment. All enrolled patients who receive at least 1 cycle of therapy and have their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)</description>

    <description>PFS will be determined from date of first study treatment until the date of radiological or clinical progression (leading to withdrawal from the study) or date of last disease evaluation (for patients without progression). It will be calculated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. All patients that receive at least one dose of study treatment will be considered evaluable.</description>
