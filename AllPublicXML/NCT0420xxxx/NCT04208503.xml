    <textblock>
      Thyroid disorders are most commonly concomitant with prematurity and still remains a
      controversial topic. The incidence of a temporary form of hypothyroidism among preterm
      neonates is higher than in the general population. Transient prematurity hypothyroxinemia is
      defined as a temporary reduction in FT4 values without increase in TSH values. Currently,
      there is no consensus about normal thyrotropine (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) values in
      preterm infants.

      The aim of this study is to determine the volume of the thyroid gland in preterm infants born
      between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation inborn or admitted to the unit within 14 days from birth
      and compare it with the results of TSH and FT4 blood concentration. Besides, the objective of
      the study is to provide references ranges of thyroid hormones in premature infants born
      before 33 wk gestation to help neonatologist to interpreter the thyroid hormone results

      Thyroid disorders are most commonly concomitant with prematurity and still remains a
      controversial topic. Preterm infants are susceptible to thyroid disorders due to many reasons
      including immaturity of hypothalamopituitary-thyroid axis, non-thyroidal illness, impaired
      synthesis and metabolism of thyroid hormones, medication administration like dopamine,
      steroids, caffeine.The incidence of a temporary form of hypothyroidism among preterm neonates
      is higher than in the general population. Transient prematurity hypothyroxinemia is defined
      as a temporary reduction in FT4 values without increase in TSH values. It is a diagnostic
      challenge in order to differentiate it from thyroid disfunction in the critically ill
      patient. Currently, there is no consensus about normal thyrotropine (TSH) and free thyroxine
      (FT4) values in preterm infants. Given the delayed appearance of TSH value increase in
      preterm newborns additional thyroid evaluation methods are sought. We believe the thyroid
      ultrasound might prove helpful.

      The aim of this study is to determine the volume of the thyroid gland in preterm infants born
      between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation inborn or admitted to the unit within 14 days from birth
      and compare it with the results of TSH and FT4 blood concentration. We will performed the
      thyroid ultrasound to estimate nomograms of the thyroid volume to aid in the comparative
      evaluation of infants with suspected thyroid disease. The sonography references ranges will
      give specialists possibility to identify a gland as normal, small or enlarged. Besides, the
      objective of the study is to provide references ranges of thyroid hormones in premature
      infants born before 33 wk gestation to help neonatologist to interpreter the thyroid hormone
      results
