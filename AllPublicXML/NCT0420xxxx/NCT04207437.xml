  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety and feasibility of a daily
      3-minute hand-held vibration therapy intervention to reduce the severity of CIPN in the
      hands. The investigators hypothesize that daily vibration therapy can reduce the severity of
      patient's CIPN in their hands and improve CIPN-related quality of life. The hope is that
      results from this study will provide early data on the feasibility, efficacy, and most
      importantly, safety, of daily 3-minute hand-held vibration therapy needed to justify future
      clinical trials examining vibration therapy as a potential option for treating CIPN in the
      future.
