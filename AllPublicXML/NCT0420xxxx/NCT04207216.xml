  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis Vulgaris is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin disease.
      Joint involvement is common along with skin involvement. However, metabolic diseases, such as
      cardiovascular diseases can be accompanied by many systemic diseases, chronic and repetitive
      due to the quality of life and psychological status of patients can affect. Today, although
      the treatment is repetitive, chronic and requires follow-up due to the disease patients can
      turn to alternative and complementary medicine techniques. In recent years, studies on
      alternative medicine and complementary therapies have been noted in the medical literature.
      These studies also include Case Reports related to psoriasis vulgaris. However, in our
      country, there is no study that tells us whether patients with psoriasis vulgaris apply these
      treatments or not and what the practitioners think about the success of the treatment. The
      aim of the study will be to clarify issues such as whether patients with Psoriasis Vulgaris
      apply alternative medicine and complementary therapies for their disease.
