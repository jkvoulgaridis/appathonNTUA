    <intervention_model_description>12 healthy volunteers will be enrolled to determine the two most palatable and tolerable AC combinations. There will be a total of 4 combinations (2 AC doses and 2 solutions) in stage 1. Each participant will drink an assigned combination every day for 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, &quot;M/T/W&quot;) and switch to a different assigned combination M/T/W the following week. AC solution assignments will be defined before the study using a balanced incomplete block design</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Activated Charcoal, Powder, USP is carbon that has been treated to create low-volume pores that increase the area available for chemical reactions and adsorption. The most common pharmaceutical uses of activated charcoal is as a purification agent and antitoxin. All Spectrum Chemical USP products are manufactured, packaged and stored under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) per 21CFR part 211 in FDA registered and inspected facilities.</description>
