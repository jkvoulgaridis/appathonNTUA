    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effect of single and repeated doses of darunavir
      (DRV) in combination with cobicistat (DRV/COBI) and with ritonavir (DRV+rtv) on the
      pharmacokinetics of single dose dabigatran etexilate (measured in plasma as free and total
      dabigatran) when co-administered in healthy participants.
