      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drugs, lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, are
      effective in treating advanced Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) or other salivary gland cancers
      that have come back and/or spread to other parts of the body. Researchers are also doing this
      study to test the safety of the study drugs in participants.

          -  Prior use of lenvatinib or any PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-PD-L2 targeted therapies or with an
             agent directed at another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (CTLA-4, OX-40,
             CD137).

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure &gt;140mm Hg or diastolic pressure &gt;90mm

             device (i.e., outside study treatment) during, or within 4 weeks of trial entry (time

             will be ineligible.

          -  Gastrointestinal malabsorption, gastrointestinal anastomosis, or any other condition

             Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) or active hepatitis B (HBV) infection (positive viral load).
             Testing for HIV, HCV, or HBV prior to initiation of the study drug is not required. If
             patient's have a known history of treated HCV, then a viral load is required to
             confirm clearance of infection.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any medical or other condition, therapy or
             laboratory abnormality which, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the
             results of the study, or preclude participation in a clinical study.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study
             treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 10 mg/d of
             prednisone or equivalent) may be approved after consultation with the Primary
             Investigator.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e., with the use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs), with the exception of autoimmune thyroid disease, vitiligo, type 1 diabetes
             mellitus, or psoriasis. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current
             pneumonitis.

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with the
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
