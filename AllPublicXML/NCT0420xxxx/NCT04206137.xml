    <textblock>
      The low back pain is a leading cause to limit individual functional activities worldwide and
      60%-80% of adults are probable to get low back pain at least once in life time. Whereas, the
      chronic low back pain prevalence is 10%.The current literature suggests that any exercise is
      beneficial for reducing chronic nonspecific low back pain. This limits evidence regarding
      superiority of specific exercise for low back pain treatment. Therefore, a randomized control
      trial will be conducted at department of physiotherapy to assess which treatment is more
      effective in chronic low back pain at department of physiotherapy, institute of physical
      medicine and rehabilitation, Dow University of Health Sciences after synopsis approval.
      Overall 150 participants with 18-40 years old having chronic low back pain will be eligible
      and they will be included through non-probability, purposive sampling technique. The written
      informed consent will be taken from all the participants. They will be divided through
      systematic random sampling method into two groups, 75 in each group. Group A (experimental
      group) will receive Bilateral, asymmetrical limbs PNF pattern exercises and group B (control
      group) will receive Swiss ball exercises. All participants will be assessed using assessment
      form. Pain and functional disability will be measured by subjective outcome tools, visual
      analogue scale with 0-10cm and Oswestry disability index , respectively. Range of movement of
      lumbar and multifidus muscle activity will be measured by objective outcome tool,
      modified-modified Schober's test and surface electromyography, respectively. The pre &amp; post
      treatment outcomes will be collected and recorded. Treatment sessions will be given thrice a
      week for 5 weeks. A maximum drop-out rate of 20% is expected. The Mean ± SD will be
      calculated for quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages for qualitative
      variables. The recorded outcome variables before and after the five weeks of treatment will
      be compared and analysed. The p-value of 0.05 will be considered as level of significant.

    <textblock>
      Globally, Low back pain (LBP) is the commonest musculoskeletal pain, for which participants
      consult general practitioners. It is defined as &quot;pain and discomfort, localized below the
      costal margin and above the inferior gluteal fold, with or without referred leg pain&quot;. The
      LBP with specific causes are rare (&lt;15%). Whereas, majority (&gt;80%) of LBP cases are
      non-specific LBP (NSLBP). The traditional temporal categorization comprises as acute LBP (&lt;6
      weeks), sub-acute LBP (≤12 weeks) or chronic LBP (&gt;12 weeks). It is based on the duration of
      the current episode. The LBP is experienced in 60% to 80% of adults at some point in
      lifetime. There is 15% annual worldwide incidence rate of LBP and 30% point prevalence. LBP
      is one of the five leading causes of YLDS that contributes 57•6 million. The estimation
      suggests 5% to 10% of LBP cases will develop chronic. This chronicity is responsible for high
      treatment expenses, sick leave, and different sufferings. The point prevalence of different
      countries shows, China as 34.1%, Bangladesh as 20.1%, Iran as 14.8, United Kingdom as 9.0%)
      and India as 8.4%. The young and middle-aged individuals are 10 to 25% prevalent with NSLBP.
      However; according to author knowledge the current literature suggests that there is no exact
      finding of LBP prevalence in Pakistan. Several factors, such as genetics ,environmental
      and/or psychosocial factors participate as cause of LBP. Whereas the prevalence of LBP and
      disability due to LBP is seen to be higher in Pakistan due to the nature of work. Lifting is
      found to be the most common cause of aggravating factors along with bending and squatting.

      The evidence based guidelines for LBP diagnosis suggest to first rule out any underlying
      pathology (spinal infection, cancer and fracture of spine and cauda equina syndrome). The LBP
      without any specific pathology is labelled as NSLBP. The routine use of radiologic imaging is
      not warranted based on clinical guidelines until presence of specific pathology. The goal of
      LBP treatment includes pain relief, function improvement, reduced work leave of absence, and
      chronicity prevention. The analgesics (topic or oral), exercise, manual therapy, traction,
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), back supports, acupuncture, biofeedback,
      spinal injections, and lastly, surgery may include in treatment options.Among exercise
      interventions the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) exercise approach is
      designed to stimulate proprioceptors in order to enhance neuromuscular mechanism responses.
      The extremity patterns of PNF have diagonal direction with combination of movements, and
      these patterns are performed in line with the topographic arrangement of the muscles being
      used. Therefore, these exercises are thought to be suitable for muscles training
      anatomical-plane or anatomical-direction training programs. Moreover, PNF often have been
      used to improve the range of movement (ROM) and endurance. Various techniques of PNF training
      are used like rhythmic initiation, rhythmic stabilization, reversal of agonists, and reversal
      of antagonists.

      In the existing literature there is little direction with mixed evidence to physiotherapists
      that what intervention is more beneficial to apply for CLPB. According to author's knowledge,
      the base to rely on PNF techniques needs evidence related to PNF patterns specification, that
      which lower limb PNF pattern is more effective. A randomized clinical trial will be conducted
      to explore the effects of bilateral, asymmetrical lower limb PNF patterns in flexion and in
      extension on multifidus in CLBP to evaluate and stabilize evidence based physical therapy
      practice in Pakistan.

      Review of Literature:

      A systemic review of 2015 revealed that exercise had better results in comparison to other
      treatment group in CLBP. Their results found strengthening, coordination and stabilisation
      exercises as beneficial in comparison with other interventions in the treatment of CNSLBP.
      Whereas, there were less effective results for cardiorespiratory and combined exercises. They
      did not report studies regarding PNF pattern exercises in their systemic review. This
      suggests less availability of its evidence. A randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted to
      examine the PNF effects on pain, functional disability and static balance ability with CLBP.
      It found PNF had greater effects comparison with control at three weeks. The results were
      limited to techniques only. This study did not include the PNF specific patterns of upper and
      lower limbs.Whereas, in a RCT of 2018 authors compared the 6-week PNF and a general exercises
      on pain and disability in participants with CLBP. Findings suggest that there is positive
      effect of PNF than general exercises. The results were limited to pain and disability only
      and were without specific patterns effects on trunk muscular impairments. A study in 2018
      compared between motor control exercise on Swiss ball and PNF rhythmic Stabilization
      Technique on 30 participants with nonspecific low back ache. It found same effects of both
      therapeutic approaches. There was less sample size .The interventions did not base limbs
      pattern effects on trunk muscles and findings were limited to pain, ROM and disability. A RCT
      in 2014 compared two methods for the muscle strengthening in trunk with CLBP with concluding
      that PNF combination pattern exercise had beneficial effects than Swiss ball exercises on
      trunk muscle activation in CLBP participants. It found PNF to be superior but there is need
      to be identified the specific PNF exercise pattern and technique effects. Whereas, a Cochrane
      review concluded that the exercises are more effective in LBP in addition with heat and cold
      therapy but suggested that exercise is more effective on pain relief and disability than
      other treatment options. This didn't reveal specific exercise effects with time
      effectiveness. According to author's knowledge the current literature have limited evidence
      on the role of PNF and other exercises. There is a need for evidence regarding effects of
      upper and lower limbs PNF patterns exercises on trunk muscles and pain related features of
      CNLBP.

      Significance:

      NSLBP is a global health problem which accompanies 80% to 90% of all LBP, probably closer to
      100%. Evidence based guidelines suggest various exercise options in Physical therapy for CLBP
      but there have been few comparisons and little evidence of specific exercise in specific
      patterns. In this study the precised exercises would be compared on pain, functional
      disability, and lumbar ROM and multifidus activation in CLBP. By this, the best exercise
      intervention would be used with the effective results in the physical therapy practice to
      improve trunk muscles and to decrease burden of CLBP. This study results if proven will
      progress physical functions and self-assurance in using the spine, and will inform
      participants how to manage with their low back problem. This study will provide baseline
      evidence to further researchers for work ahead.

      Objectives:

        1. To explore the effects of limbs PNF pattern exercises and Swiss ball exercises on
           multifidus motor activity, lumbar ROM, pain and functional disability in CLBP.

        2. To determine the frequencies and statistical association of age, gender, body mass index
           (BMI) and occupation among participants in CLBP.

        3. To determine the statistical association among multifidus motor activity, lumbar ROM,
           pain and functional disability of participants with CLBP before and after the exercise
           treatment.

        4. T determine the effects of bilateral, asymmetrical limbs PNF pattern exercises and Swiss
           ball exercises in participants with CLBP

        5. To compare the effects of bilateral, asymmetrical limbs PNF pattern exercises and Swiss
           ball exercises in participants with CLBP

      Hypothesis:

        1. Null hypothesis: There is no difference between effects of bilateral asymmetrical limbs
           proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and Swiss ball exercises on multifidus muscle
           in chronic low back pain.

        2. Alternate Hypothesis: The effects of bilateral asymmetrical limbs proprioceptive
           neuromuscular facilitations are more beneficial than Swiss ball exercises on multifidus
           muscle in chronic low back pain.

      Methodology:

      Research design: The research design will be randomize control trial (RCT), experimental
      study.

      Sampling technique: Non probability purposive sampling technique will be used. Sample size:
      Initially, a sample size of 54 human subjects was calculated through open epi software with
      95% Confidence Interval and 80% power of test with post-test VAS mean (2.1) and standard
      deviation (0.85), in experimental group and post-test VAS mean (1.5) and standard deviation
      (0.69) in control group. Due to small sample size, it is increased to 150 with drop rate of
      20%. The 75 participants per group will be considered.

      Place of the study:

      Physiotherapy department, Institute of physical medicine and rehabilitation (IPM&amp;R), Dow
      University of Health Sciences (DUHS), Chand Bibi road, Karachi, Pakistan.

      Data collection procedure:

      After taking consent, the objectives of study will be told to all participants.The
      participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. All the participants will be
      assessed with outcome measures before after 5 weeks of intervention.

      Interventions protocol: (half hour session, thrice a week for 5 weeks). Group A (experimental
      group) will receive, PNF rhythmic initiation with bilateral asymmetrical upper and lower limb
      pattern,

        -  The participant in supine position (on the back) with left arm in
           extension-adduction-internal rotation with right hand gripping his left wrist with right
           arm in modified extension-abduction-internal rotation. Neck will be in flexion looking
           at left hand.

        -  Therapist distal hand (hand away from head of the participant) will grip wrist of
           participant's left hand and the proximal hand (hand near to head of the participant)
           will be on top of the participant's head with fingers pointing towards the left side of
           participant neck.

        -  Participant will be asked to lift left arms and push the head back through the pattern
           of flexion -abduction-external rotation and neck in extension to the left in opposition
           of therapist hand resistance. At the end range of motion extensor muscles of back will
           start to contract.

        -  Then, participant will be asked to reverse the movement pattern to
           extension-adduction-internal rotation and neck flexion to right against the therapist
           resisting hands.

        -  It will be repeated on other side of participant.

        -  Then for lower limbs, participant's left leg will be in extension-abduction-internal
           rotation and right leg in extension-adduction-external rotation.

        -  Therapist will grasp the lateral and dorsal surfaces of both feet with distal hand.
           Proximal arm will be placed underneath the participant's thighs to hold them together.

        -  Then participant will be asked to lift both feet up, bend legs up and away towards right
           shoulder against therapist resistance.

        -  The right leg will go into flexion-abduction-internal rotation, the left leg into
           flexion-adduction-external rotation. At the end of range, the motion continues as lower
           trunk flexion with rotation and side-bending to the right.

        -  After that, participant will asked to reverse the left leg into
           extension-abduction-internal rotation and right leg in extension-adduction-external
           rotation against resistance. At end of range, the motion will carry on as trunk
           extension and elongation to the left with left rotation and side trunk flexion.

        -  It will be repeated on other side of participant.

        -  10 repetition and 3 sets for each side, 20 second rest between two sets.

      Group B (control group) will receive Swiss ball exercises :

        1. Supine position: A ball will be placed under participant neck, and will be asked to bend
           hip and knee up to 90°. 5 times, 10 seconds hold

        2. Supine position: With a ball below the pelvis, knees bent, the ball press will be done
           with pelvis. 5 times, for 10 seconds hold.

        3. Crawling position: With a ball below one knee while keeping toes away from contact with
           the floor, the participant will balance first to stabilize the posture and slowly raise
           the other lower limb. This exercise will be performed in turn for the two lower limbs 10
           times, with 10 seconds hold.

        4. Prone position: Participant will place a ball in front of pelvis and will repeatedly
           raise and lowered the two lower limbs alternately. There will be 10 repetitions, with 5
           sets, taking 15 seconds rest between each set.

      Data analysis:

      The Statistical package for the social sciences 21 version will be used for data analyzing.
      The mean and standard deviation will be calculated for quantitative variables like age. The
      qualitative variables will be shown through calculated frequencies and percentages. The
      outcome results of the study (decrease pain intensity, improve functional disability, improve
      range of movement and improve multifidus activity) taken before and after the treatment will
      be compared and analysed. The p-value of 0.05 will be considered as level of significant.
