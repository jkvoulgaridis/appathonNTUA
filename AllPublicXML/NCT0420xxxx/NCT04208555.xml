  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) caused by Candida species, predominantly C. Albicans is
      considered one of the most common infections of the lower female genital tract affecting 75%
      of women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent VVC (RVVC) is arbitrarily defined as four
      or more episodes every year. RVVC is a debilitating, long-term condition that can severely
      affect the quality of life of women. Several factors have been associated with RVVC such as
      prolonged use of antibiotics, inadequately treated infection, uncontrolled diabetes, immune
      mechanisms (e.g. HIV), oral contraceptive use as well as the resistance of non-albicans
      Candida species (e.g. C glabrata, C krusei) to conventional antifungal agents as azoles.

      Fluconazole administered orally is the most commonly used antifungal drug in the case of
      RVVC. However, in the last decade, fluconazole-resistant C Albicans has been reported in
      women with RVVC. Terconazole is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal treatment agent for
      both C Albicans and non-albicans. Its use (80 mg vaginal suppository daily for 6 days) was as
      effective as two doses of oral fluconazole (150 mg) in the treatment of patients with severe
      VVC and RVVC.

      Boric acid or boracic [B(OH)3] is a weak acid with proven antifungal action. In RVVC
      especially in azole-resistant strains and in non-Candida Albicans, 600 mg of the boric acid
      vaginal suppository is recommended once daily for 2 weeks. This regimen has a mycologic cure
      rate varied from 40% to 100%. However, there are no published studies comparing the
      intravaginal use of boric acid with terconazole for RVVC. Accordingly, a prospective
      randomized study in patients with RVVC will be conducted to address this important issue.
