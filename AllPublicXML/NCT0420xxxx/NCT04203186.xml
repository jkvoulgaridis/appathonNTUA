  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparison of Malaria events (symptoms and signs of malaria) experienced by subjects
      infected with PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) vs. PfSPZ Challenge (7G8).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The single center study is designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled CHMI
      trial with 2 parallel test groups to directly compare clinical and laboratory characteristics
      of the NF54 and 7G8 strains of PfSPZ Challenge. This study will also evaluate signatures of
      and time to parasitemia by multiple methods and evaluate physiologic status data collected by
      non-invasive wearable monitors before and during Plasmodium falciparum infection to
      characterize and trend physiologic changes appearing prior to the onset of parasitemia.

      PfSPZ Challenge (aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, infectious Plasmodium falciparum
      sporozoites) or normal saline will be administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI) by
      25-gauge needle and syringe to healthy malaria na√Øve adults.

      Data generated from samples collected for biomarker assay analysis will be useful for
      developing predictive models to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates.
