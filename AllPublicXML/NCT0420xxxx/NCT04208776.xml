      Study population: Decompensated cirrhotics requiring primary prophylaxis with asciteswho are
      admitted to and attending the OPD at ILBS.

      Study Design : A Randomized controlled trial Study period : August 2019 to December 2020 (1.5
      Years) Intervention : Treatment na√Øve patients will be given Propranolol and dose will be
      titrated every 2ndday to attain a target heart rate of 55.

      One group patients will be given maximum tolerated dose of propranolol with initial dosage of
      20mg once a day and uptitrating every 2nd day by 20 mg.The patients who bleed will undergo
      EVL session.

      To the other group Midodine will be added to Propranolol.It will be started at 2.5mg TDS and
      will be uptitrated every 2nd day to a max of 10mg TDS to attain a MAP of atleast 70mm Hg and
      then uptitate the beta blocker simulataneously to attain the target heart rate. The patients
      who bleed will undergo EVL session.

      Monitoring and assessment :

      The patient will be monitored every day. The patient will undergo physical examination,
      complete blood counts, at baseline, LFT, KFT, at every 2nd day and day 7 from the start of
      therapy.

      Adverse effects : Bradycardia and hypotension due to beta blockers Stopping rule : Severe
      hyponatraemia (&lt;125), low mean arterial pressure(&lt;65) or cardiac output and increasing serum
      creatinine(&gt;1.5) identifies more vulnerable patients among those with decompensated
      cirrhosis, in whom a dose reduction or temporal discontinuation of NSBB treatment will be
      considered.
