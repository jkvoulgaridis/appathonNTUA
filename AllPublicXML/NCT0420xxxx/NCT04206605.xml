  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated subcutaneous
      (SC) administrations of lanadelumab in preventing angioedema attacks in adolescents and
      adults with non-histaminergic angioedema with normal C1-INH and in adults with acquired
      angioedema (AAE) due to C1-INH deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study consists of 2 angioedema indication cohorts based on the population-specific study
      entry criteria: 1. non-histaminergic normal C1-INH angioedema indication cohort with 12 years
      of age and above participants, 2. AAE indication cohort with 30 years and above participants.
      Participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated SC administrations of lanadelumab or
      placebo in a double-blind fashion within each of the 2 angioedema indication cohorts. In the
      non-histaminergic normal C1-INH angioedema indication cohort, randomization will be
      stratified by baseline angioedema attack rate (1 to less than (&lt;) 2 attacks/4 weeks, and
      greater than (&gt;=)2 attacks/4 weeks) and in the AAE indication cohort, randomization will be
      stratified by baseline angioedema attack rate only (1 to &lt; 2 attacks/4 weeks, 2 to &lt; 3
      attacks/4 weeks, and &gt;= 3 attacks/4 weeks).

      23 APRIL 2020: Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

        applicable population criteria below.

          -  Males and females, 12 years of age and older for participants with non-histaminergic
             normal C1-INH angioedema or 30 years of age and older for participants with AAE due to
             C1-INH deficiency at the time of signing of the informed consent form (ICF).

          -  Documented clinical history of recurrent attacks of angioedema in the absence of
             wheals/urticaria.

          -  Investigator-confirmed diagnosis of non-histaminergic bradykinin-mediated angioedema:

               -  non-histaminergic angioedema with normal C1-INH

               -  AAE due to C1-INH deficiency, as documented by a history of angioedema attacks at
                  screening and occurrence of attack(s) during the observation period.

          -  Participants with non-histaminergic normal C1-INH angioedema must also meet the
             specific inclusion criteria below unique to this study population:

               -  History of recurrent angioedema with at least an average of 1 angioedema attack
                  per 4 weeks prior to screening and this attack rate must be confirmed during the
                  observation period while treated with chronic high-dose antihistamine (cetirizine
                  40 milligram per day [mg/day] or equivalent high-dose second-generation
                  antihistamine medication).

               -  Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening from a sponsor-approved
                  central laboratory that confirm C1-INH antigen and function greater than or equal
                  to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) of normal and normal C4. With prior sponsor approval,
                  participants may be retested during the observation period if results are
                  incongruent with clinical history.

               -  Clinical history of not responding to high-dose antihistamine treatment
                  (cetirizine 40 mg/day or equivalent high-dose second-generation antihistamine
                  medication), which must be confirmed during the observation period with at least
                  1 angioedema attack per 4 weeks with chronic high-dose antihistamine treatment
                  and no significant difference (as assessed by the investigator and in
                  consultation with the sponsor's medical monitor, as necessary) from the historic
                  attack rate without high-dose antihistamine treatment.

             criteria below unique to this study population:

               -  History of recurrent angioedema with at least an average of 1 angioedema attack
                  per 4 weeks prior to screening and this attack rate must be confirmed during the
                  observation period.

               -  Onset of angioedema symptoms and attacks after the age of 30 years.

          -  Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening from a sponsor-approved central
             laboratory that confirm C1-INH function below 50% of normal (decreased functional
             C1-INH) and low C4 levels (below the normal range). Participants may be retested if
             results are incongruent with clinical history or believed by the investigator to be
             confounded by recent C1-INH use.

          -  Agree to adhere to the protocol-defined schedule of treatments, assessments, and
             procedures.

          -  Participants &gt;= 18 years of age must be willing to use icatibant as the rescue
             medication during the observation and treatment period. During the observation period,
             participants need to be treated with icatibant for at least 2 angioedema attacks or at
             least 1 moderate or severe attack. In the opinion of the investigator, participants
             with no response to icatibant for acute angioedema attacks in the past medical
             history/screening, or no improvement or worsened attack severity 2 hours after
             icatibant treatment during the observation period (based on totality of assessments),
             will not be included. Note: For participants 12 to less than (&lt;) 18 years of age,
             standard of care therapy per local protocols should be provided.

          -  Males, or non-pregnant, non-lactating females who are of child-bearing potential and

             non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal for at least
             12 months.

          -  The participant (or the participant's parent/legal guardian, if applicable) has
             provided written informed consent approved by the institutional review board/research
             ethics board/ethics committee (IRB/REB/EC).

        - If the participant is a minor (i.e. &lt; 18 years of age), have a parent/legal guardian who
        is informed of the nature of the study provide written informed consent (i.e. permission)
        for the minor to participate in the study before any study-specific procedures are
        performed. Assent will be obtained from minor participants.

        Exclusion Criteria

        The participant will be excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria
        are met.

          -  Concomitant diagnosis of Type I or Type II HAE, or recurrent angioedema associated

             normal, or total bilirubin &gt; 2x upper limit of normal (unless the bilirubin elevation
             is a result of Gilbert's syndrome).

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.

             adjustment during the study treatment period that, in the opinion of the investigator
             or sponsor, may confound the results of the safety assessments or may place the
             participant at risk. Participants with stable treatment for at least 3 months prior to
             screening and NOT expecting any change to their treatment regimen for 6 months during
             the study treatment period, will not be excluded.

          -  Have any condition (surgical or medical) that, in the opinion of the investigator or
             sponsor, may compromise their safety or compliance, preclude the successful conduct of
             the study, or interfere with interpretation of the results (e.g. significant
             pre-existing illness or other major comorbidities that the investigator considers may
             confound the interpretation of study results).
