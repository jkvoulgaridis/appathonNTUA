  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) trial have proven the effectiveness of intraarterial
      revascularization in patients with larger cerebral artery occlusion. The success rate of EVT
      is close to 80%, but only 50% of patients improve to independent functional outcome.
      Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed to reduce the futile revascularization.
      However, updated guidelines recommend the indications for EVT based on the results of
      randomized clinical trials (RCT), management of post-revascularization is largely unknown.

      Current guidelines suggest that systolic blood pressure should be adjusted below 180 mmHg and
      diastolic blood pressure below 105 mmHg in patients undergoing intraarterial reopening.
      However, in the case of successful recanalization by EVT, same guideline is adopted even
      though the possibility of intracerebral hemorrhage or reperfusion injury by high blood
      pressure. On the other hand, too low blood pressure can worsen cerebral ischemia.

      Therefore, this study will compare the effectiveness of active blood pressure control group
      (with less than 140 mmHg systolic blood pressure) versus standard blood pressure control
      group (with less than 180 mmHg systolic blood pressure) during the first 24 hours in patients
      who underwent EVT and achieved successful recanalization (TICI 2b-3).

      1. The study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label trial with blinded
           end-point assessment (PROBE) design study.

        2. After successful revascularization, the active blood pressure control group and the
           standard blood pressure control group will be randomized by 1: 1.

        3. Patients who is admitted to the Department of Neurology at the participating hospital
           with acute cerebral infarction will will be included for 5 years from December 2019 to
           December 2023 (based on the date of stroke). Patients who have undergone intraarterial
           thrombectomy and have successfully reopened arteries should be enrolled.

        4. Collect medical history, laboratory findings and blood pressure parameters (systolic
           blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood pressure variability, etc.),
           neurological scores, functional recovery, and quality of life indicators.

        5. Neurological scores, functional recovery scores, and quality of life indicators are
           performed by independent researchers in the blind state.

        6. All data is collected using e-CRF, and the image study will be anonymized and sent to
           the central adjudication.

        7. Central adjudication will review the image study.

        8. At the end of the first phase in January 2022, one intermediate analysis will be
           conducted.

Identifying patients with a greater likelihood of poor functional outcome (scores &lt;8) may be helpful in the early stages of care for supporting transfer or therapy decisions.</description>
