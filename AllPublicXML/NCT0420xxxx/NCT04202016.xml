  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 female participants with class II div I will have extraction of bilateral first bicuspids
      10 weeks after bond- up appointment. The extracted teeth will be preserved in special
      containers for subsequent microscopic analysis. Four months later, upon space closure phase,
      the patient will have a piezocision surgery on one side randomly chosen. Study casts will be
      generated once before the surgery and monthly after for four and a half months. The models
      will be scanned by CADCAM and later tooth movement will be analyzed in regards to the rugae
      area.

    <intervention_model_description>The design will be a split-mouth where the participants should need extraction based treatment in collateral sides of the upper arch with one of the sides serving as the treatment while the other will be the control. Then they will be grouped based on their facial type.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>A third party will have the randomization of which side to be chosen for each case. An IT student will be asked to prepare randomized two lists using excel Microsoft program. Each list was defined based on facial divergence type; adult high, and adult average lists in the Excel columns. Underneath each list, the raws, equal number of R(right) and L(left) letters will be generated randomly. The orthodontic department's receptionist will receive the excel file, and based on which, prepare closed envelops that will be numbered. Each of which will contain a piece of paper having a letter, either R or L accordingly. The envelops will be dark and difficult to see through even under light. The periodontist will open the envelope of each patient only prior to their piezocision surgery without the involvement of the orthodontist.</masking_description>

    <description>Every six weeks from the first impression, made on the day of surgery (T0), an impression will be taken, (T1, T2, T3). Images of the impressions will be generated using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CADCAM) to evaluate the space changes from a fixed reference point; the rugae area.</description>

    <time_frame>Ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The extraction will take place 10 weeks after the bonding up-appointment. Atraumatic extraction of the upper first premolars will be executed. The periodontist, performing the extraction, will have the extracted teeth stored in containers that contain sterilized deionized water.
Each tooth will be placed in ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes to loosen any residual periodontal ligament's and soft tissue fragments' traces which will be later removed by wet gauze with a rubbing motion. Each tooth will be scanned three dimensionally by a desktop X-ray micro-tomography system. Teeth will be scanned with X-rays while being rotated over 360Â°. Three-dimension object will be generated by a 3D cone beam reconstruction algorithm utilizing the 2D images that have resulted from the scanning process.</description>
