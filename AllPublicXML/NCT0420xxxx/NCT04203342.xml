      A randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-design, multiple-site study to
      evaluate the clinical (therapeutic) effet of a generic Ketoconazole Cream 2% (Douglas
      Pharmaceuticals America Ltd) compared with the reference standard Ketoconazole Cream 2% (Teva
      Pharmaceuticals USA Inc) in subjects with a microbiologically-confirmed, clinical diagnosis
      of tinea pedis. Approximately 675 subjects, male or female, 18 years or older, will be
      enrolled.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic cure of tinea pedis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects in each treatment group with a Therapeutic Cure of tinea pedis at the test-of-cure visit conducted 2 weeks after the end of treatment (Day 56 +/- 4). Therapeutic cure is defined as having both a clinical and mycological cure of tinea pedis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical cure of tinea pedis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects in each treatment group with a Clinical Cure at Day 56 +/- 4. Clinical Cure is defined as a total severity score of &lt;/= 2, with no individual severity score of &gt;1. This is calculated using The Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Tinea Pedis rated by the Investigator using a standardized rating scale as follows:
0=none (complete absence of any sign or symptom)
Mild (slight)
moderate (definitely present)
Severe (Marked, intense).
The following signs and symptoms will be rated:
Signs = fissuring/cracking, erythema, maceration, and scaling Symptoms = pruritis and burning/stinging</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mycological cure of tinea pedis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects in each treatment group with a Mycological Cure of tinea pedis at Day 56 +/- 4. Mycological Cure is defined as having a negative KOH test AND a negative fungal culture.</description>

             (negative urine pregnancy test)

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must agree to use of reliable method of
             contraception.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of tinea pedis predominantly in interdigital spaces

          -  Tinea pedis confirmed at baseline by positive KOH wet mount.

          -  Sum of clinical signs and symptoms score of target lesion at least 4; in addition
             target lesion must have a minimum score of at least 2 for erythema and a minimum score
             of at least 2 for either pruritis or scaling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study
             period.

          -  history of, or current psoriasis, lichen planus, or contact dermatitis involving the
             feet within the previous 12 months.

          -  history of dermatophyte infections with a lack of response to antifungal systemic or
             topical therapy (recurrent tinea pedis [i.e.more than 3 infections in the past 12
             months] that were unresponsive to previous antifungal therapy).

          -  history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to ketoconazole, other
             imidazoles, sulfites or any other component of the study product.

             pedis.

          -  known history of or current impaired wound healing, presence of peripheral vascular
             disease and/or trophic changes of the lower limbs to an extent that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator would make the subject unsuitable for the study or compromise
             subject's safety.

          -  Signficant history or current evidence of chronic infectious disease, system disorder,
             organ disorder, immunosuppression (due to disease or therapy, including history of
             organ transplant), or other medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk by participating or compromise the
             integrity of the study data.

          -  Use of antipruritics, including antihistamines, within 72 hours prior to Visit 1.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids, topical antibiotics or topical antifungal therapy
             (e.g. clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole) within 2 weeks before Visit 1.

          -  Use of systemic (e.g. oral or injectable) antibiotics, systemic antifungal therapy, or
             systemic corticosteroids within 30 days before Visit 1. The use of intranasal, inhaled
             or ophthalmic corticosteroids for acute or chronic conditions (e.g. allergic
             conjunctivitis, asthma/COPD maintenance) is acceptable to the extent that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, does not compromise safety of subject or integrity of the
             data.

          -  Use of oral terbinafine or itraconazole within 2 months before Visit 1.

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medication or radiation therapy within 3 months before Visit
             1.

          -  Receipt of any drug as part of a research study within 30 days before Visit 1.

          -  Previous participation in this study.

          -  Employee of the Investigator or research centre or their immediate family members.
