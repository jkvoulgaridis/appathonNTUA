  <brief_summary>

      The aim of this study is to explore if an already established diet with anti-inflammatory
      effect in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease would have an anti-inflammatory effect in
      children with JIA. The diet is called specific carbohydrate diet.

      Children classified with JIA, in a low-to-medium disease activity and without having changed
      DMARD or bDMARD in the last 12 weeks are included. Only motivated children and parents can
      participate. Before inclusion the family are informed orally about the study plan, the diet
      and practical issues regarding the study and they receive written information including for
      example a product list and a recipe booklet. A dietician and the principal investigator
      follows the child and parents during visits, by mail and phone. After the baseline visit, the
      family has two weeks to get used to the new diet. At baseline, after two, four and twelve
      weeks on the diet the child is examined, blood exams are performed and blood is stored at
      -70, fecal samples and urine is also collected. At inclusion and after four weeks saliva
      sample for bacteria is collected. The child fills in the child health assessment
      questionnaire, (CHAQ) for a score of the physical ability and DisabKids for an overall
      assessment of the childs well-being.

    <description>The specific carbohydrate diet has been shown to have beneficial effects on IBD and has been implemented in Seattle Children's IBD centre, with some patients using SCD either as primary or complementary therapy. The SCD is a nutritionally balanced diet focused on removing many complex carbohydrates such as grains, dairy products except for yoghurt fermented over 24 hours, vegetables rich in starch and sugars except for monosaccharides like in honey. Participants can eat meat but since it has to be unprocessed food the investigator's experience is that the amounts of meat are not very big. Fish, eggs, sea-food is allowed. Bread is baked from nut and almond flour.</description>
