  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Androgens are used for doping purpose because they can increase muscle mass and strength.
      These drugs are included in the list of prohibited substances of the World Anti-Doping Agency
      (WADA). The prohibition of its use has given rise to a great variety of strategies, including
      indirect androgenic doping (increasing endogenous testosterone production) or masking of
      exogenous testosterone administration.

      Fluconazole is an imidazole antifungal that inhibits certain cytochrome P-450 dependent
      enzymes participating in the synthesis of steroid hormones. Concomitant fraudulent
      administration of testosterone and fluconazole may cause lower steroid concentrations in
      urine, leading to false negatives in the doping control. Thus, fluconazole may be used in
      athletes to mask exogenous steroid administration.

      Hypothesis:

      The oral administration of 12,5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide in healthy subjects allows
      generating detectable concentrations of the drug in urine. Positive urine samples will enable
      to identify analytical strategies for doping control.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: To measure the concentrations of fluconazole in urine for anti-doping
      control samples.

      Secondary objectives: To identify fluconazole metabolites in urine. To explore the time
      window in which the drug or its metabolites can be detected in urine after administration. To
      assess safety and tolerability of the drug used.

      Methods:

      Phase I, open, non-randomized clinical trial, with a treatment condition (fluconazole)
      administered in a single oral dose to 2 subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male volunteers aged between 18 and 45 years.

          -  Able to understand and accept the trial procedures and able to sign an informed
             consent.

          -  History and physical examination that demonstrate not presenting organic or
             psychiatric disorders.

          -  ECG, blood and urine tests performed at screening should be within normal limits.

             opinion of the Principal Investigator, they have no clinical significance, do not pose
             a risk to the subject and do not interfere with the evaluation of the product in
             study. These variations and their nonrelevance will be justified in writing
             specifically.

          -  Body mass index (weight/size^2) between 19 and 25 kg/m2. Subjects with BMI between

             study.

          -  Having participated in another clinical trial with medication in the three months
             prior to the start of the study.

          -  Having donated blood in the 2 months prior to the start of the study.

          -  Having suffered an organic disease or major surgery in the 6 months prior to the start
             of the study.

          -  Background or clinical evidence of cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic,
             endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, dermatological or other
             acute or chronic diseases that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the
             collaborators designated by him, may pose a risk to the subjects, may interfere with
             the objectives of the study or may alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Especially
             in case of seizures or history of epilepsy.

             the Principal Investigator or the collaborators designated by him, do not pose a risk
             to the subjects and do not interfere with the objectives of the study. Treatment with
             single doses of symptomatic medication in the week prior to the study sessions will
             not be exclusive if it is assumed that medication has been completely eliminated on
             the day of the experimental session.

          -  Consumption of more than 40 g of alcohol per day.

          -  Consumers of more than 5 coffees, teas, cola drinks and/or other stimulant drinks
