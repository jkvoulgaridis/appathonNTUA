  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib in patients with adult
      idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM). Half of the patients enrolled onto the study will
      receive 24 weeks of baricitinib from the baseline visit with a 12 week follow-up period. The
      other half of patients will receive barcitinib treatment after an initial 12-week delay with
      a 4 week follow up period for safety.

      Potential participants will attend a screening visit to confirm their eligibility to
      participate in the trial. Once eligibility is confirmed the participant will be randomised to
      receive 24 weeks of baracitinib from the baseline visit with 12 weeks of follow up or receive
      24 weeks of baracitinib after a delayed-start of 12 weeks from the baseline visit.

      Participants will attend study visits every 4 weeks starting at the baseline visit at week 0.
      At each visit data will be collected about the following:

        1. Muscle function

        2. Signs of disease activity

        3. Vital signs

        4. Physical examination

        5. A blood test to check blood count, liver and kidney function and markers of inflammation
           for safety purposes.

        6. Participant reported assessment of how disease disease is progressing and how it affects
           their day-to-day life.

      In addition the following data will be collected at week 0, week 12, week 24 and week 36:

        1. Signs of disease damage

        2. Blood and urine sample collection for biomarker analysis

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomised, treatment-delayed trial design. Participants will be randomised into two arms: participants in one arm will receive 24 weeks of baracitinib treatment from baseline with 12 weeks of follow up; participants in the other arm will have a delayed treatment start for 12 weeks, then will receive 24 weeks of baracitinib treatment with 4 weeks of follow up for safety.</intervention_model_description>

                  and for at least 1 week after treatment (Please see Appendix 3 for definitions
                  and acceptable methods of contraception).

                  8. Current symptoms of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
                  haematological, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological,

                  a manifestation of polymyositis or dermatomyositis.

                  9. Concomitant medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator might
                  place the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in this study.

                  non-melanoma skin cell cancers cured by local resection), including
                  carcinoma-in-situ. Existing non-melanoma skin cell cancers must be removed prior
                  to IMP dosing. Participants with dermatomyositis need to be screened for
                  malignancies according to routine procedures.

                  abuse. Subjects currently taking MTX who admit to consumption of more than an
                  average of 1 alcoholic drink per day.

                  15. Participants with active tuberculosis (TB) requiring treatment within the
                  previous 3 years. Subjects with a positive PPD and/or Quantiferon assay at

                  4 weeks of treatment for latent TB, have a negative chest x-ray at enrolment, and
                  commit to completing the course during the study. Such cases should be discussed
                  with a respiratory physician as per local guidelines. A PPD response that is
                  equal to or greater than 10 mm should be considered a positive test, although
                  more conservative criteria may be applied as determined by the clinical
                  circumstance and investigator according to published guidelines and/or local
                  standards endorsed by the medical society. PPD and/or Quantiferon positive
                  participants who have previously completed treatment for latent tuberculosis
                  according to the local guidelines may be considered for enrolment. Equivocal

                  latent bacterial or viral infections at the screening visit, including subjects
                  with evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, positive HepBsAg,
                  HepBcAb or hepatitis C antibody.

                  18. Significant toxicities associated with concomitant or previous
                  immunosuppressive/biologic therapy that would preclude subjects from
                  participating and completing the study.

                  19. Participants with clinically apparent immunodeficiency syndrome, (IgA
                  deficiency alone is not an exclusion criterion).

                  between 30-60mL/min should receive a reduced oral dose of 2mg baricitinib OD.

               -  Any other laboratory test results that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
                  place the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in this study.

                  21. For participants previously treated with rituximab: B cell levels less than
                  lower limit of normal as measured by Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)
                  analysis.

                  22. For all participants who have received prior rituximab, a normal CD19 B cell
                  count must be documented at the time of screening for this study.

                  23. Participants who have received treatment with any investigational drug within
                  28 days of the first dose of IMP.
