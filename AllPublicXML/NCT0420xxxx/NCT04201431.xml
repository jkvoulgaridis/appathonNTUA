    <textblock>
      This is an Open label, first-in-human, Phase I/IIa, blood-stage P. vivax malaria vaccine
      trial to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the blood-stage Plasmodium vivax
      malaria vaccine candidate PvDBPII in Matrix M1 in healthy adults living in the UK.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/IIa clinical trial is designed to primarily assess the safety of the
      PvDBPII-Matrix M1 vaccine in healthy volunteers and to establish whether the PvDBPII-Matrix
      M1 vaccine can demonstrate a reduced parasite multiplication rate in vaccinated subjects
      compared to infectivity controls in a blood-stage controlled human malaria infection model.

      15 healthy volunteers aged 18-45 will be recruited in England at the Centre for Clinical
      Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford.

      All volunteers will receive three doses of the PvDBPII 50ug/Matrix M1 50ug candidate vaccine
      at monthly intervals prior to blood-stage CHMI 2-4 weeks after the third vaccination

      Volunteers will undergo blood stage CHMI with Plasmodium vivax. 2 further volunteers will be
      recruited to act as back-up volunteers who will be vaccinated but only undergo CHMI if there
      are any last-minute drop-outs from the CHMI group.

      Volunteers in a parallel study (VAC069), who will undergo the same CHMI without prior
      vaccination, will be used as infectivity controls.

      Participants will be followed for approximately 1 year.
