  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators seek to transform the delivery of health care to children with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) and behavioral health problems (and their families) by developing an
      innovative tiered set of interventions. Investigators aim to demonstrate that for children
      with ASD and disruptive behavior a family navigation-based intervention (autism behavioral
      health navigation; ABHN) will be feasible and more acceptable to families than brief social
      work consultation. For children with persistent disruptive behavior despite the social work
      or ABHN intervention Investigators will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of adding
      consultation with an interprofessional team of ASD experts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context: It is often challenging to help families of children with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD) manage disruptive behaviors. Family navigation and interprofessional care are promising
      care strategies that could be applied to care for these children.

      Objectives: Investigators aim to demonstrate that for children with ASD and disruptive
      behavior a family navigation-based intervention (autism behavioral health navigation; ABHN)
      will be feasible and more acceptable to families than brief social work consultation. For
      persistent disruptive behavior despite the social work or ABHN intervention we will evaluate
      the feasibility and acceptability of adding consultation with an interprofessional team of
      ASD experts (Complex Autism Program; CAP).

      Study Design: Investigators will conduct a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial
      (SMART) of social work consultation, ABHN, and ABHN+CAP.

      Setting/Participants:Participants will be children age 5-12 years, diagnosed with an ASD,
      receiving care for ASD at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in the Division of
      Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP), Division of Neurology, or in the Department of
      Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences (DCAPBS), and exhibiting high levels
      of disruptive behaviors (defined as an elevated score on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist
      (ABC) Irritability subscale and an elevated score on the Clinical Global Impression -
      Severity (CGI-S)). A parent of the child involved in coordinating the child's care will also
      be a participant in the study.

      Study Interventions and Measures: Interventions include brief social work consultation, ABHN,
      and an interprofessional evaluation. The primary outcome measure will be the Aberrant
      Behavior Checklist (ABC) Irritability subscale. Secondary measures include the Clinical
      Global Impression - Severity and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I),
      parent ratings of child behavior, parenting stress, and measures of feasibility and
      acceptability.

    <intervention_model_description>Study Phase 1- Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and disruptive behavior will be randomized to social work (SW) or autism behavioral health navigation (ABHN) Study Phase 2- Children who are responding to their Phase 1 intervention will remain in that intervention; children who are not responding to their Phase 1 intervention in the social work arm will be randomly assigned to either ABHN or ABHN+Complex Autism Program (CAP). Those not responding in the ABHN arm will receive ABHN + CAP.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Given the nature of the intervention families will not be blind to the intervention they are receiving. During phase 1 the investigator providing the clinical global impression (CGI) scores will be blind to the child's group assignment. Families will be asked not to discuss their work with a social worker or ABHN when completing interview questions at the interim assessments.</masking_description>

    <description>Prescribing clinicians from the following Divisions and Departments (DBP, Neurology, DCAPBS) will refer patients age 5-12 with ASD and disruptive behavior to the study. The number of children referred will be determined by counting the participants in the study who meet the inclusion criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of families successfully contacted by the navigator or social worker</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of families successfully contacted will be determined by reviewing contact logs of all contacts with the family and who initiated the contact; the duration of all contacts; the location of the contact; and the topic discussed, support provided, or toolkits reviewed.</description>

    <measure>Changes (or Improvement) with interpersonal relationships</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a nine-item measure designed to assess satisfaction with the interpersonal relationship with the navigator or SW. The measure has been shown to have high internal consistency and to be significantly correlated with overall satisfaction with care and not to be correlated with health literacy or patients' primary language</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in ABC-irritability subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To meet eligibility the caregiver completed Aberrant Behavior Checklist-2 (ABC-2) Irritability subscale score needs to be &gt; 13 (above the 50th percentile for children with ASD).This change will be measured by comparing the first stage interventions (SW vs. ABHN) and the change in ABC-irritability subscale score between baseline and the intermediate visit at month 3. At month 3, patients whose ABC Irritability subscale scores demonstrate improvement of at least 5 points (approximately ½ SD; moderate effect size) will remain in the same intervention. Patients whose ABC Irritability subscale scores suggest minimal to no improvement (less than 5 point improvement) will be randomized to either ABHN or ABHN+CAP if they were in the social work group in Phase 1 or will receive ABHN+CAP if they were in the ABHN arm of the study in phase 1. The primary efficacy endpoint for comparing the three embedded regimes will be ABC-irritability subscale at month 6.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in levels of challenging behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the Clinician Global Impression Scales (CGI). The CGI consists of a severity scale (CGI-S) and an Improvement scale (CGI-I). For the CGI-I, clinicians use record review to rate the level of change from the screening/baseline visit (1-3 indicating improvement, 4 indicating no change, 5-7 indicating a worsening of symptoms). The CGI-I will be completed at the 3- and 6-month follow up visits, and will measure the level of improvement compared to the CGI-S taken at screening/baseline.</description>
