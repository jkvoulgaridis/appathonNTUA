  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CanStim consensus working group (multidisciplinary team of experts in rTMS from
      institutions across Canada) developed consensus recommendations for a protocol to deliver
      rTMS as an adjunct to physiotherapy to improve arm function in a Pan-Canadian stroke
      rehabilitation clinical trial. The overall goal of this multi-center feasibility trial is not
      to demonstrate that rTMS is effective, but to demonstrate that each site can recruit the
      assigned number of patients within a certain period, perform the stimulation procedure in
      conjunction with the protocol-specified physiotherapy intervention, complete the therapy
      protocol and enter complete datasets for each patient into the CanStim database. A secondary
      aim is to identify potential weaknesses of the consensus protocol that may need to be
      modified before performing a larger scale trial testing for the efficacy of the intervention.

      Rehabilitation is critical for reducing stroke-related disability. Although intensive
      physiotherapy improves function after a stroke, the frequency and intensity of therapy in a
      standard clinical rehabilitation session is insufficient to invoke these changes.
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe, non-invasive method of stimulating the
      human brain. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) may have the potential to enhance the brain's ability to
      re-learn specific functions and reduce the amount of standard therapy required to achieve
      certain functional gains after stroke. Although two recent multicenter studies have begun to
      test the benefits of applying rTMS during stroke rehabilitation, large scale clinical trials
      demonstrating the efficacy of rTMS for post-stroke functional motor recovery are lacking. The
      use of rTMS interventions in stroke rehabilitation trials has been limited by a lack of
      consensus regarding the optimal protocol for the clinical application of TMS in stroke
      populations. The Canadian Platform for Trials in Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (CanStim) is
      a national platform that aims to facilitate multicenter clinical trials for non-invasive
      brain stimulation interventions to augment recovery from stroke. As a first step, CanStim
      investigators convened a multidisciplinary team of experts in rTMS from institutions across
      Canada to form the CanStim Consensus Working Group and develop consensus recommendations for
      a protocol to deliver rTMS as an adjunct to standard therapy in a national stroke
      rehabilitation clinical trial.

    <time_frame>Baseline Testing done within the first three days then at 1 and 30 days post treatment. The test is scored from 0-57. The higher the score the better the outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>An evaluative measure to assess specific changes in limb function among individuals who sustained cortical damage resulting in hemiplegia. It can assess a patients ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Modified Rankin Scale between baseline, Post Day 1 and Post Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Testing done within the first three days then at 1 and 30 days post treatment. The scale is between 0-6. Zero being no symptoms to 6 the patient is dead. The lower the score the better the outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the activites of daily living in individuals who have suffered a stroke.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure between baseline, Post Day 1 and Post Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Testing done within the first three days then at 1 and 30 days post treatment. Two scores are obtained from each participant, one for performance and one for satisfaction. Each are scored between 0-10. The higher the value the better.</time_frame>
    <description>This measure serves to identify issues of personal importance to the client and to detect changes in a client's self-perception of occupational performance over time.</description>

    <description>Sub-acute stroke patients will be randomized to receive actual rTMS treatment. 1Hz rTMS will be applied over contralesional M1 at an intensity of 120% resting motor threshold once daily for 30 minutes (approximately 1800 pulses) for a total of 15 sessions.</description>

    <description>Sub-acute stroke patients randomized to receive sham rTMS. For sham-stimulation, the TMS coil will be placed over the inter-hemispheric fissure at the vertex and stimulation will be performed with low intensity (10% resting motor threshold). This will cause similar skin sensations as real stimulation but will not induce currents in motor relevant areas.</description>
