  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DupiMorph study evaluates the efficacy of Dupilumab in localized scleroderma patients.
      Dupilumab is approved in the US and EU for the treatment of moderate/severe atopic dermatitis
      and since 2018 in the US for severe asthma therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Localized scleroderma (LS) comprises a heterogenous group of sclerotic skin disorders. The
      incidence of LS is reported to be approximately 27 cases/ 1x106 and is hence approximately
      2-3-fold higher compared to systemic scleroderma. Although in most cases not lethal the
      disease can significantly impact quality of life. Depending on the location of fibrosis, the
      disorder can cause bone deformities, alopecia, skin atrophy or lesions with severe
      hypo-/hyperpigmentation.

      The disease is pathomechanistically poorly understood and no effective therapy is currently
      approved. The most promising treatments up to date include methotrexate ± pulsed
      corticosteroids or phototherapy with PUVA or UVA1. Yet, the number of treated patients in
      these studies is low. The response rates are low and inconsistent with approximately 50% of
      patients treated with UVA1 experience a recurrence within three years. There are no studies
      on efficacy of topical corticosteroids in LS. Small pilot studies and few case reports
      describe regression of lesions after topical calcineurin inhibitors. In addition, current
      therapies can only be applied for a short time during the acute phase due to the side effect
      profile after long-term use (e.g. skin atrophy in response to topical steroids, skin cancer
      in response to long term UV therapy, multiple side effects by long- term use of methotrexate
      and/or corticosteroids). Hence, this study evaluates, in comparison with placebo, the
      efficacy of Dupilumab administered subcutaneously every 14 days in patients with Morphea
      (plaque type) or generalized localized scleroderma (affecting at least three anatomic sites).
