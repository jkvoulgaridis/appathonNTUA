  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature babies have a high risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Early intervention
      approaches are applied to reduce these adverse outcomes or support of developmental delay.
      Early intervention approaches may vary depending on developmental priorities. While some
      early intervention methods can consider body structured findings such as posture, tonus,
      muscle power, others may consider coaching family, enrichment of the environment. The
      explorer baby program is developed based on the trial and error process. The program tries to
      find an answer to a unique question: &quot;how trial behavior in infants can be increased and
      which behaviors of the infants should be supported to increase their trial process?&quot; The
      Explorer baby program tries to increase exploratory motor behaviors to facilitate
      development. For this aim, the program tries to explain how a baby learns new skills such as
      rolling, sitting, babbling, playing peek a boo, etc. in all domains of development while the
      baby lives in their natural environment. This study aims to investigate the effect of the
      explorer baby early intervention program.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of Explorer Baby Early Intervention Program
      on explorative motor behaviors, motor, language, and cognitive skills. The study is designed
      as a randomized controlled trial in which infants and their families are randomly assigned to
      the intervention group (Explorer Baby) or control group (neurodevelopmental therapy),
      stratified by birth weeks and educational level of the mother.

      There is no developmental support program as standard care in Turkey for premature babies. So
      that neither intervention nor the control group doesn't take any other support. There will be
      an average of six intervention sessions during the 6 months intervention period. The
      assessments will take before intervention (T0), after 3 months after T0 (T1) and after six
      months after T0 (T2), corrected age one (T3), corrected age two (T4).

      Intervention: EXPLORatory motor behavior based Early Intervention Program (Explorer Baby) is
      a developmental support program for babies and their families. Parents visit the early
      intervention center with their babies in a variable frequency. The first step of the program
      is to build up interaction between therapists and parents; worries of parents for the
      development of their babies, knowledge about child development, knowledge about play
      behaviors, how babies learn new skills, age-specific requirements of babies, build up
      interaction with babies and family members, describing blocks for development.

      The second step is setting the play in the natural environment working with the family; how
      do families describe the play? If families want to support the ability of their babies
      kicking, reaching, rolling, communicate, or social interaction how should they organize the
      playground? Showing families some examples of enrichment of playground for specific aims.

      The third step is observing babies' reactions; how do families motivate their babies for
      play? How do families encourage their babies for self-starting explorative behaviors? How do
      parents support making the voice of the baby more if the play context is meaningful for
      creating a voice? The program doesn't give specific play homework to improve specific skills.
      The program tries to enrich parents' knowledge about the effect on the behavior of babies in
      meaningful situations.

      The control Group: The control group will take neurodevelopmental therapy. Neurodevelopmental
      therapy is commonly accepted as traditional therapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>This tool will be used to assess the change between the three-time points. These time points are before therapy (T0), during therapy (T1 - 3 months after T0) and after therapy (T2 - 6 months after T0)</time_frame>
    <description>The Bayley III is assessing &quot;Cognitive, Receptive Language, Expressive Language, Fine Motor, Gross Motor&quot;. Bayley III has a raw score, scale score, composite score, and growth percentile score. All of these scores will be given in the study. But only, the growth percentage score will be discussed as both the subareas and the total score as the primary outcome. Because only the percentage of growth gives the baby's level of development exactly day by day. The percentile score is between 0 and 100. A higher score means improvement is better. The changes in the growth percentage in pre-test and post-test (T0-T1, T1-T2, T0-T2) will be examined in-group. Also, the growth percentage scores of two groups will be compared before, during and after the therapy (intergroup). This tool will be used to assess the change between the three-time points.</description>

    <measure>Age and Stage Questionnaire 2 (ASQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>This tool will be used to assess the change between the three-time points. These time points are before therapy (T0), during therapy (T1 - 3 months after T0) and after therapy (T2 - 6 months after T0)</time_frame>
    <description>The Ages and Stages Questionnaire 2 (ASQ-2) is a widely used screening tool for infants and young children's development assessing development in five domains: Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving and Personal Social. It is is originally a parent-completed questionnaire and it includes six questions for every developmental area. There are three options for the answer &quot;Yes (10 points), Sometimes (5 points), No (0 points)&quot;. The raw score is between 0 to 60 points. High points mean better development. The study will use the raw score of all developmental areas. The age range of ASQ-2 is 3 months to 72 months meaning the ASQ-2 will not be used for children younger than 3 months. Post-tests (T1-T2) results will be used for discrimination (according to the parent's view) between children with developmental delays and developing typically in two groups.</description>

    <measure>Parent Stress Index-4-Short Form (PSI SF-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>This tool will be used to assess the change between the three-time points. These time points are before therapy (T0), during therapy (T1 - 3 months after T0) and after therapy (T2 - 6 months after T0)</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is assessing &quot;Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, Difficult Child&quot; subheadings. High points are mean high-stress behaviour. The raw score is between 36 to 180 points. There are no cut scores in the Turkish version of PSI-4 SF. The changes in the raw scores in pre-test and post-test (T0-T1, T1-T2, T0-T2) will be examined in-group. Also, the raw scores of two groups will be compared before, during and after the therapy (intergroup). This tool will be used to assess the change between the three-time points.</description>

    <measure>Infant Movement Motivation Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>The Questionnaire is assessing four subheadings with 27 items: &quot;Activity, exploration, motivation, adaptability&quot;. There are no cut scores in these in the Turkish version of the questionnaire. High points mean better development. The raw score is between 27 to 135 points. The changes in the raw scores in pre-test and post-test (T0-T1, T1-T2, T0-T2) will be examined in-group. Also, the raw scores of two groups will be compared before, during and after the therapy (intergroup). This tool will be used to assess the change between the three-time points.</description>
