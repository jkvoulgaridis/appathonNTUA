      The IVY project focuses on improving combination 10 vaccine rates for Tennessee children
      through an educational and quality improvement intervention rolled out through a
      stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.

      The proposed work seeks to improve Combination 10 vaccination rates for Tennessee children at
      2 years of age through the development and implementation of a new program, Improving
      Vaccination for Young Children (IVY). Through a collaboration with the Cumberland Pediatrics
      Foundation (CPF), a non-profit company focused on improving health care services for
      Tennessee's children, investigators plan to adapt and disseminate existing CoVER educational
      materials for community pediatric providers and clinical staff, and develop and implement
      targeted quality improvement (QI) initiatives.

      A.3. Specific Objectives:

        1. Design interactive web-based modules individualized for two groups (pediatric providers
           and pediatric clinical staff) to educate on key vaccine topics. Modules will include
           information related to 1) diseases vaccines are targeting, including influenza 2)
           vaccine contraindications, common misconceptions, and vaccine safety, 3) communication
           techniques, 4) vaccine schedules and catch up rules, and 5) exemptions, school
           requirements, and practice dismissal.

        2. Design an in-person QI coaching session incorporating key drivers for improved
           vaccination rates. The session will be developed using the 4Pillars™ Practice
           Transformation Program (4Pillars™) and will include introduction of 1) acute visits for
           vaccine catch up, 2) team-based care practices, 3) standing vaccination record review
           and vaccination orders, and 4) reminder/recall systems.

        3. Implement educational modules and QI coaching session at specific time points within the
           context of a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT). Combination 10 [(Combo
           10)] vaccine rates will be collected monthly from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of
           recruited practices for eligible children turning 2 years of age. Vaccine rates will be
           compared between practices monthly within the SW-CRT design. Rates will also be
           evaluated by practice over time.

    <intervention_model_description>Intervention effectiveness on improving vaccination rates will be evaluated using a SW-CRT. 36 Eight practices (clusters) will eventually be randomized to receive the IVY intervention over a 13-month study period. Patients are clustered within practices, and outcomes will be assessed on cross-sectional samples of individuals at each practice at 13 discrete, monthly time points. There will be a baseline block of two months where all practices will be in the control group (Figure 3). Following this, two practices will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention (Group 1). Two months after initiation of IVY in Group 1, two practices will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention in Group 2. This will be continued for 4 total Groups. There will be a five-month block after implementing IVY in all practices where data will continue to be collected after all have been assigned to receive the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
