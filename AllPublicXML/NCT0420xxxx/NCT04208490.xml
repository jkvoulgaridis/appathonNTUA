  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have been treated for head and neck cancer (HNC survivors) can experience serious
      consequences from their cancer and its treatment, ongoing risks of new cancers, and other
      unrelated illnesses. These concerns pose challenges to the provision of comprehensive care to
      HNC survivors. We created HN-STAR to facilitate and tailor the ongoing care of HNC survivors.
      Survivors use HN-STAR on a computer or tablet to answer questions about symptoms and health
      concerns before a routine visit with a cancer care provider. During the clinic visit, the
      provider uses HN-STAR to see evidence-based recommendations for managing each concern
      reported by the survivor. The provider and survivor discuss recommendations and select
      appropriate actions (e.g., testing, referrals, prescriptions, self-management). HN-STAR
      produces a survivorship care plan that includes all reported concerns and the actions
      selected in clinic. The survivorship care plan is given to the survivor and the primary care
      provider. Three months, six months, and nine months later, the survivor uses HN-STAR from
      home (or clinic) to report their concerns again, and a new survivorship care plan is created
      each time.

      Our trial randomizes ≥30 oncology practices from the National Community Oncology Research
      Program to use HN-STAR or provide usual care to 350 recent survivors of head and neck cancer.
      We hypothesize that survivors in the HN-STAR arm will have greater improvement in
      patient-centered outcomes (including cancer-related well-being, symptoms, and patient
      activation) over one year compared to survivors in the usual care arm, measured by surveys at
      baseline and one year later. We also hypothesize that survivors in the HN-STAR arm will be
      more likely to receive care that is aligned with evidence-based recommendations during the
      year of the study than survivors in the usual care arm. Our final aim investigates the
      implementation of HN-STAR in clinical practice, using interviews and surveys of survivors,
      providers, and other clinic staff to understand the feasibility, acceptability,
      appropriateness, and other aspects of providing survivorship care to head and neck cancer
      survivors.

    <description>Measured using domains and overall measures from the FACT H&amp;N. The total score evaluates overall QoL in Head and Neck Cancer patients and ranges from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating better overall QoL. Subscales are calculated by summing the relevant questions [answered using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much)].

    <ipd_description>Wake Forest NCORP Research Base is committed to following the NIH Statement on Sharing Research Data (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html). As of July 2018, the WF NCORP RB signed an agreement with NCI to contribute de-identified data and data dictionaries from clinical trials conducted through our RB to the NCI NCTN/NCORP data archive within 6 months of primary and non-primary publications of phase II/III and phase III trials to https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/. This will become the primary means for sharing raw data, and we will adhere to the guidelines spelled out in the NCTN/NCORP Data Archive Usage Guide. De-identified data from studies not covered by the agreement (e.g., phase II and observational studies) will be made available upon request. All data files will be de-identified. De-identification procedures will meet the HIPAA criteria as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 45, Section 164.514.</ipd_description>
