  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I/II, single center, prospective, open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized,
      interventional, cohort study in which low risk living donor liver transplant (LDLT)
      recipients who are between 1 and 3 years after transplantation and meet specific criteria (no
      DSA, no clinically treated rejection within 2 years preceding enrollment, permissive liver
      function tests (LFTs) within 30 days preceding enrollment, no prior liver biopsy showing
      significant fibrosis or ductopenia*) will be enrolled and will undergo a protocol liver
      biopsy unless they have had a permissive liver biopsy** within 90 days of anticipated
      immunosuppression weaning. Those patients with permissive liver biopsy** will then receive a
      single infusion of donor-derived DCreg and will remain on their current standard of care
      (SOC) immunosuppression. One week after DCreg infusion, immunosuppression weaning will be
      initiated. Recipients will be slowly weaned off immunosuppression. Successfully weaned
      participants who remain rejection-free will undergo 3 years of follow-up after the last dose
      of immunosuppression. They will undergo a liver biopsy at 1 yr and 3 yrs after
      immunosuppression withdrawal. Participants who are removed from the study protocol at any
      time will return to standard of care but will continue to be followed by the study team and
      will undergo a liver biopsy at the end of the study.

      * Permissive LFTs are defined as ALT, AST and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of
      normal.

      **A permissive biopsy is based on 2016 Comprehensive Update of the Banff Working Group on
      Liver Allograft Pathology (the criteria detailed in Table 8, Demetris et al. 2016).
