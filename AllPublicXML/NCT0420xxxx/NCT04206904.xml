  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the first part of this study the prevalence of frailty in patients with cardiovascular
      disease will be examined. Frailty is defined as a progressive age-related decline in
      physiological systems that results in decreased reserves of intrinsic capacity, which confers
      extreme vulnerability to stressors. Patients (â‰¥65 years, men and women) suffering from heart
      failure or undergoing a coronary artery bypass grafing (CABG) or percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) will be included. Based on the phenotype of Fried, frailty will be
      examined in the physical domain. Moreover, the nutritional, social, psychological and
      cognitive domain of frailty will be examined. This will result in a total score of 0 (no
      frailty) to 24 (severe frailty), divided into four categories: no frailty (score 0-6), minor
      frailty (score 7-12), moderate frailty (score 13-18) or severe frailty (score 18-24).

      Besides this frailty protocol, a few other measurements will be completed to collect
      additional information about the functioning of the patient.

      At discharge from the hospital, some of these patients will start with a cardiac
      rehabilitation program. To define the exercise intensity of this program, patients will
      perform a maximal exercise test (CPET). In the second part of this study, correlations will
      be examined between markers of frailty and markers of exercise from the CPET (e.g. maximal
      heart rate, maximal oxygen uptake).
