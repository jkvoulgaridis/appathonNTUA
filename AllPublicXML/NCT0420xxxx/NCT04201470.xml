  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system include various disorders of
      which multiple sclerosis is the most common. Besides multiple sclerosis, other distinct
      disorders including for example anti-AQP4 (aquaporine-4) and anti-MOG (Myelin oligodendrocyte
      glycoprotein) NMOSD (Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder) have been well characterized and
      are now known to be distinct from MS.

      some patient belonging to MS spectrum have recently being characterized but unusual MRI
      findings have mimicking inherited leukoencephalopathies and leukodystrophies.

      Whether these patients with atypical phenotype represent a separate disease distinct from MS
      or belong to MS spectrum is not clear.

      The objectives are to evaluate a series of 15 patients with atypical forms of MS using
      non-conventional MRI techniques and biological biomarkers (serum neurofilaments light chain)
      and to compare them with classical MS patients (15 relapsing remitting patients and 15
      progressive patients) and 15 controls. the hypothesize is that these patients with atypical
      MS have a more severe neurodegenerative process.
