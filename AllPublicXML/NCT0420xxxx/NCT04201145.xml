  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new drug combination of Pembrolizumab and Defactinib
      followed by surgical resection possible treatment for resectable Malignant Pleural
      Mesothelioma (MPM).

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Pembrolizumab

        -  Defactinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits.

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Pembrolizumab

        -  Defactinib

      The Investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have Malignant
      Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), not everyone who participates in this research study will receive
      the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who
      have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated.

      The dose of the study drug, pembrolizumab, will not change no matter when the participant is
      enrolled into the study.

      The order in which the participant is enrolled to the study will determine the cohort
      assigned to:

        -  Run-In Cohort: Pembrolizumab only followed by surgery

        -  Cohort 1: Pembrolizumab and defactinib followed by surgery

        -  Cohort 2: Pembrolizumab and defactinib followed by surgery

        -  Expansion Cohort: Pembrolizumab and defactinib at the maximum dose as determined from
           the previous cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2)

        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved defactinib as a treatment
           for any disease.

        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved pembrolizumab for this
           specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
