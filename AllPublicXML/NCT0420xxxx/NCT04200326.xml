  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will use novel technologies to collect information about the patient
      experience before and early after starting Fasenra (benralizumab) as standard of care for
      severe uncontrolled asthma in a real-world setting, to determine how the experience changes
      over time. Any detection of an early, subjective first-dose effect in this pilot study will
      be further validated in a larger follow-up study.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Explore the use of novel technologies to detect early changes in quality
      of life (QoL) within the first 4 weeks after first dose of Fasenra for the treatment of
      severe uncontrolled asthma.

      ENDPOINTS: Improvement in QoL measures, and physical and mental well-being as assessed by an
      increase in positive facial expressions, positive keywords, and quality of life biomarkers,
      with a decrease in asthma symptoms and improvement in FEV1 and PEF within the first 4 weeks
      after beginning Fasenra.

      TARGET POPULATION: Individuals aged 18-75 years with severe asthma uncontrolled (ACQ &gt;=1.5)
      on current medications (HD-ICS/LABA with/without other maintenance therapies except
      biologics). Patients beginning Fasenra asstandard of care as specified by NICE guidelines.

      STUDY DURATION: The study duration per patient will be approximately 6 weeks from the
      enrolment visit to end of recorded data. Subjects will record data for 2 weeks prior to their
      first injection with Fasenra and then for 4 more weeks post-injection. PROCEDURESPatients
      will be required to visit the study site 3 times (enrolment and onboarding visit, Fasenra
      injection visit, last visit), and perform daily tasks at home in between site visits

    <description>Evaluate if the PROACT system can detect early signs of changes in quality of life (QoL) using sentiment analysis to determine changes in peoples' emotions as a subjective measure of first-dose effects of a medication. the score should be the positivity of the expression, scaled from 0 (the most negative) to 1.0 (totally positive).</description>

    <description>Evaluate if the PROACT system can detect early signs of changes in quality of life (QoL) using emotion confidence score to determine changes in peoples' emotions as a subjective measure of first-dose effects of a medication. Emotion confidence score should be the confidence (probability) of the predicted emotion given by the machine learning model. The scores will be scaled proportionally to have a sum of 1.0 for each frame of the video.</description>

    <description>Evaluate if the PROACT system can detect early signs of changes in quality of life (QoL) using key phrase extraction to determine changes in peoples' emotions as a subjective measure of first-dose effects of a medication.

    <measure>Message analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate if the PROACT system can detect early signs of changes in quality of life (QoL) using message analysis to determine changes in peoples' emotions as a subjective measure of first-dose effects of a medication. The message analysis will define:
The topic - what it is that the participant is trying to share. This is coded using an evolving, hierarchical, lexicon.
The impact - if reported, the impact that this is having on the participant is also coded. An interpreted impact color scale (green-amber-red) is also applied by the analysts to aid quick identification of the most, and least, impactful things.
The outcome - if reported, what the person did as a result of what happened. This is also coded so that it can also be aggregated across patients.</description>

    <measure>ACQ-6 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Association between any onset of effect seen for PROACT measures and PRO ACQ-6, using the ACQ-6 score. Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by responding to 6 questions. Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and &lt;1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥1.5 indicates not well-controlled asthma.</description>

    <measure>SGRQ Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks from Fasenra injection</time_frame>
    <description>Association between any onset of effect seen for PROACT measures and PRO SQRQ, using the SGRQ Score. The SGRQ is a 50-item PRO instrument developed to measure the health status of patients with airway obstruction diseases. The questionnaire is divided into 2 parts: part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severity of respiratory symptoms in the preceding 4 weeks; part 2 consists of 42 items related to the daily activity and psychosocial impacts of the individual's respiratory condition.
The SGRQ yields a total score and 3 domain scores (symptoms, activity, and impacts). The total score indicates the impact of disease on overall health status. This total score is expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, in which 100 represents the worst possible health status and 0 indicates the best possible health status. Likewise, the domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>daily UMotif measure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Association between any onset of effect seen in the daily uMotif measures and the ACQ-6 and SQRQ/lung function measurements will be assessed. The UMotif Quality of Life questionnaire consists of 10 separate 5 point Likert scale questions. Of these, 8 are required questions, and the remaining 2 are chosen at enrolment by patients from a choice of 4 possible questions. Responses to each of these questions will be compared to their own baseline at enrolment to derive personalized metrics. A composite metric will also be created by appropriately combining the individual question responses.
The required 8 questions will be summarized descriptively by day. The 2 optional questions that patients report daily will be reported descriptively.</description>
