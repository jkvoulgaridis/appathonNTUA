        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Personally submitted written voluntary informed consent to participate in the study;

          2. Chinese adult ≥20 and &lt;40 years of age at informed consent;

          3. BMI ≥18.5 kg/m2 and &lt;25.0 kg/m2 at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Subjects with present illness requiring treatment;

          2. Subjects in whom the serum Ca concentration, as measured at pretreatment (screening
             and Day −1) blood chemistry examination, is below the lower limit of the in-house
             reference value;

          3. Subjects in whom a clinically significant abnormality in the crystalline lens is noted
             at a pre-study ophthalmological examination;

          4. Subjects with urinary tract lithiasis or its past history;

             acceptable);

          7. Subjects with mental disorder or its past history;

          8. Subjects who have alcohol/drug dependence or tested positive for any of the drug abuse

             significant abnormality or an electrocardiographic waveform shape unfit for QT
             interval measurement;

         13. Subjects who tested positive for any of the infection test items;

         14. Subjects who have used any drugs (including over-the-counter drugs, external

         15. Subjects who have smoked a cigarette or used a treatment aid to smoking cessation
             (including nicotine-containing product chewing/ingestion and nicotine-containing
             patches) within 2 weeks before initiation of the study drug administration;

         16. Subjects who have participated in a clinical study of a drug and practically received
             the drug within 4 months before initiation of the study drug administration;

         17. Subjects who, within 3 months before initiation of the study drug administration, have
             been hospitalized, undergone surgery, or undergone collection of at least 200 mL of
             blood (including blood donation and blood component donation);

         18. Subjects who did not consent to use an effective contraceptive (e.g., use of condoms)
             alone or in combination between the day of hospitalization and 3 months after the end
             of the study drug administration;

         19. Pregnant, lactating, possibly pregnant subjects/women (subjects/women of childbearing
             potential with positive pregnancy test at screening or Day −1, or with negative
             pregnancy test at screening and Day −1 not using any contraceptive methods), or
             unwilling to use adequate contraception according to the physician's instructions.
             Amenorrhea for ≥12 months after the last menstrual period without an alternative
             medical cause is considered as non-childbearing potential;

         20. Prior exposure to KHK7580;

         21. Other conditions unfit for participation in this study at the discretion of the
