  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The balance, gait and pain in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) study will aim to
      investigate the link between balance and gait impairment, and high rates of pain in people
      with COPD. This cross-sectional observational study will compare balance and gait outcomes
      for people with COPD who have pain, to those who are pain free.

    <measure>Balance Evaluations Systems Test (BESTest)</measure>
    <time_frame>20-30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>BESTest is a quantitative assessment tool that identifies disordered systems underlying postural control that are responsible for poor functional balance. It was developed for clinicians to differentiate balance problems into six underlying systems that may constrain balance. It was developed from the theoretical understanding of balance control systems based on Bernstein's concept that postural control results from a set of interacting systems. It has 36 items that evaluate performance of 6 balance systems: bio-mechanical constraints, stability limits/verticality, anticipatory responses, postural responses, sensory orientation, and stability in gait. A higher score indicates better balance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes (for additional items not featured within the BESTest</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function. A total score of 56 is available, higher scores indicate better balance.</description>

    <measure>30 second sit to stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 Second Sit to Stand Test is also known as 30 second chair stand test, and tests leg strength and endurance in older adults. A higher number of completed sit to stands in 30 seconds indicates better lower limb endurance.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory is a pain questionnaire which measures the severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week. Each item is measured on 0-10 scale, 0 being no pain and 10 being the maximum pain score available.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a questionnaire that combines information on leisure, household and occupational activity. The PASE assesses the types of activities typically chosen by older adults (walking, recreational activities, exercise, housework, yard work, and caring for others. It uses frequency, duration, and intensity level of activity over the previous week to assign a score, ranging from 0 to 793, with higher scores indicating greater physical activity.</description>
