    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of mechanical stimulation technique compared to
      massages on pain level and functional discomfort (on the mobility of the shoulder) after 6
      months, in breast cancer needing physiotherapy, following a total mastectomy and exploratory
      axillary surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, monocentric, randomized, open-labelled in two parallel groups study that
      evaluates the effectiveness of mechanical stimulation technique compared to massages on pain
      level and functional discomfort (on the mobility of the shoulder) after 6 months in breast
      cancer patients needing physiotherapy, following a total mastectomy and exploratory axillary
      surgery.

      Other objectives of the study include:

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of mechanical stimulation technique compared to massages on pain
           and functional discomfort (on the mobility of the shoulder) 15 days after the end of
           physiotherapy.

        -  Evaluate the impact of mechanical stimulation on the quality of life of patients, in
           comparison to those receiving massages

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>at the baseline and 6 months after</time_frame>
    <description>Will be evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of a list of questions to determine the level of anxiety and depression experienced by the patients. Each question is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression:
A score equal to or less than 7 indicates no symptoms,
A score of 8 - 10 indicates a questionable symptoms,
A score of 11 and above confirms of the presence of anxiety and/or depression symptoms</description>

In this questionnaire, the items are scored from 1-4, where 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much.
Only 2 items in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire are scored from 1-7, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent.</description>
