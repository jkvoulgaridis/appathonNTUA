      Postpartum hemorrhage and its complications are very well known causes for maternal mortality
      and morbidity especially in developing countries. World Health Organization Recommendations
      for Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL), on 2012 included the use of
      uterotonics for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) during the third stage of labor
      for all births. Tranexamic acid (TA) is antifibrinolytic agent used to decrease blood loss in
      surgery and health conditions associated with increased bleeding.

      A Cochrane Systematic Review from the best available evidence to determine whether TA is
      effective and safe for preventing PPH in comparison to placebo or no treatment the review
      concluded that TA (in addition to uterotonic medications) decreases blood loss postpartum and
      prevents PPH and blood transfusions following vaginal birth and abdominal delivery in women
      at low risk of PPH based on studies of mixed quality. There was insufficient evidence to draw
      conclusions about serious side effects and the effects of TA on venous thromboembolic events
      and mortality beside its use in high-risk women was not investigated on
