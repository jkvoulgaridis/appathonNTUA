  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will address a well-known neurological disorder for which there are limited
      effective treatments and an urgent need to find an efficacious management that could help
      prevent, or at least slow down the progress of this major public health problem.

      The study is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the
      efficacy of intravenous [21CFR640.30] Plasma from young, volunteer donors between the ages of
      18 - 25 years (yFFP - young Fresh Frozen Plasma) at 12.5 ml/kg in each of two doses, one day
      apart (25 ml/kg total).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease

          -  Disease duration of 1 to 5 years

          -  Failure to respond (poor efficacy or unacceptable side effects) to drugs recommended
             for the treatment

          -  Willingness to confirm the use of adequate birth control while on the trial will be
             required in premenopausal women without evidence for an inability to become pregnant.

          -  Willingness to not start any other treatment for Parkinson's or Multiple Sclerosis
             during the parallel part of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other significant disease, which in the view of the study doctor may make assessment
             of the efficacy of yFFP difficult.

          -  Unstable medical conditions.

          -  Must weigh at least 45.5 kg. Cannot weigh more than 130 kg.

          -  A severe disease state diagnosis

          -  Litigation. Patients in litigation will be excluded only if conclusion of that
             litigation is imminent during the course of the study.

          -  If patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Complete IgA deficiency.

          -  Rare contraindications to yFFP therapy as per summary of product characteristics.

          -  Receiving yFFP for other reasons.

          -  Ongoing drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Psychiatric disorder that could, in the judgement of the site investigator, interfere
             with successful study participation.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to complete the study or an inability to understand the
             questionnaires being used.

          -  Cancer other than basal cell carcinoma within the last 5 years. However, those
             patients who have received definitive treatment, such as curative surgery more than 6
             months ago, with no known recurrence can be included.

          -  A history of hypercoagulable or thrombophilic clotting abnormalities.

          -  A history of thrombembolic events: ischaemic stroke, confirmed myocardial infarction,
             pulmonary embolism; deep venous thrombosis except where immobility related (for
             example, after injury or operation).

          -  Unstable angina pectoris.

          -  Medications that might react with yFFP such as blood thinners

          -  Renal failure or serum creatinine greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal at
             screening.

          -  Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make it unsafe
             for the patient to participate or which would interfere with assessment of the outcome
             measures.

          -  Participation in another interventional trial within 3 months of randomization.
             Participation in non-interventional studies is not a reason for exclusion.
