  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study looks at the blood levels of a new study medicine in people with normal and
      impaired kidney function. Participants will get the study medicine called NNC0174-0833. This
      is an experimental medicine and has not been approved by the US FDA. It is being developed as
      a new medicine for weight management. Participants will get 1 injection of the study medicine
      by a study nurse at the clinic. The injection will be with a needle in a skin fold in the
      stomach area. The study will last for about 9 weeks. Participants will have about 7 visits
      with the study staff or the doctor. At the visits, participants will have clinical checks
      done and blood samples taken. Participants will be collecting their urine several times
      during the study. Participants will be asked about their health, medical history and habits.
      People who are already in another research study cannot take part. Only women who are not
      able to become pregnant can take part in the study. Only men who do not plan to father a
      child during the study or 6 weeks following the dose administration can take part in the
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female of non-childbearing potential, aged 18-80 years (both inclusive) at the
             time of signing informed consent.

          -  Meeting the pre-defined GFR criteria using estimated GFR (eGFR) based on serum
             creatinine for any of the renal function groups:

          -  For subjects with normal renal function: eGFR of equal to or above 90 mL/min

          -  For patients with mild renal impairment: eGFR of 60-89 mL/min

          -  For patients with moderate renal impairment: eGFR of 30-59 mL/min

          -  For patients with severe renal impairment: eGFR of &lt;30 mL/min not requiring dialysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any disorder, which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety or
             compliance with the protocol.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, or non-routine vitamins, which at the
             investigators judgement may affect subject safety or the results of the trial.
