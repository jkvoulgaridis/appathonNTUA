  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the neuroanatomical effects of ketamine treatment
      on patients with treatment-resistant depression. The investigators will compare the
      neuroimaging of patients several days before and after injection in order to assess the more
      durable changes induced by ketamine. In addition, changes in perfusion will be analyzed, in
      addition to changes in neurovascular coupling, and functional connectivity that are
      correlated with psychiatric measures.

    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a prospective data analysis of patient response to the use
      of ketamine to treat treatment-resistant depression. For Phase I trail, 10 patients of any
      gender with an age range of 18 to 70 who have undergone the outlined procedure will be
      recruited for inclusion. Patients will be examined by the principle investigator. All
      patients must be diagnosed with persistent treatment-resistant depression and prescribed
      ketamine. Patients will be accepted regardless of if the depression coincided with anxiety
      and/or pain. Patient status will be assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck
      Anxiety Inventory, and Brief Pain Inventory. Patients must have a Beck Depression Inventory
      score of 10 or above. These scores will be used as baseline data. Patients will be offered
      the option of participating in the study and provided informed consent for neuroimaging
      before and after the ketamine treatment.

      A week before the scheduled ketamine treatment, the patients will have fMRI scans, including
      structural T1, Arterial Spin Labeling, and Resting BOLD. The scans take around 30 minutes at
      no charge to the patients. The ketamine will be injected per the doctor's orders to achieve a
      dissociative state; dosages varies between 75mg - 1000mg depending on every individual's
      unique treatment plan. The same scans will be taken two days after treatment.

    <description>T1-data was collected as a sagittal MPRAGE sequence. T1 images are corrected for field biasing and then skull stripped and linearly registered to standard MNI space. Each patients' T1 image is segmented into 100 cortical and 15 subcortical areas using the Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical structural atlas. Mean volume is computed for each of these regions for each patient, which can be used for quantitative comparison.</description>

    <description>The BDI-II is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory. Each question involves four possible responses, ranging in intensity from &quot;0&quot; (this item does not apply) to &quot;3&quot; (this item applies severely). The test is scored as the sum of all of the response values; this number is used to determine the severity of depressive symptoms. A score of 0 to 3 is possible for each question with a maximum total score of 63 points. The standard cutoff scores are as follows: 0-13 total points = minimal depression; 14-19 total points = mild depression; 20-28 total points = moderate depression; and 29-63 total points = severe depression. A reduction in the total score by at least 30% is considered to be clinically significant.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days prior to treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety symptoms. Each of the 21 items asks whether the patient has experienced various anxiety symptoms in the last two weeks, and if so, how severely. Each question/answer is scored on a scale value of &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The maximum total score possible is 63 points. The standard cutoff scores are: 0-7 = minimal anxiety; 8-15 = mild anxiety; 16-25 = moderate anxiety; 26-63 = severe anxiety. A reduction in score by at least 30% is considered clinically meaningful.</description>
