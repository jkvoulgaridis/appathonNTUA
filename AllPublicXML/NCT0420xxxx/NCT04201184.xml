  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop, adapt and evaluate an intergenerational
      prevention intervention, named &quot;Wa'Kan Ye'Zah (Little Holy One),&quot; with Native American
      caregivers on a Northern Plains reservation and the caregivers' 3-to-5-year-old children. The
      intervention aims to: 1) reduce symptoms of historical trauma and everyday stress among
      parents/caregivers, 2) improve parenting, and 3) improve children's emotional and behavioral
      developmental outcomes to reduce future risk for suicide and substance use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific premise of this work is rooted in understanding that high rates of historical
      and current trauma in Native communities compromise caregivers' mental health and parenting,
      which in turn affect early childhood behavior problems and adverse events that increase
      children's risk for suicide and substance use in adolescent and young adulthood.

      Wa'Kan Ye'Zah will combine adapted elements of: 1) Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA),
      an evidence-based intervention proven effective to reduce stress, depression and
      trauma-related symptoms, 2) Family Spirit, an evidence-based parent training program to
      promote positive early child development in Native American communities, and 3) cultural
      components informed by tribal-specific risk and protective factors for suicide and substance
      abuse identified in community-based studies that led to this proposal. The intervention will
      consist of 12 weekly individual lessons taught to parents and children (ages 3 to 5) at Head
      Start facilities by indigenous community health workers, a delivery strategy selected to
      enhance participant engagement, local acceptability and sustainability.

      This study will use a randomized control trial (RCT) with an embedded single-case
      experimental design (SCED) to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on mental
      health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while empirically exploring
      the added benefit of specific cultural components on parent/caregiver outcomes. on mental
      health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while exploring the added
      benefit of cultural components on parent outcomes. The study plan is situated within a
      well-established trust relationship with tribal communities, innovative formative research
      that led to this proposal, and an experienced, multi-disciplined study team led by an
      Indigenous Principle Investigator.
