  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of INCMGA00012 in combination
      with chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in participants with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will randomize approximately 360 participants in a 2:1 ratio
      into the INCMGA00012 in combination with CRT followed by consolidation therapy with
      INCMGA00012 treatment group and placebo in combination with CRT followed by consolidation
      therapy with placebo treatment group.
