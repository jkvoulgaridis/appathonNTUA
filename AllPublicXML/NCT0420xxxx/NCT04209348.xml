  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial will be conducted among women diagnosed
      with gestational diabetes (GDM) and referred to the High Risk Obstetric Consultants (HiROC)
      at the University of Tennessee Medical Center Knoxville (UTMCK). The trial will be called
      Project Wellness. It will compare a physical activity (behavior change) intervention (i.e.,
      walking/stepping in place) versus a general wellness intervention (e.g., health education
      focusing on immunizations, contraceptive options following delivery, etc.) on physical
      activity levels, maternal glycemic profile in the third trimester, and infant size and
      anthropometric measurements soon after birth (i.e., weight, length, circumference,
      skinfolds). It is hypothesized that the physical activity intervention will increase physical
      activity levels, and improve maternal glycemic profile and infant anthropometric measures at
      birth. It is also hypothesized that maternal glycemic profile in the third trimester will be
      associated with infant anthropometric measurements at birth.

    <description>The behavioral physical activity (PA) intervention focuses on walking, or stepping in place when it is not possible to walk (e.g., stormy weather). The primary goal of the PA intervention is to achieve at least 30 minutes per day of walking/stepping in place. The secondary goal is to use a PA tracker (e.g., the Fitbit Charge 3 provided by the intervention) to log and review walking/stepping, and to accumulate at least 3,000 steps during their 30 minutes of walking/stepping each day.</description>
