  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of real-time auxiliary system based on
      artificial intelligence algorithm in lesion detection and quality control in magnetically
      controlled capsule endoscopy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) has been used in clinical practice for
      gastric examination, with high sensitivity and specificity of 90.4% and 94.7%, respectively.

      Therefore, a real-time auxiliary system based on convolutional neural network deep learning
      framework was developed to assist clinicians to improve the quality in MCE examinations.

      Patients referred for magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) in the participating
      center were prospectively enrolled. After passage through the esophagus, physician will
      finish the gastric examination under magnetic steering with the real-time auxiliary system.
      Professional operators guarantee the integrity of the examination and the diagnostic results
      of professional endoscopist was used as the gold standard. The system diagnosis results was
      recorded at the same time. The sensitivity, delay time, specificity of lesions and anatomical
      landmarks will be analyzed.

    <description>The patients swallowed the MCE with a small amount of water in the left lateral decubitus position. Once the capsule reached the stomach after investigating the esophagus, it was lifted away from the posterior wall, rotated and advanced to the fundus and cardiac regions, and then to the gastric body, angulus, antrum and pylorus. The magnetic steering time for passing through the pylorus was not allowed more than 15 min. The real-time auxiliary system implemented real-time processing for the output image of MCE system. Professional operators guarantee the integrity of the examination and the diagnostic results of professional endoscopist was used as the gold standard. The system diagnosis results was recorded at the same time. The sensitivity, delay time, specificity of lesions and anatomical landmarks will be analyzed.</description>
