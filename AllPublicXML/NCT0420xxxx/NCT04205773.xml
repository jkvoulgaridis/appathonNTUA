  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the new CompuFlo instrument which allows
      pulsatile waveform recordings.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 epidural catheters previously successfully used for obstetric anesthesia or analgesia and
      about to be removed were tested. All patients were given 5 mL 2% lidocaine to test the
      catheter before its removal. After priming with 5 mL saline, the catheter was connected to
      CompuFlo to record the occurrence of pulsatile waveforms and/or their disappearance during
      its removal. The epidural catheter was marked at the skin level to record the distance
      between the skin at the time of measurements. The power analysis required a sample of 30
      observations to set 80% test power and 95% significance level.

    <description>The epidural catheter was considered to be in the epidural space if the appearance of pulsatile waveforms were observed, and confirmed by the occurrence of L2-3 sensory block after the test dose. The disappearance of the pulsatile waveforms when the catheter was extracted from the epidural space was also noted.</description>
