  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works for the treatment of hematological
      malignancies that have come back (relapsed) or does not respond (refractory) after CAR T cell
      therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then for up to
      5 years.
