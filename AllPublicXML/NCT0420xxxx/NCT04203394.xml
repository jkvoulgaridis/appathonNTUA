    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of Schroth 3D exercise method on home
      symmetry, trunk topography, scapula symmetry, pelvic symmetry, health related quality of life
      and cosmetic deformity perception in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis

      Cobb angle measurement, which is accepted as the gold standard in patients with scoliosis, is
      a radiological measurement. However, in continuous follow-up, the search for other methods to
      obtain objective data that will provide a short term evaluation on the patient in determining
      the efficacy of conservative treatment continues.

      In our study, individuals who meet the criteria will be evaluated at the beginning and end of
      the study. Sociodemographic features and scoliosis characteristics (Cobb angle, degree of
      bone maturation according to Risser, apex, vertebra rotation angle) will be recorded.
      Posterior Trunk Asymmetry Index (POTSI) will be used to determine body asymmetry, and
      topographic measurements will be performed with Artec Eva 3D Scanner and motion analysis will
      be performed with Biomechanical Motion Analysis Sistem (Model is BTS Smart DX100) .
      Individuals will evaluate their cosmetic deformities with the Walter Reed Visual Evaluation
      Scale. Scoliosis Research Society-22 will be used to measure quality of life.

    <description>Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-22) is a simple and practical questionnaire specific to individuals with scoliosis. The questionnaire included pain, self-image, function / activity, mental health and treatment satisfaction. There are 22 questionnaire questions, scoring from 1 to 5. The minimum score is the worst score (22).</description>
