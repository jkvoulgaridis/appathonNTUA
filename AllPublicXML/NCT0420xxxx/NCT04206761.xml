    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment with QVM149, an inhaler that contains three
      types of asthma medications compared to an inhaler that contains two types of asthma
      medications. Both inhalers contain an inhaled corticosteroid, which reduces inflammation in
      the lungs, and a medication that helps to open up the airways. The investigational inhaler,
      QVM149, contains a third medication that also works to open up the airways. The investigators
      will measure the difference in these two treatments with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      using a special technique using xenon gas to show how gas spreads in the lungs. In healthy
      lungs, the gas fills the lungs evenly, but in unhealthy lungs, the gas may fill the lungs
      unevenly and they will appear patchy. The patchy areas are called ventilation defects. A CT
      of the chest will be done to assess the structure of the lungs. The investigators will also
      use lung function testing and questionnaires to evaluate the differences between these
      therapies.

      A single site, two arm, randomized, open-label study in participants with asthma, who
      demonstrate visually obvious ventilation defects despite being on ICS/LABA was chosen to
      evaluate the capability of QVM149 150/50/160 μg once daily as compared to high dose dual
      therapy (ICS/LABA) to improve ventilation heterogeneity. According to the design of the
      study, hyperpolarized Xenon-129 (129Xe) will be used to measure ventilation defects in asthma
      participants as ventilation defect percent (VDP). A low-dose chest CT acquired within a few
      minutes of MRI will provide a way to measure both airway and parenchymal abnormalities. The
      selection of the QVM149 150/50/160 μg was made in order to keep the ICS dose equipotent to
      baseline therapy and to the active comparator arm and to directly compare the addition of a
      long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) versus continuing the therapy with high dose dual
      therapy (ICS/LABA).

      This study will be a single site, two arm, randomized, open-label study with the following
      treatment:

        -  Treatment A: 2-week treatment with Indacaterol/Glycopyrronium/Mometasone 150/50/160 μg
           delivered as powder in hard capsules via Breezhaler, a breath-activated device which
           will deliver a specific dose of medication.

        -  Treatment B: 2-week treatment with high dose dual therapy (ICS/LABA) in any approved
           drug formulation and delivery device. (Continue receiving high dose ICS/LABA therapy at
           the same dose and in the same formulation as at baseline).

      The study will consist of a screening/inclusion period of 1-5 days, followed by a treatment
      period of 14 days. The evaluation team including MRI observers will be blinded to treatment.

      At Visit 101, informed consent will be obtained before any study related assessments or
      procedures are performed. Asthma medications and eligibility criteria will be reviewed.
      Furthermore, at Visit 101, safety assessments including electrocardiography (ECG),
      hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and spirometry to test reversibility will be
      performed. Once the above criteria are met, participants will move on to Visit 102.

      At Visit 102 all additional assessments, including MRI to detect visually obvious ventilation
      defects, low-dose chest CT, and Pulmonary Function Test assessments including spirometry,
      plethysmography, Lung Clearance Index (LCI) and Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) will be
      conducted. Participants who qualify will then be randomized and entered into the 14 days
      treatment period and continue with the assessments according to study protocol. Participants
      will be supplied with open-label Indacaterol/Glycopyrronium/ Mometasone 150/50/160 μg o.d.
      delivered as powder in hard capsules via Breezhaler or continue with their previously
      prescribed high dose dual therapy (ICS/LABA) in any approved drug formulation and delivery
      device, which will be used during the study treatment period and stopped at Visit 201.

      Upon completion of the study treatment period at Visit 201, all participants will undergo
      post-treatment assessments, including MRI, pre- and post-salbutamol pulmonary function
      testing including spirometry, plethysmography, LCI, FOT, and asthma questionnaires.

      A final visit, Visit 301 will be scheduled for safety assessments. All participants will
      undergo vital signs, spirometry, ECG, bloodwork and urinalysis.

                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant). Periodic abstinence (e.g.,
                  calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
                  not acceptable methods of contraception.

               2. Female sterilization (have had surgical tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy
                  with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six
                  weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment.

               3. Vasectomized male partner(s) (at least 6 months prior to Visit 101).

               4. Use hormonal contraception with failure rate &lt;1% (e.g. oral contraceptive pill,
                  Depo-Provera™ injections, Erva Patch™ or Nuvaring™).

               5. Placement of an MRI safe intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

        In case of use of hormonal contraception, women should have been stable on the same
        pharmacological agent for a minimum of 3 months before Visit 101. Women are considered
        post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural
        (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate,
        history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
        only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone
        level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.
