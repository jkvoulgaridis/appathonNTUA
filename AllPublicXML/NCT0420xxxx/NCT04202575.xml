      The study aim was to evaluate if an additional separate venous reservoir eliminates
      CO2-insufflation induced hypercapnia and keeps sweep gas flow of the oxygenator constant
      during open heart surgery.

      Background: CO2-gas insufflation is used for continuous de-airing during open heart surgery.
      The study aim was to evaluate if an additional separate venous reservoir eliminates
      CO2-insufflation induced hypercapnea and keeps sweep gas flow of the oxygenator constant.

      Methods: A separate small reservoir are used during CPB in addition to a standard large
      venous reservoir. The small reservoir receive drained wound blood and CO2-gas continuously
      via a suction drain (1 L/min) and handheld suction devices from the open surgical wound.
      CO2-gas is insufflated via a gas-diffuser in the open surgical wound at 10 L/min. During
      cross-clamping, gas and blood are either continuously drained to the standard large venous
      reservoir or not, every 5 minutes after steady state of PaCO2 is observed, after adjustment
      of sweep gas flow as necessary. Mean values for each setup (2-4 times) for each patient will
      be analyzed with Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

    <description>The connecting tube between the additional and standard venous reservoir is clamped. Thus, blood and gas from the coronary and cardiotomy suction devices are collected in the additional venous reservoir. During the intervention setup, the blood in the additional venous reservoir is only evacuated to the standard reservoir if the volume exceeded 800ml, and always with a remaining volume of 100 mL blood to keep the CO2-gas trapped in the additional venous reservoir.</description>
