    <textblock>
      The clinical study of modern therapies on flora changing in blood, oral cavity, urethra and
      intestinal tract of patients with malignant tumors. The study is observational. Patients are
      diagnosed cancer based on pathology or cell biology. The sample of flora will be obtained
      from their blood, oral cavity, urethra and intestinal tract, mainly to study what modern
      therapies lead to the influence of microecological environment including diversity and
      abundance of bacteria in patients who received malignant tumors. Immunological examination
      and Blood biochemistry evaluation include the number ratio, activity and function of immune
      cell, the immune cell marker(CD3, CD4, CD8, etc), C-reactive protein(CRP), tumor necrosis
      factor(TNF), Inflammatory stimulant factor(IL-2, IL-6, etc), tumor marker(CEA, AFP, etc),etc.
      Clinical evaluation includes image data(CT/MRI), quality of life(QOL), no disease progression
      survival, total survival, objective disease remission rate, etc.

      This study collected samples of feces, urine, discarded blood and pharyngeal swab specimens
      from clinical laboratory from patients with malignant tumors in thoracic surgery department,
      general surgery department, oncology department and etc before and after treatments which
      contain chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immune targeted, endocrine therapy, surgery,
      traditional Chinese medicine and other modern therapies. Researchers will analyze the samples
      by oral flora, urethra, blood flora bacteria, the species diversity and abundance of the
      intestinal flora. Besides, quantitative analysis of inflammatory stimulators, c-reactive
      protein and tumor necrosis factor in peripheral blood was conducted to observe the
      relationship between the change characteristics of blood, oral, intestinal, urinary tract
      flora and urine composition caused by treatment and the therapeutic effect and prognosis.
