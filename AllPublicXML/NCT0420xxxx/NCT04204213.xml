  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tai Chi exercises have increasingly grown in popularity among older adults in the past
      decades. It has been well studied to its efficacies in proportion with the management of
      elderly fall prevention and mineral-structured bone density enhancement. Nevertheless,
      existing study sources do little exemplified a quantifiable measures of effects in patients
      suffer from osteoarthritis of knees being impacted from a routine performance of Tai Chi.

      112 patients with end stage osteoarthritis knee had enrolled into a customised
      multidisciplinary education program that consisted of one hour healthcare education seminars
      followed by another hour of 8 Section Brocade (Baduanjin) sitting Tai Chi classes for 4
      consecutive weeks. Followup measures were taken at baseline, 3 and 6 months post course
      commencement using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Western Ontario
      and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), SF-36v2 Health Survey and the Client
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8).

    <description>The international Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form is designed to measure physical activity, and standardize measures of health-related physical activity behavior through 8 questions and divide patients into 3 activity groups. The health-enhancing physical activity level of category is for those people who either engaged in (1) ≥ 1500 MET-minutes on vigorous-intensity activity for at least three days, OR (2) at a combination of walking, moderate to vigorous intensity activities accumulative performance to ≥ 3000 MET-minutes per week. The Minimally Active level category is considered at the enrollment of (3) ≥ 20 mins vigorous activity for at least three days, OR (4) moderate-intensity activity or walking for ≥ 30 mins for at least five days, OR (5) any combination of walking, moderate/vigorous-intensity activities for at least 600 MET-minutes per week.</description>

    <measure>Symptoms and Physical Functional Disability Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome was shown by the symptoms and physical functional disability scores represented by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the quality of life of participants represented by the self-rated questionnaire SF-36v2. WOMAC is a widely used standardized questionnaire to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, in three different domains for pain (score range 0 to 20), stiffness (0 to 8) and physical function (0 to 68).</description>

    <description>The Client Satisfactory Questionnaires (CSQ-8) is to assess the effectiveness of the customised programme and to collect feedback from a patient's point of view. Calculation on the 90 CSQ8 sampling sizes were made with the consideration on 95% confidence level, set with a 5% margin of error for the estimated confidence interval of 10. The CSQ-8 is a questionnaire that measures client satisfaction with services summing the individual item scores to produce a range of 8-32, with high scores indicating a greater satisfaction.</description>
