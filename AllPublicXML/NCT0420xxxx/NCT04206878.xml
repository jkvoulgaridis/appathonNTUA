    <textblock>
      This UNITAID-funded study aims to assess feasibility and utility of birth testing, [early
      infant diagnosis for HIV, (EID)], using point-of-care (POC) HIV nucleic acid testing (NAT) at
      high volume maternity settings. Birth testing is defined as tests within 3 days of life.
      Outcome measures will include age at testing, turnaround time from testing to caregiver
      result receipt, HIV positivity rate, and timing of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) initiation
      for HIV-positive infants. The study will document retention in care for those who tested
      positive at birth, and the percent of those who tested negative at birth who returned for six
      week testing. The study will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of POC birth
      testing using interviews with policymakers, health care workers and caregivers of HIV-exposed
      infants (HEI).
