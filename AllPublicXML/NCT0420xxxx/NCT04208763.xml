  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study population: A total of 90 consecutive patients of decompensated cirrhosis of any
      etiology, presenting to the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences with SBP with septic
      shock will be included.

      Study design: Randomized controlled trial Study period: August 2019 to December 2021. Sample
      size: Assuming that the response rate is 90% with GM-CSF and 60% without GM-CSF after day 5.
      With alpha 5 and power 80,we need to enroll 76 cases (38 cases with each). Further assuming
      20 % drop-out due to various reasons, it was decided to enroll 90 cases randomly allocated
      into two groups (i.e., 45 in each) by block randomization method by taking block size as 6.
      So for the present study, it was decided to enroll 90 cases in all.

      Group A will be given Imipenem and Tigecycline. Patients with recent hospitalisation will be
      given Colistin in addition.

      Group B will be given: To another group we will give Imipenem and Tigecycline and
      GMCSF.Patients with recent hospitalisation will be given Colistin in addition.

      The dose of antibiotic will be given at dosage Inj Imipenem 1gm i.v. TDS Inj Tigecycline
      100mg stat f/b 50mg i.v. OD Inj GM-CSF 500mcg s.c. OD Inj Colistin 9 MIU i.v. stat f/b 4.5
      MIU i.v. BD Monitoring and assessment At the baseline, all patients will undergo
      investigational evaluation as described

      Daily monitoring of following parameters:

        -  Haemoglobin,

        -  Total peripheral leucocyte counts,

        -  Platelet counts,

        -  Renal function tests

        -  Liver function tests and

        -  Chest X rays will be undertaken

        -  Ascitic fluid analysis will be done on day 0, day 2 and day 5

      Stopping rule:If the patient develops a TLC of more than 50,000, the dose of the GM CSF will
      be reduced to half and the treatment continued. If, even after the reduction, the TLC rises
      to more than 50,000, then the treatment will be stopped and the patient excluded.

      Expected outcome of the project: Addition of GM-CSF to standard antibiotic regimen helps
      resolve SBP and improves outcome in decompensated liver cirrhotic patients.
