  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Some men who have been treated for localized prostate cancer with surgery or radiation still
      show signs of the disease in their blood. This is called biochemically recurrent prostate
      cancer. Radium-223 is a small molecule. It uses radiation to kill cancer cells and improves
      survival in advanced prostate cancer. Researchers want to see if it can treat prostate cancer
      and induced immune changes earlier in the disease when the cancer is only detectable by
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.

      Objective:

      To learn how Radium-223 affects men with rising PSA but no evidence of cancer on conventional
      CT or bone scan, but positive findings on PET or molecular imaging in the bones. The primary
      focus is impact on the immune system with secondary focus on impact on PSA and imaging.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 18 and older with prostate cancer who have had surgery and/or radiation, but their
      PSA is rising even though no disease is visible on routine imaging scans (CT or bone scans).
      Patients are required to have PET or molecular imaging findings in bones, but not organs
      (lymph nodes are allowed).

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Their ability to do
      normal tasks will be reviewed. They will give tissue samples or a report from their doctor
      about their cancer. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have an electrocardiogram
      to measure heart function. They will have a scan of their chest and abdomen using radiation
      or magnetic resonance imaging. They will have a bone scan with injection of Tc99. They will
      have a positron emission tomography scan with intravenous (IV) injection of 18F-NaF.

      Participants will get Radium-223 by IV. For this, a small plastic tube is put into an arm
      vein. Radium-223 will be given on Day 1 of each cycle (1 cycle = 4 weeks) for up to 6 cycles.
      Participants will repeat the screening tests during the study. They will also complete
      Quality of Life Surveys and give stool samples.

      After treatment, participants will have long-term follow-up every 6 weeks for the rest of
      their lives.

      Background:

        -  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and surveillance are treatment options for prostate
           cancer patients with biochemical progression after localized therapy with either
           definitive radiation or surgery (biochemically recurrent prostate cancer). A primary
           goal in these patients is to prevent morbidity from their cancer that results from
           disease progression and metastatic disease on conventional imaging.

        -  Radium-223 has demonstrated the ability to improve survival in men with symptomatic
           metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with a manageable toxicity
           profile, particularly in patients who have not yet received docetaxel.

        -  Radiation, even at low doses can impact immune recognition and immune cell killing of
           cancer cells. Recent findings by the LTIB suggest that radium-223 potentiated T-cell
           killing of prostate cancer cells.

        -  Radium-223 may present an alternative option for patients with BRPC that is not
           associated with substantial toxicity (as seen with ADT) and may have a lasting effect
           due to its potential effect on the immune system and/or the bone microenvironment.

        -  Emerging PET imaging studies will likely find evidence of &quot;micrometastatic&quot; disease,
           often in the bones, in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer patients, although these
           patients will have no standard of care that can be supported by prospective data.

        -  Radium-223 has demonstrated the ability to improve survival in men with symptomatic
           prostate cancer, but it remains unknown what the impact is in patients with
           &quot;micrometastatic&quot; or PET positive prostate cancer in their bones

        -  Preclinical data has suggested that radium-223 can impact the immune system.

        -  In addition, changes in PSA kinetics, changes on PET scan findings, and safety and
           tolerability of radium-223 in this population will also be evaluated.

      Objective:

      - To determine statistically significant changes in immune cell populations compared to
      baseline in patients with biochemically recurrent or 18F NaF PET scan positive prostate
      cancer treated with radium-223

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

        -  Patients with negative CT Scan and Tc-99m Bone Scan

        -  Patients with positive findings NaF PET imaging.

        -  Patients with a rise in PSA &gt;= 0.8 ng/mL for patients following radical prostatectomy or
           for patients following definitive radiation therapy: a rise in PSA of &gt;= 2 ng/mL above
           the nadir

        -  Patients with a PSA doubling time of 5-15 months

        -  ECOG 0-1

      Design:

        -  Single arm study

        -  Patients will receive 6 injections of radium-223 with monthly assessments of PSA and
           periodic immune response. NaF PET scans will be completed at screening then at 4 and 7
           months after the start of radium-223.

        -  After completion of treatment patient will be followed every 6 (+/- 2 weeks).

             reason, men must agree to use condoms for the duration of study therapy and at least 6
             months

        after the last treatment administration. Female partners of reproductive potential must use
        a highly effective method of birth control during treatment and for 6 months after their
        partner s last treatment administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she

        is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
        treating physician immediately.
