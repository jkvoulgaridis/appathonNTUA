      This project aims to build up the comprehensive database of geriatric medicine for local
      Taiwanese.

      This project is the pilot for the basis of establishing the schema of database and efficient
      procedures including subject recruitment, specimen collection, management, and measurement of
      samples obtained from multiple sources. We will focus on deciphering the correlation of sleep
      quality and the integrity of brain structure by integrating the holistic health data,
      socio-demographic characteristics, MRI, wearable technique, and laboratory technology
      including clinical lab, genotyping, metabolomics, gut microbiome, to unravel the clinical
      feature of which the age will effect on the frequency of sleep disturbance. This project will
      not only systematically study the aging effect on the sleep quality and brain structure
      integrity, but pave the way for exploring a variety of aging-related indications.
