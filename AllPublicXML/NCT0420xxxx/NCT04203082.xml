  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a brief,
      single-session cognitive-behavioral intervention for reducing preoperative and postoperative
      anxiety and for determining satisfaction with the delivery process in pregnant women
      scheduled for Cesarean delivery due to complications with their pregnancy. This will be done
      through a combination of psychoeducation and exposure therapy, where the participants will be
      walked through the steps of a Cesarean delivery in an operating room that mimics where the
      patient would actually be delivering. Follow-up will occur during the immediate and extended
      postpartum periods to determine satisfaction and levels of anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with high-risk pregnancies due to fetal complications have a higher risk of stress than
      those with uncomplicated pregnancies. In Colorado, self-harm, which is related to mental
      health challenges, anxiety, and stress is the most common form of maternal mortality. Both
      the presence of maternal or fetal complications and the anticipation of a surgical procedure
      increase likelihood of anxiety, specifically perioperative anxiety, in patients. The presence
      of perioperative anxiety in pregnant woman is associated with higher reports of postoperative
      pain and lower maternal satisfaction with the delivery. Additionally, preoperative anxiety in
      surgical patients is associated with other physiological symptoms and complications,
      including increase heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature, sweating, nausea, and
      heightened sensory awareness (and need for pain medications), emotional recall of the birth
      as psychological traumatic, and increased risk for postpartum mood and anxiety disorders.
      State (perioperative) anxiety is elevated prior to procedure and are similar to other norms
      for general medical/surgical patients.

      Educational and psychological interventions are recommended for adults with anxiety related
      to medical procedures. For mild, acute procedural anxiety, this includes education about the
      procedure, acknowledgement and normalization of any feelings of anxiety in the patient, and
      allowing opportunities to promote a sense of control during the procedure. For those with
      more intense anxiety, brief cognitive behavioral therapy is identified as effective
      treatment. Brief cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions typically involve some or all of
      the following components: psychoeducation (about the association between thoughts, behaviors,
      and emotions and how these relate specifically to the procedure), cognitive restructuring
      (developing self-statements that will reduce anxiety-inducing reactions during the
      procedure), in vivo exposure to the setting, and/or relaxation training. Among adult patients
      undergoing surgical procedures, brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (typically 4 1-hour
      sessions) has been associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression immediately
      after intervention and weeks after, as well as shorter hospital stays. Additionally, even
      briefer interventions involving exposure therapy is efficacious for other medical-related
      phobias, such as dental phobia. Exposure treatment can be administered in a single, 60-minute
      session, but may need more sessions for intense anxiety. Finally, in those with severe
      anxiety who are not responsive to previous interventions, anxiolytic premedicant drugs are
      sometimes indicated, though can be associated with acute anterograde amnesia and drowsiness
      during the procedure, as well as need for increased neonatal resuscitation, as they easily
      cross the placenta. For this reason, the majority of women with anxiety typically decline use
      of these medications when offered.

      Given the high prevalence of preoperative anxiety among women undergoing a cesarean delivery
      with maternal or fetal complications, identification of low-cost interventions to decrease
      anxiety and increase satisfaction with the delivery process is indicated. To date, there are
      no randomized control trials investigating brief cognitive behavioral interventions for
      elective cesarean sections. This study seeks to establish the feasibility and limited
      efficacy of a brief, single session intervention that combines psychoeducation and exposure
      treatment to reduce preoperative anxiety and satisfaction of the delivery process among women
      undergoing elective cesarean section

    <description>To determine the extent to which the intervention is judged as suitable to program recipients, acceptability will be measured with the following questions, which are similar to other research studies examining satisfaction with interventions in feasibility trials (e.g., Rabin, Pinto, Dunsiger, Nash, &amp; Trask, 2009):
&quot;In general, how satisfied were you with the information provided about the Cesarean delivery?&quot;
(1= not at all, 7 = very satisfied)</description>

    <measure>Demand</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt; 14 days post-delivery</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the extent to which the intervention is likely to be used by the target population, demand will be measured with the following questions:
&quot;Would you recommend that other women undergoing Cesarean delivery receive this intervention?&quot;
(1= do not recommend at all, 7 = highly recommend)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Practicality</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks pre-delivery</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the extent to which the intervention can be carried out in the high-risk obstetrics settings, for each institution, the following data will be monitored and reported: (a) proportion of patients enrolled to treatment who received the intervention; (b) reasons that the intervention was not received as intended (e.g., no clinician available, patient delivered prior to intervention, no OR available for session); (c) length of time of each intervention session.</description>

    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Spielberger, 1983) is the most frequently used scale of anxiety in research world-wide and is considered a standard according to the MacArthur Foundation. The self-report inventory consists of 20 items to assess state anxiety, and another 20 items to assess trait anxiety. These two parts differ in the item wording, in the response format (intensity vs. frequency), and in the instructions for how to respond. Both the state and trait versions will be administered at enrollment/baseline and the state version only will be given at subsequent assessments at which time points anxiety is measured (see procedures below for summary of time points).</description>

    <measure>Preoperative Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>At Delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Preoperative anxiety will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS has been validated to measure anxiety in the moment. Participants quantify their anxiety in the moment by marking on a visual analogue scale of 0-100 mm. One end of the scale is labelled as 'no anxiety' and the other end as 'maximum anxiety imaginable''.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with Delivery: questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt;14 days post-delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with delivery will be measured using the Maternal Satisfaction Scale for Cesarean section (MSSCS). The 22-item questionnaire yields a total satisfaction score, as well as subscale scores for satisfaction with anesthesia, insertion of needle, side effects, and atmosphere of the OR (including facilitating comfort, communication with providers, freedom to interact with partner, etc). All items are rated on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) with higher scores indicating better satisfaction. This will be administered at immediate postpartum.</description>
