  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to enroll caretakers of patients with decompensated cirrhosis to
      determine if written emotional disclosure or resilience training interventions reduce
      distress and burden among primary informal caregivers.

      Caretakers that meet eligibility will complete baseline assessments in person, or if
      necessary, over the phone and be randomized to be in one of three arms of this study.
      Materials specific to each study arm will be mailed to the caretakers home along with
      instructions. Overall, the study will take approximately 2 months and a qualitative interview
      will also be completed around 3-6 months post-baseline.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in burden of caregivers measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI -12)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and then at 4 week and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The short form of the ZBI is a validated short 12-item questionnaire measuring perceived burden associated with care giving. Participants rate each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always) the range of possible score is 0 (less burden) to 48 (more burden).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and then at 4 week and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a measure of health related quality of life (HRQOL). It is a scale from 0 to 100 where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Distress Thermometer (DT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and then at 4 week and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a single-item self-report measure of distress. The DT is presented as a 10-point scale in a thermometer format and asks to rate how distressed one felt in the previous week from 0 (not distressed) to 10 (extremely distressed).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Captivity Index (CCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and then at 4 week and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A three-item self-report measure of how much (very much, somewhat, just a little, not at all) a caregiver feels like a captive, or being an unwilling or involuntary incumbent of a caregiver role. Scored on a scale of 4-12 with higher scores being worse</description>
