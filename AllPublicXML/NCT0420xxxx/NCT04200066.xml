      The main purpose of this study is to find out the highest possible dose of maprotiline that
      can be given safely in combination with temozolomide and tamoxifen. Temozolomide is approved
      to treat glioblastoma and the investigator wants to understand what doses are safe to use.
      Tamoxifen has been used for many years to treat breast cancer and there have also been
      studies combining it with temozolomide for the treatment of brain tumors that have shown the
      combination to be safe. In this study, the investigator will be adding maprotiline to
      temozolomide and tamoxifen, determining the highest possible dose that is safe, making sure
      there are no significant drug interactions and studying the safety of this combination.

    <description>Subjects will receive a combination of temozolomide and tamoxifen for two weeks. After that, they will receive a combination of temozolomide, tamoxifen and maprotiline for the remainder of the study. All drugs are administered orally. Subjects will undergo visits at the beginning of week 3, week 5 and week 7 that will involve multiple blood draws and ECGs to evaluate for pharmacokinetics and drug interactions. Response will be assessed every two months with an MRI and patients will continue on study as long as their tumors are under control and they are tolerating the regimen.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically proven World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV gliomas.
             Patients will be eligible if the original histology was a grade II or grade III glioma
             as long as a subsequent histological diagnosis of a grade IV glioma is confirmed.

          -  Patients must have undergone upfront therapy that included a combination of
             radiotherapy and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide.

          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by
             MRI scan. A scan should be performed within 10 days prior to registration and on a
             steroid dose that has been stable for at least five days. If the steroid dose is
             increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MRI is required.

          -  Patients must have tissue confirmation of histology at the University of Rochester

          -  Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic
             radiosurgery (including gamma-knife or cyber-knife) must have confirmation of true
             progressive disease rather than radiation necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium
             scanning, MR spectroscopy, MR Perfusion, or surgical documentation of disease. The
             decision of which modality to use to make this confirmation will be at the discretion
             of the investigator.

          -  Patients who have undergone re-resection for recurrent disease are eligible but must
             have an interval of 7 days prior to starting therapy.

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for
             the release of their protected health information.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old, and with a life expectancy &gt; eight weeks.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70

          -  Patients must have an interval of at least 28 days from any investigational agent or
             from prior cytotoxic therapy, six weeks from prior nitrosureas, three weeks from
             procarbazine and two weeks from vincristine.

          -  Patients must have failed prior radiotherapy and must have an interval of greater than
             90 days from completion of initial radiation therapy to study entry.

          -  WBC &gt; 3,000/µl, ANC &gt; 1,500/mm3, platelet count of &gt; 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin &gt; 8
             gm/dl). Patients must have adequate liver function (SGOT and bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times
             ULN), and adequate renal function (creatinine clearance &gt;30ml/min as measured by
             Cockroft-Gault formula) &lt;before starting therapy. These tests must be performed within
             2 weeks prior to treatment initiation. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached
             by transfusion.

          -  Patients with any number of recurrences are eligible.

          -  Patients taking tamoxifen for other indications are eligible for the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are within 3 months of treatment with radiation and concurrent
             temozolomide will not be eligible unless there are new enhancing abnormalities outside
             the high dose radiation fields (i.e. beyond the 80% isodose line) or surgical
             demonstration of active tumor.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant and must agree to practice adequate contraception. Women
             of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented within
             7 days prior to registration. Women must not be breastfeeding.

          -  Patients with a history of other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or cancer of
             the cervix), unless in complete remission for at least three years are ineligible.

          -  Concomitant use of enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs will be prohibited. These
             include phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and oxacarbazepine. If patients are on
             these at time of study enrollment, drugs can be transitioned to a non-enzyme inducing
             anti-epileptic drug at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses or other history that in the
             investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or
             would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy.

          -  Patients must not have any disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter
             drug metabolism.

          -  Patients must not have concurrent use of other tricyclic antidepressants or MAO
             inhibitors.

          -  Patients with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy
             that are refractory to medications

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give written
             informed consent.

          -  Patients with history of myocardial infarction within the past year.

          -  Patients with history of hypersensitivity to maprotiline.

          -  Patient meets the cut-off score of ≥ 12 in the PHQ-9 or selects a positive response of
