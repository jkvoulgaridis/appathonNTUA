  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Personalized Trial of Chronic Lower Back Pain will test the feasibility of employing
      technology to facilitate remote N-of-1 interventions to research participants with
      self-identified back pain. Participants will spend 14 weeks alternating between massage,
      yoga, and usual care methods to treat their back pain, while answering daily questions and
      wearing an activity tracker. After 14 weeks, participants will have the ability to share
      their opinions about a Personalized Trials platform. We believe a Personalized Trials
      platform will be satisfactory to participants and feasible to scale to large randomized
      controlled trials, and eventually to clinical practice.

    <textblock>
      The Personalized Trial of Chronic Lower Back Pain will facilitate remote N-of-1 interventions
      to research participants with self-identified back pain persisting longer than 12 weeks.
      Participants will be randomized in a multiple crossover design to receive Swedish massage
      in-home by a commercial wellness service, yoga instruction in-home by a commercial wellness
      service, and no intervention/usual care. Participants will evaluate their pain intensity,
      pain interference, fatigue and stress daily through self-reported questionnaires. Online
      screening and enrollment methods, text-message reminders and questionnaire prompts, and
      wearable devices will be employed to collect data. At the end of the study, participants will
      receive a personalized report summarizing their observed data in each treatment period.
      Participants will evaluate the system usability of Personalized Trials, will debrief their
      experience with a member of the research team, and will share their overall satisfaction with
      Personalized Trials.

    <measure>Mean System Usability Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed once after the results report has been sent to the participant, within 8 weeks of intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>Usability of the Personalized Trials platform will be evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS), a 10-item questionnaire created by Digital Equipment Co Ltd. and John Brooke in 1986 that asks users to score each item on a Likert scale from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5). Individual results are calculated to arrive at a composite measure out of 100. Participant SUS scores will be averaged together. Higher scored values correlate to a more usable system, and therefore a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Mean Participant Satisfaction with Personalized Trials Components</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed once after the results report has been sent to the participant, within 8 weeks of intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction rated on a 5-point Likert scale from Very Dissatisfied (1) to Very Satisfied (5), or Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5). Higher scores correlate to greater satisfaction, and therefore a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Mean Within-Subject Difference in Self-Reported Daily Pain Intensity During 3 Treatment Periods from Mean Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From 2-Week Treatment Period 1 to 2-week Treatment Period 6</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity is measured using the PROMIS Scale v1.0 - Pain Intensity 3a Fixed Length Short Form. The measure is modified from instructions to recall over the last 7 days to recall over the last 24 hours. Raw scores will be converted to an item response theory-based T-score using the PROMIS scoring manual. A T-score of 50 is the average for the US general population with an SD of 10. A higher T-score represents higher pain intensity or interference.</description>
