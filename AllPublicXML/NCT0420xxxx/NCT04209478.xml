  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the pediatric age group, postoperative pain is very important for the children to have a
      comfortable and problem-free postoperative period.

      In the present study, it was aimed to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) Block, and quadratus lumborum block (QLB) Type 1 on the
      pediatric patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in the study were randomly divided into 2 groups. Cases were assessed
      ultrasonography-guided TAP block (Group B, n=20) or ultrasonography-guided QL Block. Total
      analgesic amounts in 24 hours and first analgesic requirement times recorded.

    <description>The Wong-Baker facial pain scale was used to assess pain (1: no pain, 10: worst possible pain). During monitoring patients with pain score ≥3 had intravenous 1 mg/kg tramadol hydrochloride administered, After 15 minutes following tramadol injection, cases with pain score continuing ≥3 were to be assessed as insufficient analgesia and had 0.1 mg/kg morphine hydrochloride planned for intravenous administration</description>
