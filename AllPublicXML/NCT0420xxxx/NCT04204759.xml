  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the causal relationship between prefrontal
      cortex activity and antisocial behavior, as well as risk factors for antisocial behavior.
      Specifically, this study tests the hypothesis that upregulating activity in the prefrontal
      cortex through a non-invasive form of brain stimulation, transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) will reduce antisocial and aggressive behavior. The effects of 3 days of
      anodal stimulation over the prefrontal cortex are assessed.

    <measure>Antisocial behavior inclinations after stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 hour after the third consecutive active tDCS or sham session</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using 5 hypothetical scenarios in which someone commits a criminal or antisocial act. Participants will respond to the likelihood that they would commit the act in the scenario according to a 10-point Likert scale. Responses are measured on a scale ranging from zero (no chance at all) to 10 (100% chance). A higher value reflects a greater intention to engage in the antisocial act.</description>

    <measure>Moral judgment ratings after stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 hour after the third consecutive active tDCS or sham session</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using 5 hypothetical scenarios in which someone commits a criminal or antisocial act. Participants will rate the moral wrongfulness of the act in the scenario on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very). A higher score reflects a greater perception of moral wrongfulness regarding the antisocial act.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Delay discounting rates after stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 hour after the third consecutive active tDCS or sham session</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' responses to 5 questions indicating if they would prefer a smaller reward today or a larger reward in the specified number of days will be assessed. The delay discount rates (k) of monetary rewards will be calculated based on the responses to the 5 trials.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the active stimulation group will undergo anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS will be delivered by a battery-driven, constant-current stimulator connected to two saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes. An anodal electrode (25cm2) will be placed over the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and one cathodal electrode (35cm2) will be placed over the occipital cortex. Scalp electrodes will be positioned according to the 10-20 EEG international system. A current of 2mA will be applied for 20 minutes and the current will be ramped up and down over 30 seconds at the beginning and end of the stimulation period.</description>

    <description>The sham tDCS condition will involve the same placement of the electrodes, current intensity, and ramp-up/down time as the active tDCS condition, but stimulation will only last for 30 seconds.</description>
