      This study to provide up to 52 weeks of efficacy, safety and tolerability data to support
      registration of intravenous (i.v.) secukinumab (Initial dose of 6 mg/kg at Baseline (BSL)
      followed thereafter with 3 mg/kg administered every four weeks) in patients with active
      psoriatic arthritis (PsA) despite current or previous NSAID, DMARD and/or anti-TNF therapy.

    <textblock>
      This multicenter study uses a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      design. A screening (SCR) period running up to 10 weeks before randomization will be used to
      assess subject eligibility followed by a treatment period of 52 weeks.

      At baseline, approximately 380 patients with active psoriatic arthritis will be randomized to
      one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 randomization:

      Group 1: Approximately 190 patients with active psoriatic arthritis; These patients will
      receive secukinumab 6 mg/kg i.v. at BSL, followed by the administration of secukinumab 3
      mg/kg i.v. every four weeks starting at Week 4.

      Group 2: Approximately 190 patients with active psoriatic arthritis; These patients will
      receive i.v. placebo at BSL and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12, followed by the administration of
      secukinumab 3 mg/kg i.v. every four weeks starting at Week 16.

      Study will consist of 4 periods: a screening period (up to 10 weeks), treatment period 1
      (total duration of 16 weeks) and treatment period 2 (total duration of 36 weeks) followed by
      a safety follow up period of 8 weeks after the end of treatment visit (i.e., Week 52).

      Primary endpoint analysis will be performed with Week 16 data (last patient completing
      Treatment period 1 (Week 16). Long-term efficacy and safety assessments will be performed up
      to Week 52.

    <masking_description>This is a double-blind, randomized treatment trial.
Subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments will remain blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until Week 60 database lock, using the following methods:
Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the study with the exception of the bioanalyst.
The identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of study treatments in the form of i.v. injection, filled with secukinumab or placebo that are identical in appearance.</masking_description>
