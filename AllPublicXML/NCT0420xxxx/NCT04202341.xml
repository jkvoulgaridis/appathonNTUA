  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term, multicenter, observational registry of participants with generalized
      myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are treated with Alexion complement C5 inhibition therapies
      (C5IT) prior to enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the time of enrollment in the Registry, participant records will be queried for
      retrospective information about the participants' medical history and gMG disease treatment
      history. Following enrollment, prospective data collection will be performed using data
      obtained as part of the routine clinical care and through patient-reported outcome methods in
      use. Data will be collected using an electronic data capture system. The duration of data
      collection for the Registry will be up to 5 years from the first participant enrolled.
