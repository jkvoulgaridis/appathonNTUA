  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with prehypertension, diagnosed according to the 7th Brazilian Guidelines on
      Hypertension with the presence of systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 121 and 139 and / or
      diastolic (DBP) between 81 and 89 mmHg, are more likely to become hypertensive and to develop
      cardiovascular complications. Moreover, they already have alterations in the function of
      large arteries that may play a role in the development of the disease in the future. An
      option in the prevention / treatment of hypertension is the moderate intensity physical
      training, but high intensity interval training offers the possibility of greater exercise
      adherence, since it can be performed with less volume and less time spent, with the same
      benefits than moderate exercise, or even higher, being preferred by the population. Among
      these benefits, the investigators can mention the post-exercise hypotension (PEH) which
      occurs in normotensive, prehypertensive, and hypertensive individuals, due the decreased in
      sympathetic nerve activity and improved in vascular function. Also, selected participants
      with prehypertension can present a profile of masked hypertension, identified only by 24
      hours ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Given the possible differences between vascular
      responses to exercise intensities, the investigators intend to compare, in prehypertensive
      patients, the vascular responses of large arteries by noninvasive methods and PEH to a
      session of high intensity exercise and a session of moderate intensity continuous exercise.
      In addition, to study some of the possible physiological variables involved in this response
      by measuring heart rate variability. It is expected to find differences in vascular responses
      according to the presence of masked hypertension. Twenty two prehypertensive individuals aged
      between 30 and 60 years of both sexes will be studied. Subjects will perform cardiopulmonary
      testing and baseline vascular measurements (central pressure and pulse wave velocity
      measurements by three different methods), as well as 24 -hour ABPM. The vascular measurements
      will be repeated immediately after, and 24 hours after each session. Each participant will
      perform the session of one type of exercise in one day, and after three days will perform the
      other, with random distribution to the sequence of exercise type. Participants will perform
      24-hour ABPM prior to exercise and for 24 hours after each exercise session. Data will be
      compared by appropriate statistical analysis.

      The measurement of central pressure and pulse wave velocity are achieved by three follow
      devices: Complior® , Sphygmocor® and Arteriograph®. The heart rate variability is achieved by
      Polar® device.
