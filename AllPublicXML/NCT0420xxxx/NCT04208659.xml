  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans who have responded well to Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA), a form of auricular
      acupuncture, in routine clinical practice will be invited to receive education to insert the
      needles themselves at home. A 3D-printed wearable prosthetic will also be explored as a means
      to facilitate needle placement.

      Primary end-points will include whether adverse events occur over a six-month period and
      whether the aforementioned prosthesis significantly facilitates needle placement in terms of
      subjective ease of administration.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 veterans who have repeatedly had good responses to BFA will be invited to participate. The
      PI and his collaborators will give standardized education (BFA training) to the veterans in a
      group session to teach them how to self-administer the BFA. The BFA training will be
      identical to that used by the VA for providers except that the training will focus on
      self-administration. The participants will be given needles in a manner similar to a
      prescription medication (i.e. controlled by the provider). They will self-administer BFA
      every two weeks for a total of 6 months and record their response in a standardized BFA
      template. Providers will call participants at intervals of two to four weeks to retrieve this
      data and assess for any adverse events other than minor bleeding, scratches and dizziness.

      A plastic, custom-molded prosthesis will be developed during the first several months using
      3D-scanning and 3D-printing. This prosthesis will be wearable over the ear and will have
      holes directly over the relevant acupuncture points to facilitate insertion. At the 3-month
      mark, participants will be given these. If this turns out to not be feasible with the
      available resources, work on this will cease for the remainder of the project. At the end of
      the study, participants will be asked whether the prosthesis made a significant difference in
      the ease of administration and open-ended comments regarding their experience will also be
      solicited.

    <measure>Comparative Satisfaction with Pain Control of Self-Administered Auricular Acupuncture versus Previous Episodes of Provider Administered Auricular Acupuncture</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Previous provider-administered post-needling auricular acupuncture pain scores as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale will be averaged for each participant according to the availability of such data. All participants will be expected to have several such data points in the electronic medical record. These scores will be averaged for each patient. This individual average will be compared to the average of post-needling NRS scores reported from the self-administration of auricular acupuncture for the same patient. The percentage of difference in the NRS score between provider-administered and self-administered acupuncture will be reported to assess for possible non-inferiority of self-administered auricular acupuncture.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of chronic pain from any etiology

          -  Participant is physically and cognitively able to self-administer auricular
             acupuncture. This will be determined by the investigator during the educational
             sessions.

          -  Participants taking anti-coagulant or anti-platelet medications will be allowed to
             participate if they acknowledge an increased risk of bleeding

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Condition causing ongoing immunocompromised state (e.g. overt AIDS, chemotherapy,
             anti-rejection medications)

          -  Acquired or congenital defects in the tympanic membrane

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Severe cognitive impairment

          -  Physical disability precluding self-administration of auricular acupuncture

          -  History of severe vasovagal reaction to acupuncture needling

          -  History of endocarditis

          -  History of artificial heart valve

          -  History of implanted device to support cardiac function

          -  Participation will be terminated for participants who use the acupuncture needles in
             any way other than instructed

        Exclusion criteria include those who do not wish to participate and those who have
        significant contraindications to AA (auricular acupuncture) or indwelling acupuncture.
        These include: being immunocompromised, congenital or acquired defects in the tympanic
        membrane, pregnancy, severe cognitive impairment, inability to perform BFA on themselves.
        Medical anti-coagulation is not an automatic exclusion as many patients on these
        medications will not have any issues with bleeding with BFA. Those who have history of
        severe vasovagal/syncopal or other adverse response to skin puncture will also be excluded.
        Those with artificial heart valves or those with a history of heart valve infection are
        excluded because of risk of endocarditis. Pregnant patients will be excluded from this
        study to eliminate the possibility of harm to pregnant patients and developing children.
        Medical conditions that would exclude someone from using BFA include: 1) those with
        replacement heart valves; 2) those with history of heart valve infection; 3) those who are
        pregnant; 4) those who have a pacemaker, defibrillator, or other similar electronic device;
        5) those who are afraid of needles, 6) those who are scheduled for an MRI; 7) those with
        non-medication induced bleeding disorders.

        Participants will be removed from the study if it is discovered they are using the needles
        in a manner that is inconsistent with the protocol.
