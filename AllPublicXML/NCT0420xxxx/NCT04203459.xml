  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest diseases of human digestive malignancies.
      Despite the recent advances in surgery and chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate of PC
      continues to be less than 10%. As a promising tumor therapy,Chimeric antigen receptor T cell
      (CAR-T), however, performed poorly in PC treatment and need to be further updated. In our
      study, on the basis of our previous research, we use anti-MSLN CAR-T as effector cell and
      explore the different effects and mechanism of gut microbiota (PC or healthy control) on
      anti-MSLN CAR-T treatment. Firstly, we detect the differences of gut microbiota and T cell
      cholesterol metabolism in PC and healthy control by means of 16S-rRNA,PCR, western blot and
      ELISA; explore the different effects of gut microbiota on the subtype of T cells; and analyze
      the relationships between intestinal flora composition and T cell cholesterol metabolism or
      subtype changes by means of Spearman's correlation. Secondly, we also explore the different
      effects of gut microbiota on the proliferation, migration, subtype, inflammatory cytokines
      expression and anti-tumor effector function of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells by means of flow
      cytometry and cytotoxicity assay. Thirdly, we discuss the different expression of cholesterol
      esterification enzyme 1 (ACAT-1) and other core genes of cholesterol metabolism in anti-MSLN
      CAR-T. Lastly, we evaluate the effects of different gut microbiota on the treatment of PC by
      anti-MSLN CAR-T cells in NSG mouse model of subcutaneous PC transplantation and liver
      metastasis. Through the above experiments, a new theoretical basis is provided in which gut
      microbiota regulates the subtype and anti-tumor function of anti-MSLN CAR-T by ACAT-1
      expression. Furthermore, our findings, which demonstrate the relationship of gut microbiota
      and CAR-T cell, may be translatable for the treatment of other solid tumors like PC.

    <description>Fecal and peripheral blood samples were collected from patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy people respectively: (1) through Illumina miseq
High throughput sequencing technology was used to detect 16S rRNA to analyze the diversity of intestinal flora (α and β diversity), and bioinformatics methods such as random forest and lefse were used to analyze the diversity of flora composition; (2) the difference of cholesterol content in T cells was detected by ELISA; (3) the difference of ACAT-1 expression in T cells was detected by PCR and WB; (4) the difference of ACAT-1 expression in T cells was detected by flow cytometry. The proportion of CD8 +, TNF α +, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg and other subtypes in T cells was detected by cell analyzer. Furthermore, the correlation between intestinal microflora composition and peripheral blood T cell cholesterol metabolism and subtype difference was determined by Spearman correlation analysis (statistical method).</description>
