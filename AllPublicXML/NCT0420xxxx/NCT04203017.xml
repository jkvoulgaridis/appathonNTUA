  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that according to modern data, the pathogenesis of multiple
      sclerosis is inextricably linked to the patient's microbiota. Therefore, transplantation of a
      normal fecal microbiota (FMT) can improve the outcome of autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (autoHSCT) by increasing the disease-free period and disease progression
      suspension for at least 5 years after transplantation, which meets the NEDA (No Evidence of
      Disease Activity) criteria, satisfying the current trends of clinical neurology.

      AutoHSCT may be a method of choice to treat patients with refractory forms of multiple
      sclerosis, taking into account the insufficient efficacy of first line therapy, lack of
      availability (government approval) and high cost of monoclonal antibodies as a second line
      drugs. In this setting, according to the safety-efficiency ratio the most appropriate are
      reduced intensity conditioning regimens in autoHSCT. In 75% of cases for refractory forms of
      multiple sclerosis it is possible to achieve 5 years remission with transplant mortality less
      than 1%. In recent years, it is quite clear that gut microbiota abnormalities may be one of
      mechanisms for autoimmune diseases development. Therefore, the correction of gut dysbiosis
      through FMT from a healthy donor can improve the effectiveness of basic therapies. Currently,
      FMT is a rapidly developing method of treating intestinal infections associated with
      multi-resistant bacteria, based on the replacement of the recipient's microbiota by the
      donor's microbiota.
