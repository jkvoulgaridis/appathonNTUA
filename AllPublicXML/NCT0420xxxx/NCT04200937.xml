    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the It MATTERS study is to assess erectile function at 6 months,
      post implantation of the Tactra™ Malleable Penile Prosthesis, demonstrating an improvement in
      quality of life from baseline.

      The study is a post-market study on a newly released device and is part of the planned
      postmarket clinical follow-up (PMCF) of the device. Adult males with moderate to severe
      erectile dysfunction (IIEF-EF domain score 1-16) who meet the indications for surgical
      correction of erectile dysfunction will be included. The purpose of this study will be to
      assess the impact of the Tactra malleable prosthesis on quality of life in men with erectile
      dysfunction through use of the International Index of Erectile Function, Erectile Function
      Score (IIEF-EF).

    <measure>Change from baseline to six months in the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is a validated, widely used, multidimensional self-report instrument for the evaluation of erectile function. It consists of 15 items that assess sexual function in five domains: erectile function (Q1, 2, 3, 4, 5,15), orgasmic function (Q9,10), sexual desire (Q11,12), intercourse satisfaction (Q 6,7,8) and overall satisfaction (Q 13,14). A score of 0-5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions. The IIEF-15 total score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 5 domains.
The erectile function (EF) domain is the most sensitive domain of the IIEF. IIEF-EF score ranges from 1 to 30 and is derived by scoring 0 (poorest function) to 5 (best function) on each of six questions function (Q1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15). There are five categories of erectile function based on EF domain score: severe (1-10), moderate (11-16), mild to moderate (17-21), mild (22-25) and no ED (26-30).</description>

    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms and overall sexual function post device implantation compared to baseline, as measured by the PHQ-9 Depression Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter for up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a diagnostic tool for mental health disorders used by health care professionals. The PHQ contains: mood anxiety, alcohol, eating, and somatoform modules. The PHQ-9, is a validated tool specific to depression, scoring each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria. Scored from 0-27, the PHQ-9 is separated into five different diagnoses: minimal depression (0-4), mild depression (5-9), moderate depression (10-14), moderately severe depression (15-19), and severe depression (20-27).</description>

    <measure>Change in work productivity post device implantation compared to baseline as measured by the WPAI:GH Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months, 12 months and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI:GH (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health) is a validated tool that asks a series of questions about the effect of subject health problems, both physical and emotional, on their ability to work and perform regular activities. The WPAI:GH outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes, as following 6 questions: 1 = currently employed, 2 = hours missed due to health problems, 3 = hours missed other reasons, 4 = hours actually worked, 5 = degree health affected productivity while working, 6 = degree health affected regular activities. Scores are then multiplied by 100 to be expressed in percentages.</description>
