      Open label pilot study assessing FMT to treat fecal incontinence in women 50 years of age and
      older.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence, also known as accidental bowel leakage, is a common condition that is an
      immense burden to older women, caregivers, and the health care system. The overall goal of
      this study is to gather pilot data in order to conduct a future randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) for a novel treatment for fecal incontinence in older women utilizing fecal microbial
      transplantation (FMT). The investigator's hypothesis is that infusion of intestinal
      microbiota from healthy donors to older women with fecal incontinence will increase microbial
      diversity, reduce symptom severity, and improve quality of life. This study is a single arm,
      open-label clinical trial of FMT for the treatment of fecal incontinence refractory to
      conservative management. The investigators will measure the impact of FMT on change in
      symptom severity and quality of life and stool microbial diversity at 4 and 12 weeks after
      FMT.
