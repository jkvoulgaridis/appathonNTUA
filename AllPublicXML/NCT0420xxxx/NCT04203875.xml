  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether Orencia® (Abatacept) improves outcomes in
      liver transplant patients with recurrent or de novo AIH (autoimmune hepatitis) that has not
      responded to previous therapy. AIH that does not respond to steroids or conventional
      immunotherapy often affects young patients and leads to irreversible liver damage. There is
      currently no effective therapy for this condition.

      Participants in this study will receive the study drug once a week for 6 months. If the study
      doctor feels the study drug has been beneficial, participants may receive additional study
      drug doses for up to an additional 6 months. Participants will continue on follow-up for 1
      year after stopping Abatacept.

      The risks related to participation in this study include potential side effects from the
      study drug include infusion-related reactions (reactions at the injection site), increase in
      respiratory adverse events, infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease, risk of development of malignancies (cancer) or autoimmune disorders (which may make
      your current autoimmune disease worse or you can contract new autoimmune diseases). It is
      unknown if this is drug related. The study doctor will discuss any concerns about this with
      you prior to receiving treatment.

      There is the possibility that the participant may experience improvement in their medical
      condition from participation in this study. However, this benefit cannot be guaranteed. There
      may be no direct medical benefit to the participant due to their participation. The
      Investigator hopes that in the future the information learned from this study will benefit
      other people with this condition.
