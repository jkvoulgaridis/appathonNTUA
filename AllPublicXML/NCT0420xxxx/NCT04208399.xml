    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of
      JNJ-56136379 in participants with liver cirrhosis and impaired hepatic function when compared
      with healthy participants with normal hepatic function and no liver cirrhosis.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  For all participants: Body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 38 kilogram per meter
             square (kg/m2), extremes included; Woman of childbearing potential must not be
             pregnant; Highly effective contraceptive measures in place for female participants of
             childbearing potential or male participants with female partners of childbearing
             potential; Non-smoker or light smoker as defined per protocol.

          -  For Healthy Participants with Normal Hepatic Function and No Liver Cirrhosis:
             Demographically comparable to the study groups with hepatic impairment with respect to
             sex, age (+/-10 years), and body weight (+/-10 kilogram [kg]); Participants must be in
             good health clinically and biologically as defined per protocol.

          -  For Participants with Liver Cirrhosis and Moderate or Mild or Severe Hepatic
             Impairment: Must have a total Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6, inclusive (mild); or 7 to 9,
             inclusive (moderate); or 10 to 15, inclusive (severe) as determined by the
             investigator; Must have liver cirrhosis with fibro scan readout greater than (&gt;) 12.5
             Kilopascal (kPa) as cut-off at screening

          -  Participants with controlled hypertension, with problems directly associated with the
             primary diagnosis of hepatic impairment and with concurrent stable medical conditions
             if the condition(s) will not introduce an additional risk factor and will not
             interfere with the study objectives.

          -  Concomitant medications to treat underlying disease states or medical conditions
             related to hepatic impairment are allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of / or current clinically significant medical illness that could interfere
             with the interpretation of the study results.

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-6379 or its excipients.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year before screening or positive test
             results at screening and Day -1.

          -  Blood or blood products donated or substantial loss of blood (more than 500
             milliliters [mL]) within 3 months before the study starts

          -  Experimental drug received (including investigational vaccines) or experimental
             medical device used within 1 month or within a period less than 10 times the drug's
             half-life, whichever is longer, before the first dose of the study intervention is
             scheduled.

          -  Evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2, hepatitis
             A, B or C (except if sustained virologic response to hepatitis C virus [HCV]
             treatment).

          -  Inability to fast for 10 hours.

          -  Signs of hepatocellular carcinoma or history of biliary obstruction within the past 2
             years.

          -  Lack of good or reasonable venous access.
