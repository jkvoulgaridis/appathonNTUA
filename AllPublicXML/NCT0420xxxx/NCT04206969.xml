  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The symptomatic and clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents
      is strongly influenced by the cultural setting they are growing up in. These cultural
      variations complicate psychiatric care, especially for migrant children, for whom appropriate
      care must be designed.

      Transcultural psychotherapy is an original psychotherapeutic technique developed to meet
      these specific requirements in France and in different European and American countries. Its
      theoretical and methodological foundations rest on the works of George Devereux in
      ethnopsychiatry (1970). A psychotherapeutic technique intended for first-generation migrants
      was developed by Tobie Nathan and coll (1986). Marie-Rose Moro and colleagues (1990) have
      adapted this technique to second-generation migrants.

      Indicated as a second-line treatment after the failure of standard management, this technique
      is fully formalized today. It comprises group consultations for the child and the family as a
      one-hour session each month, directed by a principal therapist, assisted by a group of
      co-therapists (of diverse cultural origins and occupations) and an interpreter in the
      family's mother tongue. The concept of culture is used to establish the therapeutic alliance,
      decode the symptoms, and propose treatment.

      The children and adolescents receiving this treatment have varied psychopathological
      profiles, mostly involving depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Specifically, migrants'
      children are especially vulnerable to depression, their psychiatric care is generally longer
      and less effective than in the general population, and their rate of treatment failure
      higher.

      Transcultural psychotherapy has demonstrated its value in these situations in numerous
      qualitative studies, but its efficacy has not yet been assessed by a method providing a high
      level of evidence, such as randomized controlled trials.

      Mixed method study using a multicenter, Bayesian randomized clinical trial with blinded
      evaluation of the primary outcome. Two parallel groups of 40 children or adolescents from 6
      to 20 years-old and their family will be included. In the experimental group, patients will
      attend six sessions of transcultural therapy in addition to usual care. The improved Clinical
      Global Impression scale scores at 6 months will be compared across groups. Qualitative
      analysis of families and therapists' interviews will allow to specify the therapeutic
      processes and acceptability of the therapy.

    <description>For this secondary objective concerning the group of patients treated by transcultural psychotherapy, a qualitative design will be used to explore the perceived efficacity and acceptability of the therapy. Investigators will organize two semi-structured interviews after the fifth therapy session. These semi-structured interviews will be conducted by a psychologist trained in transcultural care. One interview will concern the family and will explore, with the help of an interpreter speaking the native language of the family, the acceptability of the care as well as success factors identified by the family. The other interview will concern the therapists and will explore the success factors identified by the professionals. The interviews guides have been constructed by specialists of transcultural care in childhood and adolescence To describe the perceived efficacy and acceptability of the transcultural psychotherapy for the patient and the family</description>
