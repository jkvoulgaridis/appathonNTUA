  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world is facing rapid population aging, the health needs of the elderly are complex, and
      their physical capabilities are degraded, and increased the possibility of having one or more
      chronic conditions. In 1900 to 2000, there were 7,600 million people in the United States,
      aged 65 and above age increased to 4.1% up to 12.6%, by 2050 is expected to increase 20.3%.In
      Taiwan, the elderly population have 83.5% is health and sub-health, in order to allow them to
      perform activities of daily living independently, in particular, need to pay attention to the
      diverse needs of the elderly, Assist the elderly to increase self-care skills, reduce
      disability is a very important issue.

      From literature review of LED phototherapy can effectively improve symptoms in the elderly,
      such as hair loss, dermatitis, rotator tendonitis, epicondylitis of the tibia, wound healing,
      back pain, patellofemoral pain, spinal neuropathy, chronic pain relief, insomnia and
      depression.

      Comprehensive Phototherapy and Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) perspective, LED
      phototherapy is the use of physical light energy stimulation and temperature to improve the
      body's microcirculation and meridian dredge, Enhance the body's energy of the health and
      sub-health elderly, increasing physical activity perform daily functions.

      Taiwanese Elderly to take self-care by the dilemmas of the many aspects. There are 21.52%
      physical health problems, affecting work or daily activities are limited; there are 35.12%
      physical or emotional health problems affecting social activities; there are 13.01% incapable
      perform activities of daily living.

      The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of LED phototherapy on physiological
      symptoms among elderly in long-term care institutions in Taiwan. To examine the effects of
      physiological symptoms, such as mental state, muscle bone system, metabolism, autonomic
      balance and other meridian energy tests, it is expected to improve the body energy of healthy
      and sub-healthy elderly to increasing physical activity perform daily functions.
