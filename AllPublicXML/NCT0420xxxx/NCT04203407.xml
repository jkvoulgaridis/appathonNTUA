  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study aims to examine the effects of a culturally-sensitive theory-driven
      advance care planning (ACP) game in increasing the self-efficacy and readiness of ACP
      behaviours among Chinese community-dwelling older adults. This is a mixed methods study with
      the quantitative paradigm being the main research approached used. The quantitative arm will
      be a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The qualitative arm will adopt focus group interviews
      for data collection. Recruited subjects from the community centres will be randomly allocated
      to the intervention and control group. The older adults in the experimental group will
      receive an ACP board game delivered by trained facilitators, whereas the older adults in the
      control group will receive another board game about healthy lifestyle. The outcome measures
      of the older adults will include the ACP Engagement scale, the Life-Support Preferences
      Questionnaire (LSPQ), a self-developed ACP knowledge questionnaire and those data will be
      collected at baseline (T0), immediately post-intervention(T1), at 1 month (T2), and 3 month
      (T3). The qualitative arm of this study will contribute to the understanding of issues and
      effects of ACP game as an intervention. Its finding will complement the results obtained from
      the RCT.

    <measure>Advance Care Planning Engagement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Behaviour changes in ACP behaviours measured using Advance Care Planning Engagement Scale. It is about different ACP behavior on a 5-point Likert scale. The higher score means the higher level of self-efficacy and readiness for the behaviours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Certainty rate of end-of-life preferences toward medical care</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>End-of-life preferences is measured by the Life-Support Preferences Questionnaire (LSPQ). It describes one hypothetical terminally ill scenario. Preferences regarding (i) three kinds of life-sustaining treatments (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilator and tube feeding) based on three options (want to attempt, refuse or uncertain) and (ii) care goals (comfort-oriented, prolongation of life at all costs or uncertain) , will be asked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-develped ACP knowledge questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire comprised 10 questions. Response options for each of these questions were &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. Content validity was assessed within a palliative care expert team.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change of emotional status</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional status is measured using the Chinese version of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD-7) scale as process indicators. The total score ranges from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate higher level of anxiety.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Experience of playing ACP game</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' experience of playing ACP game will be collected by focus group interviews.</description>
