          -  Confirmed diagnosis of HAE type I or II at anytime in the medical history

          -  At least 3 documented HAE attacks in the past 93 days, as supported by medical
             history.

          -  Access to and ability to use conventional attack treatment for attacks of HAE

          -  Adequate organ functions

          -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective birth control
             from the Screening visit until the end of the trial follow-up procedures.

          -  Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal

          -  Males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or
             else use a highly effective method of birth control as defined in inclusion 6 from the
             Screening visit until the end of the trial follow-up procedures

          -  Provide signed informed consent and are willing and capable of complying with study
             requirements and procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic angioedema, such as acquired C1
             inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency, HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE type III),
             idiopathic angioedema, or angioedema associated with urticaria

          -  Current use of C1INH, androgens, or tranexamic acid for HAE prophylaxis

          -  Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or any estrogen-containing
             medications with systemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal
             replacement therapy) within 93 days prior to initial study treatment.

          -  Use of androgens (e.g. stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methyltestosterone,
             testosterone) or antifibrinolytics within 30 days prior to initial study treatment.

          -  Any other systemic dysfunction (e.g., gastrointestinal, renal, respiratory,
             cardiovascular) or significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject by taking part in the trial

          -  Known lactose allergy or intolerance

          -  Known hypersensitivity to KVD900 or placebo or to any of the excipients

          -  Participation in an interventional investigational clinical study within 93 days or
             within 5 half-lives of the last dosing of investigational drug (whichever is longer)
             prior to initial study treatment
