  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to detect tongue edema associated with the pressure exerted by a rigid
      direct laryngoscope by measuring the tongue area using USG in patients undergoing suspension
      laryngoscopy (SL) procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suspension laryngoscopy (SL) is a surgical procedure for both diagnostic and therapeutic
      purposes. In this procedure, a rigid direct laryngoscope is inserted orally, and the tongue
      and the base of the tongue are compressed.The tongue is an ideal organ for evaluation with
      ultrasonography. This study aimed to detect the occurrence of tongue edema through
      ultrasonography examination due to the rigid direct laryngoscope in SL procedures.

    <description>The first group is the study group. Patients aged 20 years or older and were to undergo suspension laryngoscopy procedure were eligible for inclusion in this group. Tongue areas were measured twice by submental USG. The first measurements (TA1) were done immediately after endotracheal intubation before introducing the rigid direct laryngoscope, whereas the second measurements (TA2) were done after the SL procedure and after removing the rigid direct laryngoscope just before extubation.The difference between TA2 and TA1 (i.e., TA2−TA1) were used to define the occurrence of tongue edema as study group.</description>

    <description>The second group was the control group, which included patients who did not need SL and any head and neck procedures.The tongue areas of these patients were measured twice by submental USG as in the study group. The TA1 measurements were done immediately after endotracheal intubation, whereas the TA2 measurements were done at the end of the surgical procedure just before extubation. The difference between TA2 and TA1 (i.e., TA2−TA1) were used to define the occurrence of tongue edema as study group.</description>
