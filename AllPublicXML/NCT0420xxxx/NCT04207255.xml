    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of the investigational drug opaganib. Patients with metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have experienced disease progression while
      receiving abiraterone or enzalutamide will receive Opaganib at either 250 mg or 500 mg by
      mouth twice a day continuously. Patients will continue on study drug until the development of
      progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent or other event as
      outlined in patient discontinuation.
