      The aim population is histopathologically confirmed locally unresectable advanced recurrent
      or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastric and gastroesophageal junction. Purpose of
      research to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tripletrumab combined with oxaliplatin and
      teggio (SOX) in first-line treatment of unreactable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic
      gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

      Every 21 days is a cycle, and treatment is scheduled for 6 cycles. Chemotherapy drugs until
      disease progression, toxicity intolerance, the start of new anti - tumor treatment,
      withdrawal, loss of access or death, etc., already reached first, shall be the basis for
      termination.

      Treatment was effective for more than 6 treatment cycles and toxicity was, the subjects were
      judged by the researchers when to terminate the treatment and adjust the follow-up treatment
      plan.

      For disease progression, toxicity intolerance, and initiation of new antitumor therapies.

      For subjects who donot reach terminal events such as treatment, withdrawal, loss of follow-up
      or death, at the end of chemotherapy , the follow-up maintenance regimen was adjusted
      according to the researchers' evaluation.

      The screening period of the study was 14 days. The screening test was completed and the
      evaluation was completed.

      Subjects with standard discharge entered the treatment period, and the frequency of
      administration was determined according to the protocol.

      Conduct treatment and complete relevant tests and assessments before each administration.

      Tumor imaging was assessed every 6 weeks (±7 days) and all subjects were treated.

      At the end of the visit, safety and imaging evaluations should be completed. Complete
      follow-up was conducted for a total of 90 days. Continue to receive tumor evaluation and
      imaging at a frequency of 2-3 months. Evaluation until disease progression, new antitumor
      therapy, withdrawal, Lost or dead, etc.
