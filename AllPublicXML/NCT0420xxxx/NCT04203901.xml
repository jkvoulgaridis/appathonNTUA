  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMN-001 is an autologous, tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cell immunotherapy. The active
      components of CMN-001 are autologous, matured dendritic cells, which have been
      co-electroporated with both in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA from an autologous tumor specimen
      and CD40L RNA. CMN-001 is indicated for treatment of intermediate/poor risk patients with
      advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in combination with nivolumab plus ipilimumab as first
      line therapy and in combination with lenvatinib plus everolimus as 2nd line therapy post 1st
      line failure.
