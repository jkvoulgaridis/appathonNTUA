  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent and frequently comorbid among Veterans and
      Service Members. Many of these individuals sustain more than one TBI over the course of their
      military careers, often with little recovery time between exposures placing them at increased
      risk for persistent cognitive, psychological, and psychosocial difficulties that impact daily
      functioning and life satisfaction.

      The short-term objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of the manualized, 10-week,
      telephone delivery of Tele-CABA for improving cognitive and adaptive functioning. The
      long-term objective of this study is to develop an accessible and acceptable intervention
      that can be broadly disseminated to address the complex rehabilitation needs of Veterans and
      Service Members. The overall goal of the Tele-CABA intervention is to reduce negative
      cognitive and psychiatric health outcomes for Veterans and Service Members with a history of
      TBI, promote personal resilience, and to design an intervention that is accessible and
      acceptable to patients struggling to recover from TBI.

    <description>Tele-CABA uses Behavioral Activation (BA) to identify meaningful goals and activities while learning cognitive skills to aid in working toward those goals. Early sessions of Tele-CABA focus on learning about TBI and lifestyle skills that can improve thinking abilities and mood. Cognitive skills taught each week include internal and external skills to help manage problems with memory, attention, and regulation of thinking processes. Investigators and patients will spend a part of each session applying the cognitive skills to managing real life situations and getting patients active in the service of personal goals.
The Tele-CABA intervention will be delivered over 10 weekly, 60-minute telephone sessions.</description>
