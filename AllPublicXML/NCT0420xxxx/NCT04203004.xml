    <textblock>
      Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is unavoidably typical of solid organ transplantation.

      Post-reperfusion syndrome (PRS), characterized by hemodynamic instability at reperfusion of
      the implanted graft, is a possible complication of liver transplantation. For sure, IRI plays
      a fundamental role in the multifactorial pathogenesis of PRS.

      IRI and PRS are associated with a higher risk of early allograft dysfunction (EAD) and,
      consequently, graft failure.

      Liver grafts from both extended criteria donors (ECD) and donation after circulatory death
      (DCD) are particularly susceptible to IRI and, accordingly, are at higher risk of PRS, EAD
      and graft failure. Anyway, in the present scenario of organ shortage, such donors greatly
      contribute to enlarge the organ pool. So, various strategies have been developed for the
      purpose of a safer use of this kind of grafts. Among them, ex vivo hypothermic oxygenated
      perfusion (HOPE) reduces IRI and is beneficial for high-risk liver grafts.

      The pathogenesis of IRI is an extremely complex downstream inflammation process, involving
      many different cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. In particular, tumor necrosis
      factor-alfa (TNF-alfa), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are crucial in the
      development of IRI in liver transplantation.

      In experimental models, cytokine filtration during ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) was proved
      to be safe and effective in reducing inflammatory response and, thus, pulmonary edema
      development.

      Since

        -  in liver transplantation, IRI and PRS are associated with a higher risk of EAD and graft
           failure

        -  liver grafts from ECD and DCD are particularly susceptible to IRI and are at higher risk
           of PRS, EAD and graft failure

        -  HOPE of high-risk liver grafts reduces IRI

        -  in solid organ transplantation, various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are
           involved in the pathogenesis of IRI

        -  in experimental models of EVLP, cytokine filtration was proved to reduce inflammatory
           response and subsequent organ damage,

      our hypothesis is that cytokine filtration during HOPE of high-risk liver grafts may
      potentiate the beneficial effects of HOPE, further reducing IRI and, consequently, further
      decreasing the incidence of PRS and EAD.

      So, the aim of this study is to verify the feasibility and safety of cytokine filtration
      during end-ischemic HOPE of liver grafts.

      This is a monocentric, pilot, randomized controlled study. Each eligible transplant candidate
      will be enrolled once an eligible graft has been allocated to him/her. Each enrolled patient
      will be randomized to either the experimental arm (HOPE-CytoSorb) or the control arm
      (HOPE-standard).

      End-ischemic HOPE will be performed at our center after standard procurement of the graft at
      the donor hospital, static cold storage preservation during transport and back-table
      preparation. Dual HOPE, by portal continuous flow and arterial pulsatile flow, will be
      pressure controlled: portal pressure will be ≤5 mmHg and mean arterial pressure will be ≤30
      mmHg. HOPE will be performed in an open system, so the graft will swim in the perfusate
      flowing out of the vena cava. The recirculating perfusion solution will have the same
      composition of University of Wisconsin Machine Perfusion Solution. HOPE will be maintained
      for 4 hours. CytoSorb will be included in the circuit only in the experimental arm.

      Scheduled samples of both the perfusate and patient's blood will be analyzed for the levels
      of TNF-alfa, IL-6, IL-8 and ET-1. A biopsy of the implanted graft will be taken 2 hours after
      its reperfusion. The patient will be followed for 1 year after transplantation.

      Once 10 patients have been enrolled, an interim analysis will be performed by an independent
      Clinical Endpoint Committee.
