  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the physiologic effects of an electromagnetic resonator(EMF) on autonomic nervous
      system tone modulation through measurement of heart rate variability(HRV).

      Null Hypothesis: An EMF Resonator will not change autonomic nervous system tone and no
      demonstrable difference in physiological parameters will recorded.

      Alternative Hypothesis: Using an EMF Resonator will enhance parasympathetic activty as
      supported by HRV.

      During the initial encounter, participants will be randomized to either therapy or sham. The
      randomization scheme will be blinded to all investigators, will be devoid of patient
      information, and will be programmed by a non·investigator third party. All patients will
      receive the same total duration of therapy, and all patients will receive a sham and a
      treatment session.

      Participants will wear head phones to reduce effects of any outside noises and will lay
      supine in a chair at approximately 40 degrees which is inside the FDA approved Resonator® EMF
      field. The active treatment session will be A160 which is a narrow range but variable
      magnetic field. This ranged from 3.1 x10·8 to 3.2 x 10-8 amplitude with a frequency of
      0.857-0.859.

      Eligible participants will arrive for testing in the morning and will be randomized to either
      treatment sequence. Randomization will be predetermined. Mobile phones and pagers will be
      placed into airplane mode during the study on a table in the room. The patient will be
      connected to HRV measurement systems. A BP reading will be taken in each arm. Patients will
      then lay supine in a standardized relaxation chair at approximately 40 degrees at which time
      the headphones will be placed. Ambient room light will remain powered on during therapy and
      will remain unchanged regardless of randomization. The researcher will then start either arm
      A or B (based on randomization). During the session, each participant will be given a short
      novel/magazine to read to reduce the chance of sleeping.

      All HRV monitors will be disconnect and the subject's electronics will be returned.
