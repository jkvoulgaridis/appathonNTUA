    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether follicular fluid concentrations of fetuin A and fetuin
      B are associated with the clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in in vitro fertilization
      (IVF) cycles.Twenty-nine women with poor ovarian reserve (poor responders) and 33 women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome (hyper responders) who consecutively underwent IVF at a private
      hospital between May 2018 and February 2019.Fetuin A and fetuin B in follicular fluid were
      significantly lower in women who had clinical pregnancy than women who had no clinical
      pregnancy (p=0.001 for both)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>he primary outcome of this study is to measure the follicüler fluid concentrations of fetuin A and fetuin B in IVF cycles. Follicular fluid Fetuin A and Fetuin B will be measured during oosit pick up in IVF cycles.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship between fetuin A and insulin resistance suggests the probable role of this glycoprotein in human fertility. Fetuin B prevents the hardening of zona pellucida by inhibiting ovastacin.In this study, follicular fluid concentrations of fetuin A and fetuin B are measured in IVF cycles</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary goal of this study is to whether follicular fluid concentrations of fetuin A and fetuin B are associated with clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in IVF cycles.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The oocyte fluid samples that are derived from the largest follicles and contained oocytes are collected for the measurement of fetuin A and fetuin B concentrations. Follicular fluid samples are centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minutes and stored at -80ºC up to the working day. On the working day, samples are brought to room temperature. The fertilized embryos are transferred into the uterine cavity on the 2nd day.A pregnancy test is performed on the 12th day following embryo transfer, hCG-positive patients undergot transvaginal ultrasound scan on 21st day for detection of clinical pregnancy.</description>
