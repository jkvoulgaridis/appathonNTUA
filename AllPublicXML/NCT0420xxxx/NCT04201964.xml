  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, five randomized trials showed efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy over standard
      medical care in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of arteries of the
      proximal anterior circulation. However, sufficient recanalization (mTICI2b-3) can 't be
      acquired in all patients under thrombectomy. There is a lack of evidence that whether salvage
      intra-arterial thrombolysis is beneficial for patients with insufficient recanalization after
      endovascular thrombectomy. The EXTEND-IA TNK study indicated that tenecteplase before
      thrombectomy was associated with a higher incidence of reperfusion and better functional
      outcome than alteplase among patients with ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 hours after
      symptom onset. This study intends to explore the proportion of sufficient recanalization
      (2b/3) after intra-arterial tenecteplase administration in patients undergoing thrombectomy
      with insufficient recanalization (1/2a).
