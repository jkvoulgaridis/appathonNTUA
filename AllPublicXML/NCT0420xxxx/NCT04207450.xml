  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind trial aims to evaluate the effect of
      glutaraldehyde associated or not with 37% phosphoric acid conditioning on dentin
      hypersensitivity reduction after non-surgical periodontal treatment, and its durability after
      15 and 30 days. desensitizing treatment. Additionally, investigate the impact of these
      treatments on health-related quality of life. The investigators selected patients who, after
      scraping and planing procedures, presented at least 2 teeth meeting the following inclusion
      criteria: presence of gingival recession without or with a periodontal pocket up to 5mm
      probing depth, which presented painful sensitivity response to tactile stimulus. and
      evaporative. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups: Placebo Group (GP) - Placebo Gel
      application followed by Placebo solution (distilled water); GPG- Placebo Gel application
      followed by application 5% aqueous glutaraldehyde solution; GSG - Application of 37%
      phosphoric acid followed by 5% aqueous glutaraldehyde solution. The sensitivity of the dental
      elements was evaluated by pain stimuli (tactile and evaporative) with the aid of a Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS). A questionnaire was applied to patients with the objective of capturing
      psychosocial experiences, prior to treatment and one month after its completion, to assess
      the impact of desensitizing treatment on health-related quality of life. Data will be
      collected and appropriate statistical tests will be applied.
