  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Variceal bleeding (VB) is a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis with a 6-week
      mortality of approximately 15%-20%. The 1-year rate of recurrent VB is approximately 60% in
      patients without prophylaxis treatment. Therefore, all patients who survive VB must receive
      active treatments to prevent rebleeding. Usually, these patients are submitted to rebleeding
      prophylaxis with endoscopic band ligation (EBL) combined with non-selective beta-blockers
      (NSBB). Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) are reserved for those who
      failed endoscopic plus medical treatment.

      A recent meta-analysis comparing combination therapy to monotherapy with EBL or drug therapy
      has demonstrated that combination therapy is only marginally more effective than NSBB alone.
      This suggests that NSBB is the cornerstone of combination therapy. The lowest rebleeding
      rates are observed in patients on secondary prophylaxis who are hepatic venous pressure
      gradient (HVPG) responders (defined as a reduction in HVPG below 12 mm Hg or &gt; 20% from
      baseline). A recent study demonstrated that patients who have their first episode of variceal
      bleeding while on primary prophylaxis with NSBB have an increased risk of further bleeding
      and death, despite adding EBL. These patients possibly require alternative treatment
      approaches, such as TIPS.

      The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of TIPS vs. EBL + NSBB for the
      prevention of rebleeding in NSBB non-responder for primary prophylaxis.

    <description>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a procedure that uses imaging guidance to connect the portal vein to the hepatic vein in the liver. A small metal device called a stent is placed to keep the connection open and allow it to bring blood draining from the bowel back to the heart. TIPS may successfully reduce internal bleeding in the stomach and esophagus in patients with cirrhosis and may also reduce the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites).</description>

    <description>Combination therapy of nonselective β-blocker (NSBB) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EBL) will be used for participants in this group. NSBB, which will be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose aiming to decrease the heart rate by 25%, with a lower limit of 50 beats per minute, was started at day 5 after the index bleeding, unless a contraindication was present (severe arrhythmia, severe obstructive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or known intolerance). Endoscopic variceal ligation sessions started 2 weeks after the index bleeding and were performed every 2-4 weeks thereafter until eradication of varices, followed by endoscopic surveillance and retreatment, if indicated, every 6-12 months.</description>
