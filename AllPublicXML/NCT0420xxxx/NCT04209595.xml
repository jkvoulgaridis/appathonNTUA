    <textblock>
      Background:

      Drugs known as PARP inhibitors are known to help stop tumor growth in patients with breast,
      ovarian cancers and many other cancers including prostate and pancreatic cancers. Many
      research studies done in animals and human cells have shown that these type of drugs can
      improve how well chemotherapy works. Standard chemotherapy can be too toxic to be combined
      with PARP inhibitors. In this study, we use a new form of chemotherapy called PLX038 to see
      if it can be safely combined with PARP inhibitors to shrink tumors.

      Objective:

      To find a safe combination of PLX038 and rucaparib, and to see if this mix will cause tumors
      to shrink.

      Eligibility:

      People age 18 and older with solid tumors, SCLC, or small cell cancer outside their lungs.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      Records of their diagnosis (or they will have a tumor biopsy)

      A review of their symptoms and medications

      A review of their ability to perform their normal activities

      Electrocardiograms to measure the electrical activity of the heart

      Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. CT scans are a series of
      X-rays.

      Participants will get PLX038 by intravenous catheter on Day 1 of each cycle (1 cycle = 21
      days). For this, a small plastic tube is put into an arm vein. They will take rucaparib twice
      daily by mouth on Days 3 to 19 of each cycle. They will keep a medicine diary.

      Participants may give a hair sample. They may have optional tumor biopsies.

      Screening tests are repeated throughout the study.

      About 30 days after treatment ends, participants will have a safety follow-up visit. They
      will give blood samples, talk about their health, and get a physical exam. Then they will be
      called or emailed every 6 months....

      Background:

        -  We hypothesize that a dose-escalation strategy that incorporates tumor targeted DNA-
           damaging chemotherapy and DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors could allow safe and
           effective administration of DDR inhibitor-chemotherapy combination.

        -  PLX038 is a PEGylated conjugate of SN38 with improved properties including increased
           solubility, higher exposure and longer half-life. SN-38 is the active metabolite of
           CPT-11 (irinotecan) that inhibits topoisomerase 1 (Top1) and causes DNA strand breakage.
           As a specific DNA damaging agent, SN-38 enhances cell kill in tumors deficient in the
           DNA- damage response and when combined with inhibitors of the DDR.

        -  Rucaparib is a potent oral poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that is approved
           for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian
           tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to
           platinum-based chemotherapy and for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious
           BRCA mutation- associated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
           cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies.

        -  We hypothesize that the combination of PLX038 plus rucaparib is more efficacious than
           either agent alone.

      Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PLX038 in combination with
           rucaparib.

        -  Phase II: To assess the efficacy with respect to clinical benefit rate (CBR) (CR+PR+SD)
           for 4 months according to Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1) of a combination of
           PLX038 and rucaparib in patients with small cell lung cancer and extra-pulmonary small
           cell carcinomas.

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects with histologically confirmed solid tumors (Phase I) OR histologically or
           cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Phase II) OR histologically or
           cytologically confirmed extra-pulmonary small cell carcinomas (Phase II).

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Subjects must have evaluable or measurable disease.

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2

        -  Adequate organ function

      Design:

        -  This is an open label Phase I/II trial accruing initially one cohort to determine
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined treatment of PLX038 and rucaparib (Phase I);
           and to examine the safety and efficacy of PLX038 in combination with rucaparib in the
           following cohort (Phase II).

        -  PLX038 will be administered by IV infusion on day 1 of every 21-days cycle, rucaparib
           will be administered PO twice daily on days 3 to 19 of every cycle.

        -  Treatment will continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Biomarkers of patient response to treatment will be investigated in an exploratory
           manner pre and post-treatment.
