      Rationale: Gaining information about the knowledge, practice and attitude regarding hall
      technique and find out how much the Egyptian dentists use this method for treatment the
      carious primary teeth.

      Aim of the study: To assess the knowledge, practice and attitude of Egyptian dentists
      regarding non invasive restorative approach.

      The first study on the Hall Technique was published in 2006 . It was a retrospective study
      which analysed the practice records of a general dental practitioner from Scotland, Dr. Norna
      Hall. Dr. Hall simplified the standard technique to restore primary teeth using preformed
      SSCs and used it with her patients. This retrospective study involved a total of 978 crowns
      fitted in 259 children using her novel technique (today known as the Hall Technique). Most
      crowns were placed when there was clinical evidence of a proximal carious lesion into dentine
      and marginal ridge breakdown. This study showed the Hall Technique to have comparable
      outcomes to those achieved with other more conventional restorations.

      Since then, growing understanding that caries is essentially a biofilm driven disease rather
      than an infectious disease, explains why the Hall Technique, and other 'sealing in' carious
      lesion techniques, are successful. The intervening ten years has seen robust evidence from
      several randomised control trials that are either completed or underway. These have found the
      Hall Technique superior to comparator treatments, with success rates (no pain or infection)
      of 99% (UK study) and 100% (Germany) at one year, 98% and 93% over two years (UK and Germany)
      and 97% over five years (UK). The Hall Technique is now regarded as one of several biological
      management options for carious lesions in primary molars.
