      Long-term follow-up of HIV-infected subjects who received SB-728-T or SB-728mR-T in a
      previous trial and completed 3 years of post-infusion follow-up. Enrolling subjects will be
      followed for a total of 12 years.

    <textblock>
      Subjects infected with HIV who have received therapy with SB-728-T or SB-728mR-T and have
      completed 3 years of post-infusion follow-up will be eligible to participate in this trial.
      There will be no treatment in this long-term follow-up study. Subjects who choose to enroll
      into this extension study will be evaluated for a total of 12 years.

      An optional leukapheresis may be performed upon sponsor request.
