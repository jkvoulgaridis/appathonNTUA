  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of orofarangeal exercises (OE) and inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on sleep
      quality, disease severity, and airway muscle tone have been investigated in several studies.
      IMT and OE exercise modalities for patients and practitioners have advantages and
      disadvantages. It is recommended to compare exercise modalities in the studies. Whether OE or
      IMT exercise type is more effective on disease severity, sleep quality and snoring has not
      been investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of inspiratory
      muscle training and oropharyngeal exercises in patients with OSAS in terms of disease
      severity, snoring, daytime sleepiness, respiratory muscle strength and sleep quality.
