  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high dose inorganic selenium in
      preventing and relieving chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in
      platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal cancer patients. This
      study will be conducted as a phase III randomized controlled trial in platinum-sensitive
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal cancer patients who are expected to
      undergo paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy. A total of 68 patients need to be enrolled in
      this study. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency of
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of
      the severity of peripheral neuropathy and the quality of life to show that selenium is
      effective in preventing and relieving peripheral neuropathy induced by paclitaxel. Positive
      results in this study will lead to further studies investigating the effect of selenium on
      other chemotherapies that can induce peripheral neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-dose selenium is known to reduce systemic inflammatory responses through antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory effects. Selenium has also been shown in pre-clinical studies to inhibit
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy through reactive oxygen species mechanisms in
      cells. Therefore, the investigators aimed to confirm the effect of preventing high dose
      intravenous selenium prior to chemotherapy and to prevent neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.
      In this study, the investigators will identify the frequency and severity of CIPN according
      to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Also, the investigators will assess the
      patient's quality of life (QoL), evaluate the effects of the administration of inorganic
      selenium on CIPN and QoL, and confirm the safety of high-dose selenium. I would like to.
