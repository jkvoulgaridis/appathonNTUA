  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To increase the effectiveness of pain control, it is recommended to use drugs before the pain
      onset, therefore the pre-emptive analgesia method is considered as a method, which allows
      decreasing the post-operative pain to minimum. Previous studies evaluated effectiveness of
      pre-emptive analgesia but no relation to psycho-emotional status was addressed. Our authors
      believe that the effect of pre-emptive analgesia may vary based on different psycho-emotional
      status.

      45 volunteers who needed extraction of lower third molars were examined and enrolled in the
      study (study group - 15; placebo - 15; control - 15 volunteers). Ibuprofen 400mg together
      with 500mg paracetamol was used for pre-emptive analgesia. Difficulty of the operation, heart
      rate measurements and operation protocol were documented. Surgeon filled his questionnaire
      after the procedure. Patients on consultation, operation day and 10 days postop. filled a
      questionnaire which consisted of general, special and pain evaluation sections. Less
      favorable psycho-emotional status correlated with more severe pain 6h after operation. This
      relation was mostly expressed in the control group. Psycho-emotional status of placebo
      patients was accounted for bigger analgesic consumption frequency. Postoperative pain in
      study group was minimal compared to other groups. Pre-emptive analgesia enhances patient's
      psycho-emotional status and sustains postoperative pain control during lower third molar
      surgical extractions.
