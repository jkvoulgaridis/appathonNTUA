      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different treatment
      regimens of EYS606.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized open-label interventional study of EYS606 in
      subjects with active chronic non-infectious uveitis.

      The maximum study duration per patient is 51 Weeks (including an up to 3 week screening
      period + 48 weeks follow-up after treatment).

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part I is a safety cohort phase that will enroll up
      to 6 subjects, Part II is the randomized comparison phase that will enroll up to an
      additional 50 subjects.

        Key Eligibility Criteria:

          1. Subject must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Subject must have a diagnosis of chronic non-infectious uveitis of any anatomic
             subtype (anterior, intermediate, posterior or panuveitis).

          3. Subject must have a history of chronic or recurrent non-infectious uveitis requiring
             or having required treatment with corticosteroids (systemic, periocular or
             intraocular) and/or systemic immunosuppressive medication(s) in the 12 months prior to
             the screening visit.

          4. Best corrected visual acuity of

               -  Study Part I: ≥ 5 and &lt; 67 ETDRS letters in the study eye (equivalent to less
                  than or equal to 20/50 but better than or equal to 20/800 Snellen).

               -  Study Part II: ≥ 5 and &lt; 77 ETDRS letters in the study eye (equivalent to less
                  than or equal to 20/32 but better than or equal to 20/800 Snellen).

          5. At the screening and baseline visits subject must have active chronic non-infectious
             uveitis as evidenced by at least one or more of the following in the study eye:

               -  Active retinal vasculitis (retinal vascular leakage) involving the posterior pole
                  confirmed by the reading center.

               -  Vitreous haze grade ≥ 2+ (SUN classification).

               -  Anterior chamber cell grade ≥ 2+ (SUN classification); anterior chamber cells
                  must be present for subjects with a diagnosis of chronic anterior non-infectious
                  uveitis.

               -  Persistent macular edema (defined as central retinal thickness (CRT) &gt; 300
                  microns or &gt; 320 microns using Zeiss Cirrus and Topcon or Heidelberg Spectralis
                  spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT) instruments, respectively)
                  despite treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive therapy for at
                  least 4 weeks prior to screening.

          6. Subject receiving concomitant topical and/or systemic corticosteroids or allowed
             systemic immunosuppressive medications must have maintained the same treatment regimen
             (dosage/frequency) for at least 2 weeks prior to the baseline (V1) visit, (if
             applicable).
