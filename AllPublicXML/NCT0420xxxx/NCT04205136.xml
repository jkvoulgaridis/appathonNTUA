  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether Spironolactone can improve the severity of
      obstructive sleep apnea and improve cardiovascular biomarkers in people who are not regularly
      using their Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy.

    <intervention_model_description>The researchers will do a trial of spironolactone in 30 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with cardiovascular disease who are non-adherent with Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Both groups will receive treatment as usual for obstructive sleep apnea. Spironolactone and placebo will be prescribed by one of the study physicians (who will not be blinded to treatment condition [&quot;care provider&quot;]) .</masking_description>
