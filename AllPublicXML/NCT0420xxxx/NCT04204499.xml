    <textblock>
      Prospective, observational cohort study of patients undergoing surgical resection for low
      dose CT (LDCT) screen-detected lung cancer (detected through the SUMMIT study -
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03934866), in which translational research is a fundamental
      aspect.

      The ASCENT study seeks to examine the genomic signatures of screen-detected cancers, in order
      to categorise the biological behaviour of such lesions and correlate this against
      non-invasive biological and radiological parameters. From these data, the plan is to explore
      strategies to characterise LDCT-detected cancers through non-invasive means, which the
      researchers believe may prove key in mitigating potential screening-associated harms.

      Blood collection will take place from consented patients at the time of anaesthetic induction
      pre-surgery, to include:

      â€¢ 4 x 10ml Streck tubes for germline DNA and exploratory biomarker analyses (examples include
      cell-free tumour nucleic acid (cftNA)

      Tumour surplus to diagnostic and pathological requirements will be collected for whole exome
      sequencing. Adjacent regions containing pre-invasive disease, either atypical adenomatous
      hyperplasia (AAH) or adenocarcinoma-in-situ (AIS), will be collected for separate analyses.
      Potential cases will be identifiable prospectively from pre-operative imaging based on the
      presence of reported non-solid (&quot;ground glass&quot;) lesions by the radiologist. Tumour tissue may
      also be collected retrospectively if patients have already been recruited into another study
      at the time of surgery, and they have consented for the use of their tissue in future
      ethically approved research.
