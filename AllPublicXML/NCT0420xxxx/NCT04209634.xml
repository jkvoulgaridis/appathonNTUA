  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of pozelimab on active
      CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy (PLE; CHAPLE).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pozelimab in patients with CD55-deficient PLE
           disease

        -  To evaluate the effect of pozelimab on CD55-deficient PLE (both patients with active
           disease at baseline and those with inactive disease on eculizumab, switching to
           pozelimab) at time points until 104 weeks

        -  To determine the effects of pozelimab on albumin and other serum proteins (total
           protein, immunoglobulins)

        -  To determine the effects of pozelimab on ascites

        -  To determine the effects of pozelimab on stool consistency

        -  To determine the effect of pozelimab on health-related quality of life

        -  To determine the effect of pozelimab on lab abnormalities observed in CD55-deficient PLE
           such as hypertriglyceridemia, thrombocytosis, and hypovitaminosis B12

        -  To describe the effects of pozelimab on the sparing of concomitant medications and
           reduction in hospitalization days

        -  To determine the effects of pozelimab on growth

        -  To characterize the concentration of pozelimab in patients with CD55-deficient PLE

        -  To assess the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA for pozelimab in patients with
           CD55-deficient PLE disease

          -  Active disease as defined by the protocol or inactive disease on eculizumab therapy
             (and whose treating physician has the expectation of future access to renewed
             eculizumab treatment should this be required), and is willing to discontinue
             eculizumab during screening and start pozelimab at baseline with no eculizumab

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of meningococcal infection

          -  No documented meningococcal vaccination within 3 years prior to screening and patient
             unwilling to undergo vaccination during the study

          -  No documented vaccination for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae if
             applicable based on local practice or guidelines prior to screening and patient
             unwilling to undergo vaccination during the study if required per local practice or
             guidelines

          -  Presence of a concomitant disease that leads to hypoproteinemia at the time of
             starting pozelimab

          -  A concomitant disease that leads to secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia such as a
             fontan procedure for congenital heart disease
