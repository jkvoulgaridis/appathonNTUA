  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemic complications are a major impediment to the maintenance of healthy glucose
      levels in persons with diabetes. The investigators recently completed a clinical pilot and
      feasibility study (GLIMPSE, NCT02690168), which identified a novel biomarker, glial acetate
      metabolism, that appears to predict the susceptibility to hypoglycemia. By providing an assay
      to predict hypoglycemic events and therefore diabetic complications, the development of this
      biomarker could significantly improve the treatment of persons with diabetes.

      The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of our biomarker for predicting
      susceptibility to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In order to accomplish this goal the
      investigatiors will pair our 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy procedure to assess glial
      acetate metabolism, developed in the GLIMPSE study, with a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic
      clamp procedure, developed in the HYPOCLAMP study (NCT03839511). The two procedures will be
      separated by a three day interval. The investigators will then correlate the participants'
      rates of glial acetate metabolism with their neuroendocrine responses to the hypoglycemic
      clamp. This proof of concept study will test the hypothesis that glial acetate metabolism is
      inversely proportional to the neuroendocrine response to hypoglycemia, that is, as glial
      acetate metabolism increases the neuroendocrine response will decrease.

    <description>An intravenous catheter will be placed in an antecubital vein for infusion of insulin and glucose. A second catheter will be placed retrograde in a dorsal vein of the contra-lateral hand for blood withdrawal. The hand will be placed in a heating box or pad at 70°C for arterialization of venous blood. A primed infusion of regular insulin (120 mU/min/m2) will be initiated and continued for approximately 2 hours. Beginning 20 minutes prior to the start of the insulin infusion, arterialized venous blood glucose will be measured at 5 minute intervals via a Hemocue or YSI analyzer. Following initiation of insulin infusion, blood glucose will be allowed to fall to 50 mg/dL and then maintained at this level using a variable infusion of exogenous dextrose (20% solution). Our goal is to achieve steady-state (blood glucose stabilized at 50 +/- 5 mg/dL) within the first 45 minutes following the start of insulin infusion.</description>
