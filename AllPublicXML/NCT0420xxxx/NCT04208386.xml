      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) of JNJ-73763976
      and JNJ-73763924 following a subcutaneous (SC) injection of JNJ-73763989 (JNJ-3989) in
      participants with liver cirrhosis and various degrees of impaired hepatic function when
      compared with healthy participants with normal hepatic function and no liver cirrhosis.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  For all participants: Body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 38 kilogram per meter
             square (kg/m^2), (extremes included), and a body weight not less than 50 kilograms
             (kg) at screening; Woman of childbearing potential must not be pregnant; Highly
             effective contraceptive measures in place for female participants of childbearing
             potential or male participants with female partners of childbearing potential;
             Non-smoker or light smoker as defined per protocol

          -  For Healthy Participants with Normal Hepatic Function and No Liver Cirrhosis:
             Demographically comparable to the study groups with hepatic impairment with respect to
             sex, age (+/-10 years), and body weight (+/-10 kg); Participants must be in good
             health clinically and biologically as defined per protocol

          -  For Participants with Liver Cirrhosis and Moderate or Mild or Severe Hepatic
             Impairment: Must have a total Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6, inclusive (mild); or 7 to 9,
             inclusive (moderate); or 10 to 15, inclusive (severe) as determined by the
             investigator; Must have liver cirrhosis with fibro scan readout greater than (&gt;) 12.5
             Kilopascal (kPa) as cut-off at screening

          -  Participants with controlled hypertension, with problems directly associated with the
             primary diagnosis of hepatic impairment may be included. Participants may have
             concurrent stable medical conditions and may be included in the study if the
             investigator and the sponsor consider that the condition(s) will not introduce an
             additional risk factor and will not interfere with the study objectives and the
             procedures (that is, participants with mild degenerative joint disease, controlled
             diabetes, controlled thyroid conditions, other conditions addressed on a case by case
             basis)

          -  Concomitant medications to treat underlying disease states or medical conditions
             related to hepatic impairment are allowed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of/or current clinically significant medical illness that could interfere with
             the interpretation of the study results.

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-3989 or its excipients.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year before screening or positive test
             results at screening and Day -1.

          -  Blood or blood products donated or substantial loss of blood (more than 500
             milliliters [mL]) within 3 months before the study starts

          -  Experimental drug received (including investigational vaccines) or experimental
             medical device used within 1 month or within a period less than 10 times the drug's
             half-life, whichever is longer, before the first dose of the study intervention is
             scheduled.

          -  Evidence of infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2, hepatitis
             A, B or C (except if sustained virologic response to HCV treatment)

          -  Inability to fast for 10 hours

          -  Signs of hepatocellular carcinoma or history of biliary obstruction within the past 2
             years

          -  Lack of good or reasonable venous access

          -  Use of any disallowed therapies as per protocol

          -  Participants with advanced renal disease with staggered estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (eGFR) cutoff for increasing degree of hepatic impairment

          -  History of Liver transplant, gastroesophageal variceal bleeding within 6 months prior
             to screening, known gastric varices, uncontrolled ascites, spontaneous bacterial
             peritonitis within 3 months before screening

          -  Acute or exacerbating hepatitis, fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function
             or use of any therapy known to exacerbate hepatic dysfunction within 2 weeks of study
             intervention administration

          -  Clinically significant laboratory findings except as related to hepatic impairment as
             defined per protocol
