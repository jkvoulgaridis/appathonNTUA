  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter single-arm, open label study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Neuroguard IEP System for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in
      subjects at elevated risk for adverse events following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The
      Neuroguard IEP System is a 3-in-1 carotid stent delivery system consisting of an angioplasty
      balloon, an integrated embolic protection device and a nitinol self-expanding stent loaded
      over the balloon and constrained by an outer sheath. Eligible patients between 20 and 80
      years of age have been diagnosed with either de-novo atherosclerotic or post CEA restenotic
      lesion(s) in the internal carotid arteries (ICA) or at the carotid bifurcation with ≥50%
      stenosis if symptomatic or ≥80% stenosis if asymptomatic (both defined by angiography using
      NASCET methodology). Symptomatic patients are defined as having stroke or TIA ipsilateral to
      the carotid lesion within 180 days of the procedure within the hemisphere supplied by the
      target vessel. Enrolled subjects will be followed at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months
      and 36 months.
