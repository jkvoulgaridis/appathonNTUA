  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done in patients who have been receiving corticosteroids or other
      immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of cGVHD for at least 6 months. The purpose of
      this study is to find out if itacitinib in combination with corticosteroids or other
      immunosuppressive therapies is safe and effective in people with cGVHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease remains a major hurdle to improve allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation outcome, with cGVHD being associated with decreased quality of life.
      Suppression of the immune system with corticosteroids forms the basis of first-line therapy
      for management of GVHD, but sustained responses are usually seen in less than 50 percent of
      patients and there is no standard second- or third-line treatment for steroid refractory
      cGVHD. Identification of novel therapeutic targets are needed to improve outcomes.
      Therapeutic potential has been shown by a JAK inhibitor in the treatment of steroid
      refractory GVHD. Itacitinib is a novel, selective inhibitor of the JAK family of protein
      tyrosine kinases and will be studied here in patients with steroid refractory cGVHD.

               -  Cholestatic disorders or unresolved veno-occlusive disease of the liver

               -  Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
                  alter the absorption of oral itacitinib (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled

             platelet function including, but not limited to, aspirin dose exceeding 81 mg/day and
             related drugs such as heparin or warfarin sodium. Use of low molecular weight heparin
             is allowed.

         12. Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to itacitinib or any of its
             excipients
