  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with the symptoms of generalized GI dysmotility, including gastroparesis, are
      sometimes refractory to available medications, devices and other interventions/ Some of these
      patients have serologic and/or endo organ abnormalities and findings consistent with
      autoimmune neuropathies, primarily involving the GI tract. These disorders have been known as
      autoimmune gastrointestinal neuropathies (GAIN) or also as autoimmune gastrointestinal
      dysmotility (AGID), among other terms. Some patients respond to intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIG) and this study, which is an observational clinical series, documents the patients,
      their findings and standardized responses to therapy with IVIG.

      Gastrointestinal dysmotility disorders encompass a large group of patients including a subset
      with autoimmune findings, either on serologic testing and/or end organ anatomic and
      physiologic effects.

      The identification of patients with autoimmune gastrointestinal neuropathies (GAIN) or also
      as autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID), has led to trial with autoimmune
      therapies. Most promising therapy has been intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and this,
      usually given in 12-week courses with standard dosing, has helped a number of patient's
      refractory to other available therapies including diet, drugs, devices and enteral
      diversions/disruptions.This observational study documents clinical observations in
      consecutive patients meeting entry criteria who received IVIG.

      Patients will have their gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms documented by a standardized patient
      reported outcome (PRO) survey at baseline and use the same assessment tools after at least
      one course of IVIG therapy.

    <description>The primary outcome measures are patient symptoms via the traditional gastroparesis patient reported outcome scale. It uses a 0-4 scale from none to worse on GI Symptoms; for example: Nausea,Vomiting, Anorexia/Early Satiety, Bloating/distension, Abdominal Pain. Scored as each item plus a total that is the sum of the individual scales.The five Sx subscales of 0-4 each are summed for a total score range 0-20</description>
