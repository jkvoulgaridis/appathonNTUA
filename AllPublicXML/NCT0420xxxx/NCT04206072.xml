      This is a Phase II/III, open-label, randomised study assessing the efficacy and safety of
      D-0316 (70 mg once daily for 21 days, then increased to 100 mg once daily, orally) versus
      Icotinib (125 mg three times daily, orally) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      NSCLC that is known to be EGFR sensitising mutation (EGFRm) positive, treatment-naive and
      eligible for first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI.
