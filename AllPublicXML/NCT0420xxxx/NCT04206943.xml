  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a treatment that activates and strengthens the immune system against cancer. Recently,
      T cell receptors have been genetically rearranged by adaptive T cell therapies, which are
      promising in the fight against cancer, and are now able to recognize antigens on tumor cells.
      These modified T cell receptors are called chimeric antigen receptors. Many previous clinical
      studies have shown that different CAR-T cells are effective in relapse / refractory B cell
      cancers and NHL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapy started at the end of 1990s. Phase I and II trials have
      still evaluated the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cells in hematological and solid cancers.
      The therapy involves drawing blood from patients and isolation of the T cells. Next, the T
      cells are genetically engineered in a laboratory by using virus or sleeping beauty to produce
      receptors on their surface named as chimeric antigen receptors. As the last step, the CAR-T
      cells are infused back into the patient. After infusion, it is expected that the CAR-T cells
      further increase in number in the patient's body and with the help of their engineered
      receptor to recognize and target the antigen on the surface of the cancerous cells for
      antitumor effect.
