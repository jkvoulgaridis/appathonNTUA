      Background:

      People get malaria when they are bitten by an infected mosquito. Malaria can be serious and
      sometimes deadly. Although there are medicines to treat malaria, there is no vaccine that
      fully prevents infection. Researchers want to test if an experimental drug can help.

      Objective:

      To test a drug called CIS43LS that could prevent malaria infection.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18-50 who have never been infected with malaria

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, blood tests, and medical history.

      Some participants will get pregnancy tests.

      Most participants will get CIS43LS. They will get the drug infused into a vein in their arm
      or injected into the fat under the skin. They will be monitored for side effects for up to 4
      hours after they get the drug.

      Participants will be given a thermometer to check their temperature every day for 7 days.
      They will also be given a device to measure any redness, swelling, or bruising at the
      injection site.

      Participants will have up to 12 follow-up visits. These will include blood tests.

      Most participants will take part in a Controlled Human Malaria Challenge (CHMI). During the
      CHMI, mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite will bite participants in a controlled
      setting. The participants will then have clinic visits every day for up to 12 days starting 7
      days after the CHMI. They will be treated right away with antimalarial medication if the test
      shows positive for malaria. If participants continue to test negative for malaria, they will
      have 2 more visits over the next 6 days for blood tests. Then 28 days after the CHMI they
      will get treated with antimalarial medication for 3 days. The study will last 2-6 months
      depending on participants study group....

      Title: VRC 612: A Phase 1, Dose Escalation, Open-Label Clinical Trial with Experimental
      Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) to Evaluate the Safety and Protective Efficacy of
      an Anti- Malaria Human Monoclonal Antibody, VRC-MALMAB0100-00-AB (CIS43LS), in Healthy,
      Malaria-Na(SqrRoot) ve Adults.

      Design: This is the first study of the VRC-MALMAB0100-00-AB (CIS43LS) monoclonal antibody
      (mAb) targeting the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) in healthy
      adults. This two-part, dose-escalation, adaptive design study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and protective efficacy of CIS43LS. The primary
      hypothesis is that CIS43LS will be safe and tolerable when administered by either intravenous
      (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) routes. The secondary hypotheses are that CIS43LS will be
      detectable in human sera with a definable half-life and confer protection following a
      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI).

      Study Product: VRC-MALMAB0100-00-AB was isolated and developed by the Vaccine Research Center
      (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of
      Health (NIH) and binds a unique and conserved epitope at the junction of the N- and repeat
      regions of the PfCSP.

      Subjects: Healthy subjects, 18-50 years of age, who are malaria-naive.

      Study Plan:

        -  Part A: Part A will evaluate the doses and routes as shown below in the Study Schema
           table in an open-label, dose escalation design. The study will start with enrollment
           into Group 1. Interim safety evaluations will occur and must support continued
           evaluation of CIS43LS prior to enrolling subjects into the higher dose groups. Groups 1,
           2, 3, 4A, and 5 will participate in the CHMI, which will occur greater than or equal to
           10 days through 10 weeks post product administration. Group 4B will not receive CHMI in
           order to obtain requisite safety and PK data that are unaffected by CHMI. Group 5 will
           not receive investigational product in order to serve as the control group for the CHMI.
           Following CHMI, all participants will be evaluated for malaria parasitemia. Subjects who
           develop blood stage infection will be treated as soon as identified per protocol
           criteria. If not already treated, all CHMI participants will receive directly observed
           antimalarial treatment at Day 28 post-CHMI. Part A safety, PK and immunogenicity data
           will be used to inform Part B development.

        -  Part B: Part B will further assess the optimal dose and route of CIS43LS needed to reach
           a threshold of protection. Part B will not begin until Part A data are reviewed by the
           Sponsor and the US Food and Drug Administration makes the determination that it is Safe
           to Proceed. Part A subjects who were uninfected may be included in Part B to receive
           repeat dosing of CIS43LS and/or repeat CHMI. New subjects may also enroll into Part B to
           receive CIS43LS followed by CHMI.

      Duration: Subjects who receive CIS43LS will be followed through 24 weeks after product
      administration. Control subjects will be followed through 8 weeks after CHMI.
