  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of Precision1 DD CLs with regard to
      subjective symptoms (dryness, comfort, vision), lens fit and time to haze in CL wearers who
      identify themselves as heavy digital devices users (at least 6 hours of digital device use
      per day).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is between 18 and 40 years of age (inclusive) and has full legal capacity to
             volunteer;

          2. Has read and signed an information consent letter;

          3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;

          4. Is a heavy digital device user (at least 6 hours on a typical day using any
             combination of digital devices such as PC, laptop, smartphone, or tablet);

          5. Is a habitual wearer of daily, spherical, soft contact lenses (no bifocal or
             multifocal contact lenses, no extended wear or monovision, not a current wearer of
             Precision1 lenses) for at least 5 days/week and at least 10 hours/day during the month
             prior to enrollment;

          6. Has a vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction that ranges between
             -0.50D to -6.00D in each eye;

          7. Has a vertex corrected refractive cylinder of no more than -1.00D cylindrical
             correction in each eye after vertexing to the corneal plane;

          8. Demonstrates an acceptable fit and achieves best corrected visual acuity of at least
             0.20 log MAR in each eye with Precision1 contact lenses;

          9. Is willing to wear Precision1 CLs at least 5 days per week and 10 hours per day
             throughout the study;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;

          2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study
             outcome variable;

          4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator
             may affect a study outcome variable;

          5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;

          6. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment;

          7. Is aphakic;

          8. Has undergone refractive error surgery;

               -  For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or
                  inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered
                  clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction,
                  papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered
                  active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of
                  previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.
