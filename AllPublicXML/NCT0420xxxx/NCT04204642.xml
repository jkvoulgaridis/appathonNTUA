  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is one of the major types of cerebral small vessel disease,
      and a leading cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and cognitive decline in elderly
      patients. Although increasingly detected, a number of aspects including the pathophysiology,
      the clinical and neuroradiological phenotype and the disease course are still under
      investigation. The incomplete knowledge of the disease limits the implementation of evidence
      based guidelines on patient's clinical management and the development of treatments able to
      prevent or reduce disease progression.

      The SENECA (SEarchiNg biomarkErs of Cerebral Angiopathy) project is the first Italian
      multicentre cohort study aimed at better defining the disease natural history and identifying
      clinical and neuroradiological markers of disease progression. By a multidisciplinary
      approach and the collection of a large and well phenotyped series and biorepository of CAA
      patients, the study is ultimately expected to improve the diagnosis and the knowledge of CAA
      pathophysiological mechanisms.

      The SENECA is an Italian multicenter network integrating the experience of neurologists,
      neuroradiologists, neuro-ophthalmologists and biologists and allowing the standardized
      collection of a well-characterized wide series of sporadic and familial CAA patients.

      A peripheral blood withdrawal for APOE allele screening will be performed in all patients,
      after informed consent obtainment. Additionally, cases with early onset clinical
      manifestations and/or rapid clinical progression and/or relatives with a diagnosis of CAA or
      presenting early onset CAA clinical features will be addressed to the genetic screening of
      Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Transthyretin (TTR) gene. A subgroup of patients will
      undergo at T0, T1 and T2 a whole venous blood withdrawal, to collect serum and plasma
      samples, evaluate the platelet concentration of Aβ40 by thioflavin T (ThT) assay and Western
      blot analysis and the inflammatory and endothelial profile of CAA patients by ELISA or
      Bio-Plex Panels
