  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to test the effectiveness of a nonpharmacologic therapy for burning
      mouth syndrome (BMS). This nonpharmacologic therapy approach will be the fabrication a
      protective acrylic mouthguard for the maxillary arch and palate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves a nonpharmacologic and non-invasive treatment method for BMS which will be
      administered randomly (flipping a coin) to half of the study subjects, (case group) in
      addition to normal condition treatment protocol for BMS.

    <description>The mouthguard is a thin clear acrylic protector fabricated from an impression of a patient's upper teeth and palate. The acrylic protector will be trimmed and will fit onto the patient's upper teeth and palate for use during the day, except when eating to minimize trauma to the tongue that exacerbates burning tongue pain.</description>
