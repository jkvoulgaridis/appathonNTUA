  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness reflected by the
      retention rate of perampanel as the only add-on treatment in adult participants with primary
      generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic (SGTC) seizures based
      on focal or idiopathic generalized epilepsy in a non-interventional (observational) setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy with PGTC or SGTC seizures based on focal or
             idiopathic generalized epilepsy

          2. Active epilepsy with GTC seizures, demonstrated by the occurrence of at least 1 GTC
             seizure within 3 months before inclusion

          3. The decision to prescribe perampanel was made by the physician before and irrespective
             of his/her decision to include the participant in the study

          4. Receiving treatment with perampanel in line with the current Fycompa (perampanel) SmPC

          5. Perampanel must either be newly administered as the only add-on treatment to a current
             antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy or must be planned to substitute one of two AEDs
             of a current dual therapy planned to be stopped within 2 months after initiation of
             treatment with perampanel. It will be specified which AED is planned to be substituted
             by perampanel upon inclusion. It is assumed that participants start treatment with
             perampanel closely after the baseline visit. Retrospective inclusions will be allowed,
             but only if the time between the initiation of perampanel treatment and inclusion does
             not exceed 7 calendar days. In this case, the baseline visit documentation should
             reflect the situation (including seizure situation 3 months before baseline and
             baseline medication) to the date perampanel treatment was initiated

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants with known psychogenic non-epileptic seizures

          2. The participant had already received perampanel in the past

          3. Simultaneous participation in an interventional clinical study and/or taking an
             investigational drug
