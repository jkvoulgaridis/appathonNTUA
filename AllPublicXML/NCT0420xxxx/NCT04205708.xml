  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silicosis, a preventable yet irreversible occupational lung disease, has an insidious onset
      with a latency period for diagnosis extending beyond 10 years from the initial exposure. The
      central hypothesis of this study is that silicosis cases may currently be going undetected.
      The long-term goal of this research is to determine the current prevalence and forecast the
      future prevalence of silicosis and other pneumoconiosis among working populations in Oklahoma
      and to assist the public health and the healthcare system in planning for a potential
      resurgence of silicosis.

    <description>Tuberculosis (TB) test: A blood sample is collected for lab testing to determine if you have tuberculosis (QuantiFeron test). Alternatively, the test is done by injecting a small amount of fluid (called tuberculin) into the skin on the lower part of the arm. A person given the tuberculin skin test must return within 48 to 72 hours to have a trained health care worker look for a reaction on the arm.</description>
