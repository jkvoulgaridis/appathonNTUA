  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      mPTP (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore) is a channel formed by a protein complex
      integrated into the inner membrane of mitochondria. Its opening is related to the elevation
      of the intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration and will result in: a mitochondrial
      decoupling, a rupture of the metabolic gradient and the release of pro-apoptotic factors.

      The objective of this study is the development of a new ex vivo technique for characterizing
      mPTP by a dual measurement combining oxygraphy and fluorimetry on permeabilized skeletal
      muscle fibers.

    <textblock>
      The development of new expertise in the study of mPTP is part of an approach to optimize the
      processing of muscle samples. The aim of this work is to evaluate the feasibility and
      reproducibility of a method of analysis on muscle fibers only permeabilized, while coupling
      two complementary techniques, oxygraphy and fluorimetry. Its principle is based on the
      knowledge that the opening of the mPTP leads to an inhibition of respiration at the level of
      the complex I of the respiratory chain. This inhibition is the consequence of the escape from
      mitochondria of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH, i.e. substrate
      of complex I) concomitant with the opening of mPTP. Thus, the oxygraphy must allow the
      observation of the inhibition of respiration synonymous with the non-availability of the
      substrate of the complex I and thus indirectly reflect the opening of the mPTP. For its part,
      the fluorimetry must allow, in the presence of a fluorescent calcium indicator (i.e. Calcium
      Green), the observation of the release of calcium synonymous with the opening of the mPTP.

      Once validated, this technique should make it possible to evaluate in situ the sensitivity of
      mPTP to calcium. In a context of application within clinical protocols, the evaluation of the
      mPTP calcium sensitivity should contribute to a better understanding of the physiological and
      physio-pathological mechanisms of adaptation of muscle tissue.

    <description>The goal is to study the feasibility of a new method for the analysis of the calcium sensitivity of mPTP on non-phantomized permeabilized muscle fibers by coupled use of oxygen and fluorimetry techniques. Calcium quantity and time required to open mPTPs in permeabilized muscle fibers will be measured, in the presence or absence of ciclosporin A, observable by total inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (synonymous with release of NADH).</description>
