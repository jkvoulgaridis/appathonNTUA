  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This monocentric prospective observational pilot study aims to investigate if the measurement
      of TcPO2 can be used as a predictor of postoperative cutaneous pain in patients with ankle
      surgery.

      This prospective observational study aims to determine the limit of TcPO2 predictive of
      postoperative cutaneous pain in patients with ankle trauma.

      A TcPO2 measurement will be performed preoperatively at the patient's arrival in the
      emergency room, then every day after the operation for 3 days and finally at the follow-up
      visits at 3 and 6 weeks.

      The cutaneous pain is evaluated by a PSAS self-questionnaire (completed by the patient) and
      an OSAS questionnaire (completed by the surgeon). These grids evaluate the tolerance and
      cicatricial quality in the medium and long term by the operator and the patient.

Each parameter is rated on a scale from 1 (best score) to 10 (worst score). The sum of the 7 parameters gives the total score (minimum value = 7 ; maximum value = 70).</description>
