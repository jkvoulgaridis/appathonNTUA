  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of real-time ultrasound (US) capabilities, ultrasound technology has
      been adopted and incorporated into daily practice by many medical and surgical specialties.
      Using US to help assess the difficult airway constitutes just yet another valuable
      application of this versatile technology . Since many anesthesia providers had already
      acquired proficiency in US techniques in US guided vascular access and regional nerve blocks,
      using US to evaluate the airway could be learned and mastered without too much difficulty.
      Ultrasound of the upper airway may prove to become a useful adjunct to conventional clinical
      assessment tools, as it has been successful in visualizing the relevant anatomy and critical
      structures of the airway..

      The study is cross sectional observational study in which obese patients will be assessed
      using conventional clinical methods of airway assessment and by using US for the same patient
      before induction of anesthesia then correlated to the Cormack-Lehane finding after induction
      of anesthesia..
