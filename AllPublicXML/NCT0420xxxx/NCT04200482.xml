  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II trial is to identify the most effective dose level (number of
      classes) of a diet and physical activity lifestyle program based on how well it improves diet
      and physical activity in stage 0-III breast cancer survivors. Study results may provide
      researchers with information on how to best implement diet and physical activity
      recommendations among breast cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (LOW DOSE): Participants attend one in-person diet and physical activity class and
      receive an eHealth communication intervention for 6 months.

      ARM B (HIGH DOSE): Participants attend 6 monthly in-person diet and physical activity classes
      and receive an eHealth communication intervention for 6 months.
