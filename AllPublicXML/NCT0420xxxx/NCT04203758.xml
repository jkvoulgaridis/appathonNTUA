  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate whether a diet rich in rye fiber from
      wholegrain rye, compared to refined wheat, as part of a hypo-caloric diet leads to larger
      weight loss and lower body fat content after 12 weeks of intervention.
