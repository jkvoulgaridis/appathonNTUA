  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, for patients with stage I or II disease, surgery provides the best chance for
      cure.EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs)are standard first-line treatment for EGFR-mutant
      advanced NSCLC.Afatinib was a 2nd-generation EGFR TKI that covalently bound and irreversibly
      blocked signaling through activated EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),
      and ErbB4 receptors, and the FDA has approved afatinib for first-line treatment of patients
      with metastatic NSCLC who have sensitizing EGFR mutations.The treatment of stage III NSCLC
      remains a matter of debate. Current multimodality treatment options for stage III included
      definitive chemoradiation, surgery followed by adjuvant therapy,or neoadjuvant therapy
      followed by surgical resection.Previous studies have revealed that adjuvant EGFR-TKI could
      significantly prolong disease free surivival, and have less toxicity than adjuvant
      chemotherapy for early resectable EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients.EMERGING-CTONG1103
      regarding neoadjuvant erlotinib vs chemotherapy (Gemcitabine plus cisplatin) for stage III
      NSCLC reveal that erlotinib has improved ORR (54%), major pathological response, operation
      rate, R0 resection and lymph node downstaging, and progression-free survival (PFS).A phase II
      trial (ASCENT) of neoadjuvant afatinib for stage III EGFR-mutation NSCLC concludes that
      afatinib yields the highest ORR (75%) up to now and verifies the feasibility of neoadjuvant
      EGFR TKIs for stage III NSCLC. However, no more studies are available so far to confirm the
      efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant afatinib in the treatment of resectable stage III EGFR
      mutation-positive NSCLC, and there is a lack of studies based on the Chinese population.
      Given that the neoadjuvant therapy has delayed the operation time and there is a potential
      risk of cancer progression, more data are needed to perform evaluation.

    <description>①Neoadjuvant treatment stage: the enrolled patients take afatinib at a dosage of 40mg per day, 8 weeks in total; and receive CT scan re-examination in the 3th post-therapy week (on the 14th-21th day).
②Surgical treatment stage: the patients who respond to alfatinib treatment (CR+PR) and the patients who do not respond to alfatinib therapy but could still undergo surgery (SD and PD) will receive radical lung lobectomy+systematic lymph node dissection three weeks (22 days) later.
③Adjuvant treatment stage: The CR, PR and SD patients who have been treated surgically will take alfatinib at a dosage of 40mg per day for 1 year. The SD and PD patients who could not receive operation and the PD patients who have received operation will be transferred into medical oncology or/and radiation oncology and receive comprehensive therapy (chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy, the regimen is designed by oncologist and radiologist)</description>
