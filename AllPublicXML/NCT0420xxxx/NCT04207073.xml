  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the studies in the literature are examined, no study has been reached to examine whether
      median nerve mobilization causes changes in two-point discriminatory values in healthy
      individuals. This study aimed to investigate the effect of median nerve mobilization exercise
      on two-point discrimination in healthy adult male and female participants. Secondly, it was
      aimed to determine the role of variables such as gender, age, BMI (weight in kilograms,
      height in meters and weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m^2), smoking,
      dominant extremity and physical activity level in 2-point discrimination.

    <textblock>
      Two-point discrimination is one of the most important cortical senses that require strong
      tactile sensitivity and the ability to distinguish two points from one point on the skin.
      Neural mobilization has been reported to be effective in the nerve-related waist, leg, neck,
      arm, and plantar heel pain, but there is still insufficient evidence for other
      neuromusculoskeletal problems. It has been stated that factors such as application technique,
      type and patient characteristics of mobilization are effective in the treatment and more
      comprehensive studies should be done on this subject. This study aimed to investigate the
      effect of median nerve mobilization exercise on two-point discrimination in healthy adult
      male and female participants.

      120 healthy female and male adult individuals (60 females, 60 males) will be included in the
      study. Individuals will be divided into two groups as female and male (n = 60), and a
      two-point discrimination test will be performed on the palmar face of both hands from the
      distal phalanx, forefinger, middle finger and palm. After the evaluation, the participants in
      both groups were randomly divided into two groups as the exercise group (n = 30) and control
      group (n = 30). Participants in the exercise group will perform 2 sets of 5 repetitive Median
      nerve mobilization exercises (total of 20 sessions) per day for 10 days. After the exercise
      program, the two-point discrimination measures will be repeated in all groups.
