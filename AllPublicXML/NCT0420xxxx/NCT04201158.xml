  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that activities of daily living, physical fitness, exercise capacity and quality
      of life are affected by the obesity. It is aimed to determine the effects obesity on daily
      living activities, physical fitness, exercise capacity and quality of life in obese
      adolescents compared to healthy subjects in this study. The relationship between these
      parameters and the activities of daily living which are less studied in obese adolescents
      will be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      Obesity among children, adolescents and adults has emerged as one of the most serious public
      health problems in the 21st century. There has been a significant decrease in the exercise
      capacity, physical fitness and activities of daily living of children and adolescents with
      the increase in the prevalence of obesity over the last decade. Obesity can cause not only
      health problems but also psychological effects. This situation have negative effects on the
      quality of life. The effect of these parameters on healthy individuals and obese adolescents
      will be demonstrated by this study and will guide the rehabilitation of obese adolescents.
