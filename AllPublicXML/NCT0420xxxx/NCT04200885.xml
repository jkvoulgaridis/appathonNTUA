  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study; Among the patients randomized because of severe postoperative sequelae
      expected as a result of radiological and clinical examinations; nonsteroid antiinflammatory
      drug prescribed group compared with preoperative single dose intraoral submucosal
      corticosteroid administration and therapeutic elastic bandage application considering
      inflammatory symptoms' severity and health related quality of life following surgical removal
      of impacted third molars. The study hypothesis was formed stating that corticosteroid
      injection and elastic bandage application would reduce the inflammatory symptoms more than
      NSAID.

    <measure>Wound Healing Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative second and seventh days.</time_frame>
    <description>Extraction wound healing rates were evaluated by Landry's healing index. The index scores were classified as; 1. Very poor, 2. Poor, 3. Good, 4. Very Good and 5. Excellent.</description>

    <measure>Oral Health Impact Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively on the day of surgery, postoperative second and seventh days.</time_frame>
    <description>Oral health-related quality of life was followed up with Oral Health Impaction Profile-14 questionnaire (Turkish Version). The investigators aimed to detect the alterations in quality of life due to surgical intervention and the other treatment modalities. The obtainable scores vary between 0-56 points. Lower scores indicate better postoperative physical and psychological conditions.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Symptom Severity Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative seventh day.</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative inflammatory symptoms were evaluated with the postoperative symptom severity scale at the end of the follow-up period individually. The scale scores vary between 0%-100%. The higher scores indicate that the individual experienced severe symptoms. The investigators aimed to detect the severity of symptoms from the point of the patient's view.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Postoperative NSAID Prescription</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in this arm received common postoperative prescriptions following removal of their impacted third molars for seven days; twice a day 500 mg amoxicillin+125 mg clavulanic acid, twice a day 25 mg dexketoprofen trometamol and three times a day 1.5 mg/ml clorhexidine gluconate+1.2 mg/ml benzydamine hydrochloride containing 200 ml mouthwash.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Preoperative Submucosal Corticosteroid Injection</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in this arm were administered 8mg/2ml dexamethasone 21-phosphate preoperatively after local anesthesia were obtained. Injection site was the depth of buccal sulcus near operation site. For the patients in this arm 25 mg dexketoprofen trometamol was excluded from postoperative prescription in order not to affect the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroid. Instead of NSAID, three times a day 500 mg paracetamol was prescribed. The patients were advised not to exceed maximal dosage of 3000 mg (6 tablets) in a day.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Postoperative Therapeutic Elastic Bandage Application</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this arm the therapeutic elastic bandage applications were immediately performed after removal of mandibular third molars. The distance between tragus-lateral commissura line and supraclavicular lymph nodes was measured and the tapes were then cut into 5 tails. The base of the tape was placed on supraclavicular lymph nodes and tails were placed on the site to cover parotid, submandibular, submental and superficial cervical lymph nodes. The tapes were removed on postoperative second day.</description>
