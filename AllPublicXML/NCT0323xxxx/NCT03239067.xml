  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center study to assess the long- and short-term outcomes of
      ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients will undergo face-to-face interviews, phone
      calls, or/and chart reviews at 7 days, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months. When 4500 patients
      have completed the follow-up, an interim analysis will be performed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite incidence of vascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular death was defined as death from cardiovascular causes or cerebrovascular causes and any unknown death unless there was another certain cause.
The definition of myocardial infarction was consistent with the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (1).
Stroke was defined as a rapid onset of a new focal loss of neurologic function caused by an ischemic central nervous system event with residual symptoms lasting at least 24 hours from their onset or leading to death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite incidence of all-cause death, myocardial infarction and stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>All-cause death was defined as any death at hospital or after discharge.
The definition of myocardial infarction was consistent with the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.
Stroke was defined as a rapid onset of a new focal loss of neurologic function caused by an ischemic central nervous system event with residual symptoms lasting at least 24 hours from their onset or leading to death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite incidence of vascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, recurrent ischemia, transient ischemic attack, or other arterial thrombotic events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular death was defined as death from cardiovascular causes or cerebrovascular causes and any unknown death unless there was another certain cause.
The definition of myocardial infarction was consistent with the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (1).

  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of safety endpoints</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety endpoints were defined according to the TIMI bleeding criteria.(2) Major bleeding (not related to heart surgery) was defined as fatal-, or intracranial bleeding including any clinically overt signs of hemorrhage associated with a decreased hemoglobin levels (≥5g/dl). Minor bleeding was defined as any clinically overt bleeding leading to decrease in hemoglobin levels of 3 to 5 g/dL or any bleeding requiring medical intervention. Minimal bleeding was defined as any overt bleeding event that did not meet the above criteria. An independent blinded central committee adjudicated all suspected endpoint event.</description>
