  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib plus rituximab and lenalidomide work in
      treating elderly participants with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving ibrutinib plus rituximab and lenalidomide may work
      better in treating elderly participants with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) at 4 months of ibrutinib plus rituximab and
      lenalidomide in elderly patients with newly-diagnosed, untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile of the combination of ibrutinib plus rituximab and
      lenalidomide in newly diagnosed, untreated MCL.

      II. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR); (partial response [PR] or better), the
      response duration (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and
      overall survival (OS). Clinical benefit response [(CBR) = marginal response (MR) + ORR] will
      also be evaluated.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlative studies will be aimed at confirming the mechanism of action of the combination
      and to identify predictors of response or resistance to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ibrutinib orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants also receive rituximab
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in course 1 and 2, on day 1 of course 3-8, and
      then on day 1 of every other 28-day course, lenalidomide PO on days 1-21, and dexamethasone
      PO weekly. Treatment with rituximab repeats every 28 days for 2 years, with lenalidomide for
      1 year, and with dexamethasone for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and every 6 months thereafter.

    <description>The overall response (complete response + partial response) at four months and toxicity at one month (during course 1) will be monitored simultaneously using the Bayesian approach of Thall, Simon, Estey as extended by Thall and Sung. Independence was assumed between or and toxicity, where toxicity is defined as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within cycle 1.</description>

    <description>Toxicity data by type and severity will be summarized by frequency tables. For the efficacy endpoints, intend-to-treat analysis will be performed. For the toxicity endpoint, per-treated analysis will be performed to include any patient who received the treatment regardless of the eligibility nor the duration or dose of the treatment received.</description>

The distribution of time-to-event endpoints including overall survival and progression free survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Comparison of time-to-event endpoints by important subgroups will be made using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression will be employed for multivariate analysis on time-to-event outcomes.</description>

             heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly
             effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28
             days before she starts taking lenalidomide through 90 days and ibrutinib through 30
             days after the last dose of study drug. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy
             testing.

          -  All patients must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the
             Revlimid Rems program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious medical condition that, in the investigator opinion, places the patient at
             unacceptable risk and/or would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent
             form. Examples include but are not limited to, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus, active/symptomatic coronary artery disease, active infection
             requiring treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, antiviral or antifungal agents,

             arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within 6 months at the

          -  Major surgery or wound that has not fully healed within 4 weeks or vaccination with
             live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drugs.
