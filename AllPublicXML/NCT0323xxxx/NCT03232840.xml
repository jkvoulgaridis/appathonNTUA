  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the efficiency of an e-learning in order
      to put into practice some preventive measures to avoid wrong site surgery during anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before the study, the investigators selected 7 preventive measures to avoid wrong site
      surgery during regional anesthesia combined or not with general anesthesia . These measures
      were learned to the entire anesthesia team (nurse, resident and anesthesiologist) during
      conventional meetings. An initial evaluation of the application of these measures will be
      carried out before the introduction of e-learning. This assessment will be conducted by
      nurses without the knowledge of the anesthetic team evaluated. After this initial evaluation,
      e-learning will be broadcast on the hospital intranet. Then a second evaluation of the
      application of the preventive measures will be carried out 6 month and 1 year after the
      introduction of e-learning.
