  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the topical application to gingival tissue of
      the combination of benzocaine and tetracaine has a longer duration of local anesthetic
      activity than benzocaine alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a blinded study, either benzocaine alone or the combination of benzocaine and tetracaine
      will be sprayed onto the gingival mucosal tissue. Onset and duration of local anesthesia will
      be evaluated over a one hour period using pin prick and quantitative sensory testing of heat
      (QST-heat) stimulation. Subjects will receive both treatments in a cross-over design with
      each session separated by 4-14 days. A total of 50 subjects (normal volunteers) will be
      evaluated.

    <measure>Stage II: Duration of Anesthesia as Measured by Pin Prick Test (PPT) for One Spray CTY-5339-A Compared to One Spray CTY-5339-CB</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one hour post-application</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of effect, was defined as the length of time in minutes from onset of anesthesia to the absence of anesthesia.Onset was the time point at which the PPT average pain score was less than the Baseline PPT average score by any amount. Also, in 10 minutes or less, the subject must have had a lower PPT average pain score of ≥ 1 unit than Baseline. Absence of anesthesia was defined as follows: After Onset had been established, absence was the first of two time points with consecutive occurrences of regression of absence of analgesia. Reports of less pain by ≥1 unit than Baseline indicated analgesia; while a report of similar (&lt; 1 unit) or more pain than Baseline indicated regression or absence of analgesia. The minimum onset time was 1 minute. PPT scores were assessed using a 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) Numerical Rating Scale at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point.

    <time_frame>Up to one hour post-application</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of effect, was defined as the time from onset to treatment failure, as measured by QST Heat score. QST Heat scores were the temperature where the sensation of a heat stimuli was felt: ranging from 35 ºC to a maximum of 50.5 ºC with intervals of 0.5 ºC, at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point. The QST Heat-based &quot;Duration of effect&quot; was calculated by the length of time in minutes from onset of anesthesia to the absence of anesthesia where Onset of anesthesia was defined by PPT unless specific QST thresholds were not met. After Onset had been established, absence of analgesia or offset was the first of two time points with consecutive occurrences of regression or absence of analgesia. Reports of QST heat pain temperature by ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST indicated analgesia; while a report of similar (&lt;3 °C) than Baseline indicated regression or absence of analgesia.

        <title>Stage II: Duration of Anesthesia as Measured by Pin Prick Test (PPT) for One Spray CTY-5339-A Compared to One Spray CTY-5339-CB</title>
        <description>The duration of effect, was defined as the length of time in minutes from onset of anesthesia to the absence of anesthesia.Onset was the time point at which the PPT average pain score was less than the Baseline PPT average score by any amount. Also, in 10 minutes or less, the subject must have had a lower PPT average pain score of ≥ 1 unit than Baseline. Absence of anesthesia was defined as follows: After Onset had been established, absence was the first of two time points with consecutive occurrences of regression of absence of analgesia. Reports of less pain by ≥1 unit than Baseline indicated analgesia; while a report of similar (&lt; 1 unit) or more pain than Baseline indicated regression or absence of analgesia. The minimum onset time was 1 minute. PPT scores were assessed using a 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) Numerical Rating Scale at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point.

        <title>Stage II: Duration of Anesthesia as Measured by Heat Sensation Threshold (QST Heat) for One Spray CTY-5339-A Compared to One Spray CTY-5339-CB</title>
        <description>The duration of effect, was defined as the time from onset to treatment failure, as measured by QST Heat score. QST Heat scores were the temperature where the sensation of a heat stimuli was felt: ranging from 35 ºC to a maximum of 50.5 ºC with intervals of 0.5 ºC, at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point. The QST Heat-based &quot;Duration of effect&quot; was calculated by the length of time in minutes from onset of anesthesia to the absence of anesthesia where Onset of anesthesia was defined by PPT unless specific QST thresholds were not met. After Onset had been established, absence of analgesia or offset was the first of two time points with consecutive occurrences of regression or absence of analgesia. Reports of QST heat pain temperature by ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST indicated analgesia; while a report of similar (&lt;3 °C) than Baseline indicated regression or absence of analgesia.

          <title>Stage I: Duration of Anesthesia as Measured by Pin Prick Test (PPT) for One Spray CTY-5339-A Compared to One Spray CTY-5339-CB Compared to One Spray CTY-5339-P (Placebo: Vehicle Control)</title>
          <description>The duration of effect, was defined as the length of time in minutes from onset of anesthesia to the absence of anesthesia.Onset was the time point at which the PPT average pain score was less than the Baseline PPT average score by any amount. Also, in 10 minutes or less, the subject must have had a lower PPT average pain score of ≥ 1 unit than Baseline. Absence of anesthesia was defined as follows: After Onset had been established, absence was the first of two time points with consecutive occurrences of regression of absence of analgesia. Reports of less pain by ≥1 unit than Baseline indicated analgesia; while a report of similar (&lt; 1 unit) or more pain than Baseline indicated regression or absence of analgesia. The minimum onset time was 1 minute. PPT scores were assessed using a 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) Numerical Rating Scale at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point.

        <title>Stage I: Duration of Anesthesia as Measured by Heat Sensation Threshold (QST Heat) for One Spray CTY-5339-A Compared to One Spray CTY-5339-CB Compared to One Spray CTY-5339-P (Placebo: Vehicle Control)</title>
        <description>The duration of effect, was defined as the time from onset to treatment failure, as measured by QST Heat score. QST Heat scores were the temperature where the sensation of a heat stimuli was felt: ranging from 35 ºC to a maximum of 50.5 ºC with intervals of 0.5 ºC, at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point. The QST Heat-based &quot;Duration of effect&quot; was calculated by the length of time in minutes from onset of anesthesia to the absence of anesthesia where Onset of anesthesia was defined by PPT unless specific QST thresholds were not met. After Onset had been established, absence of analgesia or offset was the first of two time points with consecutive occurrences of regression or absence of analgesia. Reports of QST heat pain temperature by ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST indicated analgesia; while a report of similar (&lt;3 °C) than Baseline indicated regression or absence of analgesia.

        <title>Stage II: Percentage of Responders for Heat Sensation Threshold (QST Heat) at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>Response at a time point is defined as an increase of QST heat pain temperature by ≥ 3 degrees C compared to the Baseline QST.
QST Heat scores were the temperature where the sensation of a heat stimuli was felt: ranging from 35 ºC to a maximum of 50.5 ºC with intervals of 0.5 ºC, at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point.

        <description>SPID was calculated as a sum of the delta PPT scores at each time point until the designated time point. The delta PPT score is defined as the change in PPT score from baseline. PPT scores were assessed using a 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) Numerical Rating Scale at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point.
The total possible scale range was from -100 (best) to +100 (worst) for SPID at the 30 minute time point, and from -160 (best) to +160 (worst) for SPID at the 60 minute time point Lower scores signify a better outcome (less sensitive to pain than at baseline = less pain with therapy = therapy was more effective).

        <title>Stage I: Percentage of Responders for Heat Sensation Threshold (QST Heat) at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>Response at a time point is defined as an increase of QST heat pain temperature by ≥ 3 degrees C compared to the Baseline QST. QST Heat scores were the temperature where the sensation of a heat stimuli was felt: ranging from 35 ºC to a maximum of 50.5 ºC with intervals of 0.5 ºC, at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point.

        <title>Stage I: Onset of Anesthesia for Heat Sensation Threshold (QST Heat)</title>
        <description>Onset of anesthesia was defined by Pin Prick Test (PPT) unless specific QST thresholds were not met.
If the PPT Onset was 5 minutes or less, then QST must have been greater than the Baseline QST temperature at 5 minutes by any amount and QST must have been ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST at 5 or 10 minutes.
If the PPT Onset was 10 minutes, then QST must have been ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST temperature at 10 minutes.
If PPT did not achieve Onset, then QST alone could have achieved onset at either 5 or 10 minutes if QST was greater than the Baseline QST temperature at 5 or 10 minutes by any amount and the QST was ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST at 5 or 10 minutes.
QST Heat scores were the temperature where the sensation of a heat stimuli was felt: ranging from 35 ºC to a maximum of 50.5 ºC with intervals of 0.5 ºC, at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point.

          <title>Stage I: Onset of Anesthesia for Heat Sensation Threshold (QST Heat)</title>
          <description>Onset of anesthesia was defined by Pin Prick Test (PPT) unless specific QST thresholds were not met.
If the PPT Onset was 5 minutes or less, then QST must have been greater than the Baseline QST temperature at 5 minutes by any amount and QST must have been ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST at 5 or 10 minutes.
If the PPT Onset was 10 minutes, then QST must have been ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST temperature at 10 minutes.
If PPT did not achieve Onset, then QST alone could have achieved onset at either 5 or 10 minutes if QST was greater than the Baseline QST temperature at 5 or 10 minutes by any amount and the QST was ≥ 3 °C of the Baseline QST at 5 or 10 minutes.
QST Heat scores were the temperature where the sensation of a heat stimuli was felt: ranging from 35 ºC to a maximum of 50.5 ºC with intervals of 0.5 ºC, at a frequency of every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then every 5 minutes thereafter until the final 60 minute time point.
