  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Clinical Study is a pivotal study to evaluate the safety of the SiteSeal™ Adjunctive
      Compression Device across a broad array of patients undergoing interventional endovascular
      procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a single arm with 90 patients. The primary endpoints measure the risk for
      common femoral nerve damage and common femoral artery laceration from the blind placement of
      a Z-stitch in the soft tissue above the femoral bundle.

      The sample size is 90 patients. The project objective is to demonstrate the safety of the
      device.

    <time_frame>24 hour interview</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are called back after 24 hours and asked to rate their discomfort on a 1-10 scale. The mean of all patients 1-10scale rating is reported as the discomfort of the arm.</description>

    <description>After intervention (deployment and removal of the Site Seal endovascular adjunctive compression device), the physician determines whether or not there was laceration of the femoral nerve or laceration of the femoral artery per protocol. A series of possible minor and/or major complications are noted per protocol.
There is a secondary metric as to patient reported pain on a 1-10scale.</description>
