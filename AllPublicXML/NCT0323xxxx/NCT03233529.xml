    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to characterize the mechanism of action of crisaborole ointment
      2%, by evaluation of efficacy and changes in key skin biomarkers in atopic dermatitis (AD)
      lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% over vehicle, in subjects with mild to moderate
      AD. Two identified AD skin lesions for each subject will be treated for the first 15 days,
      one with crisaborole ointment 2% and one with vehicle, in a blinded manner, and biopsies for
      biomarker analysis will be performed on the lesions. Following completion of the blinded
      treatment period, subjects will start the 28 day open label period during which all AD
      affected skin lesions will be treated with crisaborole ointment 2% twice daily.

    <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity on or after the first dose of study treatment. Each participant received both crisaborole (for one target lesion) and vehicle (for the other target lesion) on the same days during double-blind period, and only crisaborole during open-label period; therefore AEs were reported for each treatment group for participants to capture all AEs, instead of each treatment for treated area as it only captures AEs occurred at treated areas (see next Outcome Measure).</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose of study treatment (on Day 1) to Day 15 skin biopsy collection</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity on or after the first dose of study treatment. During double-blind period, there were a total of 2 treatment areas (for target lesions) for each participant. For this outcome measure, treatment-emergent AEs occurred at each treated area during double-blind period were summarized. MedDRA version 21.0 coding dictionary was used.</description>

          <description>The study consisted of 2 periods, i.e., a double-blind period from Day 1 to Day 15 skin biopsy collection, and an open-label period from Day 15 skin biopsy collection to the end of study (Day 71). Each participant received double-blind topical administration of crisaborole ointment 2 percent (%) for 1 target lesion and placebo ointment vehicle (referred to as vehicle) for the other target lesion (i.e., each participant was treated with both crisaborole and vehicle), twice daily from Day 1 to Day 14; then received open-label topical administration of crisaborole ointment 2% for all atopic dermatitis skin areas (excluding scalp) twice daily from Day 15 to Day 42.</description>

          <description>The study consisted of 2 periods, i.e., a double-blind period from Day 1 to Day 15 skin biopsy collection, and an open-label period from Day 15 skin biopsy collection to the end of study (Day 71). Each participant received double-blind topical administration of crisaborole ointment 2 percent (%) for 1 target lesion and placebo ointment vehicle (referred to as vehicle) for the other target lesion (i.e., each participant was treated with both crisaborole and vehicle), twice daily from Day 1 to Day 14; then received open-label topical administration of crisaborole ointment 2% for all atopic dermatitis skin areas (excluding scalp) twice daily from Day 15 to Day 42.</description>

        <description>The lesion TSS is an assessment of target lesion severity based on the severity of the following 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification, each of which was rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). These 4 ratings were then added to create the TSS, which ranges from 0 (none) to 12 (most severe), with higher score representing greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Lesion Severity as Measured by TSS at Day 8</title>
        <description>The lesion TSS is an assessment of target lesion severity based on the severity of the following 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification, each of which was rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). These 4 ratings were then added to create the TSS, which ranges from 0 (none) to 12 (most severe), with higher score representing greater severity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Lesion Severity as Measured by TSS at Day 8</title>
          <description>The lesion TSS is an assessment of target lesion severity based on the severity of the following 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification, each of which was rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). These 4 ratings were then added to create the TSS, which ranges from 0 (none) to 12 (most severe), with higher score representing greater severity.</description>

        <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity on or after the first dose of study treatment. Each participant received both crisaborole (for one target lesion) and vehicle (for the other target lesion) on the same days during double-blind period, and only crisaborole during open-label period; therefore AEs were reported for each treatment group for participants to capture all AEs, instead of each treatment for treated area as it only captures AEs occurred at treated areas (see next Outcome Measure).</description>
