    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of single and multiple oral doses of TAK-906 in Japanese healthy male
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. TAK-906 is being tested in healthy
      participants in order to evaluate safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses
      of TAK-906 in Japanese healthy male participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in Cohort 1 or Cohort 3.
      Study drug will be administered in a double-blind manner which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need),
      orally, once daily on Day 1 as Single Dose Period and twice daily from Day 3 to 7 as Multiple
      Dose Period:

        -  TAK-906 50 mg (Cohort 1)

        -  TAK-906 100 mg (Cohort 2)

        -  TAK-906 10 mg (Cohort 3)

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      Cohort 2 will be conducted after the completion of Cohort 1. This will be conducted in Japan.

             esophagitis, frequent [more than once per week] occurrence of heartburn, or any
             surgical intervention).

         16. The participant has a history of cancer, except basal cell carcinoma which has been in
             remission for at least 5 years prior to Day 1.

             cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch or nicotine gum) within 4
             weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of study drug. Cotinine test is positive at
             Screening.

         19. The participant has poor peripheral venous access.

         20. The participant has undergone whole blood collection of at least 200 mL within 4 weeks
             (28 days) or at least 400 mL within 12 weeks (84 days) prior to the start of study
             drug administration.

         21. The participant has undergone whole blood collection of at least 800 mL in total
             within 52 weeks (364 days) prior to the start of study drug administration.

         22. The participant has undergone blood component collection within 2 weeks (14 days)
             prior to the start of study drug administration.

         23. The participant has a Screening or Check-in (Day -1) electrocardiogram (ECG) that was
             abnormal (clinically significant).

         24. The participant has a QTcF of greater than (&gt;) 450 millisecond (msec) on the ECG at
             Screening, at Check-in (Day -1), or prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 1
             predose).

         25. The participant has abnormal Screening or Day -1 laboratory values that suggest a
             clinically significant underlying disease or any participant with the following lab
             abnormalities:

               -  Transaminase (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase
                  [AST]) and/or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Creatinine &gt;1.2 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL).

         26. The participant who, in the opinion of the investigator or sub-investigator, is
             unlikely to comply with the protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
