  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to validate and develop a non-invasive imaging biomarker
      of prostate cancer detection, progression, and recurrence. Development of such a biomarker
      may be useful to differentiate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes allowing
      for selection of an appropriate risk adaptive therapy.

      The investigators will evaluate a novel second-generation low-molecular-weight prostate
      specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based positron emission tomography (PET) agent, 18F-DCFPyL,
      for detection of primary and metastatic prostate cancer. 18F-DCFPyL PET demonstrates very
      high tumor-to-background and tumor specific uptake which may allow for a more sensitive and
      accurate method for detection of early tumor recurrence and metastatic disease as compared to
      current PET radiotracers and current standard-of-care imaging including 99mTc-methylene
      diphosphonate bone scintigraphy (bone scan), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The investigators propose to evaluate this PET agent for
      three different prostate cancer clinical scenarios: (1) detection of clinically significant
      high-grade prostate cancer and initial staging, (2) detection of sites of recurrence in the
      setting of biochemical recurrence after definitive prostatectomy, and (3) detection of
      advanced androgen-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.
