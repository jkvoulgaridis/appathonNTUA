  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the participant's preference for treatment with
      once-weekly dosing of DPP-4 inhibitor trelagliptin versus once-daily dosing of DPP-4
      inhibitor alogliptin among the participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are being
      treated with once-daily dosing of DPP-4 inhibitor.

      The drugs being tested in this study are called Trelagliptin and Alogliptin. This study will
      look at the participant's preference for treatment with Trelagliptin versus Alogliptin.

      The study enrolled 60 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Trelagliptin 100 mg, followed by Alogliptin 25 mg

        -  Alogliptin 25 mg, followed by Trelagliptin 100 mg All participants will be asked to take
           one tablet of trelagliptin orally once a week or one tablet of alogliptin orally once a
           day throughout the study period.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 16 weeks. Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic.

    <description>Participants answered standardized questions about their preference of drug therapy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Participants selected one choice from the following 4 choices; either once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor or daily DPP-4 inhibitor, once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor, daily DPP-4 inhibitor, neither once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor nor daily DPP-4 inhibitor. Reported data was the number of participants with a choice of either trelagliptin (once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor) or alogliptin (once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor), trelagliptin, alogliptin, neither trelagliptin nor alogliptin.</description>

    <description>Participants answered standardized questions about their preference of drug therapy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The preference of drug therapy was categorized by background factors like age (years), gender, height (cm), weight (kg), BMI (kg/m^2), duration of diabetes (years), work status, alcohol intake history, smoking habits, experience of educational hospitalization on DM, presence of cohabiter, percentage of compliance with DPP-4 inhibitors during 4-weeks before the start of treatment period, number of oral drugs per day at the beginning of treatment period (excluding investigational drug), complication of metabolic syndrome, percentage of HbA1c (NGSP is the concentration of glucose bound to hemoglobin as a percent of the absolute maximum that can be bound) at the time of informed consent.</description>

          <title>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) at the time of informed consent</title>
          <description>DTSQ is a self-reported instrument consists of 6 questions about treatment satisfaction and 2 questions regarding blood sugar level. Reported data were calculated by questions excluding Questions 2 and 3, two questions regarding blood sugar level. Each question answered on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 to 6, based on concern with the diabetes treatment and experiences in the past few weeks. Higher total score for questions about treatment satisfaction indicate greater satisfaction with treatment and experiences.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants by Their Treatment Preference Using Standardized Questions at the End of Treatment Period by Background Factors</title>
        <description>Participants answered standardized questions about their preference of drug therapy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The preference of drug therapy was categorized by background factors like age (years), gender, height (cm), weight (kg), BMI (kg/m^2), duration of diabetes (years), work status, alcohol intake history, smoking habits, experience of educational hospitalization on DM, presence of cohabiter, percentage of compliance with DPP-4 inhibitors during 4-weeks before the start of treatment period, number of oral drugs per day at the beginning of treatment period (excluding investigational drug), complication of metabolic syndrome, percentage of HbA1c (NGSP is the concentration of glucose bound to hemoglobin as a percent of the absolute maximum that can be bound) at the time of informed consent.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants by Their Treatment Preference Using Standardized Questions at the End of Treatment Period by Background Factors (T-A Administered Group)</title>
          <description>Participants answered standardized questions about their preference of drug therapy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The preference of drug therapy was categorized by background factors like age (years), gender, height (cm), weight (kg), BMI (kg/m^2), duration of diabetes (years), work status, alcohol intake history, smoking habits, experience of educational hospitalization on DM, presence of cohabiter, percentage of compliance with DPP-4 inhibitors during 4-weeks before the start of treatment period, number of oral drugs per day at the beginning of treatment period (excluding investigational drug), complication of metabolic syndrome, percentage of HbA1c (NGSP is the concentration of glucose bound to hemoglobin as a percent of the absolute maximum that can be bound) at the time of informed consent.</description>
          <population>FAS included all enrolled participants who received either the investigational product or comparator at least once during the study after randomization.</population>
