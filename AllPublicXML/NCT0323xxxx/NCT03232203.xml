  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STRIMVELIS is a medicinal product that restores adenosine deaminase (ADA) function in
      hematopoietic cell lineages, thereby preventing impaired immune function. STRIMVELIS is
      indicated for the treatment of patients with ADA- severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID),
      for whom suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related stem cell donor is not
      available. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of routine and
      additional risk minimization measures by assessing the understanding of referring health care
      providers (HCPs) and parents/carers (hereby referred as participants) with regard to the
      specific risks associated with STRIMVELIS. In this cross-sectional study, surveys will be
      provided to referring HCPs and parents/carers of children approximately six months after
      treatment with STRIMVELIS. The study will recruit for approximately two years until 10
      referring HCPs and 10 parents/carers have completed their respective surveys.
