  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, almost all of Â½ million infants born prematurely in the US and 15 million
      worldwide suffer from abnormal brain maturation resulting from interactions between
      immaturity and atypical sensory experiences after birth. The current proposal uses rigorous
      scientific methods to measure the effects and determine the mechanisms of action of a
      parent-supported multisensory neurorehabilitative intervention for preterm infants, adaptable
      to a wide variety of neonatal environments, even when parents cannot be at their child's
      bedside. The intervention aims to improve brain multisensory processing, reactions to sensory
      stimulation in the home and long term language and motor development.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed is a randomized controlled trial design with intent-to-treat analysis in
      hospitalized preterm infants between 32 and 36 weeks post-menstrual age. Both the control and
      intervention groups will receive routine neonatal intensive care unit care (i.e.,
      skin-to-skin care by parent when available and daily sessions of exposure to recorded
      parent's voice). In addition to routine care, the parent-supported multisensory intervention
      consists of 10 sessions of standardized, therapist-administered, auditory-tactile stimulation
      that combines contingent recorded mother's voice delivered using a pacifier-activated system,
      during holding with supportive tactile containment against the therapist's chest, covered by
      cloth imprinted with mother's scent. Possible covariates, multi- and uni- sensory processing,
      will be measured at entry into the study and immediately after the treatment phase. Sensory
      reactivity will be measured at 1 year of age and language and motor outcomes will be assessed
      at 2 years. Except for parent reports, all measures will be administered by masked examiners.

    <description>Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile: A caregiver questionnaire used to measure sensory reactivity and adaptation to the environment of children birth to 36 months. The Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile consists of 48 items for children 7 to 36 months. The caregiver questionnaire contains items divided into sensory systems. For children 7 to 36 months, there are five sensory processing section scores, four quadrant scores, and one combined quadrant score available. For children 12 months corrected age, the four quadrant score ranges are as follows:
Low Registration: 11-55 (&quot;typical&quot; is 46-54) Sensation Seeking: 14-70 (&quot;typical&quot; is 19-35) Sensory Sensitivity: 11-55 (&quot;typical&quot; is 41-52) Sensation Avoiding: 12-60 (&quot;typical&quot; is 45-56)</description>

Composite scores for motor and language domains are derived from sums of the subtest scaled scores. Composite scores range from 40-160.</description>

    <description>The Multisensory intervention will be carried out in addition to standard care and will include 2 components: (1) holding and light pressure containment of the infant against the hospital-gown covered chest of the therapist for tactile and non-specific auditory stimulation simultaneous with (2) playing of mother's voice contingent on infant pacifier sucking for the first 20 minutes of holding. Additionally, a gauze square scented with parent's skin will be used to provide olfactory stimulation.</description>
