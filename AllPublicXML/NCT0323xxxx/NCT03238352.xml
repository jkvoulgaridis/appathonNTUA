    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of an experimental oral rinse, containing 1.5% potassium oxalate
      (KOX) and 0 parts per million (ppm) fluoride in relieving dentine hypersensitivity (DH) after
      8 weeks use compared with a placebo oral rinse and a commercialized fluoride oral rinse.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, eight week, randomized, examiner-blind, three treatment,
      parallel group, stratified study. It will be conducted in healthy participants, with at least
      two sensitive teeth that meet all of the study criteria at the Screening and Baseline visits.
      DH will be assessed at Baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks twice daily treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows - 0: Participant did not respond to air stimulation; 1: Participant responded to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responded to air stimulus and requested discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responded to stimulus, considered stimulus to be painful, and requested discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score will be indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10 grams (g) and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows - 0: Participant did not respond to air stimulation; 1: Participant responded to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responded to air stimulus and requested discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responded to stimulus, considered stimulus to be painful, and requested discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score will be indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10 grams (g) and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold</title>
          <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10 grams (g) and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>
          <population>The ITT (N=85) population included all participants who were randomized received at least one dose of investigational product and had at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation. This population was based on the treatment to which the participant was randomized.</population>
