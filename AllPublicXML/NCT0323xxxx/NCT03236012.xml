  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to establish and evidence base for hyperhidrosis treatment algorithm in
      amputees.This project will address a problem that has troubled Service members, Veterans, and
      civilians with amputations for decades, impacting satisfaction with prosthetic use, residual
      limb skin health, and negatively affecting quality of life. Prior research in this area has
      been limited and insufficient. We plan to conduct an open label study of Botox, up to 400
      units, to treat limb hyperhidrosis in patients with amputations. The actual dose of Botox
      used will be based on individual results with the Iodine-Starch test to identify areas on the
      residual limb that are producing excessive sweat. Botulinum Toxin A (BTX-A): Botulinum toxin
      therapy is well-established for use in excessive sweating of several body areas (axillary,
      palmar, plantar, and facial) in individuals with hyperhidrosis and inadequate response to
      topical treatments. Extensive research has been conducted on the efficacy and safety of BTX-A
      for hyperhidrosis of other areas, and it has been shown to improve both objective and
      subjective measures of sweating, and lead to improved quality of life measures.

      This will be accomplished by completing the following:

      Test the validity of the Minor iodine-starch test in amputees.

        1. Hypothesis: The iodine-starch test is a valid diagnostic tool of hyperhidrosis and can
           be useful for the identification of focal areas of sweating on a residual limb.

        2. Treat the residual limb Hyperhidrosis with Botox, up to and limited to 400 units.

      Hypothesis: Treatment of residual limb Hyperhidrosis with Botox will result in improved
      patient reports of excessive sweating as measured by the HDSS and as measured by subjects'
      response to iodine-starch testing. We are confident that improving the evaluation and
      treatment of residual limb hyperhidrosis will reduce the secondary health consequences of
      amputation and will lead to improved quality of life.

      Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be given Botox injections. The maximum dose that
      will be used will vary from patient to patient up to 400 units.

      We will test the effectiveness of botulinum toxin therapy in those who fail Aluminum
      Chloride. Failure will be defined as a non-response (no change in HDSS), inadequate response
      (post-treatment HDSS of 2 or more), or intolerance to Aluminum Chloride. This would be a
      natural progression of interventions consistent with guidelines for other forms of
      hyperhidrosis. Specifically, we will study botulinum toxin type A BTX-A, brand name Botox.
      While there are other BTX-A products on the market, Botox is the only FDA approved toxin for
      the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis.

      There are a few considerations to make when dosing Botox for hyperhidrosis. These include the
      total dose, the dose per injection site, and the distribution of injection sites. Typical
      doses for axillary hyperhidrosis are 50- 100 units per axilla18. However, for clinical trials
      used to support the FDA-approved labeling in focal spasticity, doses up to 400 units were
      used. There are reports of off label dosing exceeding this amount, including the case series
      reported by Charrow for residual limb hyperhidrosis, which used doses ranging from 300 - 500
      units of Botox. There was no mention of adverse events in this series. It has been suggested
      that doses greater than 600 units pose a greater risk of serious adverse events including
      systemic weakness. Regarding dose per injection site, hyperhidrosis guidelines suggest 1 unit
      per site for the axilla, and 1.5 - 2 units per site for the palm or sole18. The largest case
      series in amputees used doses of 2-3 units per site. Regarding the distribution of injection
      sites, guidelines recommend injections every 1 - 2 cm in a grid-like fashion.

      We plan to conduct an open label study of Botox, up to 400 units, in amputees who have failed
      treatment with a topical antiperspirant.

    <intervention_model_description>For this study, subjects will be recruited from the amputee clinics held at the Salt Lake Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Center or the University of Utah. Combined, these clinics serve approximately 500 patients and see approximately 75 new patients each year.
We plan to recruit a total of 25 subjects to this project from the two study sites. It is expected that we will enroll equal numbers from both the University of Utah and VA Medical Center.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure for this study will be measuring the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS). The HDSS is scored on a number scale of 1-4. Score range from 1 (lowest) demonstrating sweating (hyperhidrosis) is least noticeable and does not interfere with daily activities (least impactful) to 4 (highest) sweating is intolerable and interferes significantly with daily activities. This measurement will be completed at Baseline, Week #4 clinic visit, Week #12 clinic visit, Week#16 clinic visit and week#20 follow up phone call visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure for this study will be measuring the Sweating Intensity Visual Scale (SIVS). The SIVS is assessed on a number scale of 0-5. A score of zero (lowest) indicates no effect from sweating (hyperhidrosis) relating to the fit and functioning of the prosthesis (least impactful) to 5 (highest) which means severely affecting the fit and functioning of the prosthesis. This measurement will be completed at Baseline, Week# 4 clinic visit, Week #12 clinic visit, Week#16 clinic visit and week#20 follow up phone call visit.</description>
