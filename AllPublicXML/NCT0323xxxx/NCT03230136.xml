  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial investigates whether a multimodal cardioprotection per-surgery therapeutic
      strategy could reduce myocardial injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to
      traditional management. The primary endpoint is the AUC (area under the curve) of the
      hypersensitive troponin I. Blood samples will be collected during the 72 hours following the
      aortic cross-unclamping. This trial is a French, multicenter, randomized, single-blinded and
      controlled trial. 210 patients will be enrolled with a clinical follow-up during 30 days.

    <description>Index Gravity Score provides an estimate of the risk of death: the higher the score is, the higher the risk to die is. The maximum score is 163. The Index Gravity Score includes 17 variables: 12 physiology variables, age, type of admission (scheduled surgical, unscheduled surgical, or medical), and three underlying disease variables (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, metastatic cancer, and hematologic malignancy).</description>

    <measure>3-level version of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) health status score (quality of life score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The 3-level version of EQ-5D consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).It comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.</description>
