  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further understand the effects of altitude on the physiology
      of gas exchange in the pulmonary microcirculation in normal subjects and in people with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) measured as the single-breath diffusing capacity
      for carbon monoxide (DLCOsb). The study will determine a mathematical formula to allow for
      altitude corrections in both study populations to be used clinically in pulmonary labs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DLCOsb is one of the most common and widely tests clinically used across the world in
      pulmonary function laboratories to assess gas exchange from the lung to hemoglobin in the
      pulmonary circulation. This test is used in the differential diagnosis of respiratory related
      symptoms, to grade the degree of severity in lung disease, and to objectively monitor the
      progression of disease or the response to therapies. Therefore, it is important to have
      standard methods of performing and interpreting this test.This is a prospective study,
      collecting data from subjects at different simulated altitudes. The study hypothesis is that
      increasing altitude will increase the DLCOsb in a predictable manner that will allow for
      mathematical corrections to be applied for uniform interpretation in pulmonary labs at
      differing altitudes.
