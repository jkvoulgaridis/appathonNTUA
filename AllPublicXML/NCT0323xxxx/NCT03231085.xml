  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral iron is commonly used in conjunction with EPO preoperatively for hemorrhagic surgeries
      in children and especially in the surgery of craniosynostosis. The bioavailability of oral
      iron is low and compliance with treatment is inconsistent. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate whether the use of ferric carboxymaltose by injection, which has a much better
      bioavailability, would make it possible to increase the preoperative hemoglobin level more
      effectively and thus reduce the risk of perioperative blood transfusion .

      Prospective study, randomized in two parallel groups (martial treatment versus venous
      injection) and stratified by center (Montpellier, Nice, Angers).

      The number of subjects required is 100 patients, or 50 per group.
