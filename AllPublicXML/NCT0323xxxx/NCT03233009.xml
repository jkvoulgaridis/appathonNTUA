          <description>All participants enrolled in the study received all the study products. Test and control products were applied to a paper disc (or cell) contained within an adhesive patch in a randomized manner. The number of cells available on the patch test tape is 6 (but only 5 cells were used, 4 test and 1 reference products). The patch was then applied onto the dorsum (scapula region) of each participant for a period of 24 ± 2 hours, the sequence of the product application to the cells was as per the randomization schedule.</description>

          <title>Overall Participants</title>
          <description>All participants randomized to the study. Test and control products were applied to a paper disc (or cell) contained within an adhesive patch. The number of cells available on the patch test tape is 6 (but only 5 cells were used, 4 test and 1 reference products). The patch was then applied onto the dorsum (scapula region) of each participant for a period of 24 ± 2 hours, the sequence of the product application to the cells was as per the randomization schedule.</description>

Response score from 0 to 7; 0= No evidence of irritation, 1= Minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= Definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= Erythema and papules, 4= Definite edema, 5= Erythema, edema and papules, 6= Vesicular eruption, 7= Strong reaction spreading beyond test site.</description>

The number of cells available on the patch test tape is 6 (but only 5 cells were used, 4 test and 1 reference products). The patch was then applied onto the dorsum (scapula region) of each participant for a period of 24 ± 2 hours, the sequence of the product application to the cells was as per the randomization schedule</description>
