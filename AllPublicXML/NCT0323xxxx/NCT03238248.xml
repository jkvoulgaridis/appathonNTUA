    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the treatment combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine in the
      setting of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor(s) failure in patients with relapsed/refractory
      myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare survival of patients treated with a combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine
      after failure of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) to historical survival for patients
      with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myelodysplastic/
      myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (MDS/MPN) who are ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the rate of hematologic improvement (HI) in patients with
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi
           failure

        -  To determine the complete remission (CR) and marrow CR rates in patients with
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi
           failure

        -  To determine the reduction of bone marrow blasts in patients with relapsed/refractory
           MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi failure

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To correlate the mutation burden in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN
           with response to treatment with pevonedistat and azacitidine

        -  To correlate genomic aberrations with rate of response and survival in
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN patients treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine

        -  To measure the effect of pevonedistat treatment in combination with azacitidine on
           quality of life in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN

        -  To define epigenetic biomarkers for pevonedistat use in relapsed/refractory MDS or
           MDS/MPN

        Inclusion:

          -  Signed and dated voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study
             related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future
             medical care.

          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Morphologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS or MDS/MPN in accordance with WHO
             diagnostic criteria.

          -  Expected survival ≥ 3 months after consenting.

          -  Refractory/relapsed disease following DNMTi failure. Refractory disease defined as
             either:

               -  failure to achieve an objective response after at least 4 cycles of DNMTi
                  therapy, or

               -  failure to achieve an objective response with clear progressive disease on bone
                  marrow biopsy after at least 2 cycles of DNMTi therapy. Relapsed disease is
                  defined as having progressive disease after achieving an objective response after
                  at least 2 cycles of DNMTi therapy.

        Previous DNMTi therapy may include 5'azacitidine, decitabine, or DNMTi therapy currently in
        clinical trials (e.g. SGI-110 (guadecitabine), ASTX727 or CC-486).To be considered DNMTi
        treatment failure, during each prior treatment cycle, patients must have received
        equivalent to minimum dosing of:

        decitabine 15mg/m2 daily x 5 days, or

        5'azacitidine 50mg/m2 IV/SC daily x 5 days,

        SGI-110 (guadecitabine) 60mg/m2 SC daily x 5 days, or

        oral DNMTi therapy with ASTX727 20/100mg daily x 5 days, or

        oral DNMTi therapy with CC-486 200mg daily x 14 days

          -  Recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline of any toxicity due to prior systemic treatments,
             excluding alopecia.

          -  Patient consent to collection of fresh bone marrow biopsy and aspirate for exploratory
             research obtained from a procedure performed no more than 28 days prior to initiating
             treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1.

          -  Clinical laboratory values as specified below:

               -  Serum albumin &gt; 2.7 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  WBC ≤ 50,000/µL (use of hyroxyurea is permitted)

          -  Hgb &lt;8g/dL should be transfused to provide adequate tissue perfusion as per the
             discretion of the investigators and local practice. Rechecking Hgb level prior to
             start on Cycle 1 Day 1 is not necessary as long as patients do not have inadequate
             oxygenation, underlying cardiopulmonary compromise, and/or any other reason deemed
             clinically significant to delay therapy per the investigator.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test; and
             additionally agree to simultaneously use at least 2 methods of effective contraception
             or abstain from heterosexual intercourse from the time of signing consent, and until 4
             months after patient's last dose of protocol-indicated treatment. Periodic abstinence
             (e.g. calendar,ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner)
             and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        Women of child bearing potential are defined as those not surgically sterile or not
        post-menopausal. If a female patient has not had a bilateral tubal ligation, a bilateral
        oophorectomy, or a complete hysterectomy; or has not been amenorrheic for at least 1 year
        in the absence of an alternative medical cause, then patient will be considered a female of
        childbearing potential. Postmenopausal status in females under 55 years of age should be
        confirmed with a serum FSH level within laboratory reference range for postmenopausal
        women.

        - Men, even if surgically sterilized (i.e. status post-vasectomy), who are sexually active
        with women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for effective
        barrier contraception from the time of signing consent and until 4 months after last dose
        of protocol-indicated treatment. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,
        symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner) and withdrawal are not
        acceptable methods of contraception.
