  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study looks to determine effectiveness of neck strengthening to reduce the incident,
      duration, and severity of sports related concussion in student athletes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After recruitment, subjects will have neck strength measured as baseline in addition to doing
      SCAT5 for baseline and eye tracking, funding pending, in order to compare later assessment
      for concussion. Throughout study, subject will perform basic, unweighted and weighted neck
      strengthening exercises twice a week. Periodic re evaluations of neck strength will be
      performed in order to determine progress. Any time a subject incurs a sports related
      concussion, a SCAT5 assessment, and eye tracking funding pending, will be done and compared
      to baseline to measure severity of injury. Weekly follow ups will be done to assess duration
      of concussion. All measurements, assessments, and exercises are non-invasive and provide
      minimal risk to subjects.
