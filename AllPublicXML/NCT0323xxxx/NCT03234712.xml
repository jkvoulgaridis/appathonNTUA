  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and the recommended phase two dose (RPTD), and to assess the safety, preliminary
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-321 for participants with advanced solid
      tumors likely to overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The study will
      consist of 2 phases: Dose Escalation Phase and Expansion Phase.
