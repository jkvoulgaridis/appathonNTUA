      This phase I/II, randomized, modified double-blind, multi-center study was conducted in 175
      healthy Japanese adults aged 65 years and older to describe the safety profile and immune
      responses (geometric mean titers and seroconversion for the 4 common strains at 28 days
      post-vaccination) of the QIV-HD administered by intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC)
      methods. A local standard-dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV-SD) administered by SC
      method served as a control arm.

    <intervention_model_description>Safety and tolerability was initially assessed in the first 10 participants in a smaller cohort (Cohort 1). Participants were randomized 1:1 into 2 groups in Cohort 1: QIV-HD by IM route (n=5) and QIV-HD by SC route (n=5).
After review of the local and systemic adverse events, the remaining 165 participants were enrolled (Cohort 2). Participants were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups in Cohort 2: QIV-HD by IM route (n=55), QIV-HD by SC route (n=55), and QIV-SD by SC route (n=55).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>QHD00008 was a modified double-blind study in which only the designated administrator at each study site knew which vaccine was administered to the participants. The participants and the Investigator/Sub-investigator in charge of the safety assessment were blinded in order to decrease the potential bias in safety assessment.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Immediate Unsolicited Adverse Events (AE) After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 minutes after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE was an observed AE that did not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the case report book (CRB) in terms of symptom and/or onset post-vaccination. Unsolicited AEs includes both serious and non-serious unsolicited AEs. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event. All participants were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and any unsolicited AEs occurred during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited AEs in the CRB.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Injection Site and Systemic Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 7 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>A solicited reaction was an adverse reaction observed and reported under the conditions (symptom and onset) prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the CRB and considered as related to the administered vaccination. Solicited injection site reactions: pain, erythema, swelling, induration, and bruising. Solicited systemic reactions: fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, and shivering.</description>

    <description>Anti-influenza antibodies were measured by using the HAI assay for the strains A1, A1-like, A2, A2-like, B1, B2, and B2-like. Seroconversion was defined as either a HAI titer lesser than (&lt;) 10 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and post-vaccination titer greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 40 (1/dilution) at Day 28, or HAI titer &gt;=10 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and a &gt;=4-fold increase in HAI titer (1/dilution) at Day 28.</description>

    <description>Anti-influenza antibodies were measured by using the HAI assay for the strains A1, A1-like, A2, A2-like, B1, B2, and B2-like. Seroprotection was defined as a HAI titer &gt;=40 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and Day 28.</description>

Unsolicited AEs includes both serious and non-serious unsolicited AEs. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event. All participants were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and any unsolicited AEs occurred during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited AEs in the CRB.</description>

        <description>An unsolicited AE was an observed AE that does not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the CRB in terms of symptom and/or onset post-vaccination. Unsolicited AEs included both serious and non-serious unsolicited AEs. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event.</description>

Data for this outcome measure was planned to be collected and analyzed for combined population of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 participants who received QIV-HD (QIV-HD by IM and QIV-HD by SC).</population>

      <time_frame>Adverse event (AE) data was collected from Day 0 (post-vaccination) up to Day 28 after vaccination. Solicited Reaction (SR) data were collected up to Day 7 after vaccination.

      <desc>Analyzed on SafAS. SR: an AE prelisted in CRB and considered related to vaccination. SR was therefore an adverse reaction observed and reported under conditions (symptom and onset) prelisted in CRB. An unsolicited AE: an observed AE that did not fulfill conditions prelisted in CRB in terms of symptom and/or onset post-vaccination. AE data were planned to be collected and analyzed for the combined population of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 participants who received QIV-HD (QIV-HD by IM and QIV-HD by SC)</desc>
