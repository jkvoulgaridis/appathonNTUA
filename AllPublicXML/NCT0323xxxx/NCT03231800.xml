      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and safety
      study in children with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting. The study will be comprised of
      3 periods: Screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout prior to
      Day -1; Double-blind randomized treatment with either dasotraline (2 mg/day) or placebo for
      14 days; and a final safety evaluation 7 days after last dose. Prior to the start of
      treatment (Day 1) and following the conclusion of the double-blind period (Day 15), subjects
      will undergo a full-day laboratory classroom evaluation in cohorts of up to 18 subjects. Each
      laboratory classroom day will include seven 30-minute simulated classroom sessions where
      trained observers will assess subjects using the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham
      (SKAMP) Scale. In addition during each classroom session, a 10-minute math test (Permanent
      Product Measure of Performance [PERMP]) will be administered to evaluate sustained attention
      and effort. Seven (± 2) days after the last dose of study drug, subjects will return to the
      clinic and complete safety assessments.

      This study is designed to test the superiority of dasotraline 2 mg/day against placebo based
      on Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham Scale (SKAMP)-Combined score in pediatric
      subjects aged 6-12 years with ADHD who weigh ≤ 30 kg

             evaluation that reviews DSM-5 criteria and confirmed using the Schedule for Affective
             Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version
             (K-SADS-PL) at screening.

          5. Subject is currently either untreated for ADHD or receiving a treatment regimen of a
             stimulant medication prescribed as monotherapy (i.e., methylphenidate, mixed

             urinalysis results are not within the laboratory's reference range, then the subject
             can be included only if the investigator determines the deviations to be not
             clinically relevant.

         13. Subject is within the 3rd to 97th percentile for gender specific weight-for-age from
             the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or parent/legal guardian has commitments during the study that would interfere
             with attending study visits.

          2. Subject is currently being treated for ADHD with a non-stimulant product, or has been
             treated with a non-stimulant product in the 4 weeks prior to the start of screening.

          3. Subject has failed 2 adequate courses (dose and duration) of stimulant or
             non-stimulant treatment for ADHD.

          4. Subject is considered treatment refractory, as judged by the investigator.

          5. Subject currently has a diagnosis of asthma that has required daily treatment with
             bronchodilators or nebulizer treatments in the 30 days prior to screening and/or who
             may require daily treatments with these agents over the course of the trial.
             Intermittent use of bronchodilators is not exclusionary. Subjects who have a history
             of requiring persistent asthma treatment should be discussed with the medical monitor
             prior to randomization.

             a condition (eg, malabsorption, gastrointestinal surgery) that may interfere with drug
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. Note: Active medical conditions
             that are minor or well-controlled are not exclusionary if they do not affect risk to
             the subject or the study results. In cases in which the impact of the condition upon
             risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the medical monitor should be

             controlled) must be discussed with the medical monitor during screening.

          7. Subject has a history or presence of abnormal ECGs, which in the investigator's
             opinion is clinically significant. Screening site ECGs will be centrally over-read,

             gravis, or other neurologic or serious neuromuscular disorders)

         12. Subjects with a history of persistent neurological symptoms attributable to serious
             head injury.

         13. History of febrile seizure, drug-induced seizure, or alcohol withdrawal seizure is

         16. Subject answers &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;Suicidal Ideation&quot; item 4 (active suicidal ideation with

             specific plan and intent) for any lifetime history on the C-SSRS Children's
             Lifetime/Recent assessment at screening.

         17. Subject has any history of attempted suicide or clinically significant suicidal
             ideation, in the opinion of the investigator.

             multiple adverse drug reactions or has a history of allergic reaction or has a known

         24. Subject is currently undergoing ongoing or newly initiated Cognitive Behavioral
             Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of ADHD; behavioral therapies, including school based
             interventions that were initiated less than one month prior to screening; or,
             behavioral therapy that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the
             subject's ability to participate for the duration of the study. School based
             interventions that have been in place for more than one month prior to screening will
             be allowed. Note: Unavoidable changes in school-based interventions that occur during
             study participation will not be exclusionary, but should be documented by the
             investigator, to the extent possible. Subjects should not be enrolled who, in the
             judgment of the investigator, are expected to start substantially different or more
             intensive course of behavioral therapy over the duration of their participation in the
             study.

         25. Subject or subject's family anticipates a move outside the geographic range of

             participating in another clinical trial.

         30. Subject shows evidence of substance or alcohol use or is currently using tobacco or
             other nicotine-containing products, or has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) at
             screening. Note: Subjects with a positive UDS may be allowed to continue in the study,
             provided that the investigator determines that the positive test is as a result of
             taking medications as prescribed after consultation with the medical monitor.

        <description>The Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, Pelham Rating Scale (SKAMP) scale is a 13-item independent observer rating of subject impairment of classroom observed behaviors. Each item is rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0 = normal to 6 = maximal impairment). The combined scores for the SKAMP are obtained by summing the values of all 13 items in the assessment. The range of SKAMP combined score is 0-78, with higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) is a math test consisting of 400 problems. Both attempted problems and correct problems are assessed. Subjects are to complete as many problems as possible in 10 minutes. Performance is measured by the number of math problems attempted and the number of math problems correctly completed. The minimum possible score is 0. The highest possible score is 400, with higher scores mean higher performance and less severe ADHD symptoms.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline at Day 15 in Mean Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP)-Attempted Problems Scores Obtained From the 7 Assessments Collected Over the 12-hour Classroom Day (12-24-hours Postdose)</title>
          <description>The Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) is a math test consisting of 400 problems. Both attempted problems and correct problems are assessed. Subjects are to complete as many problems as possible in 10 minutes. Performance is measured by the number of math problems attempted and the number of math problems correctly completed. The minimum possible score is 0. The highest possible score is 400, with higher scores mean higher performance and less severe ADHD symptoms.</description>
