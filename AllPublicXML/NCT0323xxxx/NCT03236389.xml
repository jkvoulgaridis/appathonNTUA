  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials have suggested that this device is effective in mitigating changes in brain
      structure and function in athlete populations. The purpose of the current study is to better
      understand the underlying mechanistic response of the brain hemodynamics to mild jugular vein
      compression

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant morbidity, mortality, and related costs are caused by traumatic brain injury
      (TBI). A simple, effective, and lightweight device worn by athletes or war fighters in the
      field, designed to mitigate TBI resulting from blast trauma or concussive events, would save
      lives, and the huge costs currently being experienced for life-treatment of surviving
      victims. An externally-worn medical device (the Device) that applies mild jugular vein
      compression according to the principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver, is being developed by
      Q30 Sports Science, LLC (Q30). Preliminary research suggests that the Device has the
      potential to reduce the likelihood of TBI. The currently developed collar (Smith 2009, Smith
      and Fisher 2011, Smith and Fisher 2011, Smith 2012) has been approved for studies in humans
      (IRB 2013-2240) and the results indicate safety for use during high demand and maximal
      exertion activities. Regarding safety, the externally worn collar is meticulously designed to
      mimic the body's own omohyoid muscle actions upon the jugular veins that will provide similar
      pressure and volume increases not to surpass that of a yawn or the mere act of just lying
      down. Initial safety testing and early clinical trials indicate that the collar application
      is both safe and efficacious to prevent brain microstructure and neurophysiological changes
      in response to head impacts.
