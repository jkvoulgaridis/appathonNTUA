    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 dose escalation study to determine if SNDX-6352 as monotherapy and SNDX-6352 in
      combination with a fixed dose of durvalumab will be sufficiently safe and well-tolerated at
      biologically active doses to warrant further investigation in patients with solid tumors.

      This is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 study consisting of Phase 1a and Phase 1b. The
      study will evaluate SNDX-6352 monotherapy (in Phase 1a) and SNDX-6352 combined with
      durvalumab (in Phase 1b) in patients with advanced solid tumors which must have progressed
      following prior treatment and have no standard therapy alternatives left (i.e.. patients must
      not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit). The primary objective will
      be to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of SNDX-6352 as monotherapy (Phase 1a) and in combination
      with durvalumab (Phase 1b) as evaluated by the incidence of AEs that are defined as DLTs. In
      both study phases, a standard &quot;3+3&quot;dose escalation schema will be used to determine an MTD
      with 3-6 evaluable patients enrolled per dose level. The RP2D will be determined based on
      data from the dose escalation patients as reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC;
      comprised of investigators and the Sponsor).

    <intervention_model_description>Initially in both phases, 3 patients will receive SNDX-6352 at 1 mg/kg IV on C1D1 and again on C1D15 of a 28-day cycle. Phase 1b only will also receive a fixed dose of 1500mg durvalumab IV on C1D1. If no DLTs are noted, 3 more patients will be treated at the next higher dose level (3 mg/kg). If 1 DLT is observed in 1 of 3 patients, 3 more patients will be treated at that starting dose level (1 mg/kg). If 2 or more DLTs are observed in 3-6 patients at the starting dose, the study will be terminated or a lower dose will be considered. If the safety profile is acceptable, escalation to SNDX-6352 doses of 3, 6 and 10mg/kg are planned for the 1a and for the 1b, doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg of SNDX-6352 in combination with a fixed dose of 1500mg of durvalumab are planned. The MTD will be considered to have been exceeded if 2 or more patients in a dose group experience a DLT; in this case, the next lower dose group which has been evaluated will be considered as the MTD.</intervention_model_description>

             and/or complications from the intervention.

             Note: Patients with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or ≤ Grade 2 alopecia are an exception to
             this criterion and may qualify for the study.

          7. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for
             female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have

             age-specific requirements apply:

               -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

          8. Female patients of childbearing potential who are not abstinent and intend to be
             sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use at least 1 highly effective
             method of contraception (Table 11) from the time of screening throughout the total
             duration of the study drug treatment and 90 days after the last dose of study drug.
             Non-sterilized male partners of a female patient of childbearing potential must use
             male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after
             this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the
             rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control.
             Female patients should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.

          9. Non-sterilized male patients who are not abstinent and intend to be sexually active
             with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide
             from the time of screening throughout the total duration of the study drug treatment
             and 90 days after the last dose of study drug. However, periodic abstinence, the
             rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.
             Male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period.

         10. Must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Phase 1b 11. Body weight &gt; 30 kg 12. No prior exposure to
