  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Absorption, metabolism and excretion of daprodustat (GSK1278863) have been studied in
      previous clinical trials; however, the elimination routes and metabolic pathways of
      daprodustat have not been fully elucidated in humans. This is an open-label, single-center,
      non-randomized, 2-period, single-sequence, crossover, mass balance study in 6 healthy male
      participants. The aim of the study is to assess the excretion balance of daprodustat using
      [14C]-radiolabeled drug substance administered orally, and as an intravenous (IV) infusion,
      administered as a microtracer dose (concomitant with an oral, non-radiolabeled dose).
      Absolute bioavailability of an oral dose will also be assessed. Each participant will be
      involved in the study for up to 10 weeks which include a screening visit, two treatment
      periods (treatment periods 1 and 2), separated by about 7 days (at least 14 days between oral
      doses), and a follow up visit 1-2 weeks after the last assessment in treatment period 2. The
      primary objective of the study is to gain a better understanding of the compound's excretory
      and metabolic profile. This study will include sampling of duodenal bile to conduct
      qualitative assessment of drug metabolites in this matrix in order to characterize biliary
      elimination pathways.

    <description>Blood samples were planned to be collected from participants at indicated time points in each of the treatment period 1 and 2, after administration of study treatment to investigate the pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 in blood. Data were not collected for blood total radioactivity concentration following administration of radiolabeled IV dose of GSK1278863 because of an error (deviation). The deviation is due to a processing error: labels for whole blood draws, and aliquots for shipment were not generated in error. Data were not analyzed for radiolabeled oral dose of GSK1278863 as there were not enough data points captured for a terminal slope required to calculate AUC (0-inf). The blood assay could not detect radiation levels at the time points blood was drawn to go into these calculations.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were planned to be collected from participants at indicated time points in each of the treatment period 1 and 2, after administration of study treatment to investigate the pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 in blood. Data were not collected for blood total radioactivity concentration following administration of radiolabeled IV dose of GSK1278863 because of an error (deviation). The deviation is due to a processing error: labels for whole blood draws, and aliquots for shipment were not generated in error. Data were not analyzed for radiolabeled oral dose of GSK1278863 as there were not enough data points captured for a terminal slope required to calculate AUC (0-inf). The blood assay could not detect radiation levels at the time points blood was drawn to go into these calculations.</description>

        <title>Percent Radioactivity Recovered for Each Metabolite in Plasma Following a Single Oral Dose of [14C]-GSK1278863 at 25 mg</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected in treatment period 2 to measure total radioactivity and to characterize the metabolite profiling of GSK1278863 following a single oral dose of [14C]-GSK1278863 at 25 mg. Potential metabolites were M3 (GSK2506104), M2 (GSK2391220) and M33 combined, M4 (GSK2487818), M6 (GSK2531398), M13 (GSK2531401), M5 (GSK2506102) and M14 combined. 2 pooled plasma samples were prepared. Aliquots of plasma samples collected between 0 to 8 hours post-dose from each participant were pooled in proportion to the time intervals. An equal amount of the individual pools from each participant was then pooled to create 1 plasma sample that was representative of the mean area under curve over the range of 0-8 hour. The second pool (10-12 hours pool) was obtained by mixing equal volume of the plasma samples at 10 and 12 hour across all participants. Percent radioactivity recovered for each metabolite in plasma following a single oral dose of [14C]-GSK1278863 at 25 mg is presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants at indicated time points for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters including Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Bilirubin, Calcium, Creatinine, Direct Bilirubin, Glucose, Potassium, Protein, Sodium and Urea. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose lab value category was unchanged (example given [e.g.], High to High), or whose value became normal, are recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100%. High and low indicated that the participants had values flagged as high and low respectively for the particular parameter any time on-treatment.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Clinical Chemistry Results Relative to Normal Range</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected from participants at indicated time points for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters including Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Bilirubin, Calcium, Creatinine, Direct Bilirubin, Glucose, Potassium, Protein, Sodium and Urea. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose lab value category was unchanged (example given [e.g.], High to High), or whose value became normal, are recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100%. High and low indicated that the participants had values flagged as high and low respectively for the particular parameter any time on-treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Hematology Results Relative to Normal Range</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants at indicated time points for the analysis of hematology parameters including Basophils, Eosinophils, Erythrocyte Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), Erythrocyte Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Erythrocytes, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Platelets, Reticulocytes, and Reticulocytes/Erythrocytes. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose lab value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became normal, are recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100%. High and low indicated that the participants had values flagged as high and low respectively for the particular parameter any time on-treatment.</description>
