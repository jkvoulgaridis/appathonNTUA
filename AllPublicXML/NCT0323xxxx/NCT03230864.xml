  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of 10 mg/day Lu AF35700 on symptoms of schizophrenia in
      patients with early-in-disease (ED) or late-in-disease (LD) treatment-resistant schizophrenia
      (TRS)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the study, patients will receive risperidone (4-6 mg/day), or, if recently failed on
      risperidone, olanzapine (15-20mg/day). Later during the study, patients will be randomized to
      either receive Lu AF35700 (10 mg/day), or continue their treatment from the prospective
      confirmation (PC) period.

      The study consists of a Screening Period (up to 3 weeks), a single-blind PC Period (6 weeks),
      a Double-blind Treatment (DBT) Period (8 weeks), and a Safety Follow-up Period (6 weeks).

      Patients who did not fulfil the randomization criteria for the DBT Period, were withdrawn
      from the study after the PC period.

      Patients who fulfilled the randomization criteria for the DBT Period, continued into the DBT
      period and were randomized into one of the 2 treatmetn arms (1:1) with either Lu AF35700 10
      mg or to continue the treatment allocated in the PC period (olanzapine or risperidone) at the
      dose set at the last visit of the PC period. This means that approximately half of the
      confirmed treatment-resistant patients were randomised back to the failed treatment in the PC
      period.

      Data was not collected seperately for the DBT olanzapine and DBT risperidone participants,
      and there was no intent to compare Lu AF35700 to each drug seperately.

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS total score administered by the investigator. It included a total of 30 items that evaluated the Positive Symptoms subscale, the Negative Symptoms subscale, the General Psychopathology subscale. Each item is rated from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptom extremely severe). PANSS total score was calculated as sum of all the items on the scale and ranged from 30 to 210. A negative score indicates an improvement compared to Randomization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Global Clinical Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). Higher scores indicate worsening</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in 16-item Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA-16 Total) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The NSA-16 is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess the presence, severity, and range of negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The NSA-16 consists of 16 items arranged in 5 subdomains: communication dysfunction (items 1 to 4), emotional/affective dysfunction (items 5 to 7), dysfunction in sociality (items 8 to 10), motivational/hedonic dysfunction (items 11 to 14), and reduced psychomotor activity (items 15 and 16), and a Global Negative Symptom Rating. NSA-16 items are rated on a 6-point scale from 1 (behaviour is normal) to 6 (behaviour severely reduced), and a score of 9 if the item is not-rateable. The Global Negative Symptom Rating is rated from 1 (no evidence of symptoms) to 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The 16 items are summed to yield a total score ranging from 16 to 96 and the global rating ranges from 1 to 7.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in PANSS Marder Negative Factor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS Negative Factor score is a subset of the PANSS assessing negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The factor consist of the seven items: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity, motor retardation, and active social avoidance which are each rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS Negative Factor score (7 items) range from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

          -  The patient has been treated with, AND is resistant to, clozapine according to the

        <description>The NSA-16 is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess the presence, severity, and range of negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The NSA-16 consists of 16 items arranged in 5 subdomains: communication dysfunction (items 1 to 4), emotional/affective dysfunction (items 5 to 7), dysfunction in sociality (items 8 to 10), motivational/hedonic dysfunction (items 11 to 14), and reduced psychomotor activity (items 15 and 16), and a Global Negative Symptom Rating. NSA-16 items are rated on a 6-point scale from 1 (behaviour is normal) to 6 (behaviour severely reduced), and a score of 9 if the item is not-rateable. The Global Negative Symptom Rating is rated from 1 (no evidence of symptoms) to 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The 16 items are summed to yield a total score ranging from 16 to 96 and the global rating ranges from 1 to 7.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in PANSS Marder Negative Factor Score</title>
        <description>The PANSS Negative Factor score is a subset of the PANSS assessing negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The factor consist of the seven items: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity, motor retardation, and active social avoidance which are each rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS Negative Factor score (7 items) range from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>
