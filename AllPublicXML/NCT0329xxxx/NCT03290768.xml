    <textblock>
      This study allows Type 2 diabetics to receive feedback from a continuous glucose monitor
      (CGM) as part of an educational program designed to help them better manage their glucose
      levels. Subjects will also wear an activity tracker to monitor their activity and observe its
      effect on their glucose levels. The educational program will involve calls from coaches to
      check subjects' progress and answer questions.

            <description>Subjects receive a CGM and activity tracker as part of a educational program to help manage their glucose levels.
Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM): Subjects will use a CGM to develop an understanding of how their behaviors influence their glucose levels.
Activity Tracker: Subjects will use the activity tracker, in combination with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), to develop an understanding of how their activity levels affect their glucose levels.
Coaching: Coaches will help subjects understand the readings from the CGMs and how they are affected by diet choices, use of diabetes medications, etc. Coaches and subjects will have weekly conversations about CGM data and behaviors that affect CGM readings. Coaching will occur via telephone, text messaging, and automated text messaging.</description>
