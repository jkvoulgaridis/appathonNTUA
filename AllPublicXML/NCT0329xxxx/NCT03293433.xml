  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main challenges of thoracic oncology lies in earlier diagnosis of lung cancer to
      improve survival rate, wich is about 15% at 5 years. This poor prognosis is often linked to
      late diagnosis. Efforts are being made worldwide to offer testing in patients at risk or
      earlier diagnosis of lung cancer in order to offer the patient curative treatments. Indeed,
      supported at the stage of nodule (less than 3 cm lesion), lung cancer is curable by surgery
      in 80% of patients. Nevertheless, there are many differential diagnoses and access to these
      lesions is often difficult and risky. In this context, the management of pulmonary nodules,
      which can be either benign lesions or beginners cancers, is a real challenge for
      pulmonologists and thoracic oncologists every day: it is important not to disregard a
      potentially operable nodule and avoiding offer patients invasive procedures for benign
      nodules. Indeed, many procedures (endoscopy, puncture under scanner, thoracotomy) are made to
      determine if suspicious nodules are benign or not. In the large National Lung Screening
      Trial, 28% of the procedures were associated with complications (including 11% classified
      severe and 16 deaths). It is therefore essential to develop non-invasive tools to refine
      treatment decisions.
