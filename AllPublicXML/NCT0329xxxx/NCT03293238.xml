  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the accuracy and patient-oriented outcomes between various techniques
      for intra-articular knee injections. Historically, a joint line (intercondylar) technique of
      injection at the medial or lateral joint line, reliant solely upon clinical palpation, has
      been the most popular approach among primary care and orthopedic providers. Newer approaches,
      making use of ultrasound visualization to accomplish access to the intercondylar recess and
      the anterolateral suprapatellar pouch, have gained in popularity. Because of uncertain
      accuracy with the traditional approach, this study is designed to determine if sonographic
      visualization combined with either of these two newer techniques improves accuracy and
      affects patient-oriented outcomes.

    <masking_description>Patients will be blindfolded for the duration of their procedure. Investigator will always place ultrasound probe on patient's knee regardless of group assignment to eliminate bias. To further enhance blinding, the ultrasound screen will placed on freeze for the patients randomized into the groups without ultrasound guidance.

          <title>Joint Line Ultrasound</title>
          <description>Patients assigned to this group received a standard medial or lateral joint line injection of Euflexxa aided by ultrasound guidance while sitting up.
Joint line ultrasound: Patients were sitting with knee bent at 90 degrees. Clinician palpated the extremity to determine if a medial or lateral approach would be made for the injection of Euflexxa into the joint space. The procedure was aided by real time visualization utilizing ultrasound guidance.</description>

          <title>Joint Line Landmark</title>
          <description>Patients assigned to this group received a standard medial or lateral joint line injection of Euflexxa without ultrasound guidance while sitting up.
Joint line landmark: Patients were sitting with knee bent at 90 degrees. Clinician palpated the extremity to determine if a medial or lateral approach would be made for the injection of Euflexxa into the joint space. The procedure was not be aided by ultrasound guidance, but completed based strictly on tactile feedback from the injecting physician.</description>

          <title>Suprapatellar Ultrasound Guided</title>
          <description>Patients assigned to this group received an injection of Euflexxa while lying down into the suprapatellar pouch aided by ultrasound guidance.
Suprapatellar ultrasound guided: Patients were lying supine on exam table. Ultrasound was used to capture a longitudinal view of the proximal patella and the plane between the prefemoral fat pad and suprapatellar fat pad. After the desired visualization is achieved, injection of Euflexxa was made within the suprapatellar pouch.</description>

          <title>Suprapatellar Landmark</title>
          <description>Patients assigned to this group received an injection of Euflexxa while lying down into the supratpatellar pouch without ultrasound guidance.
Suprapatellar Landmark: Patients were lying supine on exam table. Injecting physician inserted a needle lateral to the vastus lateralis toward the suprapatellar pouch, and injected of Euflexxa once it is believed that the needle tip is in the pouch.</description>
