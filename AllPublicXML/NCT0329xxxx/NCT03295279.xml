  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Rafael E de la Hoz and colleagues have performed standardized and computer-assisted
      readings of all chest CT scans received by WTC workers and volunteers at the Mount Sinai
      Medical Center between 2003 and 2016. The clinical team sought to assess all findings
      suggestive of airway, interstitial, and neoplastic disease in a systematic way, and correlate
      those findings with clinical, functional, and exposure indicators. The study team's research
      will also involve analyses of longitudinal imaging and functional trends, and
      characterization of the WTC related lower airway diseases and their risk factors, with a
      focus on obesity-related imaging markers. The study team also plans to characterize the
      transitions into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among these workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to characterize WTC-related lower airway disorders, and use
      novel imaging approaches to the investigation of obesity, one of their most important risk
      factors for poor clinical outcome and chronicity. To that end, the clinical team will utilize
      the WTC Pulmonary Evaluation Unit Chest CT Imaging Archive, an already established large
      imaging database, linked to extensive related databases that include disease symptoms, both
      pre-WTC and WTC-related occupational exposures, detailed pulmonary function and longitudinal
      spirometry measurements, visual imaging classification and grading, and quantitative computer
      assisted method (QCAM) measurements of airway, pulmonary parenchymal, pleural, and
      cardiovascular abnormalities. During the course of the proposed research project, the
      clinical team will continue to enrich most sources of data with periodic updates, in order to
      accrue information on the trajectories of the different clinical, functional, and imaging
      abnormalities observed in this population, and investigate the role of key adverse risk
      factors directly, and in collaboration with other investigators. In a related project, the
      research team will focus on COPD, classifying its severity, investigating its diagnostic
      stability, progression, and transitions, characterize structural abnormalities as assessed by
      chest CT imaging, and examine the interaction of WTC-related exposure levels with tobacco
      smoking on increasing the risk of for the disease.

    <description>The clinical team selects spirometries of acceptable quality, and subjects with at least 3 spirometries spanning at least 5 years, to calculate FEV1 slope, which can then be modeled quantitatively. For categorical analyses, the clinical team defines rapid FEV1 decliners and contrast them to normal-and-stable FEV1 subjects, defined as those having an FEV1 above the lower limit of normal at baseline, no bronchodilator response, and FEV1 not changing by more than 25 ml/year on average in either direction.</description>
