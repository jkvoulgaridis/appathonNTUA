    <textblock>
      This Antiretroviral Therapy as Long Acting Suppression every 2 Months (ATLAS-2M) study is
      designed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity and safety of CAB LA + RPV LA
      administered every 8 weeks (Q8W) compared to CAB LA + RPV LA administered every 4 weeks (Q4W)
      over a 48-week treatment period in approximately 1020 adult HIV-1 infected subjects. Subjects
      will be divided in 2 groups; Group 1 will include subjects receiving current anti-retroviral
      (ART) standard of care (SOC) therapy whereas group 2 will include subjects currently
      receiving CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W in ATLAS study. Subjects in both groups will be randomized to
      receive CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W or Q8W. The study will be carried out in 3 phases including
      screening phase, maintenance phase and extension phase. Subjects choosing not to enter the
      Extension phase can complete their study participation at the Week 100 visit and enter into
      the 52-week Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Phase as required.

Higher scores represent greater treatment satisfaction as compared to the past few weeks. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Participants without/with prior exposure to CAB+RPV (0 Weeks [without exposure] and &gt;=1 Weeks [with exposure]) has been presented. Baseline value is defined as last available recorded value up to and including the Maintenance treatment start. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Week 8 in Dimension Scores Using Perception of Injection (PIN) Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 and Weeks 24 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The PIN questionnaire explores bother of pain at injection site and injection site reactions (ISR), anxiety before and after injection, willingness to receive an HIV injectable treatment the following visit and satisfaction with mode of treatment administration of individuals receiving injection and perceptions of individuals associated with receiving injections. This measure contains 21 items that measure pain at injection site, local site reactions, impact on functioning and willingness to pursue injectable treatment outside of a clinical trial. Scores range from 1 to 5, and questions are phrased in such a way as to ensure that 1 always equated with the most favourable perception of vaccination, and 5 most unfavourable. Dimension scores include bother from ISR, leg movement, sleep and acceptability. Score of a domain is calculated as mean of all items within the domain. Higher scores represent worse perception of injection. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis.</description>

          -  Any pre-existing physical or mental condition (including substance use disorder)
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to
             comply with the dosing schedule and/or protocol evaluations or which may compromise
             the safety of the subject.

          -  Subjects determined by the Investigator to have a high risk of seizures, including
             participants with an unstable or poorly controlled seizure disorder. A subject with a
             prior history of seizure may be considered for enrollment if the Investigator believes
             the risk of seizure recurrence is low. All cases of prior seizure history should be
             discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrollment.

          -  All subjects will be screened for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]). Subjects with
             untreated secondary (late latent) or tertiary syphilis infection, defined as a
             positive RPR and a positive treponemal test without clear documentation of treatment,
             are excluded. Subjects with a false positive RPR (with negative treponemal test) or
             serofast RPR result (persistence of a reactive nontreponemal syphilis test despite
             history of adequate therapy and no evidence of re-exposure) may enroll after
             consultation with the Medical Monitor. Participants with primary syphilis or early
             latent secondary syphilis (acquired within the preceding year) who have a positive RPR
             test and have not been treated may be treated during the screening period and if
             completion of antibiotic treatment occurs during the screening period, may be allowed
             entry after consultation with the Medical Monitor. If antibiotic treatment cannot be
             completed before the screening window ends, subjects may be rescreened once following
             completion of antibiotic therapy for primary or early latent secondary syphilis.

          -  Subjects who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a significant suicide risk.
             Subject's recent history of suicidal behavior and/or suicidal ideation should be
             considered when evaluating for suicide risk.

          -  The subject has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the gluteus
             region which may interfere with interpretation of injection site reactions.

          -  Evidence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection based on the results of testing at
             Screening for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core antibody
             (anti-HBc), Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and HBV deoxyribonucleic acid
             (DNA) as follows:

        Subjects positive for HBsAg are excluded; Subjects negative for anti-HBs but positive for
        anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for HBV DNA are excluded. Note: Participants
        positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for anti-HBs (past and/or
        current evidence) are immune to HBV and are not excluded.

          -  Asymptomatic individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will not be
             excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV
             infection is required; participants who are anticipated to require HCV treatment
             within 12 months must be excluded. (HCV treatment on study may be permitted post Week
             52, following consultation with the medical monitor).

          -  Subjects with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into this study if: liver enzymes
             meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, and is not
             advanced, and will not require treatment prior to the Week 52 visit. Additional

             evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior
             treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment; In the event that recent biopsy or
             imaging data is not available or inconclusive, the Fib-4 score will be used to verify
             eligibility: Fib-4 score &gt;3.25 is exclusionary; Fib-4 scores 1.45 - 3.25 requires
             Medical Monitor consultation; Fibrosis 4 Score Formula:

             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or
             persistent jaundice or cirrhosis), known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of
             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment).

             congestive heart failure, symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery
             bypass grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
             (PTCA) or any clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  Ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or
             resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia; other localized malignancies require agreement between the investigator and
             the Study medical monitor for inclusion of the participant prior to randomization.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drugs or render the
             participant unable to receive study medication.

          -  History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components
             or drugs of their class. In addition, if heparin is used during pharmacokinetic
             sampling, participants with a history of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced
             thrombocytopenia must not be enrolled.

          -  Current or anticipated need for chronic anti-coagulation with the exception of the use
             of low dose acetylsalicylic acid (&lt;=325 mg) or hereditary coagulation and platelet
             disorders such as hemophilia or Von Willebrand Disease.

          -  Any evidence of primary resistance based on the presence of any major known Integrase
             inhibitor (INI) or Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)
             resistance-associated mutation, except for K103N by any historical resistance test
             result.

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. A single repeat test is allowed during
             the Screening phase to verify a result.

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound.

          -  Subjects has estimated creatine clearance &lt;50mL/minute per 1.73 meter square (m^2) via
             Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) Method

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;=3 × Upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Exposure to an experimental drug (with the exception of those in the ATLAS study
             including CAB, CAB LA, and RPV LA) or experimental vaccine within either 30 days, 5
             half-lives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             test agent, whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 of this study.

          -  Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Screening: radiation
             therapy; cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents; tuberculosis therapy with the exception of
             isoniazid (isonicotinylhydrazid, INH); anti--coagulation agents; Immunomodulators that
             alter immune responses such as chronic systemic corticosteroids, interleukins, or
             interferons. Note: Subjects using short-term (e.g. &lt;=21 days) systemic corticosteroid
             treatment; topical, inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids are eligible for
             enrollment.

          -  Treatment with an HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening

          -  Treatment with any agent, except recognized ART as allowed above, with documented

        <description>Percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &gt;=50 c/mL as per FDA snapshot algorithm at Week 48 was assessed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of CAB LA+RPV LA Q8W compared to CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W regimen over 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected ART experienced participants. The HIV-1 RNA &gt;=50 c/mL per Snapshot algorithm was determined by the last on-treatment HIV-1 RNA measurement within the Week 48 analysis visit window. Intent-to-treat-Exposed (ITT-E) Population comprised of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. Participants were assessed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment they received.</description>

Participants then received a loading dose of CAB LA 600 mg and RPV LA 900 mg IM injections at Week 4b followed maintenance injections of CAB LA 400 mg +RPV LA 600 mg Q4W thereafter. Participants transitioned from the Q4W arm of ATLAS study continued to receive CAB LA 400 mg+RPV LA 600 mg intramuscular injections administered Q4W from Day 1.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters: Basophils, Eosinophils, Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils and Platelets Over Time</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters: basophils, eosinophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and platelets. Baseline value is defined as latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Participants were administered the preference questionnaire which had 3 questions. For treatment preference, participants were required to provide their response to Question 1, which stated &quot;Based on your experience which HIV treatment do you prefer&quot;. The responses included 1) Injectable LA HIV treatment Q4W, 2) Injectable LA HIV Treatment Q8W (only select this answer if you received the 8-week injectable regimen of CAB LA + RPV LA during study), 3) Oral daily HIV treatment and 4) No preference. Oral daily HIV Treatment refers to the oral medication of CAB + RPV subjects received during the oral lead-in period. Number of participants without prior exposure to CAB+RPV who selected each of the responses based on their treatment preference is presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Life Satisfaction (LISAT) Using HIV/AIDs-targeted Quality of Life (HATQoL) Questionnaire in Participants With or Without Prior Exposure to CAB+RPV</title>
        <description>The HATQoL questionnaire was used to assess the health related QoL (HRQoL). It comprises of three dimensions:LISAT, medication worries (MEDWO) and disclosure worries (DISWO). Total imputed value score for LISAT is calculated on a 0-100 scale using the formula: LISAT 100=[100 divided by (20 minus 4)]*(LISAT minus 4). A response of 5 in LISAT score shows satisfaction all of the time and 1 as none of the time. The higher the score, the greater satisfaction to life and the less worry. The transformed dimension score for each domain was summarized and analyzed. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) was used as primary method of analysis. Data for participants without/with prior exposure to CAB+RPV (0 Weeks [without exposure] and &gt;=1 Weeks [with exposure]) has been presented. Baseline value is defined as last available recorded value up to and including the Maintenance treatment start. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DISWO Using HATQoL Questionnaire in Participants With or Without Prior Exposure to CAB+RPV</title>
        <description>The HATQoL questionnaire was used to assess the HRQoL. It comprises of three dimensions:LISAT, MEDWO and DISWO. The total imputed value score for DISWO is calculated on a 0-100 scale using the formula: DISWO 100=[100 divided by (25 minus 5)]*(DISWO minus 5). A response of 1 in DISWO score shows disclosure worries all of the time and 5 as none of the time. The higher the score, the greater satisfaction to life and the less worry. The transformed dimension score for each domain was summarized and analyzed. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Participants without/with prior exposure to CAB+RPV (0 Weeks [without exposure] and &gt;=1 Weeks [with exposure]) has been presented. Baseline value is defined as last available recorded value up to and including the Maintenance treatment start. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual Item Scores Using HIVTSQs at Weeks 24 and 48</title>
        <description>HIVTSQs is a 12 item questionnaire. The individual item scores on HIVTSQs scale are rated as 6 (very satisfied, convenient, flexible, etc.) to 0 (very dissatisfied, inconvenient, inflexible, etc.). Higher scores represent greater satisfaction with each aspect of treatment. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Participants without/with prior exposure to CAB+RPV (0 Weeks [without exposure] and &gt;=1 Weeks [with exposure]) has been presented. Baseline value is defined as last available recorded value up to and including the Maintenance treatment start. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Total Treatment Satisfaction Change Score Using HIV Treatment Satisfaction Change Questionnaire (HIVTSQc) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The HIVTSQc is a 1-12 items questionnaire. Each item is scored -3 to 3. Total treatment satisfaction change score is computed using items 1 to 11 and are summed to produce a score with a possible range of -33 to 33. Higher the score, greater the improvement in satisfaction with treatment; the lower the score, the greater the deterioration in satisfaction with treatment. A score of 0 represented no change. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Total treatment satisfaction change score for participants who entered the current study from Q4W arm of ATLAS (NCT number: NCT02951052) and from either standard of care (SOC) arms of ATLAS or the new SOC participants) has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 8 in Dimension Scores Using Perception of Injection (PIN) Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>The PIN questionnaire explores bother of pain at injection site and injection site reactions (ISR), anxiety before and after injection, willingness to receive an HIV injectable treatment the following visit and satisfaction with mode of treatment administration of individuals receiving injection and perceptions of individuals associated with receiving injections. This measure contains 21 items that measure pain at injection site, local site reactions, impact on functioning and willingness to pursue injectable treatment outside of a clinical trial. Scores range from 1 to 5, and questions are phrased in such a way as to ensure that 1 always equated with the most favourable perception of vaccination, and 5 most unfavourable. Dimension scores include bother from ISR, leg movement, sleep and acceptability. Score of a domain is calculated as mean of all items within the domain. Higher scores represent worse perception of injection. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 8 in Individual Item Scores (Anxiety Before, Pain, Satisfaction, Anxiety After and Willingness) Using Perception of Injection (PIN) Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>The PIN questionnaire explores the bother of pain at the injection site and ISRs, anxiety before and after injection, willingness to receive an HIV injectable treatment the following visit and satisfaction with the mode of treatment administration of individuals receiving injection and perceptions of individuals associated with receiving injections. This measure contains 21 items that measure pain at injection site, local site reactions, impact on functioning and willingness to pursue injectable treatment outside of a clinical trial. The items in the scale are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1(very dissatisfied, extremely, etc.) to 5 (very satisfied, not at all, etc.). Lower scores represent worse perception of injection. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Treatment Acceptance a Using &quot;General Acceptance&quot; Dimension of the Chronic Treatment Acceptance (ACCEPT) Questionnaire in Participants With or Without Prior Exposure to CAB+RPV</title>
        <description>The ACCEPT questionnaire is a generic medication acceptance measure assessing how participants weigh advantages and disadvantages of long-term medication.The questionnaire consists of 25 items that capture six dimensions.3 questions that focus on general acceptance of study medication were analyzed.Items on the scale are rated as 1-5 scores:1:not at all acceptable,2:not very acceptable,3:somewhat acceptable, 4:totally acceptable and 5:I don't know.Total score of the dimension is calculated as the mean of recoded items of the dimension and then linearly transformed to be on a scale from 0 to 100:Total Score=(mean of the recoded items in the dimension minus1)divided by2*100. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Data for participants without or with prior exposure has been presented. Baseline value is defined as last available value up to and including the Maintenance treatment. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>
