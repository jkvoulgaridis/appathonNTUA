    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and
      Pharmacodynamics of AMG 596 monotherapy or in combination with AMG 404 in Subjects with
      Glioblastoma or Malignant Glioma Expressing Mutant Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Variant
      III (EGFRvIII).

      This is a first in human (FIH), open-label, sequential-dose-escalation study in subjects with
      EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma or malignant glioma. This study will enroll 2 groups of
      subjects according to disease stage, recurrent disease (Group 1) and maintenance treatment
      after SoC in newly diagnosed disease (Group 2).

          -  Must have recurrent disease confirmed by MRI (Group 1) or completed SoC therapy such
             as surgery with adjuvant radiochemotherapy with or without maintenance temozolomide

             anemia, thrombocytopenia), or to levels dictated in the eligibility criteria with the
             exception of alopecia or toxicities from prior antitumor therapy that are considered
             irreversible (defined as having been present and stable for greater than 2 months)
             which may be allowed if they are not otherwise described in the exclusion criteria AND
             there is agreement to allow by both the investigator and sponsor

          -  Antitumor therapy (chemotherapy, antibody therapy, molecular-targeted therapy, or
             investigational agent) within 14 days (Group 2 subjects) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer: for Group 1 subjects) of day 1. Avastin, Pembrolizumab must be stopped 14 days
             prior to day 1

          -  Female with a positive pregnancy test.
