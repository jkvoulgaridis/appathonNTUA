          3. Determined by the investigator to be medically stable at baseline/randomization as
             assessed by medical history, physical examination, laboratory test results, and
             electrocardiogram testing. Subjects must be physically able and expected to complete
             the trial as designed;

          4. Minimum of 6 years of education or equivalent and sufficiently fluent in English to

          5. Subjects must have adequate hearing, vision, and language skills to perform
             neuropsychiatric testing and interviews as specified in the protocol;

          6. Subjects must be able to understand and agree to comply with the prescribed dosage
             regimens and procedures; report for regularly scheduled office visits; and reliably
             communicate with study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medications;

          7. It is required that all women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) who are sexually
             active agree to use two methods of contraception for the duration of the study (i.e.
             beginning 30 days prior to baseline and extending to 30 days after the last dose of
             study drug).

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to dosing at Baseline;

          9. It is required that men who are sexually active with WOCBP agree to use two methods of
             contraception for the duration of the study (beginning at first treatment and
             extending to 90 days after the last dose of study drug).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects should be excluded with a history of more than two (2) previous failed
             treatment trials of SSRIs, clomipramine, venlafaxine, or desvenlafaxine (not including
             the current SSRI trial) given for an adequate duration at an adequate dose as defined
             by the following criteria taken from the MGH-TRQ-OCD as:

               1. Treatment failure / non-response: As per the MGH-TRQ-OCD, there has been minimal
                  or no meaningful clinical benefit as perceived by the patient despite an adequate
                  dose and duration of treatment;

               2. Adequate duration: At least 10 weeks of treatment with SSRI, clomipramine,
                  venlafaxine, or desvenlafaxine

               3. Adequate dose: Defined by the USPI labeling.

          2. Current or prior history, per DSM-V criteria, of bipolar I or II disorder,

             disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder (symptoms of hoarding disorder

             (ECT).

          6. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is prohibited within three months prior to
             screening and during the study.

          7. Patients who may have received a non-biological investigational agent in any clinical
             trial within 30 days, or a biological agent within 90 days prior to screening are
             excluded.

          8. Creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL.

          9. Course of treatment for subjects with localized cancers (without metastatic spread) is
             5 years prior to screening.

         10. QTcF (Fridericia) interval ≥ 470 msec during the screening or baseline period or
             uncontrolled arrhythmia or frequent premature ventricular contraction (PVCs) (&gt;
             5/minute) or Mobitz Type II second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block or left
             bundle branch block, or right bundle branch block with a QRS duration ≥ 150 msec or
             intraventricular conduction defect with a QRS duration ≥150 msec or evidence of acute
             or sub-acute myocardial infarction or ischemia and added or other ECG findings that,
             in the investigator's opinion, would preclude participation in the study.
