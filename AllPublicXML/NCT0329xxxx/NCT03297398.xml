      Study SAR-202 is a phase 2 multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate
      the effect of OPK-88004 doses (OPK-88004 15 mg, or OPK-88004 25 mg) on serum PSA compared to
      placebo in men with BPH. Approximately 115 men with BPH will be enrolled in the study,
      randomized 1:1:1 across three arms (placebo, OPK-88004 15 mg, or OPK-88004 25 mg). The trial
      will be conducted at approximately up to 35 sites within the US.

      The study duration for individual subjects will be up to 24 weeks and will include three
      phases:

        -  a screening period (up to 4 weeks, including 1-week washout if required),

        -  a treatment period (16 weeks), and

        -  a follow-up period (4 weeks) Subjects will be randomized and receive their first dose of
           study drug at visit 2. They will begin the once daily oral dosing regimen and return
           every 4 weeks to the study site during the 16-week treatment period. Assessments during
           the study period will include vital signs, laboratory testing, weight, adverse events
           (AEs), concomitant drugs, and study drug compliance. Efficacy assessments will include
           serum PSA, LBM and fat mass by DXA scans, uroflowmetry parameters, PVR (by ultrasound),
           and assessment of symptoms by IPSS.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects are eligible if they meet the following criteria:

          2. Are men aged 45 years or older at visit 1

          3. Have prostate volume &gt;40 cm3 and &lt;80 cm3 assessed by TRUS at visit 1

          4. Have a PSA &gt;1.5 and &lt;10.0 ng/mL at visit 1. This PSA blood draw must be performed at
             least 1 week after any digital rectal exam (DRE) and/or transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
             procedures

          5. Subjects with a PSA ≥4.0 and &lt;10.0 ng/mL must have documentation of a negative
             histologic biopsy of carcinoma of the prostate within 12 months of screening (visit
             1). For subjects aged ≤80 years and who have not undergone any invasive urological
             procedure within 6 months, if biopsy has not been performed, then 4Kscore Test value
             must be &lt;7.5% at visit 1

          6. Have laboratory tests within normal limits (with the exception of total serum or free
             testosterone). If laboratory test results are outside normal limits they are
             determined to be not clinically significant at visit 1

          7. Have not received prior treatment with 5-ARIs (finasteride, dutasteride) within the
             past one year for any indication

          8. Have not received herbal BPH preparations within 1 week of visit 1. If the subject is
             currently on such treatment, a 1-week washout period will be required

          9. Agree not to use 5-ARIs, herbal or experimental treatments for BPH, at any time during
             the study. Subjects on daily PDE5i's, alpha-blockers or anticholinergic medications
             for BPH should remain on a stable dose during the study, unless a change in dose is
             medically warranted. Occasional-use PDE5i's for ED are permitted at a stable dose and
             frequency, however should not be taken within 72 hours prior to a study visit

         10. Agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during the study and for 60 days
             after the last dose of IP, unless the female partner is postmenopausal. Postmenopausal
             is defined as a female &gt;50 years of age and 12 months of amenorrhea, or surgically
             postmenopausal

         11. Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study,
             and who will comply with the required study and dosing visits and abide by the
             Clinical Research Site policy and procedure and study restrictions

         12. Have given written informed consent
