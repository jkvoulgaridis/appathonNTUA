  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled, single center, single- blind, 3 period, 3 treatment,
      cross-over, in situ design which consists of placing pre-eroded bovine enamel specimens intra
      orally using a palatal appliance and testing the remineralizing performance of the
      experimental (dentifrice containing 0.254 Percent weight by weight [%, w/w] sodium fluoride
      (1150 parts per million [ppm] fluoride) and 5% KNO3 [potassium nitrate]), comparator
      (dentifrice containing 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride (1100 ppm fluoride) and placebo (Fluoride
      free placebo containing 5% KNO3 [0 ppm fluoride] ) dentifrices 2 and 4 hours (hrs) post
      treatment application, based on surface micro hardness measurements. This study will be
      carried out in healthy adults with a maxillary dental arch suitable for the retention of the
      palatal appliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of an experimental dentifrice
      formulation in promoting enamel remineralization and inhibiting post-treatment enamel
      demineralization in an in situ erosion model, in comparison with a fluoride-free placebo and
      with a marketed competitor dentifrice product. The study will have 4 visits, 1 screening
      visit to assess participants eligibility and 3 treatment visits to assess product efficacy,
      where the treatment product will be dispensed and used under the supervision of a suitably
      trained study site personnel. Prior to each treatment visit, there will be a washout period
      of a minimum of 3 days. During this period participants will use their own dentifrice for at
      least one day, and a fluoride free dentifrice (provided) for two days prior to the next
      scheduled visit (including in the morning of the scheduled visit) to minimize any carry-over
      effects of the fluoride toothpaste.

    <measure>% Surface Micro Hardness Recovery (SMHR; Comparison of 1150 Ppm Fluoride and 5% KNO3 Dentifrice Relative to a Fluoride Free Placebo Dentifrice to Enhance Remineralization of Enamel)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 hrs following single exposure of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The %SMHR was calculated to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens. The mean indent length (micrometer) from five Knoop microindentations within each specimen was measured at baseline (B), after the first erosive challenge (E1), and after 2 and 4 hours intraoral phase (R). An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening of the enamel surface while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. The %SMHR was calculated as : %SMHR = [(E1−R)/(E1−B)]*100. Greater values of %SMHR indicate that greater remineralization has occurred, thus higher values are more favorable.</description>

    <measure>% Relative Erosion Resistance (RER; Comparison of 1150 Ppm Fluoride and 5% KNO3 Dentifrice Relative to a Fluoride Free Placebo Dentifrice to Inhibit Demineralization of Enamel)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 hrs following single exposure of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The %RER was calculated to assess the ability of treated enamel specimens to provide a combined benefit in terms of enhanced remineralization and acid resistance of the enamel. The mean indent length (micrometer) from five Knoop microindentations within each specimen was measured at baseline (B), after the first erosive challenge (E1), and after the second erosive challenge (E2) (E2 is measured for after both 2 and 4 hours of remineralization). An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening of the enamel surface while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. The %RER was calculated as : %RER = [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Higher values of %RER indicate greater resistance to erosion, thus higher values are more favorable.</description>

    <measure>Enamel Fluoride Uptake (EFU; Comparison of 1150 Ppm Fluoride and 5% KNO3 Dentifrice Relative to a Fluoride Free Placebo Dentifrice to Promote Fluoride Uptake in Enamel)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 hrs following single exposure of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The EFU was measured to determine the amount of fluoride incorporation into the model erosive lesions. Each enamel specimen drilled to a depth of approximately 100 μm using a microdrill, through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen). The enamel powder pooled from four drilling samples was then, dissolved in a known volume of perchloric acid and immediately analyzed for fluoride content using a calibrated fluoride specific electrode. The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as microgram fluoride per square centimeter (μgF/cm^2). Higher values of EFU indicate greater incorporation of fluoride into the enamel and are thus more favorable.</description>

          <description>Participants in this arm received placebo product (5% KNO3 [0 ppm fluoride]) followed by test (0.254% w/w NaF [1150 ppm fluoride] and 5% KNO3) and comparator product (0.454% w/w SnF2 [1100 ppm fluoride]) in Period 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Each treatment period was separated by a wash out period of minimum 3 days (including 2 day washout period using a non-fluoride toothpaste). Participants applied a full ribbon (1.5 g) of the allocated product and brushed the buccal surfaces of their natural teeth for 25 timed seconds and then swished the resulting toothpaste slurry around the mouth, without further brushing, for a timed period of 95 seconds. After expectorating the slurry, the participants gently rinsed their mouths with 15 mL of tap water for 10 seconds before expectorating again.</description>

        <title>% Surface Micro Hardness Recovery (SMHR; Comparison of 1150 Ppm Fluoride and 5% KNO3 Dentifrice Relative to a Fluoride Free Placebo Dentifrice to Enhance Remineralization of Enamel)</title>
        <description>The %SMHR was calculated to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens. The mean indent length (micrometer) from five Knoop microindentations within each specimen was measured at baseline (B), after the first erosive challenge (E1), and after 2 and 4 hours intraoral phase (R). An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening of the enamel surface while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. The %SMHR was calculated as : %SMHR = [(E1−R)/(E1−B)]*100. Greater values of %SMHR indicate that greater remineralization has occurred, thus higher values are more favorable.</description>

        <title>% Relative Erosion Resistance (RER; Comparison of 1150 Ppm Fluoride and 5% KNO3 Dentifrice Relative to a Fluoride Free Placebo Dentifrice to Inhibit Demineralization of Enamel)</title>
        <description>The %RER was calculated to assess the ability of treated enamel specimens to provide a combined benefit in terms of enhanced remineralization and acid resistance of the enamel. The mean indent length (micrometer) from five Knoop microindentations within each specimen was measured at baseline (B), after the first erosive challenge (E1), and after the second erosive challenge (E2) (E2 is measured for after both 2 and 4 hours of remineralization). An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening of the enamel surface while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. The %RER was calculated as : %RER = [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Higher values of %RER indicate greater resistance to erosion, thus higher values are more favorable.</description>

        <title>Enamel Fluoride Uptake (EFU; Comparison of 1150 Ppm Fluoride and 5% KNO3 Dentifrice Relative to a Fluoride Free Placebo Dentifrice to Promote Fluoride Uptake in Enamel)</title>
        <description>The EFU was measured to determine the amount of fluoride incorporation into the model erosive lesions. Each enamel specimen drilled to a depth of approximately 100 μm using a microdrill, through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen). The enamel powder pooled from four drilling samples was then, dissolved in a known volume of perchloric acid and immediately analyzed for fluoride content using a calibrated fluoride specific electrode. The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as microgram fluoride per square centimeter (μgF/cm^2). Higher values of EFU indicate greater incorporation of fluoride into the enamel and are thus more favorable.</description>

        <title>% RER (Comparison of 1150 Ppm Fluoride and 5% KNO3 Dentifrice Relative to Comparator Containing 1100 Ppm Fluoride)</title>
        <description>The %RER was calculated to assess the ability of treated enamel specimens to provide a combined benefit in terms of enhanced remineralization and acid resistance of the enamel. The mean indent length (micrometer) from five Knoop microindentations within each specimen was measured at baseline (B), after the first erosive challenge (E1), and after the second erosive challenge (E2) (E2 is measured for after both 2 and 4 hours of remineralization). An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening of the enamel surface while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. The %RER was calculated as : %RER = [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Higher values of %RER indicate greater resistance to erosion, thus higher values are more favorable.</description>

        <title>EFU (Comparison of 1150 Ppm Fluoride and 5% KNO3 Dentifrice Relative to Comparator Containing 1100 Ppm Fluoride)</title>
        <description>The EFU was measured to determine the amount of fluoride incorporation into the model erosive lesions. Each enamel specimen drilled to a depth of approximately 100 μm using a microdrill, through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen). The enamel powder pooled from four drilling samples was then, dissolved in a known volume of perchloric acid and immediately analyzed for fluoride content using a calibrated fluoride specific electrode. The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as microgram fluoride per square centimeter (μgF/cm^2). Higher values of EFU indicate greater incorporation of fluoride into the enamel and are thus more favorable.</description>
