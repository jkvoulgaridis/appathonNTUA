  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the widespread use of nutrition therapy, no large scale randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) have demonstrated positive outcomes with delivery of nutrition therapy early in
      critical illness, with some showing no effect with delayed nutrition or even harm.

      There are several possible reasons for the lack of observed benefit from RCTs to date;
      interventions have been short in duration (usually 3-10 days after intensive care unit (ICU)
      admission), perhaps applied at the incorrect time in regards to the patients metabolism and
      recovery, do not consider the patients nutrition risk, and have not addressed what happens to
      nutrition intake post ICU in critically ill individuals. This may explain why RCTs to date
      have not observed any positive associations with the delivery of nutrition; our focus to date
      may have been on the wrong stage of illness. A future study is thus urgently needed, which
      addresses the deficiencies in current RCTs by optimizing nutrition delivery for the whole
      hospital stay and collecting meaningful clinical, process and outcome data, which will
      potentially inform a larger trial of a similar nature.

      This initial study aims to determine whether optimization of energy using a pre-tested
      supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN) strategy in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and an
      intensive nutrition intervention in the post ICU period will deliver more total energy than
      standard nutrition care during hospital admission in a group of critically ill patients with
      at least one organ system failure.

      Background:

      Nutrition is a commonly provided therapy in critical illness, but data about effectiveness is
      sparse. Best practice guidelines recommend enteral nutrition (EN), a specialised solution
      delivered into the gastrointestinal tract, as the first line of nutrition therapy. The
      majority of best practice guidelines also recommend delivery of energy and protein amounts
      close to predicted requirements in critical illness over the course of Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU) admission, however the only evidence to support this is from observational data.
      Although recommended that energy and protein requirements be met, and observational data
      suggests this is of benefit, there are practical challenges with the provision of EN.
      International practice surveys report the average energy and protein provided is
      approximately 59% of the patients predicted requirements, for multifactorial reasons. The
      addition of parenteral (intravenous) nutrition has been proposed as a method to provide
      additional energy when EN is insufficient, termed supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN). The
      ability of this strategy to deliver additional energy and protein to patients during critical
      illness has been proven in several feasibility/pilot trials, but the benefit on clinical and
      functional outcomes is unknown.

      Despite observational data suggesting benefit when energy and protein delivery is optimised
      close to requirements, no large scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have confirmed
      improved clinical outcomes in critical illness, with some showing no effect with delayed
      nutrition or even harm. There are several possible reasons for the lack of observed benefit
      from RCTs to date; the interventions may have been applied at a time when the patient's
      metabolism is not in a phase of recovery; interventions have been short in duration and;
      studies have not addressed what happens to nutrition intake in the post ICU period of
      hospitalisation in critically ill individuals.

      Aims:

      To determine whether the use of a pre-tested supplemental PN strategy in the ICU and an
      intensive nutrition intervention after discharge to the hospital ward is feasible and will
      deliver more total energy than standard nutrition care over the entire hospital stay, in
      critically ill patients with at least one organ system failure.

      A further aim is to develop a research program that will determine whether optimisation of
      energy to critically ill patients over the entire period of hospitalisation improves
      clinically-meaningful outcomes.

      Hypothesis:

      In critically ill patients with at least one organ failure, the use of a supplemental PN
      strategy in ICU and an intensive nutrition intervention on the hospital ward will lead to an
      increase in daily energy delivery of at least 15% over the entire hospital stay when compared
      to standard care.

      Fifteen percent has been estimated as the minimum acceptable clinical difference between the
      two groups.

      Objectives:

      The major objectives are:

        1. To determine whether the whole hospital nutrition intervention leads to increased
           amounts of total energy delivered over the period of hospital stay

        2. To determine if the whole hospital nutrition intervention is safe in regards to adverse
           effects

        3. To determine if the post-ICU nutrition intervention is practically feasible when applied
           in multiple hospitals, across multiple wards

        4. To measure the clinical outcomes in patients and provide information to assist design of
           a larger randomised controlled trial

    <description>In ICU:
After enrolment, patients allocated to the standard nutrition therapy (control) group will commence or continue nutrition via an enteral tube to a target rate according to unit protocol including the use of promotility agents and the placement of nasojejunal feeding tubes if required.
PN will only be used if the above methods have been attempted, or an absolute contraindication to EN develops.
Unless there is specific indication for a compounded PN solution, the PN used in the standard care group will be the same as used in the intervention arm.
After ICU:
Nutrition management will be as per usual site management at that hospital.
Nutrition intake amounts will be recorded 3 times per week using provided study documents and assessment tools.</description>

    <description>Intervention
In ICU:
Supplemental PN will be commenced within 2 hours of randomisation. The starting dose of PN will be determined by the amount of energy received in the 24 hours prior to randomisation
The need for the intervention will be based on the adequacy of nutrition provision from both PN and EN and assessed daily until ICU discharge
If there is an actual or anticipated interruption of EN for greater than 2 hours the PN must be run at 20 kcal/kg calculated body weight until EN is recommenced. After the interruption, EN should be recommenced as per local protocol.
After ICU:
An intensive nutrition intervention will be provided on the ward in the intervention group. This will include daily review from dedicated study dietitians and a clearly protocolized hierarchical management plan which reflects best practice clinical management.</description>
