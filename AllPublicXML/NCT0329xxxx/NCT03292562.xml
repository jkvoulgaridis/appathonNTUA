  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if among infants &lt;30 weeks gestational age on nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), whether discontinuing CPAP after gradual
      reduction in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressure leads to successful weaning
      off CPAP when compared to discontinuing CPAP without weaning pressure.
