  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As T-cell receptor sequencing by LymphoTrack is an assay with high sensitivity that can be
      performed in peripheral blood, the investigators wish to evaluate the ability of this assay
      to predict which patients are at higher risk of relapse after initial therapy for peripheral
      T-cell lymphomas which is being given for curative intent. Additionally, as more is known
      about the ability of dynamic monitoring of cfDNA in B-cell lymphomas to predict relapse, the
      investigators wish to explore the use of this technology in T-cell lymphomas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Histologically-confirmed peripheral T-cell lymphoma being treated with curative
             intent. Eligible histologies include, but are not limited to: peripheral T-cell
             lymphoma, not otherwise specified; angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma; anaplastic
             large cell lymphoma, ALK negative; and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK positive.

          -  Plan for treatment with frontline multi-agent anthracycline containing chemotherapy
             for curative intent (for example, CHOP, CHOEP, EPOCH). A frontline therapy program can
             include different sequential phases of treatment, including high-dose therapy and
             autologous stem cell transplantation.

             if sufficient tissue is not available at time of enrollment (e.g. 15 slides from fixed
             formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue

             *Patients who have less than 15 slides of fixed formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor
             tissue may be considered for enrollment after discussion with the study principal
