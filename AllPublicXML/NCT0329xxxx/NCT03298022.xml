  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Neihulizumab (AbGn-168H) administered intravenously in
      patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis who are refractory or intolerant
      to anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α and/or anti-integrin treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label, single arm, multiple dose proof of principle study to test
      the efficacy and safety of Neihulizumab in patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative
      colitis and who has failed or are intolerant to anti-TNFα and/or anti-integrin therapy. A
      minimum of 30 patients and a maximum of 40 will be recruited in 1 dosing group. For efficacy
      evaluation, the primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with clinical response,
      defined as ≥ 3- point reduction in MCS, a 30% or greater decrease from the baseline score,
      and with a 1-point or greater decrease of the rectal bleeding subscore or an absolute rectal
      bleeding score of 0 or 1 at Week 12. Safety assessments will consist of evaluating physical
      examination, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature and
      oxygen saturation), safety laboratory tests, adverse events and tolerability.
