  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of GS010, a gene
      therapy, in improving the retina functional &amp; structural outcomes in subjects with LHON due
      to the G11778A ND4 mitochondrial mutation when vision loss duration is present up to one
      year.

    <textblock>
      GS-LHON-CLIN-05 is a Phase III, global, multi-center randomized, double-masked for the
      primary analysis, placebo-controlled, clinical study. As LHON is a neurodegenerative disease,
      the goal is to administer GS010 as soon as possible upon confirmation of the LHON diagnosis
      and the causative mutation.
