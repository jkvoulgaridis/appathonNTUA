      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Venetoclax in combination with FDA
      approved treatments Bendamustine, Rituximab and Ibrutinib (BR-I). This study will examine the
      effects Venetoclax has on participants when it is given in combination with BR-I.

             patient will be eligible

          -  Bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of
             non-hepatic origin)

          -  For women of childbearing potential:

               -  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a
                  contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment

                  after the last dose of rituximab, whichever is longer

               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per years include
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that
                  inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper
                  intrauterine devices

               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (&gt;/= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea
                  with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus)

          -  For men:

               -  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
                  contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined
                  below

               -  With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a
                  failure rate of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6
                  months after the last dose of rituximab. Men must refrain from donating sperm
                  during this same period.

               -  With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during
                  the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of rituximab
                  to avoid exposing the embryo

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception
