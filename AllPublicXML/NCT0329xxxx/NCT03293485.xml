    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing ≥1 Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants experiencing ≥1 AE was calculated. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy could be determined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days (End of Therapy Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who discontinued from study medication due to an adverse event was calculated. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy could be determined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection (cIAI) Participants With Favorable Clinical Response at End of Therapy Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Day 5 and Day 14 (End of Therapy Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with cIAI who display a favorable clinical response at End of Therapy visit was presented. Per protocol, a subset of the cIAI/cUTI study arm was analyzed: only participants with cIAI were evaluated because clinical response is primarily relevant to cIAI. Favorable clinical response is a rating of &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;improved&quot; as determined by the investigator at the End of Therapy Visit. &quot;Cure&quot; is defined as: all pretherapy signs and symptoms of the index infection(s) have resolved (or returned to preinfection status) AND no additional intravenous antibiotic therapy is required AND no unplanned surgical or percutaneous drainage procedures have been performed. &quot;Improved&quot; is defined as: All or most pretherapy signs and symptoms of the index infection(s) have improved or resolved (or returned to preinfection status) AND no additional intravenous antibiotic therapy is required AND no unplanned surgical or percutaneous drainage procedures have been performed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (cUTI) Participants With Favorable Overall Microbiological Response at End of Therapy Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Day 5 and Day 14 (End of Therapy Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with cUTI who display a favorable Overall Microbiological Response at the End of Therapy visit was calculated. Per protocol, only a subset of the cIAI/cUTI study arm was analyzed: only participants with cUTI were evaluated because the microbiological response evaluation is primarily relevant to cUTI. A favorable Overall Microbiological Response is defined as a urine culture taken at the End of Therapy Visit showing eradication (e.g., ≥10^5 CFU/mL is reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL) of all uropathogens found at study entry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection (cIAI) Participants With Favorable Clinical Response at Test of Cure Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Day 10 and Day 23 (Test of Cure Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with cIAI who display a favorable Clinical Response at the Test of Cure visit was calculated. Per protocol, only a subset of the cIAI/cUTI study arm was analyzed: only participants with cIAI were evaluated because the clinical response evaluation is primarily relevant to cIAI. A favorable clinical response is a rating of &quot;cure&quot; as determined by the investigator at the Test of Cure Visit. &quot;Cure&quot; is defined as: all pretherapy signs and symptoms of the index infection(s) have resolved (or returned to &quot;preinfection status&quot;) AND no additional intravenous antibiotic therapy is required AND no unplanned surgical or percutaneous drainage procedures have been performed.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with cUTI who display a favorable Overall Microbiological Response at the Test of Cure visit was calculated. Per protocol, only a subset of the cIAI/cUTI study arm was analyzed: only participants with cUTI were evaluated because the microbiological response evaluation is primarily relevant to cUTI. A favorable Overall Microbiological Response is defined as a urine culture taken at the Test of Cure visit still showing eradication (e.g., ≥10^5 CFU/mL is reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL) of all uropathogens found at study entry.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection (cIAI) Participants With Favorable Clinical Response at End of Therapy Visit</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with cIAI who display a favorable clinical response at End of Therapy visit was presented. Per protocol, a subset of the cIAI/cUTI study arm was analyzed: only participants with cIAI were evaluated because clinical response is primarily relevant to cIAI. Favorable clinical response is a rating of &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;improved&quot; as determined by the investigator at the End of Therapy Visit. &quot;Cure&quot; is defined as: all pretherapy signs and symptoms of the index infection(s) have resolved (or returned to preinfection status) AND no additional intravenous antibiotic therapy is required AND no unplanned surgical or percutaneous drainage procedures have been performed. &quot;Improved&quot; is defined as: All or most pretherapy signs and symptoms of the index infection(s) have improved or resolved (or returned to preinfection status) AND no additional intravenous antibiotic therapy is required AND no unplanned surgical or percutaneous drainage procedures have been performed.</description>
        <time_frame>Between Day 5 and Day 14 (End of Therapy Visit)</time_frame>
        <population>Per protocol, the population analyzed was all participants with cIAI who received intravenous imipenem+cilastatin+relebactam ≥96 hours, whose pre-study infection-site culture grew ≥1 gram-negative enteric and/or anaerobic pathogen, and who had no major deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the results of the efficacy analyses.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection (cIAI) Participants With Favorable Clinical Response at End of Therapy Visit</title>
          <description>The percentage of participants with cIAI who display a favorable clinical response at End of Therapy visit was presented. Per protocol, a subset of the cIAI/cUTI study arm was analyzed: only participants with cIAI were evaluated because clinical response is primarily relevant to cIAI. Favorable clinical response is a rating of &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;improved&quot; as determined by the investigator at the End of Therapy Visit. &quot;Cure&quot; is defined as: all pretherapy signs and symptoms of the index infection(s) have resolved (or returned to preinfection status) AND no additional intravenous antibiotic therapy is required AND no unplanned surgical or percutaneous drainage procedures have been performed. &quot;Improved&quot; is defined as: All or most pretherapy signs and symptoms of the index infection(s) have improved or resolved (or returned to preinfection status) AND no additional intravenous antibiotic therapy is required AND no unplanned surgical or percutaneous drainage procedures have been performed.</description>
          <population>Per protocol, the population analyzed was all participants with cIAI who received intravenous imipenem+cilastatin+relebactam ≥96 hours, whose pre-study infection-site culture grew ≥1 gram-negative enteric and/or anaerobic pathogen, and who had no major deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the results of the efficacy analyses.</population>

        <description>The percentage of participants with cUTI who display a favorable Overall Microbiological Response at the End of Therapy visit was calculated. Per protocol, only a subset of the cIAI/cUTI study arm was analyzed: only participants with cUTI were evaluated because the microbiological response evaluation is primarily relevant to cUTI. A favorable Overall Microbiological Response is defined as a urine culture taken at the End of Therapy Visit showing eradication (e.g., ≥10^5 CFU/mL is reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL) of all uropathogens found at study entry.</description>
