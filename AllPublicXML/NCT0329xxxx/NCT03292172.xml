  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase IB, open label, non-randomized study designed to investigate the dose, safety,
      pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of RO6870810 in combination with a fixed dose of
      atezolizumab. The study consists of four groups, Group 1 (Dose Escalation Group) and Group 2
      (Sequential Dose Group), and Groups 3 and 4 (Expansion Groups), which will further evaluate
      the safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and preliminary clinical activity in patients
      with triple negaive breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer.
