      This feasibility exploratory study objective is to assess the ability of combined MRI BOLD
      and 18F-MISO PET imaging to visualize tumor hypoxia compare to histological results obtained
      after radical prostatectomy in order to, in time, be able to identify patient with bad
      prognostic and to offer them the best therapeutic strategy.

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the fisrt one in male with 80.000 new cases each year in France. Forty
      thousand curative treatments are performed each year, but 25 to 30% of these patients will
      present a cancer reccurence after radical surgery or conformationnal radiotherapy, Tissu
      hypoxia seems to be mainly responsible of the local reccurence and conduct to molecular
      damages that creates carcinogenesis and tumor agressitivity. This hypoxia inhibits the DNA
      healing and the apoptosis but increases the angiogenesis, that leads to treatment resistance.
      L. Marignol &amp;al clearly showed that hypoxia may have a main role in hormonal resistance.
      Furthermore, M. Milosevic &amp; al showed that hypoxia is an independent factor of local
      reccurence after radiotherapy. Nowadays, new technics of IMRT in radiotherapy planning could
      be able to target an hypoxic prostate region to prevent reccurence. Patients who are eligible
      to radical prostatectomy will benefit of a prostate MRI with BOLD sequences and a
      18F-misonidazole PET before surgery. The results of these two technics will be compared to
      the histological results using CAIX and HIF immunohistochemistery markers

Patient will be selected during multidisciplinary meeting and urology consultation of Bordeaux and Toulouse university hospitals. Functional MRI imaging should be available before surgery. If patient consent to participate in the study, F-MISO PET imaging will be planed before prostatectomy. Results of this exam will not be considered for patient therapeutic management.</description>
