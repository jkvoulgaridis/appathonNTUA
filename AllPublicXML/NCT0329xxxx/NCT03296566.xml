  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to improve the patient experience of communication of colposcopy
      results and follow-up recommendations to patients. Current practice involves results being
      forwarded from the colposcopy clinic to the family or referring physician who then informs
      the patient. We are testing an intervention informed by focus groups in which a trained
      colposcopy nurse (patient liaison) directly contacts patients with their results and
      follow-up recommendations while providing education and support. We will examine whether this
      intervention improves patient satisfaction, reduces anxiety, and improves rates of adherence
      to follow-up and treatment appointments compared to the current practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of
      cancer death in women worldwide. Pre-cancerous cells can be detected with regular Pap smear
      screening and diagnosed and treated with colposcopy. This process is limited by patient
      adherence to the follow-up and treatment recommendations. Currently at Vancouver General
      Hospital (VGH), the largest colposcopy clinic in the province, results are forwarded from the
      colposcopy clinic to the family or referring physician who informs patients of results and
      recommendations. Inefficiencies or errors in this step may cause patient dissatisfaction,
      missed appointments, increased costs, and compromise patient outcomes. The primary objective
      of this study is to examine whether having a trained colposcopy nurse directly contact
      patients with their results and follow-up recommendations while providing education and
      support will improve patient satisfaction and reduce anxiety, with the secondary aim being to
      assess the clinical effectiveness of this intervention in improving rates of adherence to
      follow-up and treatment appointments and potentially long-term clinical outcomes. The first
      phase of the study involves patient focus groups that will be interviewed about what elements
      of a patient liaison interaction are most important (separate Ethics submission). This
      information will inform the development of the patient liaison role and approaches to patient
      interaction to be utilized in the intervention in the second phase. The second phase will
      entail a randomized controlled trial comparing patient anxiety, satisfaction and adherence to
      follow-up between a control group (current practice) versus the intervention group exposed to
      the patient liaison at the VGH Colposcopy Clinic. For the primary aim, a questionnaire
      containing items pertaining to patient anxiety and satisfaction with their experience of
      receiving their colposcopy results will be administered both to the intervention and control
      groups and the mean scores pertaining to anxiety and satisfaction will be compared using
      two-tailed t-tests. For the secondary aim, a chart review at 6-12 months following the
      initial colposcopy visit will examine the rates of compliance with the recommended follow-up
      or treatment visits and histologic diagnoses, and comparisons will be sought between the
      intervention and control groups using z-score test.

    <description>Mean state anxiety scores as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) State Subscale. The STAI has 40 items with 20 items allocated to each of the State Anxiety and Trait Anxiety subscales. Responses for the State Anxiety scale assess intensity of current feelings from 1-4 &quot;at this moment&quot;: 1) not at all, 2) somewhat, 3) moderately so, and 4) very much so. Item scores are added to obtain subtest total scores and for anxiety-present items, a higher score suggests higher anxiety. Scoring is reversed for anxiety-absent items (items in which a higher score suggests lower anxiety). Range of scores for the subscale is 20-80 with a higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms for the State Anxiety scale.</description>

    <time_frame>To be collected by questionnaire in 4-6 weeks following colposcopy visit</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction scores as measured by items in the questionnaire drawn from the Visit Specific Satisfaction Instrument (VSQ-9) Inventory. The VSQ-9 is a 9 item survey that measures patient satisfaction with access to primary care, with the direct interaction with the physician, and with the visit overall on a scale ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). To score the VSQ-9, responses from each individual are transformed linearly to a 0 to 100 scale, with 100 corresponding to &quot;excellent&quot; and 0 corresponding to &quot;poor&quot; (0= Poor, 25= Fair, 50= Good, 75= Very Good, 100= Excellent). The 9 responses are then averaged together to create a VSQ-9 overall score for each person, again with 100 being the best evaluation and 0 the poorest.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction With Colposcopy Information and Diagnosis Education</measure>
    <time_frame>To be collected by questionnaire in 4-6 weeks following colposcopy visit</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with information and education received regarding colposcopy, patient diagnosis and follow-up recommendations measured by questionnaire items that measure these factors (PSQ-18 Inventory). This inventory contains 18 items assessing each of the 7 dimensions of satisfaction with medical care (general satisfaction, technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects, time spent with doctor, accessibility and convenience). Each item is scored from 1-5. Some PSQ-18 items are worded so that agreement reflects satisfaction with medical care, whereas other items are worded so that agreement reflects dissatisfaction with medical care. All items all scored so that high scores reflect satisfaction with medical care. All items are then summed; sum score of all items may range from 18 to 90 points, where 18 points is the poorest evaluation and 90 points the best.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be 19 years of age or older

          2. Must be patients presenting for an initial visit at the VGH Colposcopy Clinic

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to speak conversational English- required to complete the questionnaire as
             well as provide informed consent to participate

          2. Inability or refusal to provide consent

          3. Pregnant - pregnant women do not usually have biopsies and their subsequent care may
             be much different than non-pregnant patients

          4. Do not have a family physician or referring physician who will provide continuity of
             care following colposcopy - these patients do not have the option of getting results
             from a family or referring physician, so they would bias results.

        <description>Mean state anxiety scores as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) State Subscale. The STAI has 40 items with 20 items allocated to each of the State Anxiety and Trait Anxiety subscales. Responses for the State Anxiety scale assess intensity of current feelings from 1-4 &quot;at this moment&quot;: 1) not at all, 2) somewhat, 3) moderately so, and 4) very much so. Item scores are added to obtain subtest total scores and for anxiety-present items, a higher score suggests higher anxiety. Scoring is reversed for anxiety-absent items (items in which a higher score suggests lower anxiety). Range of scores for the subscale is 20-80 with a higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms for the State Anxiety scale.</description>

The VSQ-9 is a 9 item survey that measures patient satisfaction with access to primary care, with the direct interaction with the physician, and with the visit overall on a scale ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). To score the VSQ-9, responses from each individual are transformed linearly to a 0 to 100 scale, with 100 corresponding to &quot;excellent&quot; and 0 corresponding to &quot;poor&quot; (0= Poor, 25= Fair, 50= Good, 75= Very Good, 100= Excellent). The 9 responses are then averaged together to create a VSQ-9 overall score for each person, again with 100 being the best evaluation and 0 the poorest.</description>

Rather than receive results from their referring physician, an experienced colposcopy nurse will contact participants once the colposcopists complete the final colposcopy report.
Patient Liaison: An experienced colposcopy nurse will contact participants once the colposcopists complete the final colposcopy report. The colposcopy report will inform the referring provider that these patients will be informed of the results. The colposcopy nurse will provide an explanation of the colposcopy results and subsequent follow-up or treatment recommendations, be available to answer patient questions (within her scope), offer educational or support resources to patients. She will forward any patient questions beyond her scope to the patient’s colposcopist.</description>

Upon receipt of the final pathology, colposcopy reports are prepared by the colposcopists and forwarded to family/referring physicians typically within 2-3 weeks of the visit. Patients then receive the results of their colposcopy report from their family/referring physician by whatever method of communication preferred by that provider.</description>
