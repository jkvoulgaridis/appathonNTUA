  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a well-recognized public health issue worldwide. DM can lead to
      many complications resulting in morbidity and mortality, approximately 70% of DM related
      deaths were attributed to cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

      Objectives:

      To develop 10-year risk prediction models for CVD, end stage renal disease (ESRD) and
      all-cause mortality among Chinese patients with DM in primary care.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Patient socio-demographic, clinical parameters, disease characteristics and treatment
           modalities are predictive of 10-year risk of CVD, ESRD and all-cause mortality.

        2. Risk prediction models developed from this study should have over 70% of discriminating
           power.

      Design and Subjects:

      10-year retrospective cohort study. All Chinese patients who were clinically diagnosed to
      have DM and were receiving care in the public (Hospital Authority) primary care clinics on or
      before 1 July 2006 will be followed up until 31 December 2016.

      Main outcomes measures:

      For total CVD, CHD, stroke, heart failure, ESRD, all-cause mortality

        1. 10-year incidence;

        2. Predictive factors

      Data analysis:

      Two thirds of subjects will be randomly selected as the training sample for model
      development. Cox regressions will be used to develop sex-specific 10-year risk prediction
      models for each outcome. The validity of models will be tested on the remaining one third of
      subjects by Harrell C statistics and ROC

      Expected results:

      Risk prediction models will enable accurate risk stratification and cost-effective
      interventions for Chinese DM patients in primary care.

      This study aims to develop 10-year risk prediction models for total CVD and all-cause
      mortality among Chinese diabetic patients in primary care. Risk prediction models for
      individual DM complications including CHD, heart failure, stroke and ESRD will also be
      developed.

      The objectives are to:

        1. Calculate the 10 years incidence of total CVD, all-cause mortality and each major DM
           complication in Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        2. Determine the risk factors that significantly predict total CVD, all-cause mortality and
           each major DM complication for Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        3. Develop and validate risk prediction models for total CVD, all-cause mortality and each
           major DM complication for Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        4. Develop a risk prediction nomogram and chart for the risk of total CVD, all-cause
           mortality for Chinese DM patients in primary care

      Hypotheses:

        1. Patient socio-demographic, clinical parameters, disease characteristics, and treatment
           modalities are predictive of 10-year risk of total CVD, all-cause mortality and
           individual DM complication as a dependent variable.

        2. The risk prediction models for total CVD, all-cause mortality and individual DM
           complication developed in this study can have over 70% of discriminating power.

CVD is defined as the presence of any of CHD, heart failure and stroke. CHD includes all ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, coronary death or sudden death as indicated by the ICPC-2 K74 to K76 or ICD-9-CM 410.x, 411.x to 414.x, 798.x codes. Heart failure is defined by the ICPC-2 K77 or ICD-9-CM 428.x. Stoke (fatal and non-fatal stroke) is defined by the ICPC-2 K89 to K91 or ICD-9-CM 430.x to 438.x codes.</description>
