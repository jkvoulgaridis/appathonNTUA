      This is a prospective, open label, single center clinical study enrolling 260 subjects in a
      mobile smoking cessation program using a smartphone app and handheld breath sensor with
      coaching support over a six month period. Measurements include user engagement and retention
      in the program, attitude towards smoking and smoking behavior, quit rates, relapse rates, and
      quality of life over the study period, as well as user feedback on the program.

      Potential participants will complete an online screening form. Eligible participants will be
      called to confirm eligibility, discuss the study, and have their questions about the study
      answered. Interested eligible participants will then be emailed the registration link, which
      includes the electronic informed consent. After providing electronic informed consent,
      subjects register online and receive the hand held device which measures carbon monoxide (CO)
      which correlates to smoking behavior.

      Baseline questionnaires (demographics, smoking history, and attitude towards smoking) are
      completed, and subjects then self-train to use the breath sensor and smartphone app and
      allows viewing of CO sample values. The app also provides the user with ability to log
      cigarettes, view cigarette consumption trends, view instructional videos, complete
      educational activities and challenges, and engage with a coach.

      Participants will experience the program in 5 phases and then complete the study at
      approximately six months after enrolling,activating device and app.
