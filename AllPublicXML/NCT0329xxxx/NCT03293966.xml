  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The continuity of the medicinal care between the city and the hospital stays a major
      organizational stake and of safety of patients' therapeutic care.This takeover is more
      complex when it concerns pathology needed lots of hospitalization and included the
      intervention of multiple healthcare practionners. This is clearly the case of cancer
      coverage.

      The optimization of the therapeutic suppor in town is based on pharmaceutical advice
      strengthening but also on the pharmaceutical analysis to check the entire treatments'
      prescription and eventual medicinal interactions which ensue from it.That's why it's
      important to have a medicinal conciliation that takes into account all the medecine taken or
      have to be taken by the patient.

      A specific support was developped by nurses , doctors and pharmacist ; it's a care
      coordination card that can be put easely in a pocket by the patient.

      The aim of the study is that this card can be also used as a communication tools by sharing
      the prescription done at the release of hospital by using an IT link (flea datamatrix) for
      the patients Via the use of an IT link (flea datamatrix) for the patients whose pathology is
      complex in term of extra hospital coverage.

      The aim of this strudy is to evaluate with community pharmacists the impact of a new
      information system on the prevalence of dispensing difficulties reported by pharmacies when
      hospitalized patients leave the city. This information system will be based on the care
      coordination card implemented by a secure computer link allowing the use of information on
      treatments prescribed at the end of hospitalization. Patient management is not changed by
      this protocol. Only the information of the pharmacist, which is the object of the study, is
      increased.
