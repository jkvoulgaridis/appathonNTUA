  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, monocentric study whose aim is to assess the quality of life for
      patients who underwent a coloanal continuity reconstruction and to understand the functional
      issues they encounter. This will potentially provide predictive factors identification of bad
      functional outcomes allowing to guide future decisions. Also, it will allow patients to have
      a reinforced follow-up during the year after the reconstruction.

      First of all, an information document will be given to the patients and their consent will be
      collected. Then, they will be registered through the online eCRF (or by FAX) and a study
      number will be given to each patient.

      The study will proceed with 2 stomatherapy consultations at one and six months after coloanal
      continuity reconstruction. Patient care and following up will proceed as usual. The
      stomatherapy consultation will be done by a qualified nurse.

      Before the 1st intervention (proctectomy):

        -  Collect of clinical data and disease history

        -  Quality of life questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and CR29)

        -  Evaluation of LARS score

      After the 1st intervention (proctectomy, at month 1):

      - Quality of life : EORTC-QLC30 and CR-29 questionnaires and Stom-QoL

      Before the 2nd intervention (coloanal continuity reconstruction):

      - Quality of life : EORTC-QLC30 and CR-29 questionnaires and Stom-QoL

      After the 2nd intervention (at month 1, month 3, month 6 and one year):

        -  at 1 and 6 months : clinical exam (stomatherapy consultation) for collect of
           postoperative complications

        -  Quality of life : EORTC-QLC30 and CR-29 questionnaires and LARS score
