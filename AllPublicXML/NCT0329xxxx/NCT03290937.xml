      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of irinotecan hydrochloride when
      given with utomilumab and cetuximab in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as utomilumab
      and cetuximab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving utomilumab, cetuximab, and irinotecan hydrochloride may work
      better in treating patients with colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate maximal tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the
      combination of utomilumab (PF-05082566), cetuximab and irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan)
      (PCI) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to standard therapy. (Dose
      escalation) II. To determine the antitumor activity overall response rate (ORR) by
      immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) of the study regimen
      specifically in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who are RAS-RAF wild type (WT) (Arm
      A) or RAS mutant (Arm B). (Dose expansion)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall safety profile. II. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity. III. To
      evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) biomarkers expressed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC) and tissue samples.

      IV. To characterize serum biomarkers linked to immunomodulation and cytokine release.

      V. To assess markers of T and natural killer (NK) cell phenotype (such as CD3, CD4, CD8,
      FoxP3, CD14, CD33, CCR7, CD45RO, CD16, CD56, CD69, CD25, or VCAM1), TNF alpha, IFN gamma,
      IL10, IL-8, IL-6, IL-4, IL-2, IL-1b, or IL-12p70, CD127, Ki67, eomesodermin, KLRG1, CD14,
      CD33, human leukocyte antigen- D related (HLA-DR), CD16, CD56, granzyme B, CD68, PD-1, CD11c,
      sCD137, and 4-1BB.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan hydrochloride.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and cetuximab IV
      over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 15, and utomilumab IV over 1 hour on day 2. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
