      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of postural exercise program added to
      pulmonary rehabilitation program on quality of life, exercise tolerance and postural
      stability in children with Cystic Fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, multisystem involvement disease. The most
      important cause of mortality in CF is pulmonary complications. Prevention of pulmonary
      complications is only possible with pulmonary rehabilitation. Pulmonary rehabilitation
      methods used in CF are called airway cleaning techniques that include postural drainage,
      breathing techniques and use of devices. These techniques have not been proven to be superior
      to each other. Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) is one of the breathing techniques
      used to remove secretions from the lungs.

      Pulmonary disease progression in CF causes postural impairment and decrease of exercise
      tolerance, which can reduce effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation. The aim of this study
      is to investigate the effects of postural exercise program added to pulmonary rehabilitation
      program on quality of life, exercise tolerance and postural stability in children with CF.

    <description>The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQR) is used to measure the quality of life. This scale is found to be valid and reliable in Turkish. The child version of this test consists 35 questions about physical function, emotional function, social function, body appearance, eating disorders, treatment difficulties, respiratory and digestive symptoms. The total score is calculated between 0-100 and higher scores define the better condition.</description>

    <description>The Balance Master Device- Limits of Stability Test (LOS) is used for to measure the postural stability of children. The LOS consists a 18x60 inch of a pressure platform which connected to a computer system. The patient is asked to stand on the platform barefoot and watch the image which can be moved by trunk movement on the computer the monitor. It is required to move the image towards to target points on the monitor with commands. Reaction time, movement velocity, endpoint excursion, maximum excursion and direction control parameters are calculated during these trunk movements. Reaction time (seconds) parameter is preferred to use for this study.</description>

        <title>Exercise Tolerance</title>
        <description>Modified Shuttle Test (MST) is used to measure the exercise tolerance. The patient is asked to walk until feeling tired between two fixed objects with a 10-meter interval, starting at normal walking speed and increasing the speed at the beginning of each minute. Maximum distance (meters) is measured for the test.</description>

Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT): ACBT involves three phases (Breathing control, chest expansion exercise, and huff coughing). These phases will apply with a sequence to remove secretion. ACBT will apply 1 per a week for 6 weeks.
Postural Exercise: Postural exercise program will include thoracic vertebra mobilization, pectoral stretching, scapula and thoracic extensors strengthening and core stability exercises. Postural exercise program will apply 1 per a week for 6 weeks.</description>

        <description>The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQR) is used to measure the quality of life. This scale is found to be valid and reliable in Turkish. The child version of this test consists 35 questions about physical function, emotional function, social function, body appearance, eating disorders, treatment difficulties, respiratory and digestive symptoms. The total score is calculated between 0-100 and higher scores define the better condition.</description>

The LOS consists a 18x60 inch of a pressure platform which connected to a computer system. The patient is asked to stand on the platform barefoot and watch the image which can be moved by trunk movement on the computer the monitor. It is required to move the image towards to target points on the monitor with commands. Reaction time, movement velocity, endpoint excursion, maximum excursion and direction control parameters are calculated during these trunk movements. Reaction time (seconds) parameter is preferred to use for this study.</description>

The patient is asked to stand on the platform barefoot and watch the image which can be moved by trunk movement on the computer the monitor. It is required to move the image towards to target points on the monitor with commands. Reaction time, movement velocity, endpoint excursion, maximum excursion and direction control parameters are calculated during these trunk movements. Reaction time (seconds) parameter is preferred to use for this study.</description>

Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT): ACBT involves three phases (Breathing control, chest expansion exercise, and huff coughing). These phases will apply with a sequence to remove secretion. ACBT will apply 1 per a week for 6 weeks.
Postural Exercise: Postural exercise program will include thoracic vertebra mobilization, pectoral stretching, scapula and thoracic extensors strengthening and core stability exercises. Postural exercise program will apply 1 per a week for 6 weeks.</description>

Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT): ACBT involves three phases (Breathing control, chest expansion exercise, and huff coughing). These phases will apply with a sequence to remove secretion. ACBT will apply 1 per a week for 6 weeks.
Postural Exercise: Postural exercise program will include thoracic vertebra mobilization, pectoral stretching, scapula and thoracic extensors strengthening and core stability exercises. Postural exercise program will apply 1 per a week for 6 weeks.</description>
