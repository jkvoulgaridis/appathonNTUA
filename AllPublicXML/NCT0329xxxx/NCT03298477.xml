  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, single arm study with consecutive, eligible subject enrollment at
      each site. All subjects will undergo the Endovascular Aneurysm repair procedure with the
      Nellix System.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Nellix System among a wide range
      of physicians and in consecutively enrolled subjects to assess safety and effectiveness
      outcomes. Following appropriate government and ethics committee/IRB approval the Nellix®
      EndoVascular Sealing System will be implanted into eligible patients who are adequately
      informed and have consented to join the study. Enrolled patients will undergo a high
      resolution, contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CT) scan of the relevant
      aortic and aortoiliac vasculature within three months of the scheduled procedure and at
      specified follow-up intervals post-implantation. Follow-up visits will occur at 30 days, 6
      months, and annually to 5 years to assess aneurysm morphology, the status of the implanted
      devices, and relevant laboratory test results.
