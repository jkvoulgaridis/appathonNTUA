  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb multicenter, open-label, non-comparative trial of continuous daily oral
      10 mg of ulipristal acetate (UPA) to evaluate its contraceptive efficacy as the primary
      method of contraception.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study being conducted at 18 centers. The dose of 10 mg was chosen for
      daily continuous use of ulipristal acetate (UPA). The study will enroll approximately 300
      subjects to use the UPA for 6 months (182 days). In addition to contraceptive efficacy,
      safety, overall acceptability of the product, and the number of bleeding/spotting days will
      be assessed.

        To enroll into the clinical trial, potential subjects must:

          1. Be in good general overall health with no chronic medical conditions that result in
             periodic exacerbations that require significant medical care.

          2. Be women between 18 and 35 years inclusive at the enrollment visit.

          3. Have regular menstrual cycles that occur every 21-35 days when not using hormonal
             contraception.

             a. If subject is postpartum or post-abortal, she must have one menstrual bleed prior
             to enrollment.

          4. Be seeking contraception, and willing to use the study drug as the only contraception
             method during their months of study participation.

          5. If using a ring, patch, pill, or implant prior to study treatment, the subject must
             discontinue the active hormone at least 4 days, and no more than 7 days, prior to
             study drug initiation. Note that for combined oral contraceptive users, placebo pills
             are not counted as active hormone.

          6. If using a hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) prior to study treatment, the IUD must
             be removed prior to study drug initiation; removal and study drug initiation can occur
             on the same day, but the subject must refrain from sexual intercourse for 7 days
             following IUD removal.

          7. If using a copper IUD prior to study treatment, the IUD must be removed prior to study
             drug initiation; removal and study drug initiation can occur on the same day. The IUD
             removal and study drug initiation must occur during the first 7 days of a spontaneous
             menses.

          8. If using a non-hormonal contraceptive method (e.g. condoms or withdrawal) prior to
             study treatment, drug initiation should occur within the first 7 days of a spontaneous
             menses.

          9. If the woman has received a long-acting injectable contraceptive (e.g.
             depomedroxyprogesterone acetate) during the 10 months prior to screening, she must
             have resumed cyclic spontaneous menses (two menstrual bleeds) since last injection.

         10. Have a negative urine pregnancy test at the enrollment visit.

         11. Have an intact uterus and both ovaries.

         12. In the opinion of the investigator, be willing and able to follow all study
             requirements, including use of the study product and be willing to record requested

             minutes in a sitting position at the enrollment visit. Hypertensive subjects who are
             treatment controlled and, in the judgment of the investigator, are good candidates
             require a waiver for participation.

         15. Have a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 40 kg/m2.

         16. Be planning to have at least one act of heterosexual vaginal intercourse each month
