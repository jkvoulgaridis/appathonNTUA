  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer with 5 or fewer
      sites of metastases. The trial involves surgery (removal of the prostate), six months of
      hormone therapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy to the sites of metastasis.

      This is a single arm Phase II clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed M1a,b prostate
      cancer and 1-5 radiographically visible metastases treated with radical prostatectomy (and
      post-operative fractionated radiotherapy for pT 3a, pN1, or positive margins), metastasis
      directed SBRT, and complete ADT with LHRH analog leuprolide, abiraterone acetate with
      prednisone, and apalutamide (ARN-509) for a total of six months of systemic therapy. The
      primary endpoint of our study is the percent of patients achieving a serum PSA of &lt;0.05 ng/mL
      six months after recovery of serum testosterone.

    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This uses the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire. It assesses patient function in four domains: Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being, which is further supplemented by 12 site specific items to assess for prostate related symptoms. Items are rated on a 0 to 4 Likert type scale and combined to produce subscale scores for each domain and a global score, the higher the score, the better the quality of life. Range from 0-150 . Data will be aggregated per patient and over time.</description>

    <description>CTCAE v4 criteria are a set of criteria for the standardized classification of adverse effects cancer therapy. The CTCAE system is a product of the US National Cancer Institute. The criteria are assessed by physician. The grades range from 0 to 5 (higher is worse). Data will be aggregated per patient and over time and classified by organ system (e.g., genitourinary, gastrointestinal, etc).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma (primary small cell carcinoma of
             the prostate is not allowed, however adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine
             differentiation is allowed)

          2. Age 18

          3. Presence of 1-5 visible metastases (by NaF PET-CT or PSMA PET-CT including diagnostic
             CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis)

                  example, MRI) must also be consistent with metastatic disease (unless PSMA PET-CT
                  was used as initial staging).

             metastases, ADT,

          5. Total testosterone &gt;200 ng/dL prior to ADT (optimal time to measure total testosterone

          6. Primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate (prostate adenocarcinoma with
             neuroendocrine differentiation is allowed)

          7. Inflammatory bowel disease or active collagen vascular disease

          8. History of any of the following:

               1. Seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (e.g. prior stroke
                  within 1year to randomization, brain arteriovenous malformation, Schwannoma,
                  meningioma, or other benign CNS or meningeal disease which may require treatment
                  with surgery or radiation therapy)

               1. Uncontrolled hypertension

               2. Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption

               3. Active infection (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral hepatitis)

               4. Any chronic medical condition requiring a higher dose of corticosteroid than 10
                  mg prednisone/prednisolone once daily

               5. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude
                  participation in this study

               6. Concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers. (If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be
                  co-administered, abiraterone acetate dose frequency will be adjusted).

               7. Treatment with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index. If an
                  alternative treatment cannot be used, a dose reduction of the CYP2D6 substrate
                  may be considered.

               8. Baseline severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class B &amp; C)
