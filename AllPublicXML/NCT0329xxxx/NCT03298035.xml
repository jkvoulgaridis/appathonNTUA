  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nasal intermittent positive pressure
      ventilation (NIPPV) reduces the need for endotracheal intubation in very low birth weight
      infants with persistent apnea who fail nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants born at &lt; 30 weeks gestational age who develop clinically significant apnea
             while on NCPAP &gt; 6cm H2O or whose team is considering intubation due to apnea.
             Consider clinically significant apnea as 1 or more events treated with bag-mask
             ventilation or 3 episodes of apnea requiring stimulation within 1 hour.

          -  Infants on maximum caffeine therapy (10mg/kg/day)
