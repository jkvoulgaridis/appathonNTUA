    <textblock>
      Enrollment of subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris.

      Co-Primary efficacy endpoints included:

        -  Absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory lesion counts on the face

        -  Absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non-inflammatory lesion counts on the
           face

        -  Proportion of subjects with a clinical response of &quot;success&quot; at Week 12 for lesions on
           the face. Success based on IGA is defined as an IGA score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost
           clear) at Week 12 with at least a 2-grade reduction from Baseline.

      Enrollment of subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris. Acne lesions of any
      severity on the chest and/or back (including shoulders) were enrolled provided they had mild
      to moderate acne on the face. During the 12-week treatment period subjects used the study
      product twice daily with approximately 12 hours between applications. Subjects were
      instructed to treat the entire face (and chest/back including shoulders, if applicable).

      Co-Primary efficacy endpoints included:

        -  Absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory lesion counts on the face

        -  Absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non-inflammatory lesion counts on the
           face

        -  Proportion of subjects with a clinical response of &quot;success&quot; at Week 12 for lesions on
           the face. Success based on IGA is defined as an IGA score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost
           clear) at Week 12 with at least a 2-grade reduction from Baseline.

      The primary safety endpoint was treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Other safety
      variables included local cutaneous tolerance evaluation (dryness, non-lesional erythema,
      peeling, stinging, burning, and itching) and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate).
      Urine pregnancy tests were performed at Baseline and at every visit through Week 12 for all
      female subjects. A physical examination was performed at the Baseline Visit.
