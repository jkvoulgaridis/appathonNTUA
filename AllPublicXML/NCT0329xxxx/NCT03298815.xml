      This is a randomized (to each eye, within patient), double-blinded, placebo-controlled study
      of the efficacy of Processed Amniotic Fluid (pAF) in patients with hematologic malignancies
      who have undergone Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and are
      diagnosed with Chronic Graft Verses Host Disease of the eye.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed within 3 years after hematopoietic stem cell transplant for any
             disease, with any graft and any conditioning regimen with at least one of the
             following:

               1. Dry eye symptoms partially affecting (requiring lubricant drops &gt; 3 x per day or
                  punctal plugs) or significantly affecting (special eyeware to relieve pain)
                  activities of daily living (ADL)

               2. Unable to work because of ocular symptoms

               3. Loss of vision due to keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS)

          -  Patients may be using bilateral scleral lenses and/or bilateral punctal plugs at the
             time of accrual.

          -  Patients who are 18 years of age or older.

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have any other reversible cause for dry eye at the time of accrual.

          -  More than 2 lines of therapy beyond corticosteroids with or without calcineurin
             inhibitors or sirolimus

          -  Relapsed malignancy after transplantation

          -  A difference in dryness between both eyes of more than 2 points of the grading
             provided by the International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) 2007 report

          -  Patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while participating in the study.
             - Patients who are not willing to discontinue the use of any eye drops, with the
             exception of non-medicated lubricant eye drops (artificial tears). All eye drops
             (excluding non-medicated lubricant eye drops) must be stopped at least seven days
             before treatment with pAF.
