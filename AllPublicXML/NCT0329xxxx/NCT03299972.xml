    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups trial is to
      investigate the effects of 12 weeks resistance exercise and whey protein supplementation on
      energy metabolism, markers of appetite, inflammation and hormonal response and body
      composition and strength and functional performance.

      Generally healthy, retired men aged 60-80 years will be recruited (n = 52 in total, n = 13
      per group). Participants will be randomised to either: a) control group, b) whey protein
      supplement group, c) resistance exercise + control group or d) resistance exercise + whey
      protein supplementation group.

      With demographics indicating that the world's population aged &gt;60 years will increase from
      600 million reported in 2000, to &gt;2 billion by 2050, there is an increasing interest in
      health issues related to ageing. One area of particular interest is sarcopenia, defined as
      the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength and physical function as a consequence of
      ageing. Sarcopenia has been associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease, poor
      metabolic and cognitive function, reduced quality of life and early mortality. Studies have
      reported beneficial effects of both resistance exercise and increasing protein intake
      independently and in combination on markers of sarcopenia (mostly increases in muscle mass,
      strength and physical function). However, little is known about the effects of combined
      intervention on energy metabolism, appetite and cognitive and endocrine function. This
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups trial will investigate these,
      alongside assessing the effects of combined intervention on total lean tissue mass, muscular
      strength and functional performance.
