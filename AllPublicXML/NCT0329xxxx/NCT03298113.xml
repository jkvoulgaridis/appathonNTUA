      The purpose of the clinical study is to assess the effects of 3M Cavilon Advanced Skin
      Protectant in comparison to different local IAD care regimes in hospitals (IAD:
      incontinence-associated dermatitis). IAD is a skin damage caused by exposure to moisture and
      irritants such as urine and/or stool. The clinical appearance ranges from painful erythema to
      severe erosion and denudation/skin loss with or without secondary infection. The durable,
      long lasting skin protectant (3M study device) is formulated to attach to moist or wet skin
      surfaces (i.e., superficial, partial thickness skin loss) to provide better protection
      against moisture and irritants under challenging conditions.

    <description>Number and percentage of patients completely healed (skin free of any IAD signs, including erythema, based on a structured skin assessment according to the GLOBIAD criteria (GLOBIAD: Ghent Global IAD Categorization Tool)
Note: Due to the exploratory design no formal a priori hypothesis was defined for this study. The outcome measure type for all endpoints is &quot;other pre-specified&quot;. The effects were analyzed using descriptive statistics. No confirmatory statements can be made about the effects and no comparative statements are possible. The sponsor decided to early terminate the study after 20 evaluable patients for the intention-to-treat analysis. Reason for the early termination was the slow enrollment rate of patients and overall short length of stay in hospital.</description>

Note: One patient in the group treated with Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant stayed only one day in the study due to an unrelated Severe Adverse Event at night. This had an impact on the product cost calculation. The application interval for Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant in this study was three days (D1, D4, D7, D10, D13, D16, D19) , while the use of IAD products for standard hospital care was based on manufacturer recommendations, which could correspond to a daily interval with multiple applications.</description>

    <description>Pain scores related to clean up incontinence episode for IAD 1A patients. The table details the reduction in pain experienced by subjects able to report their last recorded cleaning event relative to baseline. More extreme negative values denote a larger reduction in pain. For cleansing, IAD 1A patients treated with Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant saw no change in pain due to having no pain reported at baseline nor last visit.
Note: For this study the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale was used for patients able to report pain. Faces with different expressions from smiling to crying facilitated the communication as anchor for pain intensity scale (scores: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), with higher score indicating more pain.</description>

The sponsor decided to early terminate the study after 20 evaluable patients for the intention-to-treat analysis.

        <description>Pain scores related to clean up incontinence episode for IAD 1A patients. The table details the reduction in pain experienced by subjects able to report their last recorded cleaning event relative to baseline. More extreme negative values denote a larger reduction in pain. For cleansing, IAD 1A patients treated with Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant saw no change in pain due to having no pain reported at baseline nor last visit.
Note: For this study the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale was used for patients able to report pain. Faces with different expressions from smiling to crying facilitated the communication as anchor for pain intensity scale (scores: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), with higher score indicating more pain.</description>

          <title>Pain Related to Product Application: IAD 2A</title>
          <description>Pain scores related to application of skin protectants for IAD 2A patients (Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale). The table details the reduction in pain experienced by subjects able to report at their last recorded application event relative to baseline. More extreme negative values denote a larger reduction in pain.
Note: For this study the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale was used for patient able to report pain. Faces with different expressions from smiling to crying facilitated the communication as anchor for pain intensity scale (scores: 0, 2 , 4, 6, 8, 10), with higher score indicating more pain.</description>
          <population>Analysis was done based on IAD 2A population at start of study (IAD 2A: skin loss without clinical signs of infection) Note: One patient in the Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant group and one patient in the IAD Hospital Standard care group were not able to report pain.</population>
