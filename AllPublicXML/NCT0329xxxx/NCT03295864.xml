  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the value of multifrequency tympanometry between patients
      with surgical indication of treatment for a Chiari type I malformation and healthy
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of Chiari type I malformation in population is between 0.1% and 0.5%. Chiari type
      I malformation is responsive in perturbation of the cerebro spinal fluid flow at the
      cranio-cervical junction. Those perturbations caused headaches, and various otological
      symptoms (dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, nystagmus, hypoacousis…). The surgical treatment
      consists in an occipital craniotomy to restore the cerebro spinal fluid flow at the
      cranio-cervical junction. Symptoms are due to increasing of the pressure in the cerebellar
      fossa. 81% of the patients with Chiari type 1 malformation suffer of sub clinical otological
      perturbations especially alteration of the vestibular test.

      In the literature, hearing performance could be normalized after posterior fossa
      decompression. Furthermore, the multifrequency tympanometry measurement and particularly the
      width of conductance tympanograms at 2 kHz shows that variations of the cerebro spinal fluid
      pressure have consequences on the pressure of the perilymph.

      Investigator's hypothesis is that tympanometry (conductance) could be an effective test to
      show the variation of the cerebro spinal fluid pressure.
