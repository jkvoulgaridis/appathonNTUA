  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-children phase 1 trial using indoximod, an inhibitor of the immune
      &quot;checkpoint&quot; pathway indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), in combination with
      temozolomide-based therapy to treat pediatric brain tumors. Using a preclinical glioblastoma
      model, it was recently shown that adding IDO-blocking drugs to temozolomide plus radiation
      significantly enhanced survival by driving a vigorous, tumordirected inflammatory response.
      This data provided the rationale for the companion adult phase 1 trial using indoximod
      (IND#120813) plus temozolomide to treat adults with glioblastoma, which is currently open
      (NCT02052648). The goal of this pediatric study is to bring IDO-based immunotherapy into the
      clinic for children with brain tumors. This study will provide a foundation for future
      pediatric trials testing indoximod combined with radiation and temozolomide in the up-front
      setting for patients with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors.
