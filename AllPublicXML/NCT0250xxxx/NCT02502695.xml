  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study for participants who have been diagnosed with lung cancer and are
      receiving VATS (Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) lobectomy or segmentectomy. The overall
      objective of this study is to develop a database to collect data on participants who are
      undergoing VATS lobectomy or segmentectomy for lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This database will be used as for quality improvement purposes. Furthermore, the database
      will help in collecting data in an organized fashion, which will help the investigators learn
      more about the details of the workup performed prior to the surgery, during the surgery,
      peri-operative management and early follow-up. The investigators hope that this database will
      help to determine a common guideline to perform VATS lobectomy or segmentectomy. By creating
      a common guideline for future treatment of VATS patients, the investigators predict the
      efficiency of the process will increase significantly without decreasing, and perhaps even
      improving, the quality of the procedure.

    <description>Data to be collected will include demographic data and information about the pre-operative workup, surgical procedure, postoperative course and early discharge course for these patients.
After the last patient completes the 30-day post surgery follow-up, the investigators will determine a set of best practices to implement at each of the sites for the quality improvement initiative. During the assessment period, no patients will be enrolled into the study.</description>
