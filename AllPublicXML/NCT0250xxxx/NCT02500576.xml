  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving pembrolizumab with standard
      chemotherapy, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and aldesleukin works in treating
      patients with melanoma that has spread to other areas of the body. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving an infusion of TIL, or white blood cells, may help
      stimulate the immune system to help kill more cells. Aldesleukin may also stimulate the white
      blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Giving pembrolizumab together with standard chemotherapy,
      TIL, and high- or low-dose aldesleukin may help stop the melanoma from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the overall response rates of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combined with
      lymphodepletion, TIL and high or low dose aldesleukin (interleukin-2) therapy in patients
      with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison of progression free survival between the treatment arms. II. Comparison of
      overall survival between the treatment arms. III. Comparison of deep tumor responses (defined
      as over 60% reduction in tumor burden) between the treatment arms as per Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      IV. Number of complete responses in both treatment arms. V. Safety evaluations by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identification of biomarkers predictive of treatment response or failure through
      immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, gene expression changes as assessed by NanoString
      codeset, neo-antigen identification and complementary determining region (CDR)3 sequencing
      from blood and tumor samples acquired from baseline and on-treatment samples.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising of cyclophosphamide
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -7 and -6 followed by fludarabine phosphate IV
      piggyback (IVPB) over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1. Patients also receive therapeutic tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes IV over 15-60 minutes on day 0 followed by high-dose aldesleukin IV
      over 15 minutes every 8-16 hours for up to 15 doses on days 1-5. Beginning between 21-28 days
      after TIL infusion, patients receive maintenance therapy comprising of pembrolizumab IV over
      30 minutes every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising of
      cyclophosphamide, fludarabine phosphate, and therapeutic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as in
      Arm I, followed approximately 6 hours later by low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) once
      per day (QD) for 14 days. Patients also receive pembrolizumab as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

             exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis; subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to initiation of lymphodepletion

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months
             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease; subjects with
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule;
             subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections
             would not be excluded from the study; subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone
             replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study; subjects with
             hypophysitis stable on physiologic dose of steroid will not be excluded from the study

          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or has a history of non-infectious
             pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment

          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies)

          -  Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B virus HBsAg surface protein antigen
             [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA]
             [qualitative] is detected)

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment

          -  Any active systemic infections requiring intravenous antibiotics, coagulation
             disorders or other major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or
             immune system, such as abnormal stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease; PI or
             his designee shall make the final determination regarding appropriateness of
             enrollment
