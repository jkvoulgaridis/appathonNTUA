  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with Stage IB/II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have
      undergone surgical resection (lobectomy or pneumonectomy) with or without adjuvant
      chemotherapy will be treated with pembrolizumab or placebo. The primary study hypothesis is
      that pembrolizumab will provide improved disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo.

             study treatment

          -  Female participants who are breast feeding must discontinue nursing prior to the first

             treatment

          -  Male participants must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first infusion of study treatment through 120 days after the last infusion of
             study treatment

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years

          -  History of a hematologic or primary solid tumor malignancy, unless in remission for at
             least 5 years with the exception of pT1-2 prostatic cancer Gleason score &lt; 6,
