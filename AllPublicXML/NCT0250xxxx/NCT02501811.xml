  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess
      feasibility, safety, and effect of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) and c-kit+ cells both alone and in combination (Combo), compared to placebo (cell-free
      Plasmalyte-A medium) as well as each other, administered by transendocardial injection in
      subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the feasibility,
      safety, and effect of Combo, MSCs alone, and c-kit+ cells alone compared with placebo as well
      as each other in subjects with heart failure of ischemic etiology. Following a successful
      lead-in phase, a total of one hundred forty-four (144) subjects will be randomized (1:1:1:1)
      to receive Combo, MSCs, c-kit+ cells, or placebo. After randomization, baseline imaging,
      relevant harvest procedures, and study product injection, subjects will be followed up at 1
      day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study product injection. All
      subjects will receive study product injection (cells or placebo) using the NOGA® XP Mapping
      and Navigation System. Subjects will have delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DEMRI)
      scans to assess scar size and LV function and structure at baseline and at 6 and 12 months
      post study product administration. All endpoints will be assessed at the 6 and 12 month
      visits which will occur 180 ±30 days and 365 ±30 days respectively from the day of study
      product injection (Day 0). For the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations,
      the Investigators will utilize an &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; study population, however an as
      treated analysis will also be conducted.

          6. Be a candidate for cardiac catheterization

          7. Have NYHA class I, II, or III heart failure symptoms

          8. If a female of childbearing potential, be willing to use one form of birth control for

             bypass grafting (CABG) procedure, and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for
             the treatment of ischemic and/or valvular heart disease. Subjects who require or
             undergo PCI should undergo these procedures a minimum of 3 months in advance of
             randomization. Subjects who require or undergo CABG should undergo these procedures a
             minimum of 4 months in advance of randomization. In addition, subjects who develop a
             need for revascularization following enrollment should undergo revascularization
             without delay. Indication for imminent heart transplantation is defined as a high
             likelihood of transplant prior to collection of the 12 month study endpoint.
             Candidates cannot be UNOS status 1A or 1B, and they must have documented low
