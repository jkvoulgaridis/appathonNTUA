      This phase II trial studies how well panobinostat, gemcitabine hydrochloride, busulfan, and
      melphalan before stem cell transplant work in treating patients with multiple myeloma that
      does not respond to treatment (refractory) or has returned (relapsed). Panobinostat may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      high-dose chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, busulfan, and melphalan, before a
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body and
      helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to
      grow. Previously collected stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the
      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with refractory or relapsed
      myeloma receiving panobinostat/gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine)/busulfan/melphalan
      (panobinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel) with autologous stem-cell transplant, either as a first or a
      salvage stem-cell transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate. II. To determine the overall survival (OS).
      III. To determine the CR + very good partial remission (VGPR) rate. IV. To determine the
      overall response rate (ORR). V. To determine minimal residual disease posttransplant,
      measured by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC).

      VI. To describe the toxicity profile of panobinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel. VII. To analyze the
      predictive value of pretransplant levels in myeloma cells of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1),
      inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u), sliced XBP1 (XPB1s), XBP1u/XPBs
      ratio and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (Myc), by analyzing their
      correlation with CR, VGPR+CR and response rate (RR).

      VIII. To study the prognostic effect of pretransplant levels in myeloma cells of XBP1, IRE1,
      XBP1u, XPB1s, XBP1u/XPBs ratio and Myc, by analyzing their correlation with PFS and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panobinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -9 to -2, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days -8 and -3, busulfan IV over 3 hours on
      days -8 to -5, and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -3 and -2. Patients then undergo
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, 100 days, 6 months,
      1 year, and then every 3-6 months for at least 2 years.
