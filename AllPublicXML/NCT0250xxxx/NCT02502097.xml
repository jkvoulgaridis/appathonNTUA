      Prior to Amendment 3, participants were randomized to receive either placebo twice daily
      (BID) for 14 days during Period 1 followed by gefapixant 50 mg BID for 10 days then
      gefapixant 150 mg BID for 4 days BID during Period 2; or gefapixant 50 mg BID for 10 days
      then gefapixant 150 mg BID for 4 days during Period 1, followed by placebo BID for 14 days
      during Period 2. Each period was separated by a 14 to 21-day washout period.

      During Amendment 3, participants were randomized to receive either placebo BID for 14 days
      during Period 1 followed by gefapixant 50 mg BID for 14 days during Period 2; or gefapixant
      50 mg BID for 14 days during Period 1, followed by placebo BID for 14 days during Period 2.
      Each period was separated by a 14 to 21-day washout period.
