      This is an open-label clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of
      a combination therapy to treat gastrointestinal problems in children with autism spectrum
      disorders.

      It involves a combination therapy including beneficial bacteria.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptom Responsiveness Scale (GSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS is a measure of gastrointestinal symptoms. It includes 15 questions, rated on a Likert scale of 1-7, from no symptoms to severe symptoms, respectively (i.e., higher is worse). We report an average score for all 15 questions, so the possible range for the average score is also 1-7.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Global Impressions-Revised (PGI-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-R is a rating of change of 18 autism symptoms compared to baseline, with each symptom rated on a Likert scale from -3 (much worse) to zero (no change) to +3 (much better). We report the average change of the 18 symptoms, so the possible range is from -3 to +3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Blood Safety Markers (Assessment of Blood Chemistry Panel and Complete Blood Count)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who had a clinically significant change in their blood safety markers (comprehensive metabolic panel including kidney/liver function and complete blood count with differential)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CARS is an assessment of 15 autism-related symptoms. Each item is scored on a scale of 1 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms), and the scores for each symptom are summed to obtain a total score. So, the possible scores range from 15 to 60, with a higher score indicating greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The SRS is an assessment of social skills based on 65 items, where each item is scored on a range of 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The total score is a sum of the individual scores, so the total possible range is from 0 to 195, with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Sensory Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Sensory Profile is an assessment of sensory problems.
However, the data on this scale was not collected due to administrative error.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 18 weeks (8 weeks after treatment stopped)</time_frame>
    <description>The VABS is an assessment of adaptive behaviors, and we analyzed it to determine the developmental age of the participants, with possible scores ranging from 0 years to 21 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Stool Record (DSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The DSR is a record of the type of stool that a participant had each day, using the Bristol Stool Form which ranges from 1 (very hard) to 7 (liquid). We then analyzed the data as % days of abnormal stools over a 14 day period, where an abnormal stool is defined as an unusually hard stool (types 1-2), unusually soft stool (types 6-7), or no stool that day. So, the possible range of % days of abnormal stools is from 0% to 100%, with a higher score indicating a more severe problem.</description>

          <title>Gastrointestinal Symptom Responsiveness Scale (GSRS)</title>
          <description>The GSRS is a measure of gastrointestinal symptoms. It includes 15 questions, rated on a Likert scale of 1-7, from no symptoms to severe symptoms, respectively (i.e., higher is worse). We report an average score for all 15 questions, so the possible range for the average score is also 1-7.</description>
          <population>We report the data on all participants, regardless of how the initial dose of bacteria was administered (oral or rectal).</population>

        <title>Daily Stool Record (DSR)</title>
        <description>The DSR is a record of the type of stool that a participant had each day, using the Bristol Stool Form which ranges from 1 (very hard) to 7 (liquid). We then analyzed the data as % days of abnormal stools over a 14 day period, where an abnormal stool is defined as an unusually hard stool (types 1-2), unusually soft stool (types 6-7), or no stool that day. So, the possible range of % days of abnormal stools is from 0% to 100%, with a higher score indicating a more severe problem.</description>

          <title>All Groups</title>
          <description>We report the data on 18 participants, regardless of how the initial dose of bacteria was administered. The reason is that all but one of the adverse events occurred during the vancomycin phase, which was common to both groups, and occurred before the randomization to receive the microbiota either orally or rectally. The only exception is one participant who had initial nausea/vomiting upon receiving the initial oral dose of microbiota, and they were switched from the oral group to the rectal group, which they tolerated without incident. There were no adverse effects from the microbiota.</description>
