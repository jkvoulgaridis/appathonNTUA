  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an observational crossover study. The investigators aim to
      recruit 50 participants with severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) requiring intracranial
      pressure (ICP) monitoring during their stay at the Neuro Trauma ICU at the R Adams Cowley
      Shock Trauma Center.

      Overall, participants will be monitored, on average, for approximately 6-8 hours during the
      study period. The investigators do not anticipate the need for prolonged monitoring during
      the duration of their hospital stay or post hospital period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant at admission will initially receive a primary mode of mechanical ventilation
      as determined by the attending trauma intensivists. 12-18 hours after recruitment, continuous
      monitoring of participants' ICP and hemodynamic status will commence to collect participants'
      baseline data for 30 minutes.

      Participants will then undergo low tidal volume mechanical ventilation (LOTV), serving as a
      control mode of ventilation, for 2 hours prior to switching back to the primary mode of
      ventilation for 30 minutes. Next, patients will be placed on Airway Pressure Release
      Ventilation (APRV) for 2 hours. While receiving APRV, participants Intracranial pressure and
      hemodynamic status will be continuously monitored and recorded for comparison and analysis.
      After 2 hours of APRV, patients will be switched back to their previous mode of ventilation
      and more data collected for another 30 minutes.

    <description>Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a mode of mechanical ventilation that switches between high (PHigh) and low (PLow) continuous positive airway pressure while allowing spontaneous breathing at both phases. Alveolar recruitment and oxygenation occur during PHigh whereas ventilation occurs during brief releases to PLow.</description>

    <description>After enrollment and collection of baseline Intracranial pressure and hemodynamic status for 30 minutes the participants will undergo low tidal volume mechanical ventilation (LOTV), serving as a control mode of ventilation. LOTV is most commonly used for trauma patients with lung injury. LOTV provides oxygen in smaller amounts, without overstretching the lungs</description>

            <description>Participants first were maintained on Low Tidal Volume Ventilation for two hours. Then there was a washout period of 30 minutes. After this washout period, they were maintained on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation for two hours.
Each participant will serve as his/her own control using our observational crossover study comparing the effects of Airway Pressure Release Ventilation and Low Tidal Volume Ventilation on patient intracranial pressure and hemodynamic values.
Airway Pressure Release Ventilation: Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a mode of mechanical ventilation that switches between high (PHigh) and low (PLow) continuous positive airway pressure while allowing spontaneous breathing at both phases. Alveolar recruitment and oxygenation occur during PHigh whereas ventilation occurs during brief releases to PLow.</description>
