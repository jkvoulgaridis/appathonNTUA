  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the outcomes of a traditional, exercise-based rehabilitation
      intervention for chronic low back pain with the outcomes achieved by combining a traditional
      intervention with adjunct therapy delivered using an interactive gaming-based system for
      home-based therapy.

      The study relies upon the Valedo system by Hocoma AG to implement an interactive gaming-based
      intervention (i.e. subjects receive part of their physical therapy by playing interactive
      video games). The system is similar to consumer electronics products for interactive gaming
      that track the subject's movements using body-worn sensors. The FDA has determined that the
      Valedo system is a 510(K) exempt device under the product code ION (i.e. exerciser,
      non-measuring device for Physical Medicine). In the study, subjects with non-specific chronic
      low back pain are randomized using a block design to one of two groups: group 1 receives
      usual care alone; group 2 receives an exercise-based rehabilitation intervention using
      interactive gaming in addition to usual care. Clinical assessments are performed at baseline
      and again 4 weeks and 8 weeks after baseline measures are gathered.

    <measure>Visual Analogue Pain Scale at 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in Visual Analogue Pain Scale score at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to indicate their pain level using a visual analog scale, namely they are asked to choose the position on a horizontal line - drawn on a piece of paper - that corresponds to the pain level that they experience. The line is about 10 cm long and is divided into 10 intervals of equal length referred to as units. The minimum value on the scale is zero (meaning no pain). The maximum value on the scale is ten (meaning maximum ever experienced pain).</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire at 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in disability score at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to fill in a questionnaire inquiring about how their pain interferes with their activities of daily living. Accordingly, they receive a disability score ranging between 0 and 100%. A score between 0 and 20% indicates minimal disability; a score between 21 and 40% indicates moderate disability; a score between 41 and 60% indicates severe disability; a score between 61 and 80% indicates that pain impinges on all aspects of the patient's life; and score between 81 and 100% indicates that the subject is bed-bound.</description>

    <description>The SF36 is a clinical outcome measure based on the administration of a questionnaire inquiring about the quality of life and health status of the subject. It consists of eight normalized (so that they have the some weight) scores related to vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. The score is provide as units on a scale from 0 to 100.</description>

        <description>Subjects are asked to fill in a questionnaire inquiring about how their pain interferes with their activities of daily living. Accordingly, they receive a disability score ranging between 0 and 100%. A score between 0 and 20% indicates minimal disability; a score between 21 and 40% indicates moderate disability; a score between 41 and 60% indicates severe disability; a score between 61 and 80% indicates that pain impinges on all aspects of the patient's life; and score between 81 and 100% indicates that the subject is bed-bound.</description>

A score between 0 and 20% indicates minimal disability; a score between 21 and 40% indicates moderate disability; a score between 41 and 60% indicates severe disability; a score between 61 and 80% indicates that pain impinges on all aspects of the patient's life; and score between 81 and 100% indicates that the subject is bed-bound.</description>
