    <textblock>
      Treatment protocol to see if people with hepatitis C (HCV) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      who are treated with Harvoni for 12 weeks have improvements in their kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators hypothesize that patients with early stage (1-3) CKD caused by HCV
      infection will have significantly improved proteinuria and eGFR after viral eradication with
      12 weeks of treatment Harvoni (LDV/SOF). This trial data will serve as the basis to support
      further study of LDV/SOF in patients with early CKD. Slowing progression of CKD is a critical
      goal, as the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD and end stage renal disease
      (ESRD) places significant health burden on patients and tremendous costs on our health-care
      system.

        <title>Mean Time in Weeks to Maximum Reduction in Proteinuria</title>
        <description>This outcome evaluated all post-baseline proteinuria values through the 52 week followup, and determined which demonstrated the greatest negative change (reduction) from baseline. We then calculate the mean time to maximum reduction of proteinuria.</description>
        <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Because 3 patients had rising proteinuria they are not included in this analysis, which only looks at the mean time to reduction in proteinuria in the 7 patients who had any reductions in proteinuria. This includes the 3 patients who had -25% change in proteinuria and 4 patients who had smaller negative changes (reductions) in proteinuria.</population>
