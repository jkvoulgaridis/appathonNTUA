             18 and 55 years or between the ages of 60 and 85 years, inclusive.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 32 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs) at
             Screening.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject or a legally acceptable representative has been informed of all pertinent
             aspects of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male subjects able to father children
             who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as
             outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days after
             the last dose of investigational product.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle Guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             Investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of
             the study.

          -  Any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within
             the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

          <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug up to the follow up visit (up to 47 days in Part A, 29 days in Part B and C), that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

          <title>Part B and C: Number of Participants With Positive Response on Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) on Day 19</title>
          <description>C-SSRS is a questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced following: completed suicide; suicide attempt (response of &quot;Yes&quot; on &quot;actual attempt&quot;); preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (&quot;Yes&quot; on &quot;preparatory acts or behavior&quot;, &quot;aborted attempt&quot; or &quot;interrupted attempt&quot;), suicidal ideation (&quot;Yes&quot; on &quot;wish to be dead&quot;, &quot;non-specific active suicidal thoughts&quot;, &quot;active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent, any self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent). In this outcome, number of participants with positive response (response of &quot;yes&quot;) to suicidal behavior, ideation or any self-injurious behavior, at Day 19 were reported.</description>

        <title>Part C: Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2) of PF-06751979 at Day 14</title>
        <description>Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration of PF-06751979 to decrease by one half of its original concentration.</description>
        <time_frame>predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hour post dose on Day 14</time_frame>
        <population>The PK parameter population included all enrolled participants who had at least 1 dose of PF-06751979 and at least 1 of the PK parameters of interest measured.
