  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) impacts negatively on the balance and strength
      of patients. Several studies have shown that acute exacerbations (AEs) decrease, pulmonary
      function and survival of COPD patients, and there are a lot of physiotherapy interventions to
      improve it during the hospital stay.

      The objective of the present study is to examine the effects of a physical therapy program on
      balance and strength in COPD patients hospitalized due to acute exacerbation.

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. It is a progressive disease, characterized by lung function impairment with airway
      obstruction.

      Patients with COPD suffer exacerbations; the frequency of these exacerbations increases with
      the severity of the disease. It has been previously shown that the level of health-related
      quality of life of COPD subjects deteriorates considerably with increasing severity of
      disease and that the deterioration is linearly related to a decrease in FEV1 % predicted
      normal values.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower limb strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Lower limb strength was evaluated by a dynamometer. The assessor placed the limb to be examined in the starting position (a knee flexion of 90º) and instructed each participant to hold the limb in that position against the increasing resistance applied to it by the examiner. During each test the assessor counted out loud for seconds and at the end of the test period advised the participant to relax the limb.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Balance was evaluated by the one-leg standing balance test, that measured the time that the patient balance on one leg as long as possible. We asked the subject being tested to choose a leg to stand on (whichever he felt more comfortable with), flex the opposite knee allowing the foot to clear the floor, and balance on one leg as long as possible</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory function</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is regarded as the gold standard measure of respiratory function. The indicators of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) will be tested. Spirometry will be performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) will be used to evaluate psychological status. HADS is a 14-items self-report questionnaire designed to detect psychological morbidity in medically ill patients. It contains depression and anxiety subscales, each with scores ranging from 0 to 21.</description>

    <description>patients will be involved in the Physiotherapy program 1. The program included 15 minutes of deep breathing exercises and 20-30 minutes of limb exercises. The exercises included global active range of motion (ROM) exercises and muscle strengthening like upper and lower limbs flexion-extension do single-leg stance, and sit to stand exercises added to standard treatment.</description>

    <description>The standard medical treatment consists on:
Inhaled bronchodilators: Short acting inhaled β2 agonists ( salbutamol and terbutaline) and anticholinergic agents (ipratropium and oxitropium bromide).
Glucocorticoids:
Inhaled glucocorticoids including beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone acetonide, depending on the expert criteria.
- Antibiotics: The antibiotics were administered according to the GOLD criteria including the β‐lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones.</description>
