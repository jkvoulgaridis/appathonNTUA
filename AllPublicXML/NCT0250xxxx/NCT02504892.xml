    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Research has shown that the drug everolimus can stop cancer cells from growing. It is
      approved for people with advanced kidney cancer. Researchers want to see if it also helps
      people with two other types of kidney cancer.

      Objective:

      - To see if everolimus is safe and effective in people with Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome
      (BHD)-associated kidney cancer or sporadic (nonfamilial) chromophobe renal cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - People ages 18 and over with BHD-associated kidney cancer or advanced sporadic chromophobe
      renal cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.

        -  Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. They will lie in
           a machine that takes pictures of their chest/abdomen/pelvis.

        -  They may also be screened with:

        -  Another scan, of the brain or neck.

        -  Bone scan.

        -  Positron emission tomography scan with fludeoxyglucose (FDG-PET).

        -  Heart and lung tests.

        -  Tests for hepatitis.

        -  Participants will take a tablet once a day by mouth for up to a year. They will keep a
           diary of when they take the tablet and any symptoms.

        -  During the study, participants will have physical exams and urine and blood tests. They
           will have scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. They may have FDG-PET and bone scans.

        -  Participants will have tests for hepatitis and may have a tumor sample taken.

        -  Participants will have a follow-up visit 4-5 weeks finishing taking the drug. They will
           have a physical exam and blood tests. They may have scans and/or hepatitis tests.

        -  Participants will be called about every 3-6 months after the study ends to see how they
           are doing

      Background:

        -  Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) is a hereditary cancer syndrome with clinical manifestations
           including cutaneous fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts/pneumothorax, and renal cell carcinoma
           (RCC). RCC occurs in approximately 30% of patients with BHD. It presents at an early age
           of onset and is commonly bilateral and multifocal.

        -  Tumors associated with BHD can have variable histology, however approximately 85% of
           these tumors have a chromophobe component (either alone or part of a hybrid tumor mixed
           with elements of oncocytoma).

        -  The current management includes surgical resection with partial nephrectomy when tumors
           reach 3 cm. While significant morbidity can be associated with repeat, partial
           nephrectomy with this approach, most patients can maintain renal function and do not
           develop systemic disease. There are no proven systemic therapy options for BHD to date.

        -  Germline mutations in the gene Folliculin (FLCN) are the genetic hallmark of BHD and can
           be found in greater than 90% of patients. FLCN is believed to function like a classic
           tumor suppressor gene with a second hit in the wild type allele (somatic mutation or
           loss of heterozygosity) occurring in the majority of renal tumors.

        -  BHD is in the family of hamartomatous disorders similar to Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
           (TSC) and Cowden Syndrome, and studies have found activation of the phosphoinositide
           3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway in BHD renal tumors. FLCN is believed be part of a complex
           that interacts with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and is involved with
           regulation of mTOR activity. In vitro and in vivo models of FLCN loss demonstrate
           activation of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).

        -  Preclinical data from conditional FLCN knockout mice demonstrate that treatment with
           sirolimus can reverse renal manifestations.

        -  We hypothesize that mTOR inhibition with everolimus treatment will be clinically active
           in BHD associated RCC.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the overall response rate with everolimus treatment in subjects with
      BHD-associated renal tumors.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome (BHD).

      Design:

        -  This is an open label, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus
           therapy in patients with BHD associated renal tumors. Up to 16 evaluable patients will
           be enrolled.

        -  Tumor response rate will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
           (RECIST) and efficacy analysis will be done.

        -  Secondary endpoints will evaluate growth rates (cm/year) while on therapy.

        -  Additionally, reduction in the size of lung cysts and cutaneous fibrofolliculomas will
           be evaluated.

    <time_frame>End of treatment: every 12 weeks up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Overall best response is defined as the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria v1.1. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also progression. Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time interval from start of treatment to documented evidence of disease progression.

The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also progression.

        <title>Overall Response Rate With Everolimus Treatment.</title>
        <description>Overall best response is defined as the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria v1.1. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also progression. Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.</description>
