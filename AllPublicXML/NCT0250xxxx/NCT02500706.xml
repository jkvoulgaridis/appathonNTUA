    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 146 sites in 12 countries(number of sites indicates those that both screened and randomised subjects, unless otherwise noted)-Austria(4);Bulgaria(8); Canada(6); Germany(7); India(16); Israel(6); Italy(4); Japan(24); Russian Federation(10); Serbia(3); Taiwan(3); United States(55 sites screened/52 sites randomised subjects)</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible subjects were enrolled in a 8-week run-in period (1108 subjects) where subjects were switched from previous insulin treatment to insulin degludec once daily,and NovoRapid®/NovoLog® as mealtime bolus insulin. The basal insulin treatment was optimised using treat-to-target approach. 83 subjects were run-in failures and 1025 were randomised.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Faster Aspart (Meal)</title>
          <description>Bolus insulin: Participants received subcutaneous (s.c., into the abdominal wall) injections of faster-acting insulin aspart at mealtime (0−2 minutes before the meal) during 26-week treatment period. Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime plasma glucose between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L (71–108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.
Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections at the dose optimized during run-in period during 26-week treatment period.</description>

The insulin was titrated to the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime plasma glucose between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L (71–108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.
Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections at the dose optimized during run-in period during 26-week treatment period.</description>

Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime plasma glucose between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L (71–108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.
Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections at the dose optimized during run-in period during 26-week treatment period.</description>

        <description>The subject was instructed to perform a 7-9-7 SMPG point profile on the 3 consecutive days just before selected visit. 7-point profile (day 3 and day 1 before selected visit): before breakfast, 60 minutes after the start of breakfast, before lunch, 60 minutes after the start of lunch, before main evening meal, 60 minutes after the start of main evening meal, and at bedtime. 9-point profile (day 2 before selected visit) included all timepoints of 7-points profile with addition of SMPG measurement at 4 a.m. and before breakfast on the following day. The mean of the 7-9-7-point profile was defined as the area under the curve profile divided by the measurement time, and was calculated using the linear trapezoidal technique. The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in 7-9-7-point SMPG 26 Weeks After Randomisation: PPG Increment (Mean, Breakfast, Lunch, Main Evening Meal)</title>
          <description>The subject was instructed to perform a 7-9-7 SMPG point profile on the 3 consecutive days just before selected visit. 7-point profile (day 3 and day 1 before selected visit): before breakfast, 60 minutes after the start of breakfast, before lunch, 60 minutes after the start of lunch, before main evening meal, 60 minutes after the start of main evening meal, and at bedtime. 9-point profile (day 2 before selected visit) included all timepoints of 7-points profile with addition of SMPG measurement at 4 a.m. and before breakfast on the following day. PPG increment for each meal (breakfast, lunch, main evening meal) was derived from the 7-point and 9-point profile as the difference between PPG values and the PG value before the meal in each separate profile. The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period.</description>

            <description>Bolus insulin: Participants received subcutaneous (s.c., into the abdominal wall) injections of faster-acting insulin aspart at mealtime (0−2 minutes before the meal) during 26-week treatment period. Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime plasma glucose between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L (71–108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.
Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections at the dose optimized during run-in period during 26-week treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Evaluation (Fundoscopy/Fundus Photography) 26 Weeks After Randomisation</title>
        <description>The result of the fundus photography/dilated fundoscopy was interpreted by the investigator into following categories: Normal; Abn, NCS; Abnormal, CS. Reported results are percentage of subjects with 'normal', 'Abn, NCS' and 'Abn, CS' fundoscopy/fundus photography results at week 0 and week 26. Week 26 data are based on the last on-treatment value which contains the last available measurement in the on-treatment period.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was based on SAS. Number analysed=number of subjects with available data for fundoscopy/fundus photography at specified timepoints.</population>

            <description>Bolus insulin: Participants received subcutaneous (s.c., into the abdominal wall) injections of faster-acting insulin aspart at mealtime (0−2 minutes before the meal) during 26-week treatment period. Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime plasma glucose between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L (71–108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.
Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections at the dose optimized during run-in period during 26-week treatment period.</description>

The insulin was titrated to the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime plasma glucose between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L (71–108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.
Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections at the dose optimized during run-in period during 26-week treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urinalysis (Protein) 26 Weeks After Randomisation</title>
        <description>Presence of protein in urine was assessed by urine dipstick and categorised as: Negative, Positive, Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+. Change from baseline is represented in terms of percentage of patients with protein values at week 0 and week 26 (last on-treatment value). Last on-treatment value contains the last available measurement in the on-treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urinalysis (Erythrocytes) 26 Weeks After Randomisation</title>
        <description>Presence of erythrocytes in urine was assessed by urine dipstick and categorised as: Negative, Positive, Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+. Change from baseline is represented in terms of percentage of patients with erythrocytes values at week 0 and week 26 (last on-treatment value). Last on-treatment value contains the last available measurement in the on-treatment period.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was based on SAS. Number analysed=number of subjects with available data for erythrocytes values.</population>

            <description>Bolus insulin: Participants received subcutaneous (s.c., into the abdominal wall) injections of faster-acting insulin aspart at mealtime (0−2 minutes before the meal) during 26-week treatment period. Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime plasma glucose between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L (71–108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.
Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections at the dose optimized during run-in period during 26-week treatment period.</description>

The insulin was titrated to the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime plasma glucose between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L (71–108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.
Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections at the dose optimized during run-in period during 26-week treatment period.</description>
