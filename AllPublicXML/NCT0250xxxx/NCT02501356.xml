  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of daily intake of the ISOThrive supplement vs. a placebo on the
      primary outcome measure of body weight and secondary outcome measures (hunger/satiety,
      health-related measures and self-reported quality of life) in a group of overweight but
      otherwise healthy adults.

      Hypothesis

      The investigator's hypothesize that daily intake for a 3-month period of the ISOThrive
      supplement vs. a placebo will demonstrate beneficial effects on the primary outcome measure
      of body weight and secondary outcome measures (hunger/satiety, health-related measures and
      self-reported quality of life) in a group of overweight adults.

      Specific Aims

        -  To determine the effects of the ISOThrive supplement on body weight in overweight adults
           encouraged to reduce calories and exercise regularly, but on an unrestricted diet and
           without specific exercise instruction. Specifically, to demonstrate a clinically
           meaningful reduction in body weight in a group of overweight adults after 3 months of
           daily consumption of the ISOThrive supplement.

        -  To determine the effects of the ISOThrive supplement on hunger/satiety, body
           composition, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, blood lipid
           levels, inflammatory and satiety serum markers and self-reported quality of life in
           overweight adults encouraged to reduce calories and exercise regularly, but on an
           unrestricted diet and without specific exercise instruction. Specifically, to
           demonstrate an improvement in hunger/satiety and a clinically meaningful improvement in
           other measures in a group of overweight adults after 3 months of daily consumption of
           the ISOThrive supplement.

        -  To demonstrate the safety of the ISOThrive supplement in terms of its impact on blood,
           liver and kidney function in overweight adults. Specifically, to demonstrate the lack of
           a negative impact on blood, liver and kidney function tests in a group of overweight
           adults after 3 months of daily consumption of the ISOThrive supplement.

        -  To determine the effects of the ISOThrive supplement on Gut health. Specifically, to
           demonstrate improvement in Gut health as measured by abdominal bloating, abdominal gas,
           and abdominal pain/discomfort at the end of 3 months of daily consumption of the
           ISOThrive supplement.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight will be measured at the beginning and at the end of the study using a calibrated digital scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hunger/satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>will be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) that will ask participants a series of questions to be completed at 2 time points: mid-morning between breakfast and lunch, and late evening between dinner and bed time. The VAS questions require participants to rate on a scale the strength of specific sensations they are feeling (i.e., hunger, thirst, amount of food they could eat &quot;right now&quot;, nausea, and fullness) by placing a vertical mark on the scale in response to each question.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satiety indicators</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>will be assessed at the beginning and end of the study with biological markers using Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), PYY and ghrelin.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake data</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary intake will be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study. Each participant will complete three 24-hour dietary recalls (two for weekdays, and one for a weekend day) using an online Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall (ASA24) (available from the National Cancer Institute at http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24/). This data will be used to provide a representational measure of intake of kilocalories and macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrates).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured at the beginning and at the end of the study . BMI will be calculated as weight (kg) divided by height in meters (m) squared. Height will be measured by using a calibrated stadiometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis, which uses the resistance of electrical flow through the body to estimate body fat. The Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer will be used to measure body composition. The SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer measures weight and calculates body fat percentage and total body water percentage in addition to BMI. Measures will be taken at baseline, 6 weeks and at the end of the 3-month intervention period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leptin</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Leptin levels will be used as a biomarker to monitor the amount of body fat. Leptin level will be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study . Leptin is a hormone secreted exclusively by adipose cells in response to an increase in body fat mass, and is an important component in the regulation of long-term hunger and food intake. Leptin serves as the brain's indicator of the body's total energy stores. When leptin levels rise in the bloodstream they bind to receptors in arcuate nucleus (ARC). Leptin suppress the release of neuropeptide Y (NPY), which in turn prevents the release of appetite enhancing hypocretin (orexins) from the lateral hypothalamus. This decreases appetite and food intake, promoting weight loss. It also stimulates the expression of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Lipid levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total cholesterol (Tchol), triglycerides (TRIG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) will be obtained by direct measurements. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) are obtained by calculation: VLDL = TRIG/5; and LDL = Tchol - (VLDL + HDL). The HDL:Tchol ratio will be used to evaluate the impact of the supplement on lipid panel. The lipid profile will be assessed at baseline and at the end of 3 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess abdominal bloating, abdominal gas, and abdominal pain/discomfort at 6 weeks and at the end of 3 months. Abdominal symptoms will be assessed using a side effects survey.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>will be assessed using the SF-12 (http://www.sf-36.org/tools/sf12.shtml). The SF-12v2 Health Survey uses 12 questions to assess 8 domains of health and well-being (general health, physical function, physical role, bodily pain, mental health, emotional role, vitality, and social function) within the past 4 weeks. The SF-12v2 is a practical, reliable, and valid measure of physical and mental health and takes only 2 to 3 minutes to complete. This tool will be administered at baseline and at the end of 3 months.</description>
