        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-80 years at screening

          -  Unruptured saccular IA in the anterior or posterior circulation with dimensions
             consistent with Table 2

          -  IA appears suitable for NeXsys device

          -  Patient willing to comply with study requirements

          -  Patient able to understand and sign a study-specific informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ruptured IA

          -  Any other IA that requires treatment in the next year

          -  IA width &gt;10 mm

          -  IA neck &gt;9 mm

          -  IA has important flow from its base such that occluding the IA would cause stroke

          -  Target IA contains any device (e.g., coils)

          -  Inability to access the target IA with microcatheter

          -  Any congenital or iatrogenic coagulopathy

          -  Stenosis of the target IA's parent vessel &gt;50%

          -  Taking daily aspirin or other platelet inhibitor (clopidogrel or equivalent)

          -  Taking any anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin)

          -  Pregnant or planning pregnancy in the next 2 years

          -  Other medical conditions that could increase the risk of neurovascular procedures
             (e.g., liver failure, cancer, etc.)

          -  Participating in another study with investigational devices or drugs
