  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 open label trial of G100 in patients with low grade Non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (NHL). G100 is composed of glucopranosyl lipid A in a stable emulsion and is a
      potent TLR4 (toll-like receptor-4) agonist. G100 will be administered by direct injection
      (intratumorally) into tumors of low grade NHL with or without following standard low dose
      radiation therapy. Preclinical models and clinical studies in other cancers such as Merkel
      cell carcinoma have demonstrated that G100 administered in this manner can alter the tumor
      microenvironment, activate dendritic cells, T cells and other immune cells and induce
      systemic anti-tumor immune responses. In this trial, the safety, immunogenicity, and clinical
      efficacy of G100 will be examined alone or with pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center Phase 1/2 open label trial of intratumoral G100 in patients with low
      grade NHL. Patients with NHL will be enrolled and receive G100 to an accessible tumor mass.
      Clinical response will be evaluated in the injected lesion and systemic (abscopal) responses
      will be evaluated in distal areas involved with tumor.

      The study will be conducted in 5 parts. In Part 1, Dose Escalation, 2 sequentially enrolled
      cohorts of patients will be treated at one of 2 dose levels of G100 using a standard
      escalation design. In this portion of the study, both follicular and marginal zone NHL will
      eligible. In Part 2, 2 groups of patients with follicular NHL may be examined. One group will
      be randomly assigned to receive either single agent G100 intratumorally at the maximum safe
      dose determined in Part 1 following local radiation or will receive the same treatment
      regimen sequentially administered with pembrolizumab. A second treatment group may be
      explored if the safety profile in Part 1 is acceptable. In this optional group, patients with
      injectable tumors of 4 cm or greater would be enrolled and treated with a higher dose of
      G100. In Part 3, expansion of a higher dose (20µg of G100) in patients with follicular NHL
      will be enrolled to receive local radiation therapy and intratumoral G100 (no tumor size
      requirement in this arm). In Part 4, Dose Escalation and Expansion, a dose of 20µg of G100
      will be examined as a treatment of 1 or more tumor lesions (up to 4) with pembrolizumab in
      order to establish safety and examine clinical and biomarker responses in patients receiving
      increasing total systemic doses of G100 and Part 5, will evaluate standard induction therapy
      with rituximab (anti-CD20) in combination of escalating doses of intratumoral G100 in single
      tumor lesions.

      The primary goal of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of different doses
      of G100 when administered by intratumoral injection. The development of anti-tumor immune
      responses and preliminary evidence of clinical responses in local and distal tumor sites will
      also be examined.
