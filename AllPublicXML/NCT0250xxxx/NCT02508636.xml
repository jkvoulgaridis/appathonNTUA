  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to evaluate efficacy, safety, toxicity, and feasibility of the
      addition of enzalutamide to leuprolide for a total duration of 24 months in patients with
      very high-risk prostate cancer or pelvic node positive disease receiving radiotherapy. Very
      high-risk prostate cancer is defined as 2 or more of the following characteristics: 1)
      cT3a/b, 2) PSA ≥20 and &lt;150, 3) Gleason 8-10, and 4) ≥33% core involvement.

    <measure>Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment and assesses the disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies and comprises four summary domains (Urinary, Bowel, Sexual and Hormonal). Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better health related quality of life</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS is a set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children. A PROMIS score of 50 is the average (or mean) score for a specific, relevant group of people under investigation. That group is the reference population. The PROMIS measures the responses use a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. A score of 40 is one SD lower than the mean of the reference population and a score of 60 is one SD higher than the mean of the reference population. For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (e.g., more Fatigue, more Physical Function). Thus a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the average referenced population. This could be a desirable or undesirable outcome, depending upon the concept being measured.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol Group five dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale, with lower levels indicating less issues/problems with that particular health dimension.</description>
