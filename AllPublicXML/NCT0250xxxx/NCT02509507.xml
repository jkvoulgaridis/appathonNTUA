      This is a phase 1b/2, multicenter, open-label, basket trial to evaluate the safety of
      talimogene laherparepvec injected intrahepatically into liver tumors alone and in combination
      with systemic IV administration of pembrolizumab, in subjects with non-HCC liver metastases
      from BC, CRC, gastroesophageal cancer (GEC), melanoma, NSCLC, RCC in Part 1 Group A, and
      subjects with HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 1 Group B (viral hepatitis is only
      applicable in combination setting), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intratumoral
      talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced
      TNBC, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, CRC, CSCC, and BCC in Part 2 Group A and
      subjects with HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 2 Group B. The objective of Part 1
      is to evaluate the safety of intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec into liver
      tumors alone and in combination with systemically administered pembrolizumab for the non-HCC
      (Group A) and HCC (Group B) cohorts separately. Part 2 consists of 2-stage design to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic
      pembrolizumab. Efficacy and safety will be evaluated in each of the five non-HCC tumor types
      from Group A separately. Similarly, the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment will
      be determined for Group B HCC subjects.

    <description>Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) administered by intralesional injection into liver tumors, with US/CT guidance. Part 1: initial dose of T-VEC is 10^6 PFU/mL up to 4mL in Cohorts 1 &amp; 2, up to 8mL in Cohorts 3 &amp; 4 of the Group A &amp; Group B. The 1st cycle of T-VEC will be 21 (+3) days (from the 1st dose at 10^6 PFU/mL to the 2nd dose at 10^7 or 10^8 PFU/mL). Subsequent cycles of T-VEC will be 21 (±3) days. Max. volume of T-VEC administered at any dose is 4mL (Cohorts 1, 2, 5, and 6) or 8mL (Cohorts 3 &amp; 4) for any individual lesion or for all lesions combined. Part 2: concentration of T-VEC (10^7 or 10^8 PFU/mL) to be administered will be determined on completion of combination treatment, in Part 1. T-VEC will be used at a max. volume of 4 mL (or up to 8mL if determined safe in monotherapy on opening Part 2). If 8ml safety is not established on opening Part 2, only newly enrolled subjects in Part 2 will receive up to a max. of 8mL if safety of administering 8mL in Part 1 is established</description>

             cytologically confirmed diagnosis of estrogen receptor (ER) positive and/or
             progesterone receptor (PrR) positive breast cancer.

          -  Triple negative breast cancer: Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis
             of ER negative, PR negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-Neu
             negative.

        Part 2 Group B is restricted to HCC (fibrolamellar and mixed
        hepatocellular/cholangiocarcinoma subtypes are not eligible).

        For Part 1 Group B cohort 6b and Part 2 Arm VII, subjects must have a diagnosis of
        hepatitis B and/or C. Those with hepatitis B must be on hepatitis antiviral therapy for at
        least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and HBV viral load by real-time polymerase chain reaction
        (qPCR) must be &lt; 100 IU/mL. Subjects with past or ongoing hepatitis C infection must have
        completed treatment for hepatitis C at least 1 month prior to study enrollment and
        hepatitis C viral load must be undetectable; subjects with hepatitis B and C must fulfill
        the eligibility criteria for hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Subjects with locally recurrent
        TNBC are eligible.

        Non-HCC subjects must have received at least 1 prior standard of care systemic anti-cancer
        therapy for their locally advanced or metastatic disease. For the combination cohorts
        (Cohorts 5 and 6 in Part 1) and Part 2, subjects with melanoma CSCC or NSCLC do not need to

        Child-Pugh score must be A.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must not be candidates for surgery or locoregional therapy with curative intent or
        planned systemic anti-cancer therapy, with the exception of immunotherapy in the
        combination cohorts (Cohorts 5 and 6 in Part 1 and all subjects in Part 2). Liver tumors
        must not be estimated to invade approximately more than one-third of the liver. Liver
        tumor-directed therapy, hepatic surgery or major surgery, antibody-based therapy, or
        immunotherapy must not have been performed &lt; 28 days, chemotherapy &lt; 21 days, and targeted
        small molecule therapy or hormonal therapy &lt; 14 days prior to enrollment. Subjects must
        either (1) have no central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, or carcinomatous meningitis, or
        (2) if CNS metastasis is present, must have stable treated cerebral metastases from BC,
        NSCLC, RCC, CRC, GEC, or melanoma. Subjects must not have symptomatic auto-immune disease
        or be symptomatically immunosuppressed. They must not have a history of solid organ
        transplantation. For non-HCC, there must not be acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
        hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. For HCC with prior hepatitis B and/or C infection, HBV
        and/or HCV viral load by qPCR must be undetectable, and they must not have had recent
        treatment within 12 weeks for HBV or HCV with certain antiviral medications in Part 1 Group
        B cohorts 1-5 and 6a, and Part 2 Group B HCC without viral hepatitis (Arms I-VI). For all
        patients in Part 1 and for patients in Part 2 where intrahepatic liver injection is
        planned, there should be no macroscopic intravascular invasion of tumors into the main
        portal vein, hepatic vein, or vena cava. Subjects must not: have active herpetic skin
        lesions or prior complications of herpetic infection (eg, herpetic keratitis or
        encephalitis); require treatment with an antiherpetic drug; have received live-virus
        vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start; have previous therapy with
        talimogene laherparepvec, oncolytic viruses, or tumor vaccine. They must not require
        concomitant treatment with warfarin. Subjects in the combination treatment cohort must not
        have: a history or evidence of psychiatric, substance abuse, or any other clinically
        significant disorder; toxic effects of the most recent prior chemotherapy not resolved to
        grade 1 or less (except alopecia); or expected other cancer therapy while on study with the
        exception of local radiation to the site of bone or other metastasis for palliative
        treatment. Male subjects of reproductive potential in the combination treatment must be
        willing to use acceptable methods of effective contraception during treatment and through 4
        months after the last dose of pembrolizumab.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
