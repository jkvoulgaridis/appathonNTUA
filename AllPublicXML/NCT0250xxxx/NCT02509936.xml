  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the impact of an intensive home-based education intervention
      targeting severely stunted Guatemalan children for catch up growth and improved development.
      Half of the children in the study will receive standard of care, which includes micronutrient
      supplementation and a food ration. The other half of children in the study will receive, in
      addition to the above, home-based dietary assessment and individualized parental nutrition
      education.

    <measure>Change in Height/Length for Age Z Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in height/length over 6 months. Tool used is the WHO Child Growth Reference Standards. Change values calculated as: 6 month (z-score) minus Baseline (z-score).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Development</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cognitive development Z score over 6 months. Tool used: Bayley III Cognitive Development Observational Checklist. Z-scores derived internally from the entire baseline measurement data set for the study. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean cognitive score for the study population at baseline. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the baseline study population mean mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than this mean. Higher values above zero are indicative of cognitive scores higher than mean baseline score for the study population. Lower values below zero are indicative of cognitive scores lower than mean baseline score for the study population. For outcomes, change values are calculated as 6 month (z-score) minus Baseline (z-score)</description>

    <measure>Socioemotional Development</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in socioemotional development score over 6 months. Tool used: Bayley III Socioemotional Development Parent Questionnaire. Z-scores derived internally from the entire baseline measurement data set for the study. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean socioemotional score for the study population at baseline. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the baseline study population mean mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than this mean. Higher values above zero are indicative of socioemotional scores higher than mean baseline score for the study population. Lower values below zero are indicative of socioemotional scores lower than mean baseline score for the study population. For outcomes, change values are calculated as 6 month (z-score) minus Baseline (z-score)</description>

    <description>Change in gross motor development score over 6 months. Tool used: Bayley III Gross Motor Observational Checklist. Z-scores derived internally from the entire baseline measurement data set for the study. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean gross motor score for the study population at baseline. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the baseline study population mean mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than this mean. Higher values above zero are indicative of gross motor scores higher than mean baseline score for the study population. Lower values below zero are indicative of gross motor scores lower than mean baseline score for the study population. For outcomes, change values are calculated as 6 month (z-score) minus Baseline (z-score)</description>

    <description>Change in fine motor development score over 6 months. Tool used: Bayley III Fine Motor Observational Checklist. Z-scores derived internally from the entire baseline measurement data set for the study. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean fine motor score for the study population at baseline. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the baseline study population mean mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than this mean. Higher values above zero are indicative of fine motor scores higher than mean baseline score for the study population. Lower values below zero are indicative of fine motor scores lower than mean baseline score for the study population. For outcomes, change values are calculated as 6 month (z-score) minus Baseline (z-score)</description>

Z-scores derived internally from the entire baseline measurement data set for the study. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean receptive language score for the study population at baseline. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the baseline study population mean mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than this mean. Higher values above zero are indicative of receptive language scores higher than mean baseline score for the study population. Lower values below zero are indicative of receptive language scores lower than mean baseline score for the study population.

    <description>Change in expressive language development score over 6 months. Tool used: Bayley III Expressive Language Observational Checklist. Z-scores derived internally from the entire baseline measurement data set for the study. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean expressive language score for the study population at baseline. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the baseline study population mean mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than this mean. Higher values above zero are indicative of expressive language scores higher than mean baseline score for the study population. Lower values below zero are indicative of expressive language scores lower than mean baseline score for the study population.

        <title>Receptive Language Development</title>
        <description>Change in receptive language development score over 6 months. Tool used: Bayley III Receptive Language Observational Checklist. Z-scores derived internally from the entire baseline measurement data set for the study. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean receptive language score for the study population at baseline. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the baseline study population mean mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than this mean. Higher values above zero are indicative of receptive language scores higher than mean baseline score for the study population. Lower values below zero are indicative of receptive language scores lower than mean baseline score for the study population. For outcomes, change values are calculated as 6 month (z-score) minus Baseline (z-score)</description>
