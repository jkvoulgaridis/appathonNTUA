  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to adapt and implement a district-led, policy-based, low cost Maternal and
      Newborn Health (MNH) intervention package using the MamaToto process, proven successful in
      Uganda, in rural Tanzania. The investigators hypothesized that the 'MamaToto Package' will be
      successfully implemented in the Misungwi District and will be effective in improving key
      maternal and newborn health indicators of study participants.

      This study collected baseline data on indicators related to pre-natal care, delivery,
      post-natal care, treatment of childhood illnesses and family planning. Data collection
      tools/strategies included 1) a mapping exercise, 2) health facility audit 3) household
      surveys and 4) exit interviews. Data was collected at baseline and endline. Operational data
      was collected throughout the life of the study. Results were used to inform implementation of
      interventions that aim to improve health facility capacity to deliver good quality care to
      women and children and to strengthen families and communities to better advocate for and
      engage in activities that promote healthier women and children.

      Mapping data was collected in two districts 1) Misungwi and 2) Kwimba. Baseline and endline
      data was collected in Misungwi only. The intervention began in Misungwi in Years 1 and 2 and
      then rolled out to Kwimba in Year 3.
