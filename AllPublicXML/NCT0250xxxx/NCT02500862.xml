      This is a registry study. Only patients followed under the clinical practice at AIBILI
      Clinical Trial Centre, and with a signed informed consent form will be included.

      Based on the clinical information collected under the clinical practice, and based on
      patients' characteristics, scientific questions will be raised and data will be collected and
      analysed accordingly.

      Any procedure performed under clinical practice that may allow for the characterization of
      the disease and/or for the identification of potential biomarkers will be collected and
      analysed.
