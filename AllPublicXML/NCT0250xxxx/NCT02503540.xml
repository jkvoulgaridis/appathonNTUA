    <textblock>
      This interventional study will evaluate the retinal vascular dynamics associated with
      Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI) therapy in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME) or
      macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Ultra-widefield fluorescein
      angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography will be performed at multiple
      timepoints to assess the changes in retinal vascular leakage, ischemia, and vascular
      abnormalities throughout the study duration and compare these alterations to baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) and macular edema secondary to retinal venous occlusive diseases
      are the most common cause of vision loss from a retinal vascular disease. Recently, vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ranibizumab) have
      been described as new first-line therapies for these conditions. Aflibercept is the most
      recently approved VEGF inhibitor for the management of these conditions. Clinical trials have
      shown that treatment with aflibercept improves visual acuity and reduces macular edema in a
      large percentage of patients.

      This study will examine the changes that occur with intravitreal aflibercept to perfusion and
      leakage in treatment naive eyes over the course of 1 year.

             menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device (IUD); bilateral tubal
             ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly, or diaphragm
             plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)

               -  Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to
                  be considered of child bearing potential. Pregnancy testing and contraception are
