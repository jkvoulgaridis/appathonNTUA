  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the safety and feasibility of delivering
      allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (allo-MSCs) by transendocardial injection to cancer
      survivors with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction secondary to anthracycline-induced
      cardiomyopathy (AIC).

      The secondary purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary evidence for therapeutic
      efficacy of allo-MSCs delivered by transendocardial injection to cancer survivors with LV
      dysfunction secondary to AIC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, trial will evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of allo-MSCs administered by transendocardial injection in thirty-seven subjects with
      anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC). The first six subjects received allo-MSC therapy
      (open label) and were assessed for safety and feasibility of the study procedures. Following
      1 month data review of each of the six subjects by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
      Institute Gene and Cell Therapy Data Safety Monitoring Board; this was followed by a
      randomized, double-blind clinical trial enrolling thirty-one subjects. These subjects were
      randomized 1:1 to receive allo-MSCs or placebo. All subjects underwent cardiac
      catheterization and study product administration using the NOGA Myostar catheter injection
      system. Subjects are being followed at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post
      study product injection. All endpoints are assessed at the 6 and 12 month visits which will
      occur 180 ±30 days and 365 ±30 days, respectively, after the day of study product injection
      (Day 0). For the purpose of the safety evaluations and endpoint analysis, the Investigators
      will utilize an &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; study population. In addition, because this phase I
      study is the first cell therapy study in this population, at 12 months available
      standard-of-care medical records for cancer surveillance will be reviewed for cancer
      recurrence.
