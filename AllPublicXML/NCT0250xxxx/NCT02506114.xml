  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentered, open label, randomized phase II trial of PROSTVAC or ipilimumab or
      the combination of PROSTVAC and ipilimumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with localized
      prostate cancer. Eligible patients will be randomized to PROSTVAC monotherapy (Arm A),
      ipilimumab monotherapy (Arm B), or combination therapy with both PROSTVAC and ipilimumab (Arm
      C), prior to RP. In arms A and C, PROSTVAC-V will be administered subcutaneously as the
      primary vaccine on Day 1, which will be followed 2 weeks later with a series of 2 PROSTVAC-F
      subcutaneous administrations, given 3 weeks apart. In arms B and C, ipilimumab will be
      administered twice, at a dose of 3mg/kg, 3 weeks apart. In the combination arm, ipilimumab
      administration will coincide with the PROSTVAC-F administration. In arm B, ipilimumab will
      begin on Day 1. In all three arms, radical prostatectomy (RP) will occur 21 days, or three
      weeks, following final treatment administration of PROSTVAC or ipilimumab. No further therapy
      will be administered on study following RP.

    <description>PROSTVAC-V/F is a prostate-specific antigen(PSA)-based immunization strategy. It is intended to generate immune responses to prostate specific antigens and prostate cancer cells. It uses poxviral vectors to introduce modified PSA to the patient in an immunogenic manner to break self-tolerance, and thereby induce immune responses directed against prostate cancer cells.</description>

                    3. Persons with type 2 diabetes are not excluded since this is not an
                       autoimmune disease, and do not need to meet these criteria.

               -  Persons with hypothyroidism are not excluded if condition is well controlled, and
                  condition is due to a non-autoimmune etiology.

             screening. Subjects with a history of stage I or II cancer must have been adequately
             treated and been disease-free for ≥ 3 years prior to study screening.

         19. Subject has any uncontrolled, concurrent illness including, but not limited to the
             following: ongoing or active infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke or
             myocardial infarction within 6 months, or psychiatric illness that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

         20. Subject requires any medical intervention(s) or has any other condition(s) that, in
             the Investigator's opinion, will 1) make the administration of PROSTVAC or ipilimumab
             hazardous, 2) obscure the interpretation of AEs, 3) compromise adherence with study
             requirements, or 4) otherwise compromise the study's objectives.

         21. Subject has high-risk features (e.g., based on Gleason score, PSA, clinical stage, %
             positive biopsies), and the treating physician feels the subject should undergo
             radical prostatectomy sooner than planned within the protocol.
