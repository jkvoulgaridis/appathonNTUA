  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While some authors recommend diuretics as the first treatment to initiate for symptoms caused
      by malignant ascites (MA), their prescription is variable. No randomized, controlled study
      has assessed their benefit in this context. According to literature, diuretics may bring
      relief in about 40% of cases, regardless of primary tumor.

      The purpose of our study is to assess the effectiveness of diuretic treatment according to
      Serum Ascites Albumin Gradient (SAAG) measured before treatment. Judgment criteria is the
      time elapsed between recurrent MA that requires paracentesis. The investigators will also
      examine whether SAAG and serum levels of renin and aldosterone can predict symptom response
      to diuretics.

      Patients eligible for the trial and having signed their consent to participate will be
      randomized to arm A or B.

      Treatment order is randomly attributed to patients at the 1st paracentesis, after the
      reception of the laboratory results necessary to evaluate SAAG value. Randomization is
      stratified 1:1 according to SAAG values (≥ or &lt; to 11g/L) and Systemic treatment (yes or not)

        -  Patients randomized to arm A will be observed until the next episode requiring
           paracentesis (due to clinical symptoms : abdominal pain or heaviness, dyspnoea,
           orthopnoea, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, early satiety, gastro-oesophageal reflux, lower
           limb and genital oedema), at which time they will receive arm B (diuretics), in absence
           of contra-indication to diuretic treatment.

        -  Patients randomized to arm B will receive diuretics until the next episode requiring
           paracentesis, at which time they will receive arm A (observation).

      Patients will have a physical assessment within 24 hours prior to the start of treatment,
      once every two weeks for patients randomized in arm A and each week for patients randomized
      in arm B, at cross-over and at the end of the study. Patient will also have a biological
      assessment within 24 hours prior to the start of treatment, twice a week for patients
      randomized in arm B, at cross-over and at the end of the study. Finally, they will address a
      quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C15-PAL) prior to the start of treatment, at cross-over
      and at the end of the study.
