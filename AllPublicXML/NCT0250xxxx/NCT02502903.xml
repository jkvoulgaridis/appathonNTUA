      Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled First-In-Human study with four
      sub-parts: Part A, a single ascending dose study (SAD) in normal human volunteers (NHVs),
      Part B, a multiple ascending dose study (MAD) in NHVs, Part C, a multiple dose (MD) study in
      patients with a complement-mediated disorder, and Part E, a multiple dose (MD) study in
      patients with cold agglutinin disease previously treated with BIVV009 within the scope of a
      BIVV009 clinical trial or named patient program use. Note: For parts A-C as well as at the
      start of part E, study drug was named TNT009. The study drug name is changed to BIVV009 with
      final version Final 15.0 of the clinical study protocol.

    <textblock>
      Study TNT009-01 (parts A-C)/ BIVV009 (part E) is a First in Human (FIH) study that uses an
      Integrated Protocol Design. This Phase 1 study protocol will comprise three sub-parts: a
      Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study in normal male and female
      human volunteers (NHVs), and a Multiple Dose (MD) study in patients with various
      complement-mediated disorders not confined to a single disease or therapeutic area. Although
      these patients represent a population with a diverse set of clinical diagnoses they are
      united by a common mechanism of disease matched to the mechanism of action of BIV009. Several
      key safety measures have been incorporated into the design of this study, including use of
      Sentinel Dosing Groups and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), as well as an
      appropriate program of prophylactic vaccinations and clinical biomarker surveillance related
      to the risks potentially associated with inhibition of the complement system. To allow access
      of BIVV009 to CAD patients where successful treatment effect has been observed and to allow
      re-initiation of BIVV009 to previously treated CAD patients, Part E has been added to both
      continued access to study drug in this subset of study patients, and to further characterize
      the safety and efficacy to BIVV009.
