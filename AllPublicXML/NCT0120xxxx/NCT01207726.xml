    <textblock>
      This study combines the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase inhibitor,
      5-azacitidine (5-AZA), with an orally bioavailable histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat
      (SNDX-275), for the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung
      cancer (NCSLC).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of 5-azacitidine and entinostat on the hazard of 3 year
      progression-free survival in patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity of entinostat and 5-azacitidine in
      patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. To explore the effect of entinostat and 5-azacitidine on median disease-free and overall
      survival in patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

      III. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of 5-azacitidine and entinostat on DNA methylation
      and gene re-expression in patients with resected stage I NSCLC through analysis of sputum.

      IV. To estimate the effect of entinostat and 5-azacitidine on progression free survival
      comparing patients with N2 lymph nodes categorized as methylated pre-treatment with those who
      are categorized as unmethylated.

      V. To establish factors that predict clinical outcome in patients treated with combination
      epigenetic therapy by performing genome-wide analyses on pre-treatment tumor DNA.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and 8-10 and entinostat
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 3 and 10. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <description>The study was terminated early due to poor accrual since the requirement of clinic administration of the 5AZA daily and post-operative patients not wanting 6 months of treatment. For this reason, 13 pts were enrolled and data was not analyzed, for which we are unable to make any conclusions or report results.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be status post complete (R0) surgical resection of pathologically-proven
             NSCLC (stage IA-IB according to AJCC version 7)

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks out from completion of surgery

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,000/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  The effects of entinostat and 5-azacitidine on the developing human fetus at the
             recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be within 8 weeks of completing surgery

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy or radiation for treatment of their
             current diagnosis of lung cancer

          -  Patients with sub-lobar resections (ie: wedge resection or segmentectomy)

          -  Patients without mediastinal lymph node specimens from mediastinoscopy or surgery (at
             least level R4 or 7 for right sided tumors OR at least level 5, 6 or 7 for left sided
             tumors)

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to entinostat, 5-azacitidine or other agents used in the study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because entinostat and 5-azacitidine are
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with entinostat or 5-azacitidine, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated on this protocol; these potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             entinostat or 5-azacitidine; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy
