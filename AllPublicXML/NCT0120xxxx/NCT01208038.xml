      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the testosterone patch, in addition to
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT), on blood vessel walls, insulin levels and sexual desire.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A woman's ovaries produce the hormone testosterone during her reproductive life but
      testosterone levels decline with age or when the ovaries are removed. Testosterone has been
      associated with sexual desire in both men and women. Low testosterone is also believed to
      cause symptoms of low energy. Thus testosterone is increasingly used in hormone replacement
      regimens to restore libido and energy in postmenopausal women.

      In the past testosterone has been administered orally or via subcutaneous implants. Recently
      testosterone patches have been licensed for treating low libido in postmenopausal women. The
      testosterone patches deliver a dose of testosterone equivalent to the levels produced by the
      ovary during a woman's early reproductive years.

      Oral testosterone can lead to changes to insulin and cholesterol levels which increase the
      risk of heart disease. On the contrary, testosterone patches may reduce or avoid this risk.
      To date, trials have predominantly focused on safety data in terms of side effects and basic
      blood tests. Reviews of the safety of testosterone replacement have emphasised the need for
      improved safety data, especially in terms of cardiovascular risk.

      The investigators hypothesis that transdermal testosterone, in addition to HRT, will have no
      adverse effects on blood vessel walls and insulin levels and that transdermal testosterone
      significantly improves sexuality and psychological well-being in postmenopausal women.

      Trial design:

      The investigators aim to recruit 20 postmenopausal women to wear the testosterone patch for 3
      months in addition to their usual hormone replacement therapy.

      There will be 3 study visits - a pre study visit, week 6 and week 12. At each visit the
      following procedures will be performed:

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  Blood sample - for hormone levels, lipids and insulin levels

        -  Blood vessel stiffness measurements This will be performed using a small ultrasound
           device at the wrist with blood pressure measured every 5 minutes.

        -  Endothelial function (function of your arterial wall) is measured using a blood pressure
           cuff on each arm and finger probes on one finger of each hand. The blood pressure cuff
           is inflated for 5 minutes and is then deflated quickly. The finger probes will record
           the readings throughout this study.

    <time_frame>12 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral pressure waveforms were captured using radial artery application tonometry via the SphygmoCor apparatus (AtCor Medical Ltd., Sydney, Australia; software version 8.0). The central (ascending aortic) pressure waveform was then derived from an averaged peripheral waveform using a validated, transfer function. The augmentation index (AIx), which gives a composite measure of wave reflection and systemic arterial stiffness can then be calculated by analysis of the central waveform. Aix was defined as the difference between the first and second systolic peaks of the central pressure waveform, expressed as a percentage of the central pulse pressure.</description>

From these results, insulin resistance was then estimated using the updated homeostasis model assessment method for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) computer algorithm.

    <description>Libido was assessed at each visit using the Brief profile of female sexual function (BPFSF), a validated self-administered questionnaire for identifying Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). The BPFSF is based on 7 questions. Each question is scored on a 6-point scale from 'always' to 'never'. A total score is total score ranging from 0 to 35. Previous studies have identified a score of less than 20 as suggestive of HSDD.</description>

        <title>Arterial Compliance - Augmentation Index</title>
        <description>Peripheral pressure waveforms were captured using radial artery application tonometry via the SphygmoCor apparatus (AtCor Medical Ltd., Sydney, Australia; software version 8.0). The central (ascending aortic) pressure waveform was then derived from an averaged peripheral waveform using a validated, transfer function. The augmentation index (AIx), which gives a composite measure of wave reflection and systemic arterial stiffness can then be calculated by analysis of the central waveform. Aix was defined as the difference between the first and second systolic peaks of the central pressure waveform, expressed as a percentage of the central pulse pressure.</description>

        <title>Insulin Resistance - HOMA-IR</title>
        <description>Blood samples were taken for fasting glucose and insulin levels. From these results, insulin resistance was then estimated using the updated homeostasis model assessment method for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) computer algorithm. A higher HOMA-IR indicates a higher degree of insulin resistance. Typically a cutoff of HOMA-IR for identifying those with insulin resistance is 2.5.</description>

        <description>Libido was assessed at each visit using the Brief profile of female sexual function (BPFSF), a validated self-administered questionnaire for identifying Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). The BPFSF is based on 7 questions. Each question is scored on a 6-point scale from 'always' to 'never'. A total score is total score ranging from 0 to 35. Previous studies have identified a score of less than 20 as suggestive of HSDD.</description>
