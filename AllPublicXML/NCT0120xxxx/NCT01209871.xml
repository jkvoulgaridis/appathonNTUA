      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating
      patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may help
      the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of using a novel lymphoma deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) vaccine encoding macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (MIP3a)-fused lymphoma
      idiotype in single chain format.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the vaccine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine to generate tumor-specific cellular and
      humoral immune responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive autologous lymphoma immunoglobulin-derived single-chain variable fragment
      (scFV)-chemokine DNA vaccine intradermally (ID) at 0, 4, and 8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, and then every 6
      months for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Tissue diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with surface immunoglobulin G (IgG),
             immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) phenotype with a monoclonal heavy and
             light chain as determined by flow cytometry; all primary diagnostic lymph node and/or

             Center (UTMDACC)

          -  Previously untreated patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (of any subtype: IgG,
             IgA, IgM) in the asymptomatic phase

          -  Patients must provide a lymph node sample of at least 1.5 cm in the long axis, or a
             bone marrow aspiration sample providing at least 5 million cluster of differentiation
             (CD)20 and/or CD38+ (approximately 10 ml)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2 x upper limit of
             normal

          -  Ability to provide informed consent, and to return to clinic for adequate follow-up
             for the period that the protocol requires

             acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study and for 30 days after the last vaccination has been administered

          -  Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of
