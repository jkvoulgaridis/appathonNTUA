      Background:

      - The drug rosuvastatin (also called Crestor) is used to lower cholesterol levels in people
      with elevated cholesterol levels. Recent studies have suggested that rosuvastatin may affect
      the immune system and reduce inflammation, but the reason for this effect is unclear.
      Researchers are interested in testing the effect of rosuvastatin on the immune systems of
      healthy volunteers with good cholesterol levels.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin on the immune systems of healthy volunteers.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy individuals at least 18 years of age who have an acceptable blood level of LDL
      cholesterol (below 160).

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well
           as blood tests to check general health, cholesterol levels, liver function, and the
           C-reactive protein (which responds to inflammation).

        -  Participants will not be permitted to take most prescription and over-the-counter
           medications that affect the immune system, including antihistamines and certain pain
           relievers. For 1 week before the study, participants will have a wash-out period without
           any of these medications.

        -  Participants will take rosuvastatin daily for 4 weeks, always in the evening (to ensure
           consistent blood sample results).

        -  Participants will provide blood samples at the following time points: (1) immediately
           before the start of the rosuvastatin treatment, (2) after 2 weeks of treatment, (3)
           after 4 weeks of treatment, and (4) 2 weeks after the end of treatment.

      Statins are drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis and are used extensively for primary and
      secondary prevention of heart disease. Their benefit to patients with heart diseases appears
      to exceed that predicted from cholesterol lowering alone. A recent study has found benefits
      of statin therapy in patients with normal cholesterol and high C-reactive protein, a marker
      of inflammation, suggesting that statins exert an anti inflammatory effect in addition to the
      well known cholesterol lowering activity. Studies in mice have revealed mixed observations
      regarding the role of statins in inflammation. Therefore the Center for Human Immunology,
      Autoimmunity and Inflammation is conducting this trial to study the effects of statins on the
      immune system and the inflammatory response in healthy volunteers with normal cholesterol
      levels, and normal or elevated C-reactive protein levels.

      The primary objective is to characterize the immune system before and during statin therapy.

    <measure>To elucidate the effects of a four week course of statins on the immune system in healthy volunteers with normal cholesterol with or without elevated C- reactive protein.</measure>
    <description>An understanding of the mechanism by which statins effect the immune system may help us better define the patient population that might benefit from such therapy and potentially develop drugs that act more selectively and potently on the relevant immunologic pathway(s). We will also address the potential antithrombotic activity of statins.This study has been slow to recruit healthy subjects with elevated CRP, often because subjects with elevated CRP had mild abnormalities on a detailed history and physical exam, such as impaired fasting glucose. In addition, preliminary analysis of the cohort of normal CRP suggests a significant reduction in serum IL-17 during statin therapy. Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that affects the skin and the joints, is assumed to be IL-17 driven17, and subjects are usually free of systemic imunosuppression.</description>
