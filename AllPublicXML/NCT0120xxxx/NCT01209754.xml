      The Prevention Agent Pregnancy Exposure Registry, also known as EMBRACE (Evaluation of
      Maternal and Baby Outcome Registry After Chemoprophylactic Exposure) is a prospective
      observational cohort investigation of exposures to study agents under investigation for HIV
      prevention. The study population will consist of female participants who are identified as
      becoming pregnant during their participation in a microbicide or PrEP trial, or who have had
      planned exposures in pregnancy safety studies as well as their babies resulting from these
      pregnancies. This study will only enroll babies who have not yet reached their 1 year birth
      date.

      The Prevention Agent Pregnancy Exposure Registry, also known as EMBRACE (Evaluation of
      Maternal and Baby Outcome Registry After Chemoprophylactic Exposure) is a prospective
      observational cohort study of maternal exposures to investigational HIV prevention agents.
      Approximately 550 pregnant participants and 400 live infants will be offered enrollment. The
      study population will consist of current or recent female participants identified as becoming
      pregnant during microbicide or PrEP trials, or who have had planned exposures in pregnancy
      safety studies. This study will also include infants resulting from those pregnancies. This
      protocol will monitor for adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, monitor the prevalence of
      major malformations, evaluate growth parameters of infants during the first year of life, and
      evaluate the prevalence and persistence of HIV drug resistance mutations in a cohort of
      infants who were either exposed to active study agents or not exposed to active study agents
      while in utero.

        The study population will consist of female participants who become or became pregnant
        during HIV prevention agent trials, or who have or had planned exposures in pregnancy
        safety studies, and the infants resulting from those pregnancies. Mother participants must
        still be pregnant, or have had a pregnancy outcome diagnosis less than one year before
        screening/enrollment, and infant participants must be less than one year old. The study may
        include HIV-uninfected and -infected participants. Mothers may participate in EMBRACE
        without participation of their infants; however, infants whose mothers have not enrolled in
        EMBRACE will not participate.
