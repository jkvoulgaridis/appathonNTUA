  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-00489791 is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5. Our hypothesis is that PF-00489791
      will enhance the relaxation of blood vessels within the kidney and so reduce blood pressure,
      improving renal function.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 (Day 5, 6, 7)</time_frame>
    <description>UACR was ratio of albumin measured in urine (milligram) to creatinine measured in urine (millimole), reported in units milligram per millimole (mg/mmol). A decrease in UACR may be associated with improved renal and cardiovascular function. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples (obtained 2 days prior to [Day 5, 6 of Week 12], and with last sample collected on the morning of scheduled clinic visit [Day 7 of Week 12]) were used to determine UACR at the scheduled clinic visit. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples obtained at screening were used to determine baseline UACR.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) at Week 3, 6 and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3 (Day 5, 6, 7), Week 6 (Day 5, 6, 7), Week 16 (Day 5, 6, 7)</time_frame>
    <description>UACR was ratio of albumin measured in urine (milligram) to creatinine measured in urine (millimole), reported in units mg/mmol. A decrease in UACR may be associated with improved renal and cardiovascular function. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples (obtained 2 days prior to [Day 5, 6 of specified Week], and with last sample collected on the morning of scheduled clinic visit [Day 7 of specified Week]) were used to determine UACR at the scheduled clinic visit. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples obtained at screening were used to determine baseline UACR.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Urinary Protein Creatinine Ratio (UPCR) at Week 3, 6, 12, and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3 (Day 5, 6, 7), Week 6 (Day 5, 6, 7), Week 12 (Day 5, 6, 7), Week 16 (Day 5, 6, 7)</time_frame>
    <description>UPCR is a ratio between two measured substances in urine: milligram of protein per millimole (mmol) of creatinine, reported in units mg/mmol. A decrease in UPCR may be associated with improved renal and cardiovascular function. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples (obtained 2 days prior to [Day 5, 6 of Week 3, 6, 12, 16], and with last sample collected on the morning of scheduled clinic visit [Day 7 of Week 3, 6, 12, 16]) were used to determine UPCR at the scheduled clinic visit. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples obtained at screening were used to determine baseline UPCR.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) at Week 3, 6, 12, and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3, 6, 12, 16 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The eGFR was calculated using 4 variable formula developed by the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) study group. The 4 variables needed to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using this formula were serum creatinine concentration (sCr), age, sex (for females, eGFR was multiplied by 0.742) and ethnic origin (for African-Caribbean people only, eGFR was multiplied by 1.212). Thus eGFR in milliliter per minute per 1.73 square meter (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 175*(sCr/88.4)^-1.154*(Age)^-0.203*(0.742 if female)*(1.212 if African-Caribbean). Baseline eGFR was determined predose at Week 0 (Day 1).</description>

    <measure>Systolic, Diastolic and Mean Blood Pressure at Week 0, 3, 6, 12, and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 3, 6, 12, 16 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the blood pressure (pressure exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels) when heart is contracting; it is the maximum arterial pressure during contraction of left ventricle of heart. diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the blood pressure (pressure exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels) when heart is relaxing; it is the minimum arterial pressure during relaxation and dilation of ventricles of heart. Mean blood pressure (MBP) = diastolic blood pressure + ([systolic blood pressure - diastolic blood pressure]/3). After a minimum of 5 minutes of rest, supine BP was measured with the participant's arm supported at the level of the heart.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Serum High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (Hs-CRP) Concentration at Week 12 and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 16 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The CRP is an acute phase reactant which is virtually absent from the blood serum of healthy persons but rapidly appears in blood and body fluids in response to injurious stimuli. Baseline hs-CRP was determined predose at Week 0 (Day 1).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Serum Cystatin-C Concentration at Week 12 and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 16 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Cystatin C is produced by all nucleated cells at a constant rate and is freely filtered at the glomerulus. The blood concentration of cystatin C depends almost entirely on the GFR and is not substantially affected by diet, nutritional status or inflammatory disease. Serum cystatin C had been proposed as an endogenous marker of GFR in participant with chronic kidney disease (CKD) than sCr. Baseline serum cystatin C was determined predose at Week 0 (Day 1).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) at Week 12</title>
        <description>UACR was ratio of albumin measured in urine (milligram) to creatinine measured in urine (millimole), reported in units milligram per millimole (mg/mmol). A decrease in UACR may be associated with improved renal and cardiovascular function. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples (obtained 2 days prior to [Day 5, 6 of Week 12], and with last sample collected on the morning of scheduled clinic visit [Day 7 of Week 12]) were used to determine UACR at the scheduled clinic visit. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples obtained at screening were used to determine baseline UACR.</description>

          <description>UACR was ratio of albumin measured in urine (milligram) to creatinine measured in urine (millimole), reported in units milligram per millimole (mg/mmol). A decrease in UACR may be associated with improved renal and cardiovascular function. The mean values of the 3 consecutive first morning void urine samples (obtained 2 days prior to [Day 5, 6 of Week 12], and with last sample collected on the morning of scheduled clinic visit [Day 7 of Week 12]) were used to determine UACR at the scheduled clinic visit.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) at Week 3, 6, 12, and 16</title>
        <description>The eGFR was calculated using 4 variable formula developed by the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) study group. The 4 variables needed to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using this formula were serum creatinine concentration (sCr), age, sex (for females, eGFR was multiplied by 0.742) and ethnic origin (for African-Caribbean people only, eGFR was multiplied by 1.212). Thus eGFR in milliliter per minute per 1.73 square meter (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 175*(sCr/88.4)^-1.154*(Age)^-0.203*(0.742 if female)*(1.212 if African-Caribbean). Baseline eGFR was determined predose at Week 0 (Day 1).</description>

        <title>Systolic, Diastolic and Mean Blood Pressure at Week 0, 3, 6, 12, and 16</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the blood pressure (pressure exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels) when heart is contracting; it is the maximum arterial pressure during contraction of left ventricle of heart. diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the blood pressure (pressure exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels) when heart is relaxing; it is the minimum arterial pressure during relaxation and dilation of ventricles of heart. Mean blood pressure (MBP) = diastolic blood pressure + ([systolic blood pressure - diastolic blood pressure]/3). After a minimum of 5 minutes of rest, supine BP was measured with the participant's arm supported at the level of the heart.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study medication without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE: an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study medication and up to Week 16 (follow-up) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both non-serious (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)</description>
