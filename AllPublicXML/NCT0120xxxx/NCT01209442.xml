    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether Hypofractionated Intensity-Modulated
      Radiation Therapy (Hypo-IMRT) combining with temozolomide chemotherapy can be safely given
      with a targeted agent, bevacizumab, and how effective this study treatment will be in
      controlling your brain tumor.

      This is a pilot phase II trial of the combination of concurrent hypofractionated IMRT (60
      Gy/2 weeks), temozolomide and bevacizumab followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant bevacizumab and
      temozolomide in patients with grade IV malignant gliomas (glioblastoma and gliosarcoma). The
      study will have survival and toxicity endpoints.

    <description>Patients will be treated with hypofractionated IMRT (60 Gy in 10 Fx) and daily TMZ at 75 mg/m2 qd concurrent with IMRT (including weekends and holidays). Bevacizumab will be administered at 10 mg/kg on day 1 and day 15. Day 1 and the 1st Fx of IMRT must start on the same day. Four to six weeks following completion of concurrent IMRT, TMZ and bevacizumab therapy, patients will have a brain MRI and if there is no evidence of disease progression, patients will receive 6 cycles of Bevacizumab and TMZ. Beginning a minimum of 28 days after the last radiation treatment the bevacizumab will be dosed at 10 mg/kg on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle. TMZ will be given at 150-200 mg/m2 qd on days 1-5 of each cycle. Each cycle is 28 days.</description>

            <description>Patients will be treated with hypofractionated IMRT (60 Gy in 10 Fx) and daily TMZ at 75 mg/m2 qd concurrent with IMRT (including weekends and holidays). Bevacizumab will be administered at 10 mg/kg on day 1 and day 15. Day 1 and the 1st Fx of IMRT must start on the same day. Four to six weeks following completion of concurrent IMRT, TMZ and bevacizumab therapy, patients will have a brain MRI and if there is no evidence of disease progression, patients will receive 6 cycles of Bevacizumab and TMZ. Beginning a minimum of 28 days after the last radiation treatment the bevacizumab will be dosed at 10 mg/kg on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle. TMZ will be given at 150-200 mg/m2 qd on days 1-5 of each cycle. Each cycle is 28 days.</description>
