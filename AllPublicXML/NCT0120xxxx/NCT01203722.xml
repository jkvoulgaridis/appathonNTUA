  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If transplantation using mismatched unrelated donors or non-first-degree relatives could be
      performed with an acceptable toxicity profile, an important unmet need would be served.
      Towards this goal, the current study extends our platform of nonmyeloablative, partially
      HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplant (BMT) and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (PBSCT)
      to the use of such donors, investigating up to several postgrafting immunosuppression
      regimens that incorporate high-dose Cy. Of central interest is the incorporation of sirolimus
      into this postgrafting immunosuppression regimen.

      The primary goal for phase 1 is to identify a transplant regimen associated with acceptable
      rates of severe acute GVHD and NRM by Day 100 and for phase 2 estimate the 6-month
      probability of survival without having had acute grade III- IV GVHD or graft failure.

          -  No previous allogeneic BMT (syngeneic BMT permissible).

          -  Active extramedullary leukemia or known active CNS involvement by malignancy. Such
             disease treated into remission is permitted.

        Donor Inclusion Criteria:

               -  First cousins

          -  The donor and recipient must be identical at at least 5 HLA alleles based on high
             resolution typing of HLA-A, -B, -Cw, -DRB1, and -DQB1, with at least one allele
             matched for a HLA class I gene (HLA-A, -B, or -Cw) and at least one allele matched for
             a class II gene (HLA-DRB1 or -DQB1).

          -  Meets institutional selection criteria and medically fit to donate.

          -  Lack of recipient anti-donor HLA antibody. Note: In some instances, low level,
             non-cytotoxic HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to be at a
             level well below that detectable by flow cytometry. This will be decided on a
             case-by-case basis by the PI and one of the immunogenetics directors. Pheresis to
             reduce anti-HLA antibodies is permissible; however eligibility to proceed with the
             transplant regimen would be contingent upon the result.

        Donor Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Donor must not be HLA identical to the recipient.

          -  Has not donated blood products to recipient.
