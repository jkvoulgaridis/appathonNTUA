      Background:

      - Artificial sweeteners, such as sucralose (brand name Splenda), are very commonly found in
      products such as diet soft drinks. Recently, researchers learned that these sweeteners may
      affect hormones in the body, especially when they are consumed in combination with real
      sugar. Changes in hormone levels may, in turn, result in changes in blood sugar, appetite,
      and weight. Researchers are interested in studying the effects of artificial sweeteners on
      the metabolism and hormonal levels of healthy volunteers.

      Objectives:

        -  To study the effects that artificial sweeteners have on hormone levels, blood sugar, and
           appetite.

        -  To evaluate whether artificial sweeteners change the rate at which food passes out of
           the stomach into the gut, or the rate at which the body absorbs sugar from the gut.

        -  To evaluate the effects that different amounts of artificial sweeteners have on hormone
           levels.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age.

      Design:

        -  This study will require one screening visit and four testing visits, scheduled on
           different days.

        -  At the screening visit, eligible participants will be screened with a physical
           examination, medical history, blood samples, and body measurements (including height,
           weight, body circumferences, and skin folds). Participants will also be asked about how
           much artificial sweetener they typically consume and will have taste tests, in which a
           small amount of flavored liquid is placed on the tongue and participants will name the
           flavor and rate its intensity.

        -  Participants will have four glucose tolerance tests on four different days. In
           preparation for the test, participants will not eat or drink anything but water for 12
           hours prior to the test. Blood will be drawn before the test, and participants will
           drink one of the following study liquids, selected at random:

        -  Plain water

        -  Water mixed with sucralose (the amount found in one 12 oz diet soft drink)

        -  Water mixed with sucralose (the amount found in 2.5 12 oz diet soft drinks)

        -  Water mixed with sucralose (the amount found in 3.7 12 oz diet soft drinks)

        -  Ten minutes after drinking the study liquid, participants will have a sugary drink that
           will allow researchers to measure sugar absorption and the speed with which food leaves
           the stomach.

        -  In addition, participants will complete questionnaires about hunger levels before
           drinking the sugar solution and at regular intervals for 2 hours afterward. Blood
           samples will be taken at regular intervals as well.

      Background

      Consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners is common practice in the US, and these chemicals are
      generally thought to be metabolically inert. However, recent data obtained from animal
      studies demonstrate that non-nutritive sweeteners play an active metabolic role within the
      gastrointestinal tract. Sweet-taste receptors, including the T1R family and Alpha-gustducin,
      respond not only to caloric sugars such as sucrose, but also to non-nutritive sweeteners,
      including sucralose (Splenda ) and acesulfame-K . In both humans and animals, these receptors
      have been shown to be present in glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) secreting L cells of the gut
      mucosa as well as in lingual taste buds , and serve as critical mediators of GLP-1 secretion
      . We have demonstrated in a previous study that diet soda augments glucose-stimulated GLP-1
      secretion . In addition, there is evidence in animals that activation of intestinal
      sweet-taste receptors by non-nutritive sweeteners enhances intestinal glucose absorption via
      upregulation of the glucose transporter, GLUT2 .

      Aims

      The purpose of this study is to broadly explore the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on
      glucose and glucoregulatory hormones in healthy humans. To this end, we plan the following:

      Primary Aim: To confirm that the non-nutritive sweetener sucralose (versus other ingredients
      in diet soda) augments glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion

      Secondary Aims:

        1. To study whether increased GLP-1 secretion due to non-nutritive sweeteners alters
           gastric emptying or satiety

        2. To determine a dose-response relationship for non-nutritive sweeteners on
           glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion

        3. To determine whether non-nutritive sweeteners alter the rate of intestinal glucose
           absorption

        4. To test whether non-nutritive sweeteners affect levels of other incretin or gut hormones

      Methods

      Healthy men and women ages greater than or equal to 18 years, and prepubertal children ages
      6-12 years, across a wide range of body mass indices will participate in a variety of paired
      experiments, in randomized order, with each subject serving as his or her own control. In
      each experiment, the subject will ingest either a non-nutritive sweetener or control, and a
      glucose load (oral glucose tolerance test). The following measurements will be obtained:

        1. Serial measurement of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, and other incretin and gut
           hormones

        2. Rate of gastric emptying using acetaminophen labeling in the oral glucose or mixed meal

        3. Measurement of hunger and satiety using validated questionnaires

        4. Measurement of intestinal glucose absorption using a glucose analog

    <description>Perceived ratings of hunger and satiety will be measured through the use of questionnaires during the OGTT or mixed meal tests. Starting 10 minutes before consumption of the non- nutritive sweetener/placebo, the subject with fill out a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which contains questions on hunger and satiety. The VAS will be filled out at -10,0,30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.</description>
