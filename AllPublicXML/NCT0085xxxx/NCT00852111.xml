  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Researchers have studied the causes of fatigue during treatments for various diseases,
           but these results have not been conclusive.

        -  More information on the physical changes that affect the body during treatment may help
           identify biological or chemical factors that contribute to patient fatigue, which may
           allow physicians to identify individuals who may be more at risk of feeling fatigue
           before, during, and after treatment for diseases such as cancer.

      Objectives:

        -  To identify factors contributing to fatigue in men who are undergoing radiation
           treatment for prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Men 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to receive localized radiation treatment
           for prostate cancer.

      Design:

        -  Six outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center, approximately on the same day and same
           time of day:

        -  First visit before beginning radiation treatment.

        -  Once a week for the first 2 weeks of the treatment, once at the midpoint of treatment,
           once at the end of treatment.

        -  Final visit 4 weeks after completion of radiation treatment.

        -  Initial visit will involve a physical examination and questions about medical history.

        -  Evaluations during the treatment period:

        -  Blood draws to identify cells and chemicals associated with inflammation and fatigue.

        -  Questions about physical activity, fatigue, depression, and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Although the underlying mechanisms of fatigue have been studied in several disease conditions
      the data are not conclusive, and this symptom remains poorly managed at present. Longitudinal
      studies related to treatment-related fatigue in prostate cancer patients have been conducted,
      but there are limited studies exploring the changes in physiologic mechanisms before and
      after radiotherapy which can identify individuals who are at risk for enduring fatigue during
      and after therapy. Fatigue is conceptualized as a multidimensional symptom which incorporates
      temporal, sensory, cognitive/mental, affective/emotional, behavioral, and physiological
      dimensions. This prospective, observational study is the first study to explore the
      molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying fatigue and the cluster of symptoms (urinary, sexual,
      gastrointestinal, psychiatric) experienced by prostate cancer patients undergoing External
      Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT).

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the changes in the self-reported fatigue;
      urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal symptoms; depression; fatigue catastrophizing; and
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) experienced by patients with and without prostate
      surgery before, during, and after EBRT completion. The secondary objectives of this study are
      to investigate the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile of EBRT-related fatigue (TNF alpha,
      IGF-I, IL-6, IL-8, TGF alpha and beta), determine changes in white blood cell gene
      expression, determine levels of oxidative stress and changes in potential biomarkers
      influencing oxidative stress from blood and buccal samples before and after EBRT completion
      and to relate these changes in the levels of these biological markers to self-reported
      fatigue; urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal symptoms; depression; fatigue catastrophizing;
      and HRQOL scores. This study also aims to measure the skeletal muscle strength,
      activity/fitness levels, cognitive function and energy expenditure of patients before, at
      completion of EBRT, and at least 6 months post EBRT and relate these findings with
      self-reported fatigue, physical symptoms (e.g. urinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual
      functioning), depression, and HRQOL scores before and after an exercise training program. The
      study also aims to describe changes in chemical profile in the brain that are associated with
      changes in fatigue symptoms using magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after EBRT.

        This protocol will enroll 262 men with prostate cancer, 161 (116 without prior
        prostatectomy and 45 with previous prostatectomy) who are scheduled to receive EBRT.
        Additional 56 men will be invited to participate in 8-week, an hour/day, 3 days/week
        aerobic exercise programs (CT [N=28], HIIT [N=28]). It will also enroll 45 men with
        prostate cancer who are not currently receiving any treatment to serve as the control group
        for the study. Ten additional prostate cancer subjects (with and without previous
        prostatectomy) who are scheduled to be treated with EBRT will also be enrolled for the
        pilot study subgroup to determine associations between fatigue with structural and chemical
        changes of the brain using magnetic resonance spectrospcopy (MRS). Thirty additional men
        (with and without previous prostatectomy) will be enrolled for the pilot study subgroup to
        collect buccal swabs to measure proteins related to mitochondrial function. The study will
        enroll a total of 262 subjects.

        All participants with any one of the following criteria will be excluded:

        Progressive or unstable disease of any body system causing clinically significant fatigue,
        including cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, psychiatric,
        endocrine, hematologic, renal, or immunologic disorders, and including patients with any of
        the following broad disease categories:

          9. Mitochondrial disease

        Participants unable to pass the English comprehension test will be unable to take the
        Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairement (CAMCT) test but will be asked to
        complete the other outcome measures of the study.

        Self report of color-blindness, verified by taking the Ishihara card test and scoring
        greater than 14 (more or less than 10 minutes), will exclude a participant from taking the
        STROOP test, but will be asked to complete the other outcome measures of the study. This
        card test will be administered only if the patient states they are color blind.

        - Individuals capable of becoming pregnant.
