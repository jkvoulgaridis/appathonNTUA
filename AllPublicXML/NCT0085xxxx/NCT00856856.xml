  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the BVS Everolimus
      Eluting Coronary Stent System (EECSS) in the treatment of patients with a maximum of two de
      novo native coronary artery lesions located in two different major epicardial vessels.

      Currently in development at Abbott Vascular. Not available for sale in the United States.

    <description>Scaffold thrombosis will be categorized as acute (≤ 1day), subacute (&gt;1day ≤ 30 days) and late (&gt;30 days) and will be defined as any of the following:
Clinical presentation of acute coronary syndrome with angiographic evidence of scaffold thrombosis (angiographic appearance of thrombus within or adjacent to a previously treated target lesion)
In the absence of angiography, any unexplained death, or acute MI (ST segment elevation or new Q-wave)* in the distribution of the target lesion within 30 days *(Non-specific ST /T changes and cardiac enzyme elevations do not suffice)
Any thromboses that occur less than 30 days after the index procedure will not be counted as restenosis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Total of 101 patients (intent to treat patient population [ITT]) were enrolled in the ABSORB Cohort B study at 12 clinical sites in Europe/Australia/New Zealand between March 19, 2009 and November 6, 2009. Only for assessing imaging outcomes at different follow-up periods, subjects were divided into Group 1 (n = 45) &amp; Group 2 (n = 56).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>ITT population were assessed for all clinical endpoints. For imaging outcomes,Group 1 (n=45) patients were followed up at 180 days, 2 &amp; 5 years; while Group 2 (n=56) patients at 1, 3 &amp; 5 years. Therefore, data related to imaging outcomes are available only for Group 1 at 180 days, 2 &amp; 5 years timeframe &amp; only for Group 2 at 1, 3 &amp; 5 years timeframe</pre_assignment_details>

Investigational devices available for the study were the Absorb BVS with a diameter of 3.0 mm and length of 18 mm. A total of 249 Absorb BVS were received at 12 investigational sites in the ABSORB Cohort B clinical study. Of the 249 devices received by the study sites, 102 were implanted in patients and 147 were returned to the sponsor.</description>

        <description>Scaffold thrombosis will be categorized as acute (≤ 1day), subacute (&gt;1day ≤ 30 days) and late (&gt;30 days) and will be defined as any of the following:
Clinical presentation of acute coronary syndrome with angiographic evidence of scaffold thrombosis (angiographic appearance of thrombus within or adjacent to a previously treated target lesion)
In the absence of angiography, any unexplained death, or acute MI (ST segment elevation or new Q-wave)* in the distribution of the target lesion within 30 days *(Non-specific ST /T changes and cardiac enzyme elevations do not suffice)
Any thromboses that occur less than 30 days after the index procedure will not be counted as restenosis.</description>

Investigational devices available for the study were the Absorb BVS with a diameter of 3.0 mm and length of 18 mm. A total of 249 Absorb BVS were received at twelve investigational sites in the ABSORB Cohort B clinical study. Of the 249 devices received by the study sites, 102 were implanted in patients and 147 were returned to the sponsor.</description>

Investigational devices available for the study were the Absorb BVS with a diameter of 3.0 mm and length of 18 mm. A total of 249 Absorb BVS were received at twelve investigational sites in the ABSORB Cohort B clinical study. Of the 249 devices received by the study sites, 102 were implanted in patients and 147 were returned to the sponsor.</description>
