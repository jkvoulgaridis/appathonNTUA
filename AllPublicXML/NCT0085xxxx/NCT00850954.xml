    <textblock>
      This trial studies the effect of an intervention program, Project CASA, on smoking cessation
      and reducing secondhand smoke exposure in Mexican American households. Project CASA,
      comprising pamphlets and fotonovelas (illustrated storybooks), may provide valuable
      information to participants on how to improve the air quality in their homes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Reduction in secondhand smoke exposure: The study will distinguish if a tailored
      intervention designed to address the needs of the target group will reduce objectively and
      subjectively measured secondhand smoke exposure of nonsmokers in Mexican American (MA)
      households.

      Ia. Develop tailored fotonovelas for intervention implementation. II. Smoking cessation: The
      study will identify if a tailored intervention designed to address the needs of the target
      group will help the primary smokers in the household quit smoking.

      III. Stages of change: The study will identify if the proposed intervention will have a
      significant impact on the primary smoker(s) progression through the stages of smoking
      cessation.

      IV. Knowledge and attitudes: The study will identify if the proposed intervention will result
      in better knowledge and changed attitudes towards secondhand smoke exposure among members of
      MA households (smokers and nonsmokers) compared to standard care.

      V. Perceived health: The study will distinguish whether reduced exposure to secondhand smoke
      would improve perceived health.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on smoking status.

      GROUP I (SMOKERS): Participants receive smoking cessation intervention materials based on
      transtheoretical model of change (TTM).

      GROUP II (NON-SMOKERS): Participants receive fotonovelas and other materials on secondhand
      smoking and how to assist the smoker in quitting.

      Participants are followed up at 6 and 12 months to assess for home air quality.

    <description>Method of analysis is a pre-post test analysis of covariance, ANCOVA, using a linear regression model (PROC REG in SAS). In this analysis, the prevalence of nicotine levels at the 6-month follow-up compared between conditions while controlling for baseline nicotine levels. Second hand smoke (SHS) exposure based on objective monitoring of SHS in each household (in the kitchen and TV room) over a 7-day period. A small, lightweight (16 gram) passive nicotine monitor used to measure exposure to nicotine.</description>
