  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prevent asthma symptoms (recurrent wheeze) in childhood by
      supplementation with high dose vitamin D to the mother during pregnancy. Participants are
      mothers and children of the ABC (Asthma Begins in Childhood) cohort. Mothers are recruited
      during pregnancy and receive daily supplement with 2400 IU of Vitamin D3 or placebo from week
      24 og gestation to 1 week after delivery. In addition all mothers are advised to take the
      recommended dose of 400 IU vitamin D daily. The mothers in ABC also participate in an
      interventional trial with fish oil supplementation, and the vitamin D randomization is
      stratified by fish oil treatment group. The child is followed with acute and planned vits at
      the research unit, and wheeze is diagnosed according to predefined algorithms.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In a secondary analyses, we will determine the effect of 17q21 genotype on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of asthma/wheeze. We will compute hazard ratios for the reduction in asthma/wheeze risk associated with prenatal supplementation, stratified by rs12936231. rs12936231 is a functional SNP influencing expression of ORMDL3, and given the role of ORMDL3 as a key sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator, we will subsequently investigate the relative abundance of sphingolipids between those in the vitamin D Intervention arm and those in the placebo group, stratified by 17q21 genotype. Finally we will identify interactions between prenatal vitamin D supplementation, rs12936231 genotype and sphingolipid metabolism in the risk of asthma/wheeze by age three.</description>
