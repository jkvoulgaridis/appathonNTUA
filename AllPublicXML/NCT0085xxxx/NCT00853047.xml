  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of telotristat etiprate
      (LX1606) versus a placebo control in participants with symptomatic carcinoid syndrome not
      managed by stable-dose long-acting octreotide therapy. Following determination of the
      maximally tolerated or effective dose, cohort expansion will occur to confirm effect on
      symptoms and safety profile.
