    <measure>Mean Weekly Total 4 Symptom Score (T4SS) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>During the treatment period until week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The T4SS is the sum of the symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus and ocular pruritus. Each of the symptoms is rated retrospectively over the past 24 hours using a 4-point 0 to 3 scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Total T4SS is the sum of the idividual scores and ranges from 0-12. Increasing values are associated with increasing severity of disease.</description>

        <description>The T4SS is the sum of the symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus and ocular pruritus.

Total T4SS is the sum of the idividual scores and ranges from 0-12. Increasing values are associated with increasing severity of disease.</description>

        <title>Mean Monthly Total 4 Symptom Score (T4SS) for Month 6 of the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The T4SS is the sum of the symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus and ocular pruritus. Each of the symptoms is rated retrospectively over the past 24 hours using a 4-point 0 to 3 scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Total T4SS is the sum of the idividual scores and ranges from 0-12. Increasing values are associated with increasing severity of disease.</description>

        <description>Individual symptom scores include scores for Sneezing, Rhinorrhea, Nasal Pruritus, Ocular Pruritus, and Nasal Congestion.
The subjects had to evaluate the severity of the symptoms retrospectively over the past 24 hours (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

        <title>Mean Monthly Individual Symptoms Scores During Month 4 of the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Individual symptom scores include scores for Sneezing, Rhinorrhea, Nasal Pruritus, Ocular Pruritus, and Nasal Congestion.
The subjects had to evaluate the severity of the symptoms retrospectively over the past 24 hours (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

        <population>31 patients were included in the ITT-Set for each treatment group.
