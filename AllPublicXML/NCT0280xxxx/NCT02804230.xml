      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial effectiveness
      of Exablate thermal ablation of a focal epileptic target area in the brain of patients
      suffering from medication-refractory epilepsy, using the Exablate transcranial system to
      produce multiple sonications targeted in the focus of interest. The investigators will
      establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial effectiveness
      of Exablate thermal ablation of a focal epileptic target area in the brain of patients
      suffering from medication-refractory epilepsy, using the Exablate transcranial system to
      produce multiple sonications targeted in the lesion of interest. The Investigators will
      establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.

      The hypotheses tested are that:

        1. MRgFUS treatment of focal epilepsy is feasible and safe, with a low risk of adverse
           effects as evaluated during the follow-up period.

        2. Exablate treatment of foci in patients with focal epilepsy reduces the seizure
           frequency.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Seizure refractory to at least three standard antiepileptic medications at adequate
             doses, failed for lack of efficacy. This may include a rescue medication designated
             use as PRN.

          -  A minimum of 3 seizures per month for 2 months by patient diary started at intake
             interview.

          -  Subjects should have focal seizures with or without secondary generalization.

          -  Subjects should have evidence suggesting the focus within the periventricular white
             matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, or mesial temporal lob has been
             previously determined as the source of seizures by standard clinical criteria
             including at least the description of seizures, physical examination, neuroimaging,
             and video EEG monitoring capturing at least one seizure.

          -  Subjects must be taking 2 medications during the Baseline period and the dosage must
             be stable.

          -  A diagnosis of intractable lesional epilepsy which may include: Hypothalamic
             hamartoma, Periventricular nodular hetereotopia, Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial
             tumor (DNET), Cortical dysplasia, Tuberous sclerosis, Focal cortical gliosis, or
             Predominately unilateral Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with standard contraindications for MR imaging such as non-MRI compatible
             implanted metallic devices including cardiac pacemakers, size limitations, etc.

          -  Individuals who are not able or willing to tolerate the required prolonged stationary
             supine position during treatment (can be up to 4 hrs of total table time.).

          -  Patients with malignant brain tumors.

          -  Patients with a known history of psychogenic non-epileptic spells in the last three
             years.

          -  Patients with a vagal nerve stimulator, deep brain stimulator, other implanted
             electronic device, or prior radiofrequency lesion techniques.

          -  Lesions in the brainstem or cerebellum.

          -  Subjects with symptomatic generalized epilepsy.

          -  Subjects with only simple partial seizures.

          -  Subjects who have had convulsive status epilepticus within 12 months prior to
             baseline.

          -  Subjects with a prior diagnosis of psychogenic/non-epileptic seizures within the last
             5 years.
