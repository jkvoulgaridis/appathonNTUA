  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tafenoquine (TQ) is an 8-aminoquinoline anti-malarial drug which is in development as a
      single-dose treatment for the radical cure of P.vivax malaria when given with standard doses
      of chloroquine. Currently, the only available drug for radical cure is primaquine (PQ) which
      requires administration over 14 days, resulting in poor compliance. In Indonesia, chloroquine
      has been replaced by artemisinin-based combination therapy (i.e. ACTs) due to widespread
      chloroquine resistance. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose of
      tafenoquine when co-administered with an ACT (i.e. DHA-PQP). This single-center,
      double-blind, double-dummy, randomized study will test the superiority of DHA-PQP plus TQ
      against DHA-PQP alone in the prevention of P. vivax malaria relapse at 6 months. The study
      will be conducted in male Indonesian soldiers diagnosed with P.vivax malaria on return from
      deployment to a malarious region of Indonesia. A PQ plus DHA-PQP comparator arm is included
      to provide an informal comparison against the standard 14 day treatment for P.vivax malaria
      in Indonesia. Subjects who are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient (G6PD deficient)
      will be excluded due to the risk of acute hemolysis following dosing with 8-aminoquinolines
      drugs. Subjects who have a recurrence of P.vivax malaria during the study will be treated
      with an ACT plus PQ (0.5mg/kg for 14 days), in line with local treatment guidelines. At the
      end of the 6 month follow up period, any subject who has not relapsed will be given open
      label PQ (0.5mg/kg daily for 14 days) to minimize the likelihood of relapse after the study.
      Approximately 200 subjects will be screened to achieve 150 randomized subjects. The total
      duration of study for each subject will be 180-195 days. This study is being carried out to
      support registration of TQ in Indonesia and other countries where ACTs are first line
      therapy.

      <recruitment_details>This was a single center randomized, double-blind, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tafenoquine co-administered with DHA-PQP for the radical cure of P.vivax malaria in Indonesian soldiers. Participants with microscopy-confirmed P.vivax were recruited at 2malaria-free bases in Java following deployment to Indonesian Papua.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 164 participants were screened of whom 14 failed during screening and 150 were randomized to receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) only, tafenoquine+DHA-PQP and primaquine+DHA-PQP in a ratio of 1:1:1.</pre_assignment_details>

Blinded treatment started on Day 1 or Day 2. Participants who did not relapse before Day 180 were administered 0.5 milligrams (mg)/kg open-label primaquine once daily for 14 days after completion of the double-blind phase.</description>

        <title>Time to Relapse of P. Vivax Malaria</title>
        <description>Relapse is defined by a positive blood smear with or without vivax symptoms. Relapse is described as any recurrence of P. vivax malaria after clearance of the initial infection. The time to relapse (number of days between the date of first positive count and date of Study Day 1) was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The median number of days to relapse along with 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) has been presented for each treatment group.</description>

          <title>Time to Relapse of P. Vivax Malaria</title>
          <description>Relapse is defined by a positive blood smear with or without vivax symptoms. Relapse is described as any recurrence of P. vivax malaria after clearance of the initial infection. The time to relapse (number of days between the date of first positive count and date of Study Day 1) was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The median number of days to relapse along with 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) has been presented for each treatment group.</description>

        <description>Time to fever clearance is defined as time from first dose of treatment to the time when body temperature falls to normal and remains normal for at least 48 hours up to the Day 7 visit. Fever clearance is considered to have been achieved once an initial temperature of greater than 37.4 degree Celsius is reduced to a value less than or equal to 37.4 degree Celsius, in the absence of value greater than 37.4 degree Celsius in the following 48 hours up to Day 7 visit.

Clinical concern range included:absolute QTcF interval (upper: &gt;480 milliseconds) and increase from Baseline in QTcF (upper: &gt;=60 milliseconds). Data for maximum post-Baseline increase &gt;=60 and &gt;480 milliseconds has been presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Body Temperature Results Relative to Normal Range Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline</title>
        <description>Body temperature was measured with participants in semi-supine position after 5 minutes of rest. Data was categorized as: body temperature 'low: &lt;36.5 degrees celsius', 'high: &gt;37.3 degrees celsius' and 'To Normal or No change'. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose vital sign value category was unchanged (e.g.,High to High), or whose value became normal, are recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100%. Day 1 was considered as Baseline.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Pulse Rate Results Relative to Normal Range Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline</title>
        <description>Pulse rate was measured with participants in semi-supine position after 5 minutes of rest. Data was categorized as: pulse rate low: &lt;60 beats per minute [bpm], high: &gt;100 bpm and 'To normal or No change'. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose vital sign value category was unchanged (e.g.,High to High), or whose value became normal, are recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100%. Day 1 was considered as Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Methemoglobin/ Total Hemoglobin</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of methemoglobin/Total Hemoglobin (Hb). Methemoglobin is a type of Hb in the form of metalloprotein that cannot bind with oxygen, measured as percentage of methemoglobin in total hemoglobin. Change from Baseline is calculated as Post-Dose Visit Value minus Baseline value. Day 1 was considered as Baseline.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points to analyze the hemoglobin level. Hemoglobin drop is defined as any one of the following occurring in the first 15 days of the study: a relative hemoglobin decrease of &gt;=30% from Baseline, or an absolute hemoglobin decrease of &gt;3 grams per liter from Baseline, or a drop in absolute hemoglobin to &lt;7.0 grams per decilter (g/dL). Number of participants with a protocol-defined hemoglobin SAEs has been presented.</description>
