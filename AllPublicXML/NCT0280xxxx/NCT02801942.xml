  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that early changes in the immune system in New Onset Type 1 Diabetes
      Mellitus (NOT1D) subjects can be detected in immune cells from the inguinal lymph nodes
      (iLN), which will be distinct from changes observed in peripheral blood derived immune cells.
      Therefore this study will assess and compare the molecular immune profile of cells derived
      from the iLN in healthy and NOT1D subjects, to understand the immunological processes that
      may lead to beta cell destruction. It is a multi-center, non-drug treatment study. Up to 15
      subjects in each group, namely healthy subjects and NOT1D subjects, will be evaluated in the
      study. A data look will be carried out after the recruitment of a cohort of up to 5 healthy
      subjects, to determine if the quality and quantity of cells derived from aspirate or core
      biopsy or from peripheral blood are likely to be sufficient to continue the study to meet its
      primary objective. An interim analysis will be carried out after the recruitment of 5
      evaluable healthy subjects and 5 evaluable NOT1D subjects. The primary purpose of this
      interim analysis will be to facilitate decision making and study design for a potential
      follow-up interventional study.

    <description>Peripheral blood samples were collected from both healthy and NOT1D participants at the indicated time points for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. The analysis was based upon Safety Population which comprised of all participants who complete any study assessment. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a multi-center, non-drug treatment study to compare differences in immune cells derived from the inguinal lymph nodes (iLN) and peripheral blood of New Onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (NOT1D) participants and healthy volunteers. Participants were enrolled at a single center in United Kingdom.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants underwent iLN biopsies by two methods; fine-needle aspirate (FNA) and core needle biopsy. Participants underwent screening followed by study visits and follow-up. A total of 43 participants were screened, of which, 21 were considered as screen failures and 22 were enrolled into the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Peripheral blood samples were collected from both healthy and NOT1D participants at the indicated time points for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. The analysis was based upon Safety Population which comprised of all participants who complete any study assessment. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Leukocyte Subsets Including B Lymphocytes, Classical B Lymphocytes, Double Negative B Lymphocytes, Naive B Lymphocytes, Plasmablast and Transitional B Lymphocytes in iLN</title>
        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA.

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA.Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Peripheral blood samples were collected from both healthy and NOT1D participants at the indicated time points for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA.</description>

        <description>Peripheral blood samples were collected from both healthy and NOT1D participants at the indicated time points for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Peripheral blood samples were collected from both healthy and NOT1D participants at the indicated time points for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. NA indicates that data was not availble. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

        <description>Peripheral blood samples were collected from both healthy and NOT1D participants at the indicated time points for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T Reg cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA.</description>

        <description>Peripheral blood samples were collected from both healthy and NOT1D participants at the indicated time points for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T Reg cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA.</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T Reg cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T Reg cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

          <title>Percentage of Leukocyte Subsets Including B Lymphocytes, Classical B Lymphocytes, Double Negative B Lymphocytes, Naive B Lymphocytes, Plasmablast and Transitional B Lymphocytes in iLN Core Biopsies and iLN FNA</title>
          <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from Monocyte Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Leukocyte Subsets Including Central Memory Conv T Cells, Effector Memory Conv T Cells, Naive Conv T Cells and Stem Cell Memory-like Conv T Cells in iLN Core Biopsies and iLN FNA</title>
        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles). NA indicates that data was not available.</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T Reg cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

          <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T Reg cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Leukocyte Subsets Including CD15s+ Conv T Cells, CD69+ Conv T Cells, Helios+ Conv T Cells and Ki67+ Conv T Cells in iLN Core Biopsies and iLN FNA</title>
        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T Reg cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Samples were collected including up to two FNA passages of iLN and up to five core biopsies of iLN at the indicated time point from both healthy and NOT1D participants for the analysis of leukocyte subsets from T Reg cell Panel. Candidate biomarkers associated with either location of cells and/or disease-status were identified using flow cytometry technique. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze data separately for each flow cytometry cell type to provide estimates for comparisons. Fixed categorical were group, sample type, and the interaction of group with sample type, where Group was HV or NOT1D, and sample type was peripheral blood, core biopsy or FNA. Only those participants with data available at specific time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>
