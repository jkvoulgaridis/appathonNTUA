  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the hypothesis that cardiogoniometry (CGM) is helpful to identify the
      site of the culprit vessel in patients with NSTEMI in comparison to 12-lead ECG.

      NSTEMI constitutes a clinical syndrome subset of acute coronary syndrome which is most
      usually caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. It is defined by
      &quot;electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-segment depression or prominent T-wave inversion and/or
      positive biomarkers of necrosis (e.g., troponin) in the absence of ST-segment elevation and
      in an appropriate clinical setting (chest discomfort or angina equivalent)&quot;. The standard 12
      lead ECG is not commonly sensitive at localising the site of the culprit lesion and even
      coronary angiography may not always be helpful as the majority of lesions will not have
      angiographically evident thrombus. Patients with an ACS may have multivessel disease and it
      is often not possible to identify the precise site of the culprit lesion. In patients with
      multivessel disease, interventionists will frequently target the most severe stenosis even
      though this is not necessarily the acute lesion.

      CGM (Cardiogoniometry cardiologic explorer, Enverdis GmbH medical solutions, Germany) is a
      form of 3D vector electrocardiography which can provide quantitative analysis of myocardial
      depolarisation and repolarisation. It has CE mark and has been shown to be more sensitive and
      specific than standard 12-lead ECG at diagnosing stable coronary artery disease. Furthermore,
      recent work has shown CGM to be more sensitive at detecting patients with NSTEMI than
      conventional 12-lead ECG

      In summary, there is evidence that CGM is more efficacious than 12-lead ECG at the diagnosis
      of both stable CAD and ACS. The hope is this that the clinical application can be extended to
      localising ischaemia in the culprit vessel and be a valuable diagnostic aid.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of CGM to identify the
      culprit vessel in patients presenting with NSTEMI. Secondary endpoint will be to evaluate the
      efficacy of CGM to detect a significant coronary stenosis (defined as â‰¥70%) as compared to a
      standard 12-lead ECG

    <description>Every patient in the study will have a cardiogoniometry recording performed by the Cardiologic Explorer whilst an inpatient on the ward. This will then be taken for interpretation to see if it indicates what vessel is the culprit causing their NSTEMI. The researcher interpreting the cardiogoniometry recording will be blind to the results of the ECG and the coronary angiography,</description>
