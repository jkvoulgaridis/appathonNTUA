  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' preclinical data have demonstrated the feasibility of fluorescence-guided
      tumor resection by Cancer Vision Goggles (CVG) with LS301 in animal models. In this study,
      the investigators will conduct intraoperative imaging procedures that have minimal
      interference with ongoing surgery. The underlying hypothesis is that the accurate detection
      of all cancer cells highlighted by LS301 during surgery will reduce the number of breast
      cancer patients with margin positivity to less than 5%, compared to the current surgical
      paradigm of greater than 20%. The pilot study will obtain critical data required to address
      the larger question of surgical margin assessment in a full Phase I clinical trial.

    <description>Optimal dose will be the dose at which fewer than 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed and optimal image quality is observed. It need not be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) if optimal image quality is observed at a lower dose than the MTD.
DLT is defined as any grade 2 or above toxicity that occurs during the hour after injection that is considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to LS301
Toxicities will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0</description>

    <measure>Ability of LS301 to predict presence of positive margins around partial mastectomy (Phase II)</measure>

    <description>-The histopathological results of margin positivity has the following possible results: margin negative, margin positive at LS301 and CVG identified locations, margin positive at LS301 and CVG unidentified locations. Using LS301 and CVG, the exercised tissue will be considered to be margin positive and have ink marked at the identified locations if any positive margins are observed; otherwise, the margin is considered negative. Diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of LS301 and CVG for margin positivity by histology will established and margin positivity rate, defined as the proportion of tumors with histopathologically confirmed positive margins but missed by CVG, will be estimated.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed Stage I-II breast cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy
             and SLN biopsy.

          -  Negative nodal basin clinical exam.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for surgery.

          -  Receiving any investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to ICG or other agents used in the study,
             include known iodide or seafood allergy. The investigators do not expect many of these
             adverse reactions with LS301 because it is not radioactive and does not possess
             iodinated counter ions.

          -  Presence of underlying lung disease

          -  Pregnant. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test no more than 7 days before start of participation.

          -  Breastfeeding. Patients who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with LS301.
