  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients with brain metastases (BM) have poor prognosis. Current treatments produce
      limited efficacy. Recent advance in cancer immunotherapy has provided important new means to
      treat cancer patients at advanced stages. This study is designed to perform a clinical trial
      to treat advanced caner patients with brain metastases with personalized dendritic cell-based
      cellular vaccines. The patients will receive vaccines consisting of mRNA tumor antigen pulsed
      DCs. Immune response to the immunized tumor antigens will be monitored. Safety and efficacy
      will be observed in this study.

      This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I study designed to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular tumor vaccines for cancer patients with
      brain metastases (BM). BM patients will undergo tumor resection or biopsy and the tumor
      tissues will be analyzed for the expression of tumor antigens and immune-related genes. The
      patients will be immunized with DCs pulsed with mRNA encoded tumor antigens. Patients will be
      immunized with DC vaccines on a biweekly basis. Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The
      objective of this study is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines and to
      deterimine the antitumor specific T cell responses. The efficacy of the vaccines will be
      determined using RANO-BM criteria, progression-free survival and overall survival.
