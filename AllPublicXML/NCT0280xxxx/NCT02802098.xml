  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot proof of concept, open-label clinical trial. Twenty-five subjects
      will be enrolled in 6 sites.

      Metastatic breast cancer patients with disease progression to bevacizumab maintenance
      treatment will be potential candidates.

      Bevacizumab maintenance will be considered as six weeks of bevacizumab treatment in
      monotherapy, with hormonal treatment or combined with chemotherapy in the context of previous
      bevacizumab plus chemotherapy regimens.

      When progression to bevacizumab maintenance treatment occurs, patients will enter the trial
      and will start receiving DURVALUMAB 10 mg/kg Q2W IV infusion plus bevacizumab 10mg/kg IV
      infusion every 2 weeks. The patients will undergo a tumor biopsy before the first dose of
      DURVALUMAB, and after one month of combined treatment - the blood sampling will continue on a
      monthly basis. The treatment will continue until disease progression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired resistance against chronic administration of the monoclonal antibody antiangiogenic
      agent like bevacizumab in breast cancer is caused in a fraction of patients by an immune
      reprogramming. The immune reprogramming can be detected by elevated counts of Tregs in
      peripheral blood, aberrant pattern of cytokines, and elevated concentrations of kynurenine
      and immunosuppressive/vasodilator prostaglandins. The addition of DURVALUMAB to a
      bevacizumab-based treatment would delay or abrogate these changes and be of therapeutic
      interest in this scenario.

    <description>Durvalumab is an investigational human monoclonal antibody directed against programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). PD-L1 can be expressed by tumours to evade detection by the immune system through binding to PD-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Durvalumab blocks the PD-L1 interaction with PD-1, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics.</description>
