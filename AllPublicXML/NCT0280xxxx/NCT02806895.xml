    <measure>Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) at 2 Hours Post-dose (Approximately at Tmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were instructed to drive with steady lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the slower (right) traffic lane, while maintaining a constant speed of 95 kilometers (km) per hour (hr). Deviation was measured by the vehicle's speed and lateral distance to the left lane line and was continuously recorded. Individual improvement was defined as a decrease in SDLP below the negative value of threshold; individual impairment was defined as an increase in SDLP above the threshold or failure to complete the driving test due to sleepiness or subjects related safety concerns.</description>

    <description>Driving lapses (also known as lane drift, defined as deviations &gt; 100 cm from the mean lateral position and from the absolute lateral position for 8 seconds. Driving performance will be assessed using a standardized on-road driving test on Day 7 (Visit 4) and on Day 14 (Visit 5). A practice driving test will be done during the screening period to familiarize the subject with the vehicle and test scenario, assess if the subject can adequately operate the manual transmission vehicle, and determine if any safety concerns exist that exclude the subject from participating in the study.</description>

        <title>Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) at 2 Hours Post-dose (Approximately at Tmax)</title>
        <description>Subjects were instructed to drive with steady lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the slower (right) traffic lane, while maintaining a constant speed of 95 kilometers (km) per hour (hr). Deviation was measured by the vehicle's speed and lateral distance to the left lane line and was continuously recorded. Individual improvement was defined as a decrease in SDLP below the negative value of threshold; individual impairment was defined as an increase in SDLP above the threshold or failure to complete the driving test due to sleepiness or subjects related safety concerns.</description>

        <title>PVT Number of Errors of Commission at 6 Hours Post-dose</title>
        <description>The PVT was administered at screening for practice only, and at pre-dose and within 30 minutes before each driving test on Days 7 and 14 (Visits 4 and 5, respectively). The test was administered over 10 minutes with visual stimuli appearing randomly at variable intervals of 2 to 10 seconds. Subjects were instructed to respond to the appearance of a visual stimulus on a computer screen by pushing a response button as quickly as possible. Errors of commission were measured as the number of responses without a stimulus or false starts with (RT &lt; 100 msec).</description>
