  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label, 2-period, 2-treatment, fixed-sequence, cross-over study
      in approximately 12 healthy subjects employing administration of a single oral dose of
      PF-06463922 in the fasted state alone, and with multiple dosing of rifampin 600 mg once a day
      to estimate the effect of multiple dose rifampin on the single dose PK of PF-06463922.

    <description>Participants abstained from all concomitant treatments, except for the treatment of adverse events. Limited use of non-prescription medications that were not believed to affect participant safety or the overall results of the study might be permitted on a case by case basis following approval by the sponsor. All participants were questioned about concomitant treatment at each clinic visit. Treatments taken within 28 days before the first dose of study investigational product were documented as a prior treatment. Treatment taken after the first dose of study investigational product were documented as concomitant treatments. Females taking hormone replacement therapy might be eligible to participate in this study if they were willing to discontinue therapy at least 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and remained off hormonal therapy for duration of the study.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a casual relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: 1) resulted in death; 2) was life threatening (immediate risk of death); 3) required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 4) resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); 5) resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE included both non-serious adverse events and serious adverse events.</description>

        <description>PR interval was the interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization. Criteria for potentially clinically important changes (chg) in ECG were defined as: absolute values of PR interval &gt;=200 to &lt;220 msec, &gt;=220 to &lt;240 msec, &gt;=240 to &lt;260 msec and &gt;=260 msec. Increase from baseline &gt;=40, &lt;60, &gt;=60 and &lt;80, &gt;=80, and relative change from baseline &gt;25%. The beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole (QT) interval corrected using the Fridericia formular (QTCF) of 450 to &lt;480 msec, 480 to &lt;500 msec and &gt;=500 msec, or an increase of 30 to &lt;60 msec of &gt;=60 msec.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a casual relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: 1) resulted in death; 2) was life threatening (immediate risk of death); 3) required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 4) resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); 5) resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE included both non-serious adverse events and serious adverse events.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a casual relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: 1) resulted in death; 2) was life threatening (immediate risk of death); 3) required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 4) resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); 5) resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE included both non-serious adverse events and serious adverse events.</description>
