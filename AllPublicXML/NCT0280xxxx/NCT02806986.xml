      Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in order to have approximately 20 adult subjects
      and 20 pediatric subjects treated with subcutaneously administered Immune Globulin
      Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (IGSC 20%) who complete the
      entire study. This study will include 3 study stages: Screening/Previous Regimen Phase, IGSC
      20% Treatment Stage 1 (13 IGSC 20% weekly doses), and IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 2 (39 IGSC 20%
      weekly doses). A total of 52 doses of IGSC 20% will be administered with a final follow-up
      visit 1 week after the last dose at Week 53. Subjects/caregivers will be trained on
      self-administration of IGSC 20% by the clinical site personnel.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, efficacy, PK, safety and
      tolerability study of IGSC 20% in subjects with PI. Approximately 60 subjects will be
      enrolled in order to have approximately 20 adult subjects and 20 pediatric subjects treated
      with subcutaneously administered IGSC 20% who complete the entire study.

      This study will include 3 study stages: Screening/Previous Regimen Phase, IGSC 20% Treatment
      Stage 1 (13 IGSC 20% weekly doses), and IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 2 (39 IGSC 20% weekly
      doses).

      Previous Regimen Phase: Subjects will be infused with their current ongoing (&quot;previous
      regimen&quot;) intravenous immune globulin/subcutaneous immune globulin (IVIG/SCIG) regimen
      (pIV/pSC) in the clinic to obtain 2 trough immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (obtained prior to
      each pIV/pSC infusion) on each subject's &quot;previous regimen&quot;.

      20% IGSC Treatment Stage 1: The first dose of IGSC 20% will be administered at the clinical
      site immediately after Baseline assessments are complete (SC#1). All subjects will receive 13
      IGSC 20% infusions at weekly intervals. IgG trough blood levels will be measured at all
      (except SC#3) study visits All other doses of IGSC 20% may be infused at home (once properly
      trained) or in the clinic. The Treatment Stage 1 dose will continue into IGSC 20% Treatment
      Stage 2.

      IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 2: The IGSC 20% dose (mg/kg) will remain constant with no dose
      adjustment permitted in this phase, unless it is absolutely medically necessary. While all
      subjects will have a SC#17 clinic visit and standard assessments, serial pharmacokinetics
      (PK) sampling will only be performed in a subset of adult subjects:

    <measure>Mean Trough Total IgG Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Previous Regimen Phase: 2 timepoints pre-dose of pIV or pSC between Screening and Baseline (up to 8 weeks). IGSC 20% Phase: Pre-dose of IGSC 20% at Baseline (Week 1), Weeks 2, 5, 9, 13, 17, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, and at Week 53</time_frame>
    <description>Mean trough total IgG concentration during the previous regimen phase was calculated as the average of the trough concentrations at the previous IVIG (pIV)#1 and pIV#2 visits for participants entering the study on a previous IVIG regimen, or at the previous subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG) (pSC)#1 and baseline/SC#1 visits for participants entering the study on a previous SCIG regimen. Mean trough total IgG concentration during the IGSC 20% phase was calculated as the average of all steady state trough concentrations measured during the IGSC 20% treatment stage 2 at the visits corresponding to Weeks 17, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 and 53.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with primary immunodeficiency (PI) requiring IgG replacement were enrolled. Study has 3 stages: Screening/Previous Regimen Phase, Treatment Stage 1 and 2. Total 62 participants entered Previous Regimen Phase, of which 61 entered in Treatment Stage 1 to receive IGSC 20%. Study was conducted in 8 countries from June 2016 to May 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants had no SBI within last 3 months prior to screening and were on immunoglobulin G (IgG) replacement therapy (stable regimen via intravenous [IV] or subcutaneous [SC] infusion) for ≥3 consecutive months prior to screening. Participants receiving IVIG prior to study entry must have received a dosage of ≥200 mg/kg per infusion.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Following the previous regimen phase (screening), participants were enrolled to receive 13 immune globulin subcutaneous (human), 20% caprylate/chromatography purified (IGSC 20%) infusions at weekly intervals from baseline (Week 1) up to Week 13 in treatment stage 1. Participants were infused with IGSC 20% at a 1:1 dose-equivalent regimen from their previous regimen (or a minimum IGSC 20% dose of 100 milligram per kilogram per week (mg/kg/week) if the derived 1:1 dose from the previous regimen was lower) and followed by 39 IGSC 20% infusions at weekly intervals from Week 14 up to Week 52 in treatment stage 2. Dose adjustments were permitted per the study protocol and at the Investigator’s discretion in the treatment stage 1. However, dose remained constant in treatment stage 2 unless it was absolutely medically necessary to change the dose, and such change required prior consultation with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor. A final follow-up visit occurred at Week 53.</description>

            <description>Participants were required to attend the clinic for infusion with their previous ongoing (“previous regimen”) IVIG/SCIG regimen (pIV/pSC) to obtain 2 trough IgG levels (obtained prior to each pIV/pSC infusion) on each participant’s &quot;previous regimen&quot;. Trough levels for total IgG determined during the Previous Regimen Phase were used to confirm final eligibility for participants entering the study to receive treatment with IGSC 20% (must be ≥500 milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]).</description>

However, dose remained constant in treatment stage 2 unless it was absolutely medically necessary to change the dose, and such change required prior consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. A final follow-up visit occurred at Week 53.</description>

          <title>Rate of Days of Work/School/Daily Activities Missed Per Participants Per Year Due to Infections and Related Treatment</title>
          <description>The rate of days of work, school or daily activities missed per participant per year during IGSC 20% treatment was calculated as the total number of days of work/school/daily activities missed divided by the total duration of exposure in years across all participants. The 2-sided 95% CI was determined from a generalized linear model for poisson regression for the log-transformed number of days with log transformed duration of exposure in years as an offset variable.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on the efficacy evaluable population which included all participants who received at least 1 dose of IGSC 20%.</population>
