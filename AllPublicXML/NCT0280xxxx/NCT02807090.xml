  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supervised exercises are the first line therapy for patients with chronic low back pain. The
      lumbar segmental stabilization (LSE) is a specific training for the muscles of the lumbar
      spine, which aims to improve neuromuscular control, strength and endurance of the muscles
      that promotes stability to the spine. The circular dance (CD) belongs to the group of
      complementary and integrative practices entered in Public Health Care in Brazil, and has been
      used to improve several aspects related to physical and mental states such as flexibility,
      posture, strength and muscular endurance, awareness or scheme body, pain control and strains.
      There are few studies evaluating the circular dance effect on back pain. The aim of this
      study is to compare the effects of lumbar stabilization exercises and circular dance for
      improvement in non specific low back pain in middle-aged women.

      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of CD with ESL exercises on pain and functional disability
      in women with nonspecific chronic low back pain (DLCI). METHOD: Thirty-eight women, aged
      35-60 years, were randomly assigned to two groups: 1) Circular Dance group (gDC); 2) Lumbar
      Stabilization Exercise group (gESL). The primary clinical outcomes were pain, assessed using
      the Numerical Pain Scale and functional disability by the Roland Morris Disability
      Questionnaire and the secondary outcomes were: Depression assessed by the Beck Depression
      Inventory; Anxiety by the Numerical Anxiety Scale; Global Perception with the Global Effect
      Perception Scale, Signs and Symptoms of Adverse Effects analyzed by the Collective Subject
      Discourse and Quality of Life method using the Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire
      (SF-36). The groups were treated twice a week for 60 minutes for 8 weeks totaling 16
      sessions. Each participant was assessed before and after treatment and at follow-up 12 and 24
      weeks.

    <description>There will be 16 sessions, twice a week, with 40-60 minutes each session. In this arm the participants will learn basic notions about anatomy and biomechanics and the lumbar stabilization technique. They will be evaluated by a pressure biofeedback in the first day that will be used in the training. The lumbar stabilization technique consists of three stages: cognitive, associated and automatic. The biofeedback is used in the first stage and it helps patients to do the best contraction of stabilization muscles in different levels of pressure. Then, in stage two the patients do the contraction without the use of biofeedback and in the last phase different exercises are associated with the contraction of stabilization muscles.</description>
