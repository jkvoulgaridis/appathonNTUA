  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is the stage III of the FIGO ovarian cancer staging. It
      corresponds to an advanced stage with a relative 5 year survival rate of 52%. The multimodal
      treatment approach combines neoadjuvant chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery of macroscopic
      lesions, and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). It has significantly improved
      survival rate in patients with ovarian PC and decreased recurrence and mortality rate by 21%.
      The efficacy of HIPEC is based on chemotherapy potentiated by the hyperthermia (43Â°).
      However, the cellular mechanisms involved are not fully understood, but they include cell
      death pathways and heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsp90). RICCI et al. showed, based on
      pre-clinical models, that the efficacy of HIPEC was partly due to the overexpression and
      exposure of HSP90 on the cell surface leaded to an anti-cancer immune response. The aims of
      this study are to validate these findings in tissue samples of patients with ovarian PC. We
      will constitute a bank of isolated tumor samples before and after HIPEC and measure
      postoperative HSP90 serum levels in order to establish if they are predictive of a response.
      HSPs expression on the cancer cell surface will be determined by flow cytometry. Forty-four
      patients will be included. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of HIPEC will broaden
      therapeutic possibilities including the use of new immunotherapy. The multimodal approach
      could improve the efficacy of HIPEC with a minimal systemic toxicity.
