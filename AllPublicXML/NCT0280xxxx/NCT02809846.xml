      Single site, double blinded, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial. 40 subjects will
      be selected based on the inclusion criteria and then randomized to either the intervention
      group or the placebo control group. Prior to the start of this study, a Controlled Substance
      Utilization Review and Evaluation (CURES) reports will be acquired to establish baseline
      number of opioid prescriptions for each subject. Subjects will track how consistently they
      are using pain medications, both opioids and non-opioids, during the two weeks prior to the
      start of the study. They will also provide twice daily recordings of their pain intensity via
      a mobile application. At the end of this two-week period, each subject will be fitted with a
      Quell device or a sham device, including initial calibration to the subject's comfort level
      as described in the background section.Once the study subjects have started using the device,
      we will also be able to monitor and track their sleep wirelessly via the mobile application
      as long as they are wearing the device. Subjects will receive weekly check in's to monitor
      the functionality of the device and to help troubleshoot any issues with the device for the
      duration of subject participation in the study. These check-ins will take place in person, by
      phone, and or per subject's usual outpatient oncology visits. Each subject will use their
      device for 8 weeks, during which they will continue to track their pain, sleep and frequency
      of pain medication use as stated above. Study investigators will receive automated alerts via
      email to ensure that study are participants using their devices and that the devices are
      powered on at regular intervals for the duration of the study.Total duration of subject
      participation will be 10 weeks.

    <measure>Change in Daily Opioid Use Assessed as Recorded by the Subject in Their Analgesia Diary.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks: 2,4,6,8,10</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point of this study was the difference in the change in daily opioid use between the active device group and the sham device group, assessed at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 of the study as recorded by the subject in their analgesia diary. Participants documented which medication was taken, how much, and at what time. Dose and type of opioid pain medication was converted to morphine milliequivalents (MME) using conversion factors published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)and combined as a daily dose for each day in a subject's analgesia journal.</description>

        <title>Change in Daily Opioid Use Assessed as Recorded by the Subject in Their Analgesia Diary.</title>
        <description>The primary end point of this study was the difference in the change in daily opioid use between the active device group and the sham device group, assessed at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 of the study as recorded by the subject in their analgesia diary. Participants documented which medication was taken, how much, and at what time. Dose and type of opioid pain medication was converted to morphine milliequivalents (MME) using conversion factors published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)and combined as a daily dose for each day in a subject's analgesia journal.</description>

            <description>Quell is a class II medical device with FDA 510(k) clearance for the symptomatic relief and management of chronic intractable pain, without a prescription. It operates by using an electrical stimulator to activate peripheral sensory nerves and trigger analgesia.
For the active device, a therapy session consisted of one hour of continuous stimulation with high frequency electric nerve stimulation varying between 60 and 100 Hz.
