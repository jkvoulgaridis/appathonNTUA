  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate changes in the level of inflammatory mediators in
      the tear film of scleral contact lens wearers in a keratoconic population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scleral contact lenses are rigid gas permeable lenses designed to rest on the sclera while
      vaulting over the cornea with a fluid reservoir. The use of scleral contact lenses has become
      the current standard of practice as a nonsurgical management of corneal ectasia and ocular
      surface diseases. Cases have been recently presented of scleral lens wearers exhibiting
      adverse corneal findings and conjunctival injection from lens wear. These findings are likely
      associated with the mechanical and hypoxic effects due to poor fitting characteristics at the
      limbal area. Tear film analysis detecting changes in the levels of proteinases and cytokines
      have helped researchers gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of complications
      in soft contact lenses wearers, dry eye, and keratoconus. Ultimately, this study will provide
      insights in relating scleral lens fitting characteristics and corneal and limbal
      physiological responses.
