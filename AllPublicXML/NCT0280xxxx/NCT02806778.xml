      The use of protective ventilation (to maintain normoxia and normocapnia), optimise
      haemodynamics, diagnose/treat seizures, therapeutic hypotermia etc is recommended for ICU
      management of patients who have had cardiac arrest and remain in coma after return of
      spontaneous circulation according to the latest International Guidelines. These actions
      essentially aim to limit secondary brain injury but despite all therapeutic effort, the
      cerebral oxygenation may remain inadequate and there is no validated method to avoid such a
      state in real time.

      The use of protective ventilation (to maintain normoxia and normocapnia), optimize
      hemodynamics, diagnose/treat seizures, therapeutic hypothermia etc is recommended for ICU
      management of patients who have had cardiac arrest and remain in a coma after the return of
      spontaneous circulation according to the latest International Guidelines. These actions
      essentially aim to limit secondary brain injury but despite all therapeutic effort, the
      cerebral oxygenation may remain inadequate and there is no validated method to avoid such a
      state in real time.

      The objective of this study is to assess the relationship between jugular venous oximetry and
      neurological outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest, evaluated as per the Cerebral
      Performance Category scale (CPC). Further, the aim is to clarify relations between biomarkers
      protein S100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and parameters of jugular oximetry for
      prognostication. An anticipated total of sixty patients will be enrolled in this
      non-randomised, single-group, double-blind study.

      In the course of the study, the authors have decided to stop using BIS monitoring for
      sedation management. Reason for this decision was very limited reliability of this technique
      in unparalyzed patients on ICU (muscle artifacts). New aim of sedation was Richmond Agitation
      Sedation Scale (RASS) -4 or -5, with avoiding shivering and clinically manifested seizures.
