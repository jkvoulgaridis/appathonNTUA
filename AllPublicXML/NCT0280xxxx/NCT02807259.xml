  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female sex workers (FSWs) frequently experience violence from their intimate partners
      (non-paying lovers), which compromises their health and increases their the risk of infection
      with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Samdevena Plus is a complex multi-level
      intervention that works with FSWs, their intimate partners, the sex worker community and the
      general population. The intervention aims to reduce partner violence and increase consistent
      condom use within these relationships.

      The intervention consists of: (i) couples counselling sessions between FSWs and their
      intimate partners; (ii) separate group work among FSWs and intimate partners to increase
      self-esteem and encourage reflection about violence; (iii) strengthening supportive crisis
      management systems that address domestic and sex worker violence; (iv) training male
      'champions' to encourage action against violence; and (v) training media to promote informed
      discussions about violence and HIV risk.The program involves changing perceptions on
      acceptability of physical violence as a form of discipline, challenging assumptions that give
      men authority over women, and working with men and women to encourage new relationship models
      based on equality and respect. The intervention will reach 800 FSWs and their intimate
      partners living in 47 villages in north Karnataka, India. The evaluation uses a
      cluster-randomized control trial design that introduces the intervention into half of
      villages for the first 24 months and the remaining half receive the intervention thereafter.
      The primary outcomes of the trial are: the proportion of FSWs who report: i) consistent
      condom use in their intimate relationship; and ii) experiencing partner violence within the
      past 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female sex workers (FSWs) are at increased risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections
      (STI) compared to women in the general population, and frequently experience violence in
      their working and domestic lives from a variety of perpetrators, which can enhance this risk.
      While progress has been made in addressing violence by police and clients, little work has
      been done to understand and prevent violence by intimate partners (IPs) among FSW
      populations.

      Samvedana Plus is a multi-level intervention programme that works with FSWs, their IPs, the
      sex worker community, and the general population, and aims to reduce violence and increase
      consistent condom use within these 'intimate' relationships. The programme involves shifting
      norms around the acceptability of beating as a form of discipline, challenging gender roles
      that give men authority over women, and working with men and women to encourage new
      relationship models based on gender equity and respect. The programme will aim to cover 800
      FSWs and their IPs living in 47 villages in Bagalkot district, northern Karnataka. The study
      is designed to assess three primary outcomes: the proportion of FSWs who report: (i) any
      physical or sexual partner violence; (ii) severe/moderate physical or sexual partner violence
      in the last 6 months; and iii) consistent condom use in their intimate relationship. The
      evaluation will employ a cluster-randomised controlled trial design, with 50% of the village
      clusters (n=24) randomly selected to receive the intervention for the first 24 months and the
      remaining 50% (n=23) receiving the intervention thereafter. Statisticians will be blinded to
      treatment arm allocation. The evaluation will use an adjusted, individual-level intention to
      treat analysis, comparing outcomes in intervention and control villages at endline (24
      months) using a mixed effects logistic model. We will adjust for confounders in two ways: i)
      outcome variables are adjusted for at a cluster level using the mean baseline summaries; ii)
      other variables will be adjusted for an at an individual level using endline data. We will
      include all women survey at endline. We will also report cluster-level summaries by trial arm
      for each primary and secondary outcome to double check our analyses. The evaluation design
      will involve quantitative and qualitative assessments with (i) all FSWs who report an IP (ii)
      IPs; and process/ implementation monitoring.

      This is an innovative intervention programme that aims to address violence by IPs as part of
      HIV prevention programming with FSWs. Reducing violence is expected to reduce vulnerability
      to HIV acquisition, and help women to work and live without fear of violence.

    <description>At the individual level, the intervention will focus on: (i) structured reflection groups for FSWs to enhance self-esteem, encourage critical reflection around gender norms and violence, and build individual and collective efficacy; (ii) separate sessions for intimate partners to discuss issues around violence and condom use as well as gender, equity, respect and responsibility; (iii) skills building around female condoms (iv) access to individual and couples-based counselling. At the community level, the intervention will focus on: (i) strengthening the supportive crisis management systems so that they are able to address 'domestic' as well as 'work-place' violence among FSWs and (ii) building an environment that encourages action against violence from intimate partners by training male champions and developing folk media troops to generate discussion around gender, masculinity, violence and HIV risk behaviours.</description>

          <title>Samvedana Plus Multi-level Intervention</title>
          <description>In brief, the programme, informed by prior participatory research, worked with individuals, couples, and at a community level to change the acceptability of IPV as a form of discipline, to challenge assumptions that give men authority over women, and to encourage new relationship models based on equality and respect. The intervention, implemented between April 2015 and September 2017, lasted 27 months (Box 1). It was led by a local community-based organisation (CBO) sex worker collective Chaitanya AIDS Tadegattuva Mahila Sangha (CATMS) in collaboration with the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT). The CBO was responsible for identifying sex workers and IPs to take part in the intervention; with support from KHPT they trained outreach workers to facilitate 12 reflection sessions and provide counselling, training male champions; and building alliances with other networks to address violence against sex workers.</description>

            <description>In brief, the programme, informed by prior participatory research, worked with individuals, couples, and at a community level to change the acceptability of IPV as a form of discipline, to challenge assumptions that give men authority over women, and to encourage new relationship models based on equality and respect. The intervention, implemented between April 2015 and September 2017, lasted 27 months (Box 1). It was led by a local community-based organisation (CBO) sex worker collective Chaitanya AIDS Tadegattuva Mahila Sangha (CATMS) in collaboration with the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT). The CBO was responsible for identifying sex workers and IPs to take part in the intervention; with support from KHPT they trained outreach workers to facilitate 12 reflection sessions and provide counselling, training male champions; and building alliances with other networks to address violence against sex workers.</description>

The power calculation was performed by analysing simulated data from 800 women, distributed across clusters using empirical data with a range in variance across cluster-level proportions of IPV (15% to 25% of the total variation) and a narrow range of effect sizes (risk ratio= 0.75-0.80).</groups_desc>

      <desc>A community advisory board of sex workers was set up to inform all aspects of study design, implementation and consent procedures, to ensure it was acceptable to the community and to help monitor any adverse events (defined as a report of sexual/physical violence). Outreach workers collected reports of violence during regular sessions with sex workers, completing a report when incidents occurred. These reports were monitored and reported to the Crisis Management Committee.</desc>
