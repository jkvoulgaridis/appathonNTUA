    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status. The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating slight problems, 3: indicating moderate problems, 4: indicating severe problems, 5: indicating extreme problems), and a separate visual analog scale (VAS).
Responses to the 5 dimension scores were combined and converted into a single preference-weighted health utility index score by applying country-specific weights.The range for EQ-5D-5L index score is 0 to 1 where '0' is defined as a health state equivalent to being dead and '1' is full health.The higher the score the better the health status.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and end of treatment (week 12 or 24 depending on the treatment regimen)</time_frame>
    <description>PAM 13 is a measure used to assess the patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management, consisting of 13 questions. Each of the 13 items can be answered with one of four possible response options, which are &quot;disagree strongly&quot; (1), &quot;disagree&quot; (2), &quot;agree&quot; (3), &quot;agree strongly&quot; (4). Scores were summed to calculate the overall raw score, then transformed to a scale with a theoretical range 0 to 100, based on calibration tables, with higher PAM scores indicating higher patient activation</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Beliefs Medication Questionnaire - (18-item BMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of treatment (week 12 or 24 depending on the treatment regimen)</time_frame>
    <description>The BMQ consists of 2 sections and 18 questions to screen for patients' beliefs, attitudes and concerns about their medication. The BMQ-Specific section comprises two 5-item subscales assessing the necessity of and concerns about the prescribed medication (Specific-Necessity and Specific-Concerns). The BMQ-General section comprises two 4-item subscales assessing beliefs that medicines are harmful and overused by doctors in general (General-Harm and General-Overuse). The 18 items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Each subscale score ranges from 1 to 5. High scores in the Specific-Concerns scale represent the notion that adverse reactions are potentially harmful when taking medication on a regular basis, and high scores in the Specific-Necessity scale indicate the patient's need to adhere to medication to maintain health. High scores in the General-Harm and General-Overuse scales represent an overall negative perception of medication.</description>

          <description>Sustained virologic response was defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels less than 50 IU/mL 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
The core population with sufficient follow-up data regarding SVR12 included all core population participants who
had evaluable HCV RNA data ≥ 70 days after the last actual dose of paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir
or a HCV RNA value ≥ 50 IU/mL at the last measurement post-baseline
or had HCV RNA &lt; 50 IU/mL at the last measurement post-baseline, but no HCV RNA measurement ≥ 70 days after the last actual dose of paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir with dasabuvir due to reasons related to safety (e.g. dropped out due to adverse event) or virologic failure.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status. The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating slight problems, 3: indicating moderate problems, 4: indicating severe problems, 5: indicating extreme problems), and a separate visual analog scale (VAS).
Responses to the 5 dimension scores were combined and converted into a single preference-weighted health utility index score by applying country-specific weights.The range for EQ-5D-5L index score is 0 to 1 where '0' is defined as a health state equivalent to being dead and '1' is full health.The higher the score the better the health status.</description>

        <description>The WPAI Hepatitis C V2.0 is an HCV specific questionnaire used to measure work absenteeism, work presenteeism, and daily activity impairment. Respondents were asked about time missed from work and time while at work during which productivity was impaired in the past seven days. Results of WPAI are expressed as a percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, with higher percentages indicating greater impairment and less productivity.
Absenteeism indicates the percentage of work time missed due to health problems.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Total Work Productivity Impairment (TWP)</title>
        <description>The WPAI Hepatitis C V2.0 is an HCV specific questionnaire used to measure work absenteeism, work presenteeism, and daily activity impairment. Respondents were asked about time missed from work and time while at work during which productivity was impaired in the past seven days. Results of WPAI are expressed as a percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, with higher percentages indicating greater impairment and less productivity.
Total work productivity impairment (TWP) indicates the percentage of overall work impairment due to health problems.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Beliefs Medication Questionnaire - (18-item BMQ)</title>
        <description>The BMQ consists of 2 sections and 18 questions to screen for patients' beliefs, attitudes and concerns about their medication. The BMQ-Specific section comprises two 5-item subscales assessing the necessity of and concerns about the prescribed medication (Specific-Necessity and Specific-Concerns). The BMQ-General section comprises two 4-item subscales assessing beliefs that medicines are harmful and overused by doctors in general (General-Harm and General-Overuse). The 18 items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Each subscale score ranges from 1 to 5. High scores in the Specific-Concerns scale represent the notion that adverse reactions are potentially harmful when taking medication on a regular basis, and high scores in the Specific-Necessity scale indicate the patient's need to adhere to medication to maintain health. High scores in the General-Harm and General-Overuse scales represent an overall negative perception of medication.</description>
