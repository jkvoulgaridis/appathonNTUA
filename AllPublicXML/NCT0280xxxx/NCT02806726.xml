      A prospective study to evaluate the feasibility of a new treatment algorithm to increase
      depth of focus after wavefront-guided LASIK correction of myopic refractive errors with the
      iDesign Advanced Wavescan Studio™ System and Star S4 IR™ Excimer Laser System. The purpose of
      this study is to determine whether wavefront-guided LASIK correction of myopic refractive
      errors with CustomVue combined with iDesign 1.3-PRESBY (presbyT-LASIK) treatments mitigate
      the effects of presbyopia by increasing the depth of focus compared to iDesign CustomVue
      treatments.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All criteria apply to each eye

          1. Signed informed consent and Personal Health Information Protection Act authorization.

          2. At least 45 years of age at enrollment (date informed consent signed).

          3. The refractive error, based on the iDesign displayed refraction selected for treatment
             (&quot;4.0 Rx calc&quot; at 12.5 mm), must be myopia with or without astigmatism with sphere up
             to -6.00 D, and cylinder between 0.00 D and -5.00 D with a maximum spherical
             equivalent (SE) of -8.00 D.

          4. Require an add power of +1.00 D or more during near testing at 40 cm.

          5. Anticipated stromal bed thickness of at least 250 microns based on preoperative
             central corneal pachymetry minus the maximum ablation depth (as calculated by the
             iDesign system) plus the intended flap thickness.

          6. Distance Best Spectacle Corrected Visual Acuity (BSCVA) of 20/20 or better.

          7. Uncorrected Visual Acuity (UCVA) of 20/40 or worse.

          8. Less than or equal to 0.75 D difference between cycloplegic and manifest refraction
             sphere.

          9. A stable refractive error (based on a previous exam, medical records, lensometry, or
             prescription at least 12 months prior to the preoperative manifest refraction), as
             defined by a change of ≤1.00 D in MRSE.

         10. Any eye with a history of contact lens wear within the last 4 weeks must demonstrate
             refractive stability according to the following:

               1. Rigid contact lenses (toric or spherical) must be removed for at least 4 weeks
                  and soft contact lenses (toric or spherical) for at least 2 weeks prior to the
                  first refraction used to establish stability.

               2. Two consecutive refractions and keratometric readings must be conducted at least
                  7 days apart.

               3. Refractive stability is defined as a change of not more than 0.50 D in manifest
                  refraction sphere and cylinder as well as mean keratometry between measurements.

               4. If the subject/eye meets the refractive stability criteria, contact lens wear is
                  not permitted prior to surgery.

         11. Agreement between manifest refraction (adjusted for optical infinity) and iDesign
             System refraction chosen for treatment, as follows:

               1. Spherical Equivalent: Magnitude of the difference is less than 0.625 D.

               2. Cylinder: Magnitude of the difference is less than or equal to 0.5 D.

               3. Cylinder Axis Tolerance: If either the manifest cylinder entered into the iDesign
                  System or the iDesign cylinder selected for treatment is less than 0.5 D, there
                  is no requirement for axis tolerance. When both cylinders have a magnitude of at
                  least 0.5 D, the axis tolerance as determined by the iDesign system is linearly
                  reduced from 15 (0.5 D) to 7.5 (7.0 D) based on the average magnitude of both
                  cylinders. Note: If the axis tolerance is not in the calculated range, the
                  iDesign system will produce a warning and this exam may not be used for treatment
                  planning.

         12. Willing and capable of complying with follow-up examinations for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, intend to become pregnant, or are not using an
             adequate method of birth control [examples are any form of barrier contraception (such
             as condom or diaphragm with contraceptive cream/jelly), birth control pills, hormonal
             implant, IUD, abstinence or surgical sterilization (tubal ligation, hysterectomy or
             vasectomy)]. Note: Women who were pregnant or nursing may not be enrolled until 6
             months after either delivery or have stopped nursing and there is documented
             refractive stability.

          2. Concurrent use of systemic (including inhaled) medications that may impair healing,
             including but not limited to: antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane®) within 6
             months of treatment, and amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone®) within 12 months of
             treatment.

             NOTE: The use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, whether chronic or acute, is
             deemed to adversely affect healing and subjects using such medications are
             specifically excluded from eligibility.

          3. History of any of the following medical conditions, or any other condition that could
             affect wound healing: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency
             diseases, ocular herpes zoster or herpes simplex, endocrine disorders (including, but
             not limited to unstable thyroid disorders and diabetes), lupus, and rheumatoid
             arthritis.

             NOTE: The presence of diabetes (either type 1 or 2), regardless of disease duration,
             severity, or control, will specifically exclude subjects from eligibility.

          4. Subjects with a cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator or other implanted
             electronic device.

          5. History of prior intraocular or corneal surgery (including cataract extraction),
             active ophthalmic disease or abnormality (including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             blepharitis, recurrent corneal erosion, dry eye syndrome, neovascularization &gt; 1 mm
             from limbus), retinal detachment/repair, clinically significant lens opacity, clinical
             evidence of trauma, corneal opacity within the central 9 mm and visible on topography,
             at risk for developing strabismus, or with evidence of glaucoma or propensity for
             narrow angle glaucoma.

             NOTE: Subjects with open angle glaucoma, regardless of medication regimen or control,
             or an IOP greater than 21 mmHg at screening, are specifically excluded from
             eligibility.

          6. Evidence of keratoconus, corneal dystrophy or irregularity, or abnormal topography.

          7. Known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the medications used in
             the postoperative course.

          8. Desire to have monovision.

          9. Intolerance to multifocal correction based on questionnaire responses to contact lens
             trial.
