  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fistula/Sinus Tract Length</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical efficacy will be assessed by measuring change in length of the fistulas and/or sinus tracts using ultrasound from baseline at week 8.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fistula/Sinus Tract Lumen Diameter</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical efficacy will be assessed by measuring change in diameter of the lumen of the fistulas and/or sinus tracts using ultrasound from baseline at week 8.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This non-validated assessment is based on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and allows the physician and the subject to score multiple hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) symptoms on a scale from 'extremely worse' to 'very much improved' compared to baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale for Pain/Stinging</measure>

Injection with normal saline (placebo) in one site randomly allocated by side. The subject and ultrasound operator will be blinded to the treatment allocation.</description>
