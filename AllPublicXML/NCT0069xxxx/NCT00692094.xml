  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary focus of this five-year study will be to optimize the melatonin dosing regimen
      for synchronizing the body clocks of elderly blind individuals to the 24-hour day.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to study as many as 26 subjects through up to four melatonin
      treatment regimens, all of which involve a dose step-down in which the melatonin dose will be
      reduced gradually to find the lowest effective dose. The 4 treatment plans differ only in the
      start dose and the time of administration. Successfully treated subjects will enter a
      one-year intensive assessment of the safety and efficacy of melatonin treatment in which the
      subject will take the same dose for one year and complete biweekly assessments of efficacy
      and side-effects. The final phase of the study involves a placebo discontinuation, in which
      the subject's circadian rhythm will be returned to the baseline rhythm (this may take up to 6
      months for some subjects).
