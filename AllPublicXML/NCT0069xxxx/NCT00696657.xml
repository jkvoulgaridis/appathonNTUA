  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was conducted in Europe,Asia and Africa. Study participants were randomised evenly
      to treatment with semaglutide (0.1 mg QW - 1.6 mg QW, 6 treatment arms, placebo or
      liraglutide (1.2 mg QD, or 1.8 mg QD).Treatment allocation to semaglutide or placebo was
      double-blind, whereas liraglutide treatment was administered open-label.Primary efficacy
      parameter was HbA1c and the treatment duration was 12 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With an Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The results of adverse event presented here are treatment emergent, i.e., TEAE. A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset on or after the first date (week 0) on trial product and no later than 5 weeks after the last date on trial product (week 17), or that had onset before the first date on trial product and increases in severity during the treatment period until 5 weeks after the last date on trial product.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Hypoglycaemic Episode</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The results of hypoglycaemic episode presented here are treatment emergent. Hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as treatment emergent if they had onset on or after the first day of randomised treatment (in week 0) and no later than 5 weeks after the last date on trial product (week 17). Hypoglycaemic episodes are classified as follows: Major: If the subject was not able to treat himself or herself and was needed to be administered food, glucagon or intravenous (i.v.) glucose by another person. Minor: If the subject was able to treat himself or herself and measured plasma glucose was &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL). Symptoms only: If the subject was able to treat himself or herself and measured plasma glucose was &gt;=3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or no plasma glucose measurement was done.</description>

    <description>A standard 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a 10-second rhythm strip was performed at screening (week -2) and at the end of treatment (week 12).

      <pre_assignment_details>Study Design: This was a 9 armed parallel group trial. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 manner to receive one of five doses of blinded semaglutide once-weekly (0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg, 0.8 mg, 0.8 mg T [with titration] and 1.6 mg T [with titration]) or blinded placebo once-weekly or open-label liraglutide 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg once-daily.</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>Subjects followed a 1-week titration period (liraglutide 0.6 mg once-daily in week 1), followed by an 11-week treatment period of fixed doses liraglutide 1.2 mg, once-daily. Liraglutide was injected s.c. in the abdomen, upper arm or thigh by using the Flexpen® in the evening before bedtime. Liraglutide was given in adjunct to previous metformin therapy on a stable dose (minimum 1.5 g daily) or as monotherapy in case the diabetes was controlled by diet and exercise alone.</description>

          <description>Change from baseline in HbA1c was evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment. Post baseline (week 0) missing values were replaced using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all randomised subjects who had been exposed to at least 1 dose of the trial product (placebo/semaglutide/liraglutide). Four subjects mistakenly received a different treatment instead of the randomised treatment. The randomised treatment was applied regardless of the treatment actually received.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG</title>
        <description>A standard 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a 10-second rhythm strip was performed at screening (week -2) and at the end of treatment (week 12). The time frame should be read as &quot;week -2, week 12&quot;. Change from baseline in ECG was measured in terms of number of subjects in each category (normal, abnormal, not clinically significant [NCS] or abnormal clinically significant [CS]) at week -2 and week 12 (i.e., change in each category in terms of number of subjects from week -2 to week 12).</description>

        <population>The safety analysis set included all randomised subjects who were exposed to at least 1 dose of trial product. 2 subjects randomised to semaglutide 0.8mg were mistakenly titrated, so actual treatment was semaglutide 0.8mg T. 2 subjects randomised to semaglutide 0.8mg T were mistakenly titrated to 1.6mg T, so actual treatment was semaglutide 1.6mg T</population>

        <description>Change from baseline in urine-haemoglobin was measured in terms of number of subjects in each category (negative, trace, small, moderate/large and missing) at week 0 and week 12 (i.e., change in each category in terms of number of subjects from week 0 to week 12).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0, week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The safety analysis set included all randomised subjects who were exposed to at least 1 dose of trial product. 2 subjects randomised to semaglutide 0.8mg were mistakenly titrated, so actual treatment was semaglutide 0.8mg T. 2 subjects randomised to semaglutide 0.8mg T were mistakenly titrated to 1.6mg T, so actual treatment was semaglutide 1.6mg T</population>

            <description>Subjects followed a 1-week titration period (semaglutide 0.4 mg once-weekly at week 1), followed by an 11- week treatment period of fixed doses semaglutide 0.8 mg, once-weekly. Semaglutide was injected s.c. in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm by using the NordiPen® on the same day of the week at a convenient time for the subjects. Semaglutide was given in adjunct to previous metformin therapy on a stable dose (minimum 1.5 g daily) or as monotherapy in case the diabetes was controlled by diet and exercise alone.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Standard Safety Laboratory Parameter (Urinalysis; Haemoglobin)</title>
          <description>Change from baseline in urine-haemoglobin was measured in terms of number of subjects in each category (negative, trace, small, moderate/large and missing) at week 0 and week 12 (i.e., change in each category in terms of number of subjects from week 0 to week 12).</description>
          <population>The safety analysis set included all randomised subjects who were exposed to at least 1 dose of trial product. 2 subjects randomised to semaglutide 0.8mg were mistakenly titrated, so actual treatment was semaglutide 0.8mg T. 2 subjects randomised to semaglutide 0.8mg T were mistakenly titrated to 1.6mg T, so actual treatment was semaglutide 1.6mg T</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Standard Safety Laboratory Parameter (Urinalysis; Ketones)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in urine-ketone was measured in terms of number of subjects in each category (negative, positive, &gt;=55 mmol/L and missing) at week 0 and week 12 (i.e., change in each category in terms of number of subjects from week 0 to week 12).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0, week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The safety analysis set included all randomised subjects who were exposed to at least 1 dose of trial product. 2 subjects randomised to semaglutide 0.8mg were mistakenly titrated, so actual treatment was semaglutide 0.8mg T. 2 subjects randomised to semaglutide 0.8mg T were mistakenly titrated to 1.6mg T, so actual treatment was semaglutide 1.6mg T</population>

        <description>Change from baseline in urine-protein was measured in terms of number of subjects in each category at week 0 (negative, 0.3 g/L, 1.0 g/L and missing) and week 12 (negative, trace, 0.3 g/L, 1.0 g/L, &gt;=3.0 g/L and missing). i.e., change in each category in terms of number of subjects from week 0 to week 12.</description>
