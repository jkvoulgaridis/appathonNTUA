  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are seeking participants for a study of the role of kisspeptin in the
      reproductive system. Kisspeptin is a naturally occuring hormone in humans that stimulates the
      production of reproductive hormones. The investigators hypothesize that kisspeptin
      administration will be a useful tool for characterizing certain reproductive disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The master reproductive hormone GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) is essential for normal
      reproductive function. People with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), hyperprolactinemia,
      and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) do not secrete or respond to GnRH in a normal way. In
      this study, investigators will give participants kisspeptinâ€” a hormone that is naturally
      found in the human body and is known to be a powerful stimulus of GnRH secretion. They may
      also give participants GnRH to determine if participants will be able to fully respond to
      kisspeptin.

      The goal of this study is to use kisspeptin administration to probe the condition of GnRH
      neurons in people with various reproductive disorders to better understand the underlying
      reasons for the disorders. Investigators hope to gain new insights into GnRH neuronal
      function (or dysfunction) that will lead to better diagnostics in the future.
