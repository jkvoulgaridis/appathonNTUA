  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project consists of a three part study with five embedded sub studies. The
      first study phase identifies &quot;body rhythms&quot; of sleepiness/wakefulness and of melatonin levels
      for each subject (including sub-study 1). The second study phase identifies the optimum dose
      and timing of melatonin for regulating each individual's 24-hour sleep/waking cycle
      (including sub-study 2). The third study phase introduces a new independent variable, light
      (including sub-studies 3 and 4). Sub-study 5 is an optional longitudinal study.

      Sub-study 1 looks at how keeping a regular sleep schedule affects the body's natural rhythm.
      Sub-study 2 looks at how individuals metabolize melatonin. Sub-study 3 tests how individuals'
      endogenous melatonin production responds to bright outdoor light and Sub-study 4 tests a
      previous finding that artificial bright light exposed daily behind the knee can regulate the
      body clock. Sub-study 5 is an optional longitudinal study, an extension of the first study
      stage, for subjects whose rhythms are not clearly free-running.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  blindness for at least one year, verified by an ophthalmologic exam

          -  ability to comply with the requirements of the experimental protocol

          -  competency to sign informed consent

        Exclusion criteria (as determined by medical history and/or physical examination):

          -  abnormal heart, liver or kidney function

          -  a current Axis I psychiatric or substance abuse disorder according to the DSM-IV
             Manual

          -  possibly external demands that limit the ability to maintain a regular schedule (e.g.,
             night shift work)

          -  sexually active female subjects of child-bearing potential will be asked to avoid
             pregnancy using accepted methods and will be notified that the effects of melatonin on
             a fetus are not known (we will ask subjects monthly if they are pregnant or trying to
             become pregnant)

          -  if a subject reports she is pregnant or is trying to become pregnant anytime during
             her study participation, any study medications (melatonin or placebo) will be
             immediately withdrawn and the subject will be excluded from the study
