  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Legalon速 SIL will be administered to patients with amatoxin poisoning diagnosed by history,
      gastrointestinal symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, and/or diagnostic assay (should one become
      available). Patients may or may not also demonstrate abnormalities in bilirubin and/or
      creatinine. Treatment consists of a 5 mg/kg loading dose followed by 20 mg/kg/day via
      continuous infusion. The treating physician is expected to administer supportive therapy of
      his/her choosing but consistent with best practices. Legalon速 SIL will be stopped when
      coagulopathy is no longer present, and when liver function tests have returned significantly
      towards the normal range. Patients will be followed 7-14 days after the end of Legalon速 SIL
      therapy with follow up lab studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent(s) for clinical trial participation (due to the potential
             critical status of the subject upon presentation, consent may need to be obtained from
             Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) per sites consenting policy and ICH/GCP
             guidance) Signed Informed Consent for Clinical Trial participation

          2. History of eating foraged mushrooms

          3. Gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of amatoxin poisoning (cramping abdominal pain,
             nausea, vomiting, and / or watery diarrhea) usually 24-48 hours after of mushroom
             ingestion

          4. Liver function tests suggestive of amatoxin poisoning: AST or ALT above the
             institutions upper limit of normal after mushroom ingestion

        Exclusion criteria:

        1. Evidence of significant medical illness or any other abnormal laboratory finding that,
        in the Investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk associated with the
        subject's participation in, and completion of the study or could preclude the evaluation of
        the subject's response.
