  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single institution, single-arm, open-label study of oral dasatinib
      monotherapy administered to subjects with relapsed or refractory aggressive DLBCL.

      This study will be conducted in two phases: a Treatment Phase and a Follow-up Phase.

      Research Hypothesis: Dasatinib, when administered orally at a continuous dose of 100 mg once
      daily, will be safe and effective in treating subjects that have failed prior therapies to
      diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or have relapsed disease.

             pregnancy tests are negative; Will be warned that sharing study drug is prohibited and
             will be counseled about pregnancy precautions and potential risks of fetal exposure;

             about pregnancy precautions and potential risks of fetal exposure; Must agree to
             abstain from donating blood, semen, or sperm during study participation and for at
             least 28 days after discontinuation from the study.

        Female Subjects:

          -  FCBP with regular cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28
             days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at study
             discontinuation, and at day 28 following discontinuation from the study. If menstrual
             cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days
             and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28
             following discontinuation from the study.

          -  In addition to the required pregnancy testing, the Investigator must confirm with FCBP
             that she is continuing to use two reliable methods of birth control at each visit.

          -  Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must
             be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. During counseling, subjects must be
             reminded to not share study drug and to not donate blood.

          -  Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a subject misses her period or
             if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal. Study drug treatment must
             be discontinued during this evaluation.

          -  Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at

             to not share study drug and to not donate blood, sperm, or semen.

          -  If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study subject or the partner
             of a male study subject during study participation, study drug must be immediately
             discontinued.
