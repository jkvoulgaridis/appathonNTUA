  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLP) has gained widespread acceptance as
      a standard treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Despite the enhanced
      visualization and precise dissection afforded by the robotic platform, two major
      comorbidities affect a significant number of men: incontinence and erectile function.

      Urinary continence and erectile function

      It is commonly believed that the most important factor affecting continence is preservation
      of the external urinary sphincter complex which lies just below the prostate. Trauma to the
      urethral tissue itself after it is transected from the prostate and damage to the autonomic
      nerves that control this sphincter may lead to sphincteric dysfunction. In addition,
      dissection of the bladder may lead to bladder irritability which also plays a role in
      incontinence. Surgical removal of the prostate also causes significant inflammatory damage to
      the pelvic floor which likely delays recovery of urinary continence. The same trauma issues
      apply to sexual function.

      One possible method to protect the nerves and other tissues from operative trauma may be the
      use of local hypothermia (cold-ischemia) to the pelvis. Local tissue hypothermia using ice,
      ice slush, or cold irrigation has been safely and routinely used for decades in humans during
      brain, heart, and kidney surgery to minimize organ damage. Yet, this technique has never been
      applied to prostate surgery. We will accomplish local cooling of the pelvis using a cooling
      balloon inserted into the rectum. The cooling balloon is powered by an FDA approved cooling
      system developed by Innercool therapies. Temperatures of 57-86 degrees F (22+/-8 degrees C).

      2. 1. Selection of the Patients From June 2002 to August 2015, a total of 1,503 patients
      underwent RARP. During this period, perioperative data, including postoperative functional
      outcomes, were prospectively collected using a customized database; our ethics committee
      approved the data collection. Erectile function was assessed using the sexual health profile
      for men (SHIM) score at 3, 9, 15, and 24 months and then annually after surgery, and the
      duration of pad-free continence recovery was asked by a non-physician third party. In our
      institution, RH was applied during RARP for all patients from February 2008 to March 2015
      (consecutively between the 671st and 1459th cases). Among the recruited patients, 789 men
      (52.6%) underwent HP, leaving the other 711 (47.4%) as controls.

      The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) bilateral nerve-sparing RARP (over
      70%) and (2) a minimum follow-up of 15 months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
      men with a history of salvage radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy after RARP
      (n=98) and (2) the presence of a high-risk disease with an initial prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) level over 20 ng/ml or biopsy Gleason score over 8, which may influence the refining
      surgical plane around the neurovascular bundle (NVB), thereby affecting the degrees of
      nerve-sparing strategy at the time of surgery (n=275). Further, (3) the initial 100 cases
      were excluded to avoid potential bias from the learning period. From a cohort of 1,503
      patients, 59 (3.92%) men whose potency outcome within 15 months was not assessed were also
      excluded from the study. Finally, 930 patients were selected for the analysis; half of the
      procedures (n=466, 50.1%) were performed under RH and the remaining other half (n=464, 49.9%)
      as normothermal controls.

      2. 2. Endpoints of the Study The primary endpoints of this study were the SHIM score and the
      rate of potency regain, which was defined as a SHIM score &gt;17 in the RH and control groups 15
      months after surgery. Considering the proven impacts of age and preoperative SHIM scores on
      the recovery of potency, the groups were further divided into the young and potent (YP: age
      &lt;65 years and SHIM score ≥22, n=409, 43.9%) subgroup and susceptible for impotency (SI: age
      ≥65 years or SHIM score &lt;22, n=512, 55.1%) counterpart and investigated the sexual function
      of the YP subgroup. The secondary endpoints were the duration of pad-free continence regain
      and the rate of continence recovery within 3 months after surgery, especially in the YP
      subgroup.

      2.3. Surgical Protocol for RH All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. RH was
      achieved by devising an endorectal cooling balloon system (ECB) as previously reported [2, 4,
      5]. In brief, a 40-cm, 24-F, 3-way latex urethral catheter was placed inside a 5 × 2.5-inch
      elliptic latex balloon that distended at a low pressure and conformed to the rectal wall
      without excessive deformations. The lubricated ECB was inserted just inside the anus and
      anchored by inflating the catheter balloon to 20 ml. The ECB was then distended and cycled
      continuously with cold saline (4°C) by gravity 40 cm above the patient. The ECB volume was
      ~200 ml. A 9-F esophageal probe (Smiths Medical ASD, Rockland, MA) was used to obtain the
      intracorporeal temperature readings directly along the anterior surface of the rectum/NVB.

Adverse event reporting was irrespective of arm and cannot be separated. Adverse events were also assessed irrespective of terms.</desc>

          <description>Both arms:
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable experience (sign, symptom, significant laboratory abnormality, illness, or other medical event) occurring to a patient that appears or worsens during a clinical study, regardless of etiology.
Mild – Awareness of signs or symptoms that are easily tolerated. Signs and symptoms are transient and only of minor irritant type and cause no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms do not require medication or a medical evaluation.
Moderate – Discomfort severe enough to cause interference with usual activities. Symptoms may require treatment but not extended hospitalization or intensive care for the patient.
Severe – Incapacitating with inability to do work or usual activities. Signs and symptoms may be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation and/or treatment that requires prolonged hospital stay</description>
