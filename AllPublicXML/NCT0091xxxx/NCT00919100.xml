      A vibrating cold pack placed proximal to the site of venipuncture will decrease the pain of
      cannulation when compared to vapocoolant spray.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Needle pain is the most common and the most feared source of childhood pain, resulting in
      needle phobia for 10% of adults. Current pain relief options include numbing creams,
      vapocoolant spray, or injected lidocaine. 17 million pediatric IV access procedures are done
      yearly with no pain intervention. An inexpensive, immediately acting form of needle pain
      control could reduce needle phobia in the long term if demonstrated to be effective for
      needle pain.

      This study will evaluate pain self report and parent report using the Faces Pain Scale
      revised, and video-coded OSBD-R scores for patients undergoing emergency department venous
      access or cannulation procedures. Demographic information, pre-procedural anxiety, and
      success data from the attempts at placement will be included.

    <description>Self-report measure of pain via 6 faces ranging from neutral to increasing pain expression. The scoring for the scale ranges from 0-10 with lower scores representing lower pain and higher scores representing higher pain. The FPS-R was conducted several minutes following venipuncture. This time was not tracked, but it was typically between 2-5 minutes following completion of the venipuncture.</description>

    <measure>OSBD-R Observational Pain/Distress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress (OSBD) is a validated and commonly used scale. There are 11 OSBD distress responses (information seeking, cry, scream, physical restraint, verbal resistance, seeking emotional support, verbal pain, flail, verbal fear, muscular rigidity, and nervous behavior). Using videotapes of the venipuncture, a composite OSBD score of 1 (low distress) to 11 (high distress) was assigned from the time of placement of tourniquet to placement of the bandage or securing the intravenous line (IV) after the first attempt. Two students not associated with the hospital or the device had been previously trained in this methodology and coded all tapes. A supervisor assessed interrater reliability on each coded behavior. After each group of 10 subjects, interrater agreements that fell below the level of excellent agreement (kappa = 0.80) were reviewed and discussed by both coders, with the consensus score recorded and definitions of observed behaviors.</description>

        <title>OSBD-R Observational Pain/Distress Scale</title>
        <description>The Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress (OSBD) is a validated and commonly used scale. There are 11 OSBD distress responses (information seeking, cry, scream, physical restraint, verbal resistance, seeking emotional support, verbal pain, flail, verbal fear, muscular rigidity, and nervous behavior). Using videotapes of the venipuncture, a composite OSBD score of 1 (low distress) to 11 (high distress) was assigned from the time of placement of tourniquet to placement of the bandage or securing the intravenous line (IV) after the first attempt. Two students not associated with the hospital or the device had been previously trained in this methodology and coded all tapes. A supervisor assessed interrater reliability on each coded behavior. After each group of 10 subjects, interrater agreements that fell below the level of excellent agreement (kappa = 0.80) were reviewed and discussed by both coders, with the consensus score recorded and definitions of observed behaviors.</description>

Buzzy: &quot;Buzzy&quot; is a vibrating cold pack attached with Velcro strap or tourniquet 5-10cm proximal to the site of venipuncture. The vibration is activated and the device remains in place throughout the procedure. The distraction cards are offered to the parents to show the children, with questions on the back and pictures on the front.</description>
