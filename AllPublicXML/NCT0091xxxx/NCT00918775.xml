    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the follow-up after metastasectomy in patients with kidney
      cancer. Following up patients' health condition after metastasectomy may help doctors to
      learn if the surgical removal of the primary tumor or the parts of the cancer that has spread
      to other parts of the body is a good method for treating patients who have kidney cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the 24-week progression free/relapse free survival rate in patients undergoing
      metastasectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS), relapse free survival (RFS) and overall
      survival (OS) in patients undergoing metastasectomy.

      II. To evaluate tissue determinants predictive for resectability, PFS and OS in patients
      undergoing metastasectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      After metastasectomy, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma (RCC)

          -  Patients have clinical reasons for undergoing a surgical resection of tumor; there are
             two main categories of patients:

               -  Patients with fully resectable disease as defined by lesions accessible by a
                  surgeon during no more than two separate surgical sessions, and are expected to
                  be rendered surgically no evidence of disease (NED)

               -  Patients undergoing a noncurative procedure for relief of symptoms or for
                  management of threatening lesions

          -  Patients have been deemed resectable by the subspecialty surgeon involved in the
             patient's care

          -  Patients must give written informed consent prior to initiation of therapy, in keeping
             with the policies of the institution; patients with a history of major psychiatric
             illness must be judged able to fully understand the investigational nature of the
             study and the risks associated with the therapy; the only approved consent is attached
             to this protocol

          -  Patients must have ability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures

          -  Members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have active acute infections that could be worsened by surgery or
             interfere with this study

          -  Patients must not have clinically significant cardiovascular disease, or peripheral
             vascular disease that creates an unacceptably high operative risk

          -  Patients must not have history of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates surgical resection, or render the subject at
             high risk from treatment complications

          -  Patients must not have a history of uncontrolled severe depression
