    <textblock>
      This treatment pilot study will investigate clinical efficacy and adverse effects of magnetic
      seizure therapy (MST) in patients currently experiencing a unipolar or bipolar depressive
      episode. The investigators will perform add-on tests to assess clinical and cognitive
      response to treatment. It is hypothesized that MST will have an antidepressant efficacy with
      a beneficial neurocognitive adverse effect profile.
