  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a systematic training of general
      affect regulation skills (ART) on the reduction of depressive symptom in individuals meeting
      criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in general emotion regulation skills have been shown to be associated with various
      mental disorders. Thus, general affect-regulation training has been proposed as promising
      transdiagnostic approach to the treatment of psychopathology. In the present study, we aimed
      to evaluate the efficacy of a general affect-regulation as a stand-alone, group-based
      treatment for depression. For this purpose, we randomly assigned 218 individuals who met
      criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) to the Affect Regulation Training (ART), to a
      waitlist control condition (WLC), or to a condition controlling for common factors (CFC). The
      primary outcome was the course of depressive symptom severity as assessed with the Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory. Differences between groups
      will be analyzed with the help of multi-level analyses. To clarify mechanisms of change we
      will test whether changes in emotion regulation skills will mediate potential differences
      between conditions regarding change of depressive symptoms. As secondary goal, the study will
      try and clarify whether participating in ART might augment the efficacy of subsequent
      individual cognitive-behavioral therapy.
