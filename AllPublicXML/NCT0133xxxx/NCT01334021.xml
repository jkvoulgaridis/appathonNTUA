    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well genetic testing works in predicting tumor response in
      patients with stage I-III HER2 negative invasive breast cancer. Genetic testing is a
      procedure that tests tumor samples to learn if certain genes are activated (turned on) in the
      tumor and if the activation of these genes may predict if the tumor will be sensitive or
      resistant to routine breast cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of implementation of molecular (genomic) predictive testing
      for patients with localized (stage I-III) invasive carcinoma of the breast who are candidates
      for either adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment of their breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the frequency of tumors in each of the four molecularly defined cohorts, overall
      and within subsets defined by nodal status and estrogen receptor (ER) status.

      II. Estimate the concordance of genomic analysis of gene expression levels for ER and HER2
      from the microarray (published previously), compared with standard testing with
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine ER and
      HER2 status in these tumors.

      III. Estimate the rates of indeterminate results and other variables of feasibility for
      tissue obtained by different procurement methods.

      IV. Estimate the impact of adjuvant therapy as measured by disease free survival (DFS) at 3
      and 5 years for the patients within each cohort who received a neoadjuvant or adjuvant
      treatment that is concordant with the application of the prediction result.

      V. Estimate the impact of neoadjuvant therapy for patients within each cohort, as measured by
      pathologic response in the breast and regional lymph nodes (pathologic complete response rate
      [pCR] and residual cancer burden [RCB]).

      VI. Estimate the predictive performance of other pre-validated and published genomic
      predictors of chemotherapy or endocrine therapy sensitivity by calculating those predictions
      from the microarray data that are produced or by using available results if the test was
      performed separately for clinical use.

      VII. Determine molecular characteristics of residual disease by analyzing resected surgical
      specimens of residual disease in patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      VIII. Determine molecular characteristics of recurrent or metastatic disease by analyzing
      tumor tissue obtained from diagnostic biopsies of a recurrent or metastatic tumor and
      comparing these samples to the primary tumor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo biopsy or surgery to obtain tumor sample for genetic testing. Patients are
      then assigned to 4 treatment cohorts as determined by genetic test results.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <description>The study will use the methods of Thall et al. to monitor the ability to classify patients into 1 of 4 groups (success rate) throughout the trial.

    <description>The study will estimate 3-year DFS with 95% confidence intervals within each subgroup (Groups A-D) using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Will also use a Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the association between DFS and subgroup, genomic predictions of treatment response, treatment, age at diagnosis, tumor stage at diagnosis, clinical nodal status at diagnosis, and histologic grade.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The study will tabulate the estrogen receptor (ER) status and Her2 status of tumors as determined by the genomic analysis and by IHC. Will estimate the concordance between these 2 methods for ER status and for Her2 status with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Indeterminate Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The study will use descriptive statistics to summarize the data in an effort to understand reasons for obtaining indeterminate results when trying to classify patients into 1 of the 4 subgroups (Groups A-D). Will summarize these data overall and separately for each biopsy method (e.g., fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, surgical resection).</description>

          -  The patient can undergo biopsy or surgery of a primary tumor site for suspected or
             proven invasive breast cancer of clinical stage I to III; stage IV patients will be

             amplification of the gene or 3+ score for immunohistochemical staining

          -  The patient has received prior systemic therapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer

          -  The patient has a prior history of invasive or metastatic cancer within 5 years of
             diagnosis of breast cancer, excluding squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin

          -  The patient had prior excisional biopsy of the primary invasive breast cancer

          -  There is hematoma or biopsy site changes that obscure the primary tumor

          -  Patients deemed medically ineligible for any adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Patients
             with ER-positive (+) tumors deemed medically eligible for hormonal therapy, but not
             chemotherapy will be considered eligible for this protocol. Patients with ER-negative
             (-) tumors who are not candidates for adjuvant anthracycline based chemotherapy will
             be considered ineligible for this protocol. Patients who undergo biopsy and are later
             found to be ineligible for adjuvant therapy will be assessed for the primary
             objective, but will be excluded from the secondary objectives
