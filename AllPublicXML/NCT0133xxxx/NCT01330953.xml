  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the following in healthy participants: 1)
      LY2928057 safety, including any side effects possibly associated with LY2928057; 2) how the
      body processes LY2928057; 3) effect of LY2928057 on blood iron levels; and 4) immune system
      reactions to LY2928057.
