          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling

          -  Are willing to follow study procedures including no drugs (exception of study drug) 72
             hours prior to initiation of the laser doppler imaging (LDI) procedure, no chocolate,
             alcohol or caffeine containing products 12 hours prior to initiation of the laser
             doppler imaging (LDI) procedure, and complete a 4 hour fast prior to initiation of the
             laser doppler imaging (LDI) procedure

          -  Have suitable skin characteristics for the dermal capsaicin challenge and have
             demonstrated a 100 percent increase in dermal flow following capsaicin challenge as
             part of the screening procedures and measured by laser doppler imaging (LDI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are currently enrolled in, have completed or discontinued within the last 30 days
             from, a clinical trial involving an investigational product; or are concurrently
