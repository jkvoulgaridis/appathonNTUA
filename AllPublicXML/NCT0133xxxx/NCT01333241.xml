  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects of a
      community-based lifestyle behavior intervention (LSBI) that is designed to improve dietary
      habits and physical activity (PA), and reduce weight of Latino women who are predominantly
      Spanish-speaking immigrants. It is hypothesized that middle-aged overweight/obese Latinas
      participating in a LSBI conducted by lay health advisors will demonstrate improved dietary
      habits, increased physical activity and a decrease in BMI compared to those in a control
      condition, Women in the LSBI also are expected to demonstrate improvements in selected
      physiologic outcomes (waist circumference, blood pressure [BP], measures of cholesterol and
      blood sugar).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obesity and physical inactivity are two significant predictors of illness and
      death from cardiovascular (heart) disease (CVD) in Latina adults. These risk factors may be
      reduced or eliminated through prevention efforts that focus on heart-healthy diets, weight
      reduction, and PA. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a 6-month
      community-based lifestyle behavior intervention (LSBI) conducted by lay health advisors and a
      control condition (disaster preparedness and home safety program) on lifestyle behaviors
      -dietary habits and physical activity(primary outcome) and selected physiologic outcomes
      (secondary outcomes) i.e., BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, measures of
      cholesterol,and fasting blood sugar of Latinas who are overweight/obese. The LSBI includes
      group education (8 classes) and individual teaching and coaching (8 contacts by home visits
      and telephone calls) delivered over a 6-month period. Acceptability and feasibility of the
      intervention is evaluated through examination of women's retention rates and participation in
      classes and home visits.
