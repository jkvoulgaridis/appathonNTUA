    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact on both clinical (violence and substance
      use) outcomes and health services use (substance use disorder and mental health treatment)
      compared to standard SUD treatment (enhanced treatment as usual) of

        1. an integrated Motivational Interviewing-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MI-CBT) violence
           prevention treatment intervention delivered during the 8-week early substance use
           disorder treatment phase; and

        2. MI-CBT plus a continuing care (CC) intervention for the 3-month continuing care period
           following the early treatment phase MI-CBT+CC).

      The study will provide important new information regarding the role and relative impact of
      both early treatment and continuing care interventions designed to impact substance use and
      violence, and whether combining such interventions yields additional benefits.

      Objective: Rates of violence in Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment samples often exceed
      50%, with studies showing rates of past-year violence &gt;70% when considering violence
      occurring with either intimate partners or others. Violence has numerous costs to Veterans
      and their families, in terms of physical (e.g., injuries) and psychosocial problems (mental
      health, legal problems, marital problems, poorer functioning for their children, etc.). To
      date, only one treatment approach (Behavioral Couples Therapy - BCT) has been established
      that reduces both substance use and violence, and BCT focuses exclusively on the couples'
      relationship. Given that a small proportion of Veterans in SUD treatment have a partner
      willing or able to attend treatment, and that a substantial amount of violence occurs with
      non-partners, there is a clear need for interventions that do not require partner
      participation and focus on violence and relapse prevention more generally. Based on prior
      findings, new intervention approaches targeting the use of violence prevention skills and
      means of sustaining substance use remission are needed.

      The primary objectives of this study are to examine the impact on both substance use and
      violence outcomes of:

        1. an acute treatment phase integrated Motivational Interviewing-Cognitive Behavioral
           Treatment intervention (MI-CBT); and

        2. MI-CBT plus a violence and substance use prevention Continuing Care intervention
           (MI-CBT+CC) intervention.

      Research Plan: Participants will be randomized to one of three conditions: MI-CBT, MI-CBT+CC
      or an enhanced treatment as usual (E-TAU) control condition with follow-up interviews
      targeting violence and substance use outcomes at 3, 6 and 12-months. The MI-CBT intervention
      involves six individual sessions delivered during the acute SUD treatment phase, combines
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) and CBT approaches targeting violence and substance use, and
      has been developed, piloted and refined by the investigators. The MI-CBT+CC intervention
      includes acute phase MI-CBT plus weekly telephone sessions for an additional 3-month period,
      and is designed to address both post-treatment violence and substance use through
      facilitating SUD remission and use of violence prevention skills. The MI-CBT+CC intervention
      is adapted from a continuing care intervention shown to help consolidate and maintain gains
      made in treatment.

      Methods: Veterans with substance use disorders will be recruited from the Substance Abuse
      Clinic (SAC) at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare system. Approximately 855 Veterans enrolling in
      SAC will be consented and screened, and those screening positive for severe and recent
      violence (~30%) and meeting other project inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible for
      participation in the randomized controlled trial (n = 210). The clinical interventions will
      be delivered by master's level clinicians, who will be monitored and supervised by licensed
      psychologists. Primary dependent measures (violence, substance use) will be measured at
      baseline and follow-up interviews, and the impact of the interventions on services use during
      the follow-up period also will be examined.

    <description>The CTS-SI is a semi-structured interview assessing interpersonal violence (violence severity, injury and characteristics of interpersonal conflict incidents). Baseline data collection assessed the 180 days prior to enrollment, and follow-up data was collected at 3 and 6 months for the prior 90 days, and at 12 months for the past 180 days. The analysis below compares the month rate of various types of interpersonal aggression from the period pre-baseline to the monthly rate post-intervention (across all 12 months of follow-up) in the form of % difference. Means at baseline, 3 , 6 and 12 months were compared resulting in a number with no measure of dispersion. Values were calculated across all participants. There were primary aggression outcomes (overall physical aggression, injuring another person), and secondary aggression outcomes (partner physical aggression and injury, nonpartner physical aggression and injury).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with severe and recent violence (i.e., injuring another person in the
             past year) will be eligible for the RCT.

          -  Eligible patients also will meet DSM-IV criteria for either alcohol or illicit drug
             (e.g., cocaine, marijuana, opiates, etc.) abuse/dependence.

          -  The study will include those with comorbid mood and/or anxiety problems (e.g.,
             depression, PTSD and other anxiety disorders), whether or not on medication at the
             point of recruitment, with the exception of those who have schizophrenia and/or are
             mentally incompetent (e.g., unable to provide informed consent).

          -  A brief mental status screen will with an established cutoff will be required for
             competency.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are suicidal (ideation, intent and plan) at the point of recruitment
             will not be enrolled in the study. Rather, research staff will inform clinical staff
             at the study site if a potential participant is currently suicidal.

          -  Participants who report transient suicidal ideation but no intent or plan will be
             eligible to participate.

          -  As noted, individuals with schizophrenia and/or who are mentally incompetent to
             consent for participation will be excluded. Finally, participants who live outside the
             study catchment area (i.e., a 45 mile radius of the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System)
             will be excluded.

        <title>Conflict Tactics Scale-Structured Interview (CTS-SI)</title>
        <description>The CTS-SI is a semi-structured interview assessing interpersonal violence (violence severity, injury and characteristics of interpersonal conflict incidents). Baseline data collection assessed the 180 days prior to enrollment, and follow-up data was collected at 3 and 6 months for the prior 90 days, and at 12 months for the past 180 days. The analysis below compares the month rate of various types of interpersonal aggression from the period pre-baseline to the monthly rate post-intervention (across all 12 months of follow-up) in the form of % difference. Means at baseline, 3 , 6 and 12 months were compared resulting in a number with no measure of dispersion. Values were calculated across all participants. There were primary aggression outcomes (overall physical aggression, injuring another person), and secondary aggression outcomes (partner physical aggression and injury, nonpartner physical aggression and injury).</description>

        <description>Data was collected via a Time-line Follow Back interview. Semi-structured interview assessing alcohol and drug use. Baseline data collection assessed the 180 days prior to enrollment, and follow-up data was collected at 3 and 6 months for the prior 90 days, and at 12 months for the past 180 days. The analysis below compares the monthly rate of various types of substance use (heavy drinking, cocaine, marijuana, and illicit) from the period pre-baseline to the monthly rate post-intervention (across all 12 months of follow-up) in the form of % difference. (% days use for each substance) Means at baseline, 3 , 6 and 12 months were compared resulting in a number with no measure of dispersion. Values were calculated across all participants.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>We fell short of recruitment goal of 210 participants and had a low number of women per group. Rates of aggression at each follow-up were very low so we collapsed across the 3,6 &amp; 12 month follow-ups when examining changes from baseline to follow-up.</limitations_and_caveats>
