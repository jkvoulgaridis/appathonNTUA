        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or female aged 18 to 60 years at the time of the first vaccination.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Satisfactory baseline medical assessment by history and physical examination. Stable
             health status is defined as the absence of health event satisfying the definition of a
             serious adverse event, or a change in an ongoing drug therapy due to therapeutic
             failure or symptoms of drug toxicity, within one month prior to enrollment.

          -  Access to a consistent means of telephone contact, which may be either in the home or
             at the workplace, land line or mobile, but NOT a pay phone or multiple-user device.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
                  hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of the study vaccine or planned use during the
             study period.

          -  Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses
             which, although stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject

             vaccinated at a later date, provided symptoms have resolved, vaccination occurs within
             the window specified by the protocol, and all other eligibility criteria continue to
             be satisfied.

                  successfully treated with local excisions only are excepted and may enroll within
                  3 years of diagnosis, but other histological types of skin cancer require a
                  3-year untreated and disease-free window as above.

             months of study enrolment or planned administration during the study period.

          -  Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study
             enrolment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.

          -  An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

          -  Administration of any vaccines within 30 days before vaccination.

          -  Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines; a history of
             anaphylactic-type reaction to any constituent of influenza vaccines; or a history of

        <description>GMFR, also called seroconversion factor (SCF), was defined as the fold increase in serum HI GMTs post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination. The flu strain assessed was Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like, in subjects 18-60 years old. The primary endpoint results consist in those presented for GSK2340272A Group.</description>

        <description>SCF was defined as the fold increase in serum HI GMTs post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination. The flu strain assessed was Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like, in subjects 18-60 years old.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects who received two doses of vaccine and for whom assay results were available for antibodies against H1N1 antigen for blood sample taken 14 days (Day 35) after the second vaccine dose.</population>

Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities.
