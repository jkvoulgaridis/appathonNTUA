      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Flaxseed may help
      protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects of flaxseed supplement in
      treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer undergoing
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the feasibility of dietary flaxseed (FS) supplementation in patients
           undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small
           cell lung cancer.

        -  To collect toxicity and tolerability data on dietary FS supplementation during
           definitive chemoradiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To validate urinary and serum markers of oxidative stress and FS lignan levels as
           surrogates of the bioavailability of FS in these patients.

        -  To determine if a dose response to daily ingestion of 20 g or 40 g of FS can be observed
           in plasma lignan levels and urinary markers of oxidative stress.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients consume flaxseed muffins once or twice daily beginning on the first day
           of radiotherapy and continuing for up to 9-10 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients consume placebo muffins once or twice daily beginning on the first day
           of radiotherapy and continuing for up to 9-10 weeks.

      Blood and urine samples are collected periodically for biomarker studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
