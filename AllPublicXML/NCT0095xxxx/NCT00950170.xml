  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ReFacto AF for the treatment of severe
      hemophilia A in patients who have not yet received treatment for their hemophilia. Study
      subjects will be males less than 6 years old who have not taken any clotting factor or other
      blood products before the study. The safety and effectiveness of ReFacto AF will be
      determined in this study by tests and procedures done at the doctor's office.
