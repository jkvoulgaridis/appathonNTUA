      Study the neural substrates of autism spectrum disorders using neuroimaging methods such as
      MEG/EEG/MRI.

      (NOTE: we are currently recruiting individuals between the ages of 14 and 32, either
      typically developing or with an autism spectrum disorder.)

      To study how sensory information is processed by the brain, we primarily use an instrument
      called MEG (MagnetoEncephaloGraphy), which measures the magnetic brainwaves emitted by our
      brains. The device does not have any output (i.e., there is no magnetic field); it only
      measures the waves produced in the brain.

      We measure those waves as the participants in the study listen to, view, or otherwise
      experience simple, non painful, stimuli. For instance, participants may listen to words while
      sitting in the MEG room, and watching a movie with the sound turned off.

      We then combine this information with pictures of the brain from MRI (Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging - when available), to get an idea about both the anatomy and the function of the
      brain, so that we can study how the brains of populations with autism spectrum disorders or
      language disorders may be different from those of typically developing populations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All of the following criteria must be met by all participants:

               -  The participant or the participant's legal guardian is able to understand and is
                  willing to comply with the requirements of the study

               -  The participant meets the age requirements (14-32 years old)

               -  The participant or legal guardian has signed an Informed Consent Form specific to
                  this study, and is able to understand the consent form.

               -  The participant must have English as their first language.

               -  The participant must have a non-verbal IQ &gt; 70

          -  For the ASD/language disorder group only:

               -  Autism Spectrum Disorder: Participants must meet criteria for Autism Spectrum
                  Disorder on the ADOS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The following exclusion criteria apply to both control and autism groups:

               -  Any volunteer for whom informed consent cannot be obtained

               -  Volunteers with metal braces, extensive dental work involving metals, implanted
                  electromagnetically activated medical equipment (cardiac pacemakers,
                  neurostimulators, functioning infusion pumps), all of which would interfere with
                  the MEG signal, will be excluded from the MEG portion of the study

               -  Volunteers with any medically diagnosed sensory loss

               -  Volunteers with a known genetic disorder (e.g. Tourette's syndrome, etc), or
                  other medical condition affecting the brain, such as progressive encephalopathy
                  as well as those who are on high doses of multiple anti-seizure medications and
                  have frequent, uncontrolled seizures

               -  Asphyxia at birth or any other time, premature birth (Fewer than 34 weeks
                  gestation)

          -  For the control group only:

               -  Volunteers diagnosed with a mental condition such as depression, anxiety,
                  aggression, hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder (with or without
                  hyperactivity).

               -  Volunteers who score below the autism spectrum cut-off (in the normal range) on
                  the ADOS and SCQ

               -  Volunteers on any sort of neuro-psychopharmacological treatment (including
                  antidepressants, stimulants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines).

          -  For the autism group only:

               -  Children or adults not meeting criteria for autism spectrum disorder

               -  Volunteers with co-morbid disorders such as tuberous sclerosis or fragile X.
