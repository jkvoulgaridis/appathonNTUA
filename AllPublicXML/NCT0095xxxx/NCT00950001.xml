    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery to see how well it works
      compared to clinical observation after surgery in treating patients with brain metastases.
      Stereotactic radiosurgery, a type of radiation therapy, may be able to send x-rays directly
      to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate benefit of post-surgical stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on the resection bed
      in providing 6 month local control (decreasing the risk of local tumor recurrence) when
      compared to surgical resection alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival, development of distant brain metastases and complications related to
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery to the surgical cavity within 30 days of
      the craniotomy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo clinical observation after craniotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 5-8 weeks, every 6-9 weeks
      for 1 year, every 3-4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

    <description>A univariate test between groups will be conducted using a log rank test of Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and multivariate analyses will be conducted via the Cox proportional hazards model.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be older than 3 years of age (radiosurgical frames cannot be placed on
             children younger than age 3).

             complete resection of at least one lesion as determined the study neuroradiologist.

          3. The resection cavity must have a maximum diameter of less than or equal to 4cm. This
             criteria will be determined by the study radiologist.

          4. Additional unresected brain metastases (up to 2) must have a maximum diameter of less
             than or equal to 3 cm.

          6. Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Scores (KPS) of at least 70 at the first
             post operative visit. Patients under 18 years of age must have a Lansky Performance
             Score of of at least 70.

          7. Patients must be able to undergo an MRI scan.

          8. Patients must agree to randomization as documented by signing the Institutional Review
             Board (IRB) approved consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received prior radiation therapy to the brain for any reason.

          2. There is radiographic evidence of leptomeningeal disease prior to study entry.

          3. The primary tumor is small-cell lung cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma.

          4. For females, if they are pregnant or breast-feeding (The exclusion is made because
