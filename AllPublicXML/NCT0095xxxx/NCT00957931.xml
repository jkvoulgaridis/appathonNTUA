  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this project is to cure patients with high risk Sickle cell disease and
      other red cell disorders including thalassemia and diamond-blackfan anemia by bone marrow
      transplantation. The patients enrolled in this study will be those who lack matched sibling
      donors and therefore have no other option but to undergo bone marrow transplantation using
      matched but unrelated bone marrow or umbilical cord blood from the national marrow donor
      program registry. Since bone marrow transplantation for these disorders using matched
      unrelated donors has two major problems i.e. engraftment, or , the process of new marrow
      being accepted and allowed to grow in the the patient; and graft-versus-host disease, or the
      process where the new marrow &quot;rejects&quot; the host or the patient, this study has been devised
      with methods to overcome these two problems and thus make transplantation from unrelated
      donors both successful in terms of engraftment and safe in terms of side effects, both acute
      and long term.

      In order to accomplish these two goals, two important things will be done. Firstly, patients
      will get three medicines which are considered reduced intensity because they are not known to
      cause the serious organ damage seen with conventional chemotherapy. These medicines, however,
      do cause intense immune suppression so these can cause increased infections. Secondly, in
      addition to transplantation of bone marrow from unrelated donors, patients will also
      transplanted with mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the bone marrow of their parents.
      Mesenchymal stromal cells are adult stem cells that are normally found in the bone marrow and
      are thought to create the right background for the blood cells to grow. They have been shown
      in many animal and human studies to improve engraftment. In addition, they have a special
      property by which they prevent and are now even considered to treat graft versus host
      disease. Therefore, by using a reduced intensity chemotherapy regimen before transplant and
      transplanting mesenchymal stromal cells, we hope to improve engraftment while at the same
      time decrease the potential for severe side effects associated with a conventional transplant
      which uses extremely high doses of chemotherapy.
