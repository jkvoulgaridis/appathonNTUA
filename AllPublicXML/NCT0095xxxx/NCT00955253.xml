  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out if spatial neglect following stroke and brain injury can be reduced using
      guanfacine, a drug that was shown to improve neglect in two stroke patients in a previous
      pilot study (Malhotra et al, 2006). In this trial, the effects of guanfacine will be examined
      in a larger number of patients, and there will also be a systematic assessment of whether the
      drug is only effective in patients with particular patterns of brain damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study has a double-blind crossover design where patients will receive a single
      2mg dose of oral guanfacine and a single dose of placebo. They will receive one of these on
      Day 2 of the study period and the other on Day 4.

      They will be tested daily on Days 1 to 5 so that any test repetition or long-term drug
      effects can be gauged.

      On days 2 and 4 they will be tested twice-once prior to drug/placebo administration and again
      90 minutes after drug/placebo administration.

      Tests will include standard pen-and-paper tasks for neglect as well as computerised tests of
      sustained attention and visual exploration. In our published pilot study (Malhotra et al,
      2006) there was a suggestion that patients without damage to frontal cortex were more likely
      to respond to guanfacine. In the current study we intend to test 10 patients with and 10
      patients without frontal damage in order to test this further.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were tested on five consecutive days. On days 1, 3 and 5, they were tested on a task battery. On day 2, individuals received active drug or placebo, and on day 4 they received placebo if they had previously received active drug and vice versa. The order of administration of guanfacine and placebo was counterbalanced across patients, according to a pregenerated randomisation scheme. The clinician who administered the drugs and the tests was blind to the randomisation and the drug. The analyses presented here were performed by a different researcher, only after all data were collected. On both treatment days, patients were tested on the task battery twice: once immediately before guanfacine/placebo administration and once 2 hours after.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Touchscreen Cancellation: This is a computerised scale for measuring the severity of spatial neglect as described in previous publications (Malhotra et al, Annals of Neurology 2006; Parton et al, Neuroreport 2006). Patients are asked to find and touch targets (which are embedded amongst distractors) on a touchscreen. In the variant of the task employed here, the targets are not marked when touched (&quot;Invisible Cancellation&quot;).The maximum number of targets that can be found is 64 (Therefore minimum score =0, maximum = 64), which represents normal performance.</description>

          <description>This is a computerised scale for measuring the severity of spatial neglect as described in previous publications (Malhotra et al, Annals of Neurology 2006; Parton et al, Neuroreport 2006). Patients are asked to find and touch targets (which are embedded amongst distractors) on a touchscreen. In the variant of the task employed here, the targets are not marked when touched (&quot;Invisible Cancellation&quot;).The maximum number of targets that can be found is 64 (Therefore minimum score = 0, maximum = 64), which represents normal performance.</description>
