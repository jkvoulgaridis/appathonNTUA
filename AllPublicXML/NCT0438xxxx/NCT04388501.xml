    <measure>Change From Baseline in Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2 and Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Activated partial thromboplastin time measures the time to clot formation via the intrinsic (contact) and common pathways, and is dependent on activation of contact factors (such as FXI). The assay is triggered in citrated platelet-poor plasma by addition of phospholipids, a contact activator (typically a negatively charged substance, as kaolin or ellagic acid), and calcium. The time taken for a fibrin clot to form is measured in seconds.</description>
