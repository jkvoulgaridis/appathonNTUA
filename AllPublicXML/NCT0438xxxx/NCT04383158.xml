  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-centre randomised controlled pilot study involving 12-24 healthy adult patients for
      investigating dental extraction socket healing with and without plasma rich in growth factors
      (PRGF) taking place during early days of healing (days 1, 3, 7, 15, 30) and relating the
      healing to clinical and histological outcomes after 90 days of healing. Healing will be
      investigated by means of various non-invasive imaging technologies (e.g. laser scanners,
      thermal cameras, laser cameras) in addition to conventional technologies (e.g. bone core
      biopsy, 3D xray images). At 90 days of healing, dental implants will be placed in the healed
      sockets and implants will be restored and followed up until 12 months after connecting the
      prosthesis to the implant (e.g. implant crown). Dental implant outcomes (e.g. survival,
      success) will also be evaluated.

      Randomised, controlled, single-centre, prospective, parallel-group qualitative pilot study.
      Objectives: the study aims to characterise wound healing events in the dental extraction
      socket with and without plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) taking place during early days
      of healing after a dental extraction and their relation to clinical and histological outcomes
      after 90 days of healing. The early healing events of the post-extraction socket will be
      characterized in terms of volumetric changes in relation to intra-oral thermographic changes,
      blood flowgraphy, molecular (proteomic) changes, as well as extra-oral integrated geometric
      thermographic changes in tandem with clinical measures of soft tissue healing, post-operative
      pain assessment. The early healing events will be analysed in relation to volumetric,
      clinical and histomorphometric changes of new bone formation after 90 days of healing during
      dental implant treatment. Dental Implant outcomes will be evaluated up to 12 months after
      loading.

      Duration: Overall, the investigators anticipate that the study will last approximately 22
      months. The investigators estimate a 2-month study set-up period, followed by a recruitment
      period of 3 months. Each participant will attend 14 visits over approximately 22 months. The
      first 9 visits, from enrolment to 90 days after extraction, will provide data for a clinical
      PhD study. Visits 10 to 14 will be for restoring the dental implant and evaluating dental
      implant treatment outcomes which will not be related to the clinical PhD study.

    <description>ENDORET® POST-EXTRACTION ALVEOLUS DENTAL KIT (KMU16) is a system for obtaining plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF), which can be applied in the regeneration of bone and other connective tissues in oral surgery. PRGF is a completely autologous blood platelet concentrate that stimulates tissue regeneration due to enrichment with autologous growth factors, acting as a biological system.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have willingness to read and sign a copy of the Informed Consent Form
             Males and females, ≥25 years old.

          -  Patient in need of a single permanent tooth extraction with clinical and/or
             radiographic evidence of unrestorable maxillary premolars, canines, or incisors with
             at least one adjacent tooth present, and with periodontal attachment preserved at
             least for 2/3rd of the root nor associated with acute periapical pathology.

          -  Post-extraction alveolar bone defect with ≤50 % buccal bone loss. This will be
             confirmed at Visit 2 after extraction. In case of &gt;50% buccal bone loss, the
             participant will be withdrawn.

          -  Patient in good general health as documented by self-assessment.

          -  Full mouth bleeding and plaque scores (FMBS &lt;10% and FMPS &lt;20%) recorded within the
             previous 8 weeks.

          -  All males would be willing to keep their face clean shaven throughout approximately
             the first 4 months of the study as facial hair introduces errors in extra-oral
             geometric thermal imaging.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled or untreated periodontal disease.

          -  History of local (head and neck) radiation therapy.

          -  Presence of oral lesions in the area of the extraction (such as ulceration,
             malignancy).

          -  Severe bruxing or clenching habits.

          -  Acute endodontic lesion in the test tooth or in the neighbouring areas to the
             extraction procedure (sites with presence of an asymptomatic chronic lesion are
             eligible).

          -  Medical history that includes uncontrolled diabetes or hepatic or renal disease, or
             other serious medical conditions that can impact on bone metabolism (e.g. rheumatoid
             arthritis, osteoporosis) or transmittable diseases (e.g. AIDS).

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Smokers.

          -  Self-reported pregnancy or lactation (this criterion is due to oral tissue changes
             related to pregnancy and nursing which can affect interpretation of study results).

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             trial results and, in the judgement of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.

          -  Malocclusion, or collapse of the occlusal vertical dimension leading to dentoalveolar
             compensation which could interfere with ridge preservation dimensions and
             measurements.

          -  Lack of adjacent sound restored or unrestored teeth.
