  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intrathecal analgesia is a recommended technic to treat persistent pain in cancer patient
      but little used, whose the technical conditions require hospital multidisciplinary expertise
      and coordination associated to a link between city and hospital. The experience of patients
      who benefit of this technic in this situation of advanced cancer (loco-regional or
      metastatic) is little known. So far, it doesn't exist developed tools to know it.

      In literature, 2 qualitative studies have been published on the quality of life with
      intrathecal analgesia. A study realised in 2009 with 6 Canadian patients (3 interview per
      patients) and nurses in palliative unit shows the positive impact on the quality of life of
      patients. Recently, a qualitative study has approached the question of the quality of life of
      patients who had an intrathecal analgesia with the point of view of nursing staff. The
      results confirm the improvement of quality of life and suggest an establishment more
      premature of technic in the care process.

      Given the development of this technic in cancerology in France and more premature in the care
      process of patients, it seems interesting to know better the experience of patients with
      cancer and for who the pain is treated by this technic and the impact on the quality of life
      of these patients sometimes dependent of some expert centres. This study is done to answer to
      theses questions on the experience of patients and their close relations and the impact of
      the quality of life according to a qualitative approach. An independent psychologist of
      process care of patients will realised semi-directed before putting on the equipment allowing
      the administration of analgesic by intrathecal pathway, at 1 month, then 3 months to know the
      experience when the balance of the pain is generally reached (M1) and the impact in long-term
      (M3).

      The referent algologist informs the patient of the retained offer in the pain
      multidisciplinary consultation meeting. Following the consultation, the investigator sees the
      patient to explain the study and to verify all the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, to
      give and explain the information note and to be sure of the non-opposition.

      A psychologist comes in each centre to realise the semi-directed interviews before putting on
      the catheter, at 1 month and at 3 months after the establishment of this technic. The
      interview will be recorded with the agreement of the patient then totally transcribed. A
      double analysis will allow to extract the verbatim record and to construct the thematic tree
      with under-themes.

      The same day of the interviews, 4 questionnaires will allow to evaluate to the 3 periods of
      measurement (before putting on the catheter, M1 et M3) : the mean pain of the past 24 hours
      by the BPI-SF (Brief Pain Inventory-short form) questionnaire, the anxiety and the depression
      by the HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) questionnaire, the quality of life by the
      QLQ-C30 questionnaire, the catastrophism by the PCS (Pain Catastrophizing Scale)
      questionnaire.

      The evaluation by the patient and the algologist of the global clinic improvement after the
      establishment of the analgesic treatment by intrathecal way will be realised at M1 and M3
      with the help of the questionnaire P-GIC and C-GIC (Patient or Clinical- Global Impression of
      Change).

      The study does not interfere with the treatment of the patient and his usual care. No
      biological exams or imagery will be realise in this study.

    <description>The evaluation will be done through the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire. It is a 9 item self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning such as general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work including outside the home and housework, relations with other people, enjoyment of life, and sleep. This questionnaire is a 10 point scale (where 0 = no interference and 10 = interferes completely).</description>

        20 patients having pain treated by analgesic administrated through an intrathecal way with
        an implantable pump will be included in this study.

        The inclusion of patients will be done with a consecutive way to avoid the selection bias.
        Each patient file will be presented to the pain multidisciplinary consultation meeting. It
        will have the validation of an antalgic treatment by an intrathecal way. The investigator
        will verify the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria to offer the study to all the
        corresponding patients
