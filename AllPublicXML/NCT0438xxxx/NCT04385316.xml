  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer and colorectal cancer are common gastrointestinal malignancies in the
      world.Early cancer generally has no obvious symptoms. Endoscopy is the &quot;gold standard&quot;for the
      diagnosis of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer.gastric cancer and colorectal cancer
      treatment mainly includes surgery and medication.Compared with traditional diagnosis and
      treatment methods, the application of gene detection technology, especially high-throughput
      sequencing technology (NGS) in tumor diagnosis and treatment, performs multi-dimensional and
      multi-target detection of cancer-related genes, which can quickly and accurately determine
      the target gene mutations Morphology and expression differences, so as to provide
      personalized guidance to patients in terms of medication, treatment or prognosis evaluation,
      which can save a lot of time and treatment costs, and improve the overall treatment effect
      and patient quality of life.

      Cystoscopy and biopsy sampling pathological testing are the gold standard for bladder cancer
      diagnosis, and have been widely used in clinical diagnosis and prognosis judgment. However,
      cystoscopy is cumbersome, expensive, and often causes pain to the patients under test. At
      present, the main clinical non-invasive detection technique for bladder cancer is still the
      cytological examination of urinary tract bladder cells in urine, and its sensitivity and
      specificity are not good, especially for the diagnosis of early lower grade bladder
      cancer.For bladder cancer, tumor tissue (puncture biopsy or surgical resection) DNA, urine
      ctDNA, urinary tract exfoliated cell DNA and peripheral blood ctDNA can be used for genetic
      testing, but the consistency of the genetic testing results of these four types of samples
      has not been verified, especially There is no systematic evaluation of the guidance effect of
      non-invasive gene detection of free tumor DNA and urinary tract shed cell DNA in the
      diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer.The corresponding relationship between the
      significant mutation genes contained in the DNA derived from bladder urinary tract cancer and
      the various types and stages of bladder cancer is not clear.
