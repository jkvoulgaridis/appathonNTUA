    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess vitamin D as a therapeutic adjunct in the stimulant
      treatment of ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether acute calcitriol (vitaminD)
      administration (compared to placebo) enhances the neurocognitive effects of of current
      stimulant medications as measured by tasks of vigilance/attention, spatial working memory,
      and reversal learning in individuals with (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      using a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject, two-day study design.

      Primary Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that calcitriol (versus placebo) administration will
      enhance positive neurocognitive effects of current stimulant medications in individuals with
      ADHD.

      Seconday (Exploratory) Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that calcitriol (versus placebo)
      administration alone will also enhance neurocognitive performance on tasks of
      attention/vigilance and/or spatial working memory.

    <description>On the Continuous Performance Task (CPT-IP) subjects are shown a random sequence of different numbers and are instructed to press a button as quickly and accurately as possible upon detection of two identical pairs of numbers, and to withhold their response to any other sequence of letters. Outcomes will be measured by d prime.</description>

    <description>The spatial working memory task is a measure of working memory. As part of the task, stimuli will be projected onto the computer screen and target stimuli can be spatial locations, different visual stimuli, sound or text. Outcomes will be measured by percent correct.</description>

    <description>A total of 24 otherwise medically healthy individuals with ADHD will be studied as outpatients. All subjects will undergo neurocognitive assessments of attention/vigilance, spatial working memory, and reversal learning both before and after subjects' daily dosing with their currently prescribed stimulant medication on both calcitriol and placebo pretreatment days using a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject, two-day study design.</description>
