    <intervention_model_description>Test staging: Phase I Design Type: Single Arm Test This study was a preliminary study of stage Ia, openness, dose escalation, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy.
To assess safety and tolerability in HER2-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer subjects, to determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and to explore maximum tolerated dose (MTD); to evaluate pharmacokinetic characteristics, immunization Originality and preliminary exploration of efficacy.
The study was divided into the main trial period and the extended trial period. The subject trial completed the enrollment and DLT observations of all evaluable DLT subjects for the dose climbing phase; the PK expansion phase completed the enrollment required PK sample collection for the enrolled subjects.
The extension test is the completion of the subject test and the subject continues to take the drug to the stage of progression of the disease or intolerance.

    <description>Usage: intravenous infusion; B002, doses 2, 6, 12, 16, 20 mg / kg, intravenous drip. The infusion time was 120 ± 10 minutes for the first time; if the patient was tolerated, the follow-up time was adjusted to 60 ± 10 minutes. Pre-treatment was performed using phenergan (25 mg, intramuscular) within 30 minutes prior to each study drug infusion. The dosing cycle is administered once every 3 weeks for one cycle and can be administered continuously until the disease progresses or is intolerable.</description>
