      Subjects undergo vitreous substitution with either SF6 gas or fluid during vitrectomy.

      Hypothesis: Subjects undergoing vitreous substitution with 30% SF6 gas during vitrectomy will
      have fewer postoperative vitreous hemorrhages compared to control subjects

      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized according to a coin toss during PPV: heads undergo
      30% SF6 gas tamponade, tails undergo vitreous substitution with fluid

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          1. Subject age is 18-85 years.

          2. Subject consents to study participation and is capable of 6 months of follow-up.

          3. The subject has type I or II Diabetes Mellitus with active PDR in the study eye.

          4. Best-corrected spectacle visual acuity (BCSVA) on the Snellen eye chart ranges from
             20/40 to hand motions in the study eye.

          5. The subject is determined to need a PPV for the primary indication of VH secondary to
             PDR.

        Exclusion:

          1. Subject has significant vitreoretinal adhesion (Grades 2 or 3) (i.e. extensive fibrous
             proliferation or tractional retinal detachment).

          2. Subject is known to have a significant retinal/optic nerve disease otherwise unrelated
             to Diabetes Mellitus, which in the opinion of the examiner is responsible for two or
             more lines of reduced BCSVA (macular degeneration, optic neuritis, glaucoma,
             amblyopia, etc.) in the study eye.

          3. Subject is known to have macular ischemia, which in the opinion of the examiner, is
             responsible for two or more lines of reduced BCSVA in the study eye.

          4. Subject has a significant corneal or cataract opacity, which in the opinion of the
             examiner, is responsible for two or more lines of reduced BCSVA (corneal scar,
             ectasia, etc.) in the study eye.

          5. Subject has had a previous vitrectomy (anterior or PPV) in the study eye.

          6. Subject has uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma (intraocular pressure &gt; 30 mmHg despite
             medical/surgical treatment) in the study eye.

          7. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 200 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 120 mmHg)
             despite adherence to a multiple anti-hypertensive medication regimen.
