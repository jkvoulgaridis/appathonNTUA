  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XW003 is an acylated human GLP-1 analogue and is being development for obesity management.

      This is a first-in-human (FIH), single-centre, double blind, randomised, SAD study of XW003
      conducted in healthy adult participants. The study is designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, and PD of XW003 in healthy participants.

    <textblock>
      Participants will undergo a Screening period beginning up to 28 days prior to
      randomisation/dose administration. Participants will undergo pre-dose assessments, post-dose
      assessments, and will complete an EOS follow-up visit or early termination (ET) visit.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled into one of up to seven (7) sequential cohorts
      (Cohorts A1 to A7). Participants in each cohort will be randomised to receive a single
      subcutaneous (SC) dose of either XW003 or matching placebo on Day 1 following an overnight
      fast. Two sentinel participants will receive a single SC dose of XW003 initially. If dosing
      of these sentinel participants proceeds without clinically significant safety signals in the
      first 48 hours post-dose, the remaining participants will receive a single dose of XW003 or
      placebo according to the randomisation schedule.
