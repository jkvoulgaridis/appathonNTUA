  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA) can help treat and prevent many physical and mental health conditions.
      However, many of the United Kingdom population do not meet the Department of Health's PA
      recommendations which is contributing to the high chronic disease burden in the UK
      population. Many patients who are admitted to acute medical wards have at least one co-
      morbidity. Inpatients on acute hospital wards do not routinely receive PA advice from
      healthcare staff. The investigators believe that patients could be encouraged to increase
      their PA level (PAL) during an admission to hospital.

      The investigators have undertaken two previous qualitative studies that proceed this work.
      The first study found that patients were open to discussing PA during admission to an acute
      medical unit (AMU). In the second study patients thought motivational interviews focused on
      PA helped them increase their PAL. Although patients have reported that motivational
      interviews were beneficial in helping them increase their PA, this has so far not been
      assessed quantitatively.

      The investigators plan to recruit 50-100 patients and randomise them into two groups. One
      group will receive a short PA intervention and the other a long intervention. The
      investigators will use the moving medicine online resource to structure both PA intervention.
      The 'one minute' conversation will be used for the short PA intervention and the 'more
      minutes' conversation for the long PA intervention. The investigators will measure the PAL of
      both groups at baseline and at two follow-up points (4 weeks and 12 weeks). The Global
      Physical Activity Questionnaire will be used to assess participants self-reported PAL. The
      data collected will be used to describe participants baseline PAL and the treatment effect of
      the two PA interventions. The investigators will also calculate estimated recruitment and
      retention rates. The results of this feasibility study will be used to plan a similarly
      designed powered randomised controlled trial.

    <description>The long PA intervention will be a MI (motivational interview) exploring the participant's knowledge and concerns about PA. An MI involves a semi-structured discussion between an investigator and the participant. The MI initially explores the participant's knowledge of the benefits of PA and their concerns about PA. The MI will then explore the participant's confidence in increasing their PAL, help the participant come up with a plan to increase their PAL and finally the participant will be signposted to further support and local opportunities for PA. The investigator will use a Moving Medicine 'more minutes' conversation tool of a chronic health condition that the patient has to facilitate every MI. Where possible the investigator will discuss the chronic condition that most relates to the participant's current admission to hospital. For patients with no health conditions the primary prevention section will be used.</description>

    <description>The short PA intervention will involve a short (1 min) discussion between an investigator and a participant. A Moving Medicine 'one minute' intervention appropriate to the participant's health conditions will be used to guide every short intervention. The short intervention will firstly involve the investigator asking whether the participant knew that doing PA was beneficial for their health. The investigator would then explain to be more PA they could try to build more PA into their daily routine and that this was often enough to meet the current PA recommendations. The investigator will also offer the participant a patient information sheet about PA.</description>

    <intervention_name>'More minutes' conversation (Moving medicine)</intervention_name>
    <description>For the interventions in this study we have chosen to use the Moving Medicine conversation tools because they are an evidence-based PA intervention tool. The Moving Medicine 'more minutes' conversation tool initially involves the investigator exploring the participant's understanding of PA. Improving patients' knowledge of the benefits of PA may empower them to increase their PAL because knowledge of the benefits of PA may motivate patients to increase their PAL. The division of the Moving Medicine conversation tools into chronic health conditions is important because it will allow the investigator to explore topics relating to PA which are specific to the participant's own medical co-morbidities. For example, in a patient with known ischaemic heart disease the investigator could discuss how PA helps to prevent the risk of further heart attacks and the development of heart failure (Moving Medicine).</description>
