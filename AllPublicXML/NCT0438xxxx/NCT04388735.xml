  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to examine differences in quality of life and psychological
      distress for both Multiple Myeloma patients receiving treatment and their caregivers and to
      assess patient and caregiver prognostic understanding (understanding of the likely course of
      a disease over time) of Multiple Myeloma to guide development of more personalized treatment
      plans.

      This study looks to further understand quality of life changes throughout multiple myeloma
      therapy for both patients and caregivers to help determine ways to improve patient and
      caregiver understanding of illness and in turn, tailor customized treatment that best aligns
      with patient preferences.

      The study will use a series of questionnaires to measure quality of life, mood, coping
      strategies, and prognostic understanding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study's procedures include screening for eligibility, participant designation
      of a caregiver and a series of questionnaires.

      - It is expected that about 180 people undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma and up to
      180 of their caregivers will take part in this research study.

      -- The questionnaires are completed one time only and measure quality of life, mood, coping
      strategies, and prognostic understanding and can be completed in the hospital, clinic, over
      the email, or telephone with assistance provided as needed.Questionnaires take approximately
      20 minutes to complete.

    <description>Describe patient QOL scores by lines of therapy. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Multiple Myeloma(FACT-MM) will be used to assess QOL, which has been validated for use in multiple care settings.[10]. The FACT-MM consists of four subscales assessing well-being across four domains (physical, functional, emotional, and social). These self-reported measures possess strong psychometric properties and have been validated for patients with cancer [Appendix E].</description>
