  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study evaluates the safety and efficacy of OH2 as single agent or in combination
      with Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with malignant solid tumors (Melanoma).

      OH2 is an oncolytic virus developed upon genetic modifications of the herpes simplex virus
      type 2 strain HG52, allowing the virus to selectively replicate in tumors. Meanwhile, the
      delivery of the gene encoding human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
      may induce a more potent antitumor immune response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The non-operative stage III or stage IV malignant tumor patients with clear diagnosis
             by pathology and/ or cytology; breast cancer, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, liver
             cancer, cervical cancer, malignant melanoma, head and neck tumors, Priority inclusion
             in soft tissue sarcomas (mainly for melanoma patients at the dose extension phase).

          2. The absence of a conventional effective treatment or treatment failure or recurrence
             by a conventional method.

          3. Male or female patients, aged 18 ≤ 75 years (including boundary value), general
             physical condition score ECOG 0 ≤ 1, expected survival time more than 3 months.

          4. Prior anti-tumor treatment (including endocrine, chemical/ radiotherapy,targeted
             therapy) was over 4 weeks (more than 6 weeks of discontinuation using nitroso-and
             mitomycin-based chemotherapy) and was recovered to grade 1 from the side effects of
             prior treatment.

          6. There is at least one measurable lesion that is suitable for intratumoral injection.
