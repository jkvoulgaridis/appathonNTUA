  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proof of concept study to investigate the impact of a food supplement consisting of Acacia
      gum on changes of gut microbiota and production of short chain fatty acids. Additionally,
      safety, tolerability and parameters of bowel function (stool frequency, stool consistency and
      gastrointestinal symptoms) will be assessed during the study.

             gastrointestinal system or on visceral motility

          -  Constipation defined as an average of 2 - 3 stools per week (which needs to be
             confirmed during a prospective run-in phase)

          -  At least one of the following criteria:

               -  straining during more than 25% of defecations

                  defecations

               -  sensation of incomplete evacuation in more than 25% of defecations

               -  sensation of anorectal obstruction/ blockage in more than 25% of defecations

               -  manual manoeuvre to facilitate more than 25% of defecations (such as digital
                  evacuation or support from pelvic floor)

          -  Criteria of constipation for at least the previous 3 months

             the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the outcome of the study, e.g.
