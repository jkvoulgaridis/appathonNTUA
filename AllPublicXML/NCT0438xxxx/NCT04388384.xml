  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      So far, there is no data available on treatment of patients with early-stage hormone receptor
      (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressed/amplified breast
      cancer, who completed adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy less than one year ago, in the
      clinical routine setting.

      ELEANOR - designed as a prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional study (NIS) - will
      investigate real-world use of neratinib and its treatment management in patients with
      HR-positive, HER2-overexpressing/amplified breast cancer stage I-III having completed
      adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy less than one year ago. Data from this study will
      contribute to a deeper understanding and characterization of the everyday use of neratinib in
      a broader patient population in the German and Austrian routine setting.
