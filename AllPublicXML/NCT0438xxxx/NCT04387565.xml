      Introduction: Vanadium important pollutants produced from anthropogenic activities, has been
      suggested to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in a lot of studies. Magnesium sulfate therapy is
      used very common to prevent seizures in women with preeclampsia. However, the causes of
      preeclampsia are little known and heavy metals merit further investigation. The investigators
      will be tested whether late - onset preeclampsia (LOPE) was associated with exposure to these
      metals.

      Methods: This study was designed to determine maternal plasma/urine/hair magnesium and
      vanadium concentrations in women with LOPE (n=70) compared to those of normotensive pregnant
      women (n=70) and to those of normotensive-healthy non-pregnant women (n=70). These metals
      concentrations will be measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry were
      compared.

      This observational case-control study will be conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology, Cengiz Gokcek Public Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey, between May 2020 and February
      2021. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of Gaziantep
      University (reference no: 2020/130). The study strictly will be adhered to the principles of
      the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants will be included in the study gave oral and
      written informed consent. Two-hundred ten women will be enrolled in the study in three
      groups.

    <description>The diagnosis of LOPE, as will be defined by the Committee on Terminology of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), will be established based on the presence of proteinuria and a blood pressure level of ≥140/90 mmHg that occurs after 34 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman. The diastolic and/or systolic blood pressure ≥ 160/110 mm Hg, it will be accepted as mild; and in case these values exceeded this level, it will be accepted as severe.</description>
