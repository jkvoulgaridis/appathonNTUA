  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing aids are the number one treatment for hearing loss and it is estimated that out of
      the 2 million of UK individuals who are supplied with hearing aids 1.4 million will use their
      hearing aids to varying degrees and the other 0.6 million will stop using their hearing aids
      altogether.

      The proposed research is looking to improve hearing aid usage by using a self-affirmation
      intervention which lowers the threat of participants' ageing anxiety. The target of lowering
      participants' ageing anxiety to improve hearing aid use is because there is a stigma of
      hearing aids making people seem old and this stigma can make individuals resistant to wearing
      their hearing aids as they do not want to be seen in this light.

      The current proposed research is an extension of a pilot study that was conducted in 2016
      which found that a self-affirmation intervention may be useful in improving individuals'
      hearing aid usage. They randomly allocated 50 first-time hearing aid users either to a group
      that undertook a self-affirming exercise (e.g., &quot;If I feel threatened or anxious, then I will
      think about the things I value about myself&quot;) or to a no-intervention control group.
      Consistent with the idea that self-affirmation helps people deal with threat, first-time
      hearing aid users reported significantly lower anxieties about ageing after self-affirming.
      Moreover, according to the data usage downloaded from their hearing aids (data-logging), the
      self-affirming group were found to have worn their hearing aids an average of two hours per
      day longer than the control group. Due to the limited number of participants, the effects of
      the intervention were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the low cost and high
      potential public health &quot;reach&quot; alongside the effect size of d = 0.43 indicates that the
      intervention shows promise.

      The main aim of this research is to re-test the self-affirmation intervention from the
      previous pilot study with a sufficiently large enough sample to answer the following &quot;Does a
      self-affirmation intervention improve participant's hearing aid usage when compared to
      participants in the control group?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited through an NHS audiology clinic where they will be invited to
      participant in this study via an invitation letter enclosed within their appointment letter.
      The information used to identify potential participants is that of their diagnoses (must be
      using or being supplied with hearing aids) and their treatment (must be returning for a
      follow up appointment ). The audiology clinic staff will be identifying potential clients
      therefore it is believed that there is unlikely to be a breach of confidentiality.
      Alternatively, if they did not receive the invitation letter they will be approached within
      clinic and asked if they wish to participate. All participants will be given a £10
      shop-for-all voucher for agreeing to participate at the second stage of the study (10-week
      post appointment).

      All prospective participants will be required to give written consent before being assigned
      to the study and those unable to do this will not be included. After consent is given
      participants will be allocated to either the intervention group or the control group.
      Procedure of the proposed study is as follows:

        1. Each participant will be randomly assigned to either the control group or the
           intervention group. Blinding of both the participant and the researcher with regards to
           which group the participant has been assigned to will be achieved by all questionnaires
           being placed in opaque envelopes which will have a number printed on the front of the
           envelope. The numbers from the envelope will be placed in a computerised list generator
           and an order list of how they are to be administered will be produced.

        2. Participants in both groups fill in a questionnaire which contain the following Scales:
           The Anxiety toward Ageing Scale (AAS), The Attitudes Toward Loss of Hearing
           Questionnaire (ATLH) and The Glasgow Benefit Hearing Aid Scale (GBHA) as well as a
           self-report question on their daily hearing aid use. The intervention group also
           undertake a self-affirmation exercise which is placed at the end of the questionnaire.
           This is expected to take 20-30 minutes.

        3. Participants return 10 weeks later (post) and have their hearing aid usage downloaded
           (hours per day the aids were worn) from their hearing aids by an audiologist before
           subsequently filling in another questionnaire which again contains the AAS, ATLH, GBHA
           and a self- report question on their daily hearing aid use. This is expected to take
           30-40 minutes.

        4. Six months later participants are contacted via email or post to fill in an optional
           questionnaire containing the AAS, ATLH, GBHA and a self-report question on their daily
           hearing aid use which they send back to the researcher. This should take 20-30 minutes.

        5. A debrief form will be sent out via e-mail or post by the principal researcher 3 weeks
           after the follow up questionnaire was returned or alternatively if they decide to not to
           complete the follow up questionnaire the debrief will be sent 4 weeks after the initial
           questionnaire request was sent.

      A G-power analysis was conducted to detect a small-moderate effect size (Cohen's D of 0.35)
      with 80% power at the 5% significance level which indicated that a sample of 260 participants
      (130 per group) would be required. This study will attempt to recruit 400 based on a similar
      pilot study having a 34% attrition rate. The data collection phase will continue until 260
      participants have completed the 10 week follow up.

      The study design is a mixed Design: Between-participants factor is condition (control vs
      intervention). Within-participants factor is time (pre-intervention vs post intervention
      (10-week) vs exit (6 month after post ). We will use a series of 2 (Intervention, control) x
      3 ( pre-intervention, post intervention and exit) repeated ANOVA to assess to assess the
      outcome measures. If a small-moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.35) is found on any of the
      principle and secondary measures, then the Hayes PROCESS macro will be used to examine the
      possible mediating effects of the intervention on participants' hearing aid usage. If data is
      missing at the 10-week follow up the participant concerned will be excluded from the analysis
      at this point. The present study also has a longitudinal element and attrition at 6 months is
      expected. Any missing data will be addressed by using the &quot;last observation carried forward
      technique&quot;.

      All data such as contact details and ethnicity will be pseudonymised and kept in a separate,
      password protected file, in a restricted access folder on a secure University server. All
      paper copies of contact details and questionnaire data will be secured in Manchester
      University in a locked filing cabinet. Only the study team and regulatory monitoring and
      auditing authorities from the University of Manchester will have access to this data.

      All the questionnaire data will be anonymised and kept in a separate, password protected
      file, in a restricted access folder on a secure University server. Only the study team and
      regulatory monitoring and auditing authorities from the University of Manchester will have
      access to this data.

      The physical personal data copies will be kept until completion of the study then will be
      destroyed in accordance with University of Manchester regulations. All consent forms and
      questionnaire data are deemed as essential and this will be kept for 5 years to comply with
      University of Manchester regulations.

      The current study will go through ethics approval with the National Health Service, Health
      Research Authority in the UK before it will be allowed to proceed. The study has already been
      through a preliminary ethics review at the University of Manchester.
