      This phase III trial studies compares CT-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy and
      MRI-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating prostate cancer.
      Image-guided SBRT is a standard treatment for prostate cancer, which combines imaging of the
      cancer within the body with the delivery of therapeutic radiation doses produced on a linear
      accelerator machine. Imaging modalities for image-guided SBRT can be either computed
      tomography imaging (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a combination of the two. This
      research is being done to help determine whether there are benefits to MRI-guidance over
      CT-guidance in patients who are receiving the same radiation dose by SBRT to treat prostate
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine whether (MRI)-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) improves acute
      physician-scored genitourinary (GU) toxicity when compared with standard computed tomography
      (CT)-guided SBRT for prostate cancer (PCa).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether there are differences in acute grade &gt;= 2 gastrointestinal (GI)
      toxicity as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version
      4.03 scale, following MRI-guided SBRT versus CT-guided SBRT.

      II. To determine whether there are differences in 5-year cumulative incidences of late grade
      &gt;= 2 GU and GI physician-reported toxicity, following MRI-guided SBRT versus CT-guided SBRT.

      III. To quantify the temporal changes in patient-reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes, as
      assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-26 (EPIC-26), International Prostate Symptom
      Scores (IPSS), and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) QOL indices, following MRI-guided
      SBRT.

      IV. To determine whether there are differences in 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival
      (BCRFS) following MRI-guided SBRT.

      V. To observe the proportion of SBRT fractions for which on-line adaptive radiotherapy is
      required due to changes in organ-at-risk anatomy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo 5 fractions of CT-guided SBRT over 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo 5 fractions of MRI-guided SBRT over 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 4 years, and then yearly thereafter.
