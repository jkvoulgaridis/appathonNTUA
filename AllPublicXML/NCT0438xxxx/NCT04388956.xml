  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      4 to 7 percent of adult population has a palpable thyroid nodule and 17% to 27% of cases can
      be found when examined by sonography. Although the incidence of the thyroid nodules is high,
      only 1 of 20 clinically identified nodules is malignant.

      Several gray scale sonographic characteristics have been suggestive of malignancy, including
      hypoechoigenicity, micro calcification, blurred margin and intranodular vascularity. The
      intranodular vascularity has been studied in several researches. But the previous studies
      usually evaluated the vascularity by color Doppler sonography and only divided into several
      categories subjectively. And the result is controversial.

      The evaluation of the tumor microcirculation by Doppler ultrasound has been used in many
      tumors and defined as vascularity index (VI). The power Doppler sonography has many
      advantages over color Doppler ultrasound in studying the vascularity. It is more sensitive,
      less noisy. Power Doppler can detect the blood flow of small internal tumor vessels with a
      diameter of less than 100μm at slow flow rates on the order of a few mm per second1,2
      According to our previous study, the vascularity index(PDVI) of thyroid tumor by power
      Doppler ultrasound between benign and malignant one are statistically different.

      In the present study, we examine different PDVI of thyroid tumors and the
      traditional（B-mode）ultrasound features including the heterogeneity, echogenicity, margin
      status, and the presence of microcalcification. We consider the several factors
      simultaneously by statistical model (PCA, FLD). In the outpatient clinic based population
      setting, we want to reappraise the accuracy of the new model of multi-factorial ultrasound
      diagnosis with the conventional fine-needle aspiration cytology.

    <description>Patients who were eligible for this trial will receive the new model of ultrasound evaluation . The traditional features including echogenicity, margin, heterogeneity, size and the presence of microcalcification will be recorded in the same time. Then we evaluate the thyroid tumor vascularity in sagittal and transverse section by power Doppler mode (WF: medium, CPA: 82, RPF: 1000). The DICOM data of the vascularity index(PDVI) will be collected and analyzed later.</description>

        We plan to recruit 300 patients who have discrete solid thyroid tumors need to undergo
        fine-needle aspiration cytology to provide the tentative diagnosis. The inclusion criteria
        were discrete thyroid tumors with mainly solid content (&gt;50% solid content) and diameter of
        tumors between 0.5-3cm. The exclusion criteria were abnormal thyroid function, past history
        of thyroiditis, multinodular goiter, and cystic tumors.
