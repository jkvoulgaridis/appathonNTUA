  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High fidelity simulation (HFS) is an established method of training in various fields of
      medicine, especially emergency medicine, anesthesiology and intensive therapy. One of the
      benefits of HFS as an educational tool is the protective environment, where the risk of error
      do not bring harm to the patients.

      It is proven that HFS is successful in acquisition of new knowledge and skills and may
      facilitate positive behavioral change in medical students. However, this education method may
      cause elevated stress levels as well as other physiological reactions. Other than sympathetic
      nervous system reactions such as heart rate and blood pressure, there are a few laboratory
      stress level markers such as cortisol, alpha-amylase, testosterone and secretory
      immunoglobulin A. Our aim was to evaluate the change of stress level induced by high-fidelity
      simulation in medical students.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Α-amylase activity in saliva [U/ml]</measure>
    <time_frame>120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva was collected using a disposable Salivette tube (Sarstedt AG &amp; Co, Germany) by placing a sterile tampon under the tongue or chewing for 30-45 seconds. Next the tube was centrifuged (1000 x g for 10 min.) to obtain a ready to test saliva supernatant. Samples were frozen after centrifugation at - 85°C until performing laboratory tests. Α-amylase activity assay was performed by a static method with AMYLAZA kit (Aqua-Med Łodz, Poland). The samples were diluted 100 times using 0,9% chloride solution. 2-chloro-4-nitrofenylo-maltotrioside is a substrate in this method. The reaction was performed in pH 6,0 MES buffer at 37 ° C rendering a colored reaction product. The product was then analyzed via spectrophotometry at 405 nm.</description>

Next the tube was centrifuged (1000 x g for 10 min.) to obtain a ready to test saliva supernatant. Samples were frozen after centrifugation at - 85°C until performing laboratory tests. Determination of secretory immunoglobulin class A (sIgA) concentration was established using an ELISA (Immunodiagnostic AG, Germany). The analytical procedure was carried out in accordance to the instructions provided by the manufacturer in the user manual. Absorbance readings were taken using a μQuant reader (BioTek, USA), the results were processed using the KCJunior program (BioTek, USA).</description>

The commercial ELISA (Diapra, Italy) were used to determine the concentration of cortisol in saliva. The analytical procedure was carried out with accordance to the manufacturer's instructions in the technical manual supplied with the kit.

    <description>Saliva was collected using a disposable Salivette tube (Sarstedt AG &amp; Co, Germany) by placing a sterile tampon under the tongue or chewing for 30-45 seconds. Next the tube was centrifuged (1000 x g for 10 min.) to obtain a ready to test saliva supernatant. Samples were frozen after centrifugation at - 85°C until performing laboratory tests. To determine the total protein concentration the Lowry method was used. This method base on the reactions between peptide bonds, tyrosine and Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The absorbance of the resulting color was read at a wavelength of 650-750 nm, 30 minutes after the addition of the reagent. Bovine serum albumin water solution (BSA - Sigma Aldrich, Germany) at slightly basic pH was used as standard.</description>

    <description>At the beginning of scheduled classes in the simulation center, students were placed sitting at rest for 30 min. In each team a leader was chosen. Other team members were also assigned detailed functions. Before starting the scenario, participants were oriented for 10 -15 minutes by a physician instructor about the simulation room setup and manikin features. The simulated scenarios were performed using a high fidelity computer-based manikin simulator, with the possibility of remote control of vital signs. All medications and equipment required during the clinical scenarios were available. The scenario used was prepared and validated by experienced simulation instructors. All student groups were given the same standardized scenario.</description>
