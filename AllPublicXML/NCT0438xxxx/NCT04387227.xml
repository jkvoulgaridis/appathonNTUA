  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well pembrolizumab and carboplatin work in treating
      patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back
      (recurrent). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with carboplatin may work better
      in treating patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -2 of cycle 1 only.
      Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3
      months for year 1, and every 6 months for year 2.
