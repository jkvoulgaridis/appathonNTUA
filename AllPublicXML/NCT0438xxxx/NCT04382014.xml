  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Curcumin is a molecule soluble in fat. It has multiple health benefits. Indeed, it has
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Curcumin could play a role in preventing
      diseases such as cancer, inflammatory, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Omega-3
      fatty acids are also important for good health, as they have positive effects on the
      cardiovascular and neurological systems. However, curcumin is poorly absorbed by the body
      when provided in supplements. In order to improve curcumin's absorption, a natural health
      product that combines curcumin and omega-3 fatty acids has been developped. The goal of this
      project is therefore to determine the absorption of curcumin when administered in combination
      with omega-3 fatty acids esterified in monoacylglycerol (MAG). This combination will be
      compared with a curcumin extract alone or in rice oil. A pharmacokinetic study will be
      carried out for each of the formulations. Pharmacokinetics (PK) is defined as monitoring the
      blood concentrations of curcumin over a 24-hour period after taking one of the three
      different supplements.

      15 men and 15 women in good health conditions will be recruited for this project. The study
      has a randomized double-blinded crossover design with three treatments that include an equal
      dosage of curcumin as follows :

        -  400 mg of curcumin extract,

        -  400 mg of curcumin in rice oil,

        -  400 mg of curcumin extract + 1.5 g omega-3 in MAG form.

      For each of the above listed products, a natural product number (NPN) was requested to Health
      Canada and these number are currently pending.

      Each participant will consume each of the three treatments in a random order with a minimum
      of 7 days washout phase between both treatments. Blood samples will be collected at time 0,
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 24h (10 blood samples per participant per treatment) after
      taking the single dose intake. A questionnaire will allow documenting side effects throughout
      the study period. The analyses will be performed by ultra-high-performance liquid
      chromatography couples to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC/MS/MS). Samples will be
      analyzed in a blinded manner such that the student and research assistant will be blinded
      from the type of treatment and the time point they are analyzing. After performing all the
      analyses, sample identification will be decoded and pharmacokinetic data of the curcuminoids
      in each of the treatments will be plotted on a plasma concentration vs time curve. The
      parameters below will be calculated:

        -  Area under the curve (AUC) 0-24h (bioavailability);

        -  Area under the curve (AUC) 0-6h (absorption);

        -  Maximum concentration (Cmax);

        -  Time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax);

        -  Half-life (if available).

    <masking_description>Neither the participant nor the research nurse will know the administration order of the different treatments administered. All plasma samples collected during the research project will be anonymized. Also, it will not be possible to identify the participant by his name since a number will be assigned to him. The code key linking the participant's name to his number will be stored, with access restricted to those designated by the principal investigator. The data file is also protected by a password.</masking_description>
