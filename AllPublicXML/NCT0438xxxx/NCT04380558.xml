  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is a frequent chronic condition in general population. It is even more
      frequent in people with chronic respiratory disease due to several factors, including but not
      limited to frequent cough. Urinary incontinence may be more frequent during exercise so that
      it may contribute to the general deconditioning associated with chronic respiratory disease.

      Although pulmonary rehabilitation is a cornerstone in the management of people with chronic
      respiratory disease to break this spiral of worsening dyspnea, little is known about the
      prevalence of urinary incontinence among those people referred for pulmonary rehabilitation
      nor about its impact on the effects of the program.

      Experimental design:

      People referred for pulmonary rehabilitation in two centres will be offer to participate in
      the study. Those people who will agree to participate and give their formal consent will be
      asked to answer two questionnaires about urinary incontinence symptoms (see outcomes) to
      assess the prevalence and the type of these symptoms.

      They will subsequently participate in their usual pulmonary rehabilitation program consisting
      in 90min sessions (including endurance training, muscle strengthening and self-management),
      3x/week for 8weeks (centre 1) or 2x60min sessions (including the same components), 3x/week
      for 8weeks (centre 2).

      The effects of the pulmonary rehabilitation program on usual clinical outcomes (according to
      each centre routine practice; tests may differ between centres) will be compared between
      those people with or without urinary incontinence symptoms.
