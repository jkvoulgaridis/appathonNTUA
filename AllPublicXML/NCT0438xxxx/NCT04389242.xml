      Brief summary:

      The objective of this study is to develop an internet-based cognitive behavioral intervention
      program (including an online platform and a smartphone application) for Chinese university
      students in Hong Kong, and examine its effectiveness in reducing psychological distress,
      anxiety/depression symptoms, and improving emotions and automatic thoughts. The 3-month
      maintenance effect will also be tested.

      Previous research has provided evidence for the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive
      behavioral intervention in improving mental health, but most studies were done in Western
      countries. This study is intended to design a culturally appropriate online program
      especially for Chinese university students in Hong Kong. The program will include 8 weekly
      sessions and one face-to-face session and one telephone follow-up with a with certified CBT
      therapist. The effects on psychological distress, anxiety/depression, emotions, and automatic
      thoughts will be tested.
