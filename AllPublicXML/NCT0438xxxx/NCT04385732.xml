  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised controlled trial will investigate the role of melanoma surveillance
      photography (MSP) in the surveillance of patients at high or ultra-high risk of melanoma. MSP
      is a comprehensive method of melanoma monitoring which includes total body photography and
      digital dermoscopy which is performed at prescribed intervals. The study will test whether
      participants under surveillance with MSP have less unnecessary biopsies (false positives)
      compared to those without MSP. Participants will be Australian residents with a new diagnosis
      of primary melanoma, who have multiple naevi and are at high or ultra-high risk of developing
      melanoma. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to either groups.

      It is hypothesised that those randomised to surveillance with MSP will have better patient
      outcomes. Improved diagnostic accuracy as measured by the number of unnecessary biopsies will
      be the primary outcome measure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to test whether melanoma surveillance with MSP, comprising either 2D or 3D
      TBP tagged with digital dermoscopy, compared to clinical surveillance without MSP, results in
      improved diagnostic accuracy, specifically reduced number of unnecessary biopsies (i.e. false
      positives due to an excision or biopsy of a lesion being performed to diagnose melanoma and
      that lesion being identified on pathology as benign), in high (and very high) risk
      individuals whose risk is contributed to by high naevus counts.

      The secondary aims are to:

        1. Test whether MSP:

             1. Results in improved sensitivity of doctors' diagnosis of melanoma (i.e. reduction
                in false negatives)

             2. Improves health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, and reduces patient
                anxiety

             3. Reduces costs to patients and health care system

             4. Is cost effective compared with a strategy of no MSP

        2. Estimate the financial implications to Medicare of introducing MSP

        3. Evaluate diagnostic accuracy of tele-dermatology compared to en-face clinical visits.

        4. Evaluate the safety and acceptability of melanoma surveillance photography

      Investigators hypothesise that for ultra-high and high risk patients with multiple naevi,
      clinical surveillance with melanoma surveillance photography (compared to without MSP) will
      lead to better patient outcomes, in particular a reduction in the number of unnecessary
      biopsies (i.e. false positives) as a measure of diagnostic accuracy. Pre-specified secondary
      outcomes will be sensitivity and specificity, thickness and stage at diagnosis of subsequent
      melanomas, quality of life, costs and cost-effectiveness.

This substudy will not affect patient care but will assess diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) in the teledermatology setting compared to the en-face clinical setting in order to validate the use of telediagnosis in routine care.</description>
