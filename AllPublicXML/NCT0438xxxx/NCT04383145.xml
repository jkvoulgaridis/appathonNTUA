    <textblock>
      The INNER-B post-market clinical follow-up study is undertaken to evaluate the prevention of
      death related to a thoracoabdominal aneurysm when treated by the E-nside TAAA Multibranch
      Stent Graft System.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and clinical performance of the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study patients will be observed, who receive an E-nside TAAA Multibranch Stent Graft
      System for the endovascular treatment of a degenerative, atherosclerotic thoracoabdominal
      aortic aneurysm. The E-nside TAAA Multibranch Stent Graft will be implanted at the discretion
      of the treating physician.

      Participating physicians will be asked to provide their observations collected during routine
      care for patients he/she had decided to treat with the E-nside TAAA Multibranch Stent Graft
      System. Informed consent of the patients to allow the use of their clinical records for the
      purpose of this observational study will be obtained before data are being collected.

      The period of data collection will be approximately 60 months from the index procedure for
      each patient. Source document verification will be performed on 100% of patients; data from
      all visits will be reviewed and verified against existing source documents. Complete DICOM
      image files of the CT scans will be sent to the CoreLab for independent evaluation.
