  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase I trial for subjects with advanced head &amp; neck cancer, breast cancer, soft
      tissue sarcoma or melanoma all subjects will receive open label X-PACT treatment as a
      intra-tumoral injection. The primary objective will be to establish the safety of X-PACT when
      dosed with 5 intra-tumoral injections of the combination product (the phosphor device and
      methoxsalen sterile solution and subsequently exposing the tumor to X-ray energy) over a
      period of 6 weeks (on day D1, D3 and D5 of Week 1, on D1 of Week 2, and a booster on D1 of
      Week 6). After the week 8 tumor assessment subjects demonstrating stable disease, partial
      response or unconfirmed progression assessed by iRecist, will be eligible to receive two
      additional booster treatments 4-6 weeks apart. Treatment will be considered safe provided ≤ 2
      out of 12 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 6 weeks after the
      first intra-tumoral injection.

      per standard of care during the optional treatment and follow up study periods. There will be
      a two-year follow up period.

    <description>X-PACT is comprised of a phosphor device, the drug methoxsalen sterile solution and X-ray energy. The dose of methoxsalen sterile solution per injection will vary per patient and will remained fixed across injections within each patient as it is based on the applicable tumor volume at baseline. Immediately after each injection of the combination product, patients will be exposed to an X-ray beam delivered via a LINAC (and thus targeted at the tumor) at a fixed dose to activate the combination product.</description>

                  persistent following curative-intent radiation and is not amenable to curative
                  surgery due to unresectability, morbidity or because patient declines surgery.

               2. Advanced unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative
                  treatment with surgery or radiation.
