        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female (of non-child bearing potential) participants must be 18 to 55 years
             of age, inclusive, and with BMI of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg
             (110 lb).

          -  Male and female of non-child bearing potential participants who are overtly healthy as
             determined by medical evaluation.

          -  Participants must be willing to avoid direct sunlight exposure or any high intensity
             ultraviolet light exposure, from admission to FU1 and to apply sun screen/lotion with
             a high sun protection factor, as appropriate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological,
             immunological/rheumatological, or allergic diseases.

          -  Evidence of active or latent or inadequately treated infection with Mycobacterium
             tuberculosis (TB), history of HIV infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

          -  Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant
             inappropriate for the study.

          -  Have a history of systemic infection requiring hospitalization, parenteral
             antimicrobial therapy, or as otherwise judged clinically significant by the
             investigator within 6 months prior to Day 1.

          -  History of phototoxicity and photosensitivity.
