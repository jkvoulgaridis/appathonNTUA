      Objective: To demonstrate the presence of bioresistant intracorporeal carbon-based
      nanocomposites in subjects exposed to a fulguration, in the immediate aftermath of this
      fulguration and 24 months (+/- 6 months) after the accident, on blood and urine samples, then
      in comparison with blood and urine samples from 14 healthy subjects.

      Hypothesis: Lightning discharge in the human body reveals the presence of multi-functional
      nanoparticles which are reassembled under the impact of the electric discharge into
      nanostructured films, filaments and aggregates; they consist of dispersed graphene-like
      nanoparticles embedded in an aliphatic cross-reticulated matrix. The high electrical
      conductivity of the nanoinclusions, their refractory properties and the cross-reticulation of
      the nanoassemblages explain their biorésistance.

      The graphene-like multi-functional nanoparticles are assumed to trace a population of
      aerosols formed in the atmosphere by plasma discharge which is present in air, water and all
      natural resources. Their ability to undergo changes from folded nanosheets to confined
      ultra-fine nanoparticles allow them to be inhaled or absorbed by the human body, or to be
      ingested with food.

      In order to detect nanocomposites in patients who have been impacted by lightning, an
      analysis protocol will be performed on the remains of blood and urine samples from their
      initial medical admission. After filtering the blood and urine samples, the remaining
      nanocomposites are selected for characterization, at micro to nanoscale, using the scanning
      electron microscope and the transmission electron microscope.

      Based on laboratory experiments, a second sampling of blood and urine will be performed 24
      months (+/-6 months) after the lightning strike to follow the delayed production of
      nanocomposites from the remaining activated nanoparticles.

        -  Presence of bioresistant nanocomposites in blood and urine at D0 and M24 (+/- 6 months)
           :

        -  If the victim was treated between H0 and H2 after the fulguration : an initial blood
           sample was taken by the SMUR or the emergency room and stored

        -  If the victim was treated between H0 and H6: urine sample was taken from the first urine
           after fulguration.

        -  At M24 (+/- 6 months) after the fulguration: collection of 18 ml of blood and two
           bottles of urine.

      In order to describe the neurological disorders of the patients, initial clinical, biological
      and radiological data will be collected in the patients' medical records and a new clinical
      examination will be performed at 24 months (+/- 6 months) after fulguration.

           - Looking through the medical file for the clinical examination of J0 and those of
           follow-ups

             -  Looking through the biological assessment carried out immediately after the event
                between H0 and H12 in the lighting-stroke patient to highlight which organs were
                affected (bloodlines, kidney, liver, muscle, heart).

             -  Basic biology screening to look for the following information:

             -  NFS / Platelet / VS / Coagulation check-up

             -  Blood ionogram (Na+ Cl- K+ Total Ca ionized Ca Mg++ HCO3- HPO4--)

             -  Blood creatinine / urea / CPK / LDH

             -  Troponin in cycle

             -  Liver check-up

             -  CRP

           Description of measures taken to reduce and avoid bias

           Measurement bias:

             -  Preliminary experiments carried out by the CNRS team with a lightning reactor on
                self-samples of urine in order to obtain comparative images, adapt the
                manipulations and anticipate the preparation of the lighting-stroke patient samples
                to select the most representative nanocomposites for high resolution microscopic
                characterization.

             -  During the analysis of the samples, the only two experimenters will be the
                investigator coordinating the study, Dr FOUSSAT, and Dr COURTY. There will be a
                double reading of each sample with consultation on the description.

             -  Photos will be taken with the same camera.

           Selection bias:

           - None, because all 14 patients were fulgurated.

           Memory bias:

           - Cross-check the patients' testimonies with the analyses and complementary examinations
           carried out, requested by the attending physician or another health professional.

           Sampling bias:

           - Matching the 14 healthy subjects to the age and sex of the 14 fulgurated subjects.

           In order to better understand the mechanisms of in vivo formation of these
           nanocomposites, an attempt will be made to identify them in healthy subjects.

           -Qualitative and quantitative aspects of bioremediation nanocomposites possibly
           identified in the blood of subjects not affected by lightning-strike.

           Analysis of the blood of 14 healthy patients for:

             -  controlling stochastic forming mechanisms of polymer nanocomposite;

             -  controlling effects of environmental factors (air and water quality) on the
                abundance and properties of airmade polymer nanocomposites

             -  proof-of-concept justification

             -  full analytical procedure.

           Low levels of bioresistant nanocomposites are expected in this group. The aim is to
           trace the occurrence of nanocomposites formed by plasma discharges in the atmosphere
           which have passed through the alveolar and digestive barrier into the bloodstream.

           The blood of healthy subjects will be collected at the Aurillac CH laboratory by taking
           an additional 18 ml on sodium heparinate tube during a blood test for routine check-up
           (INR monitoring for example). Patients will be given an information note and a consent
           form stating that they accept this additional volume of sample. They will inform their
           work and their commune of residence.

           The samples will be anonymised and packaged for transport to the Aurillac laboratory for
           analysis under a stereomicroscope microscope in the alcoholic liquid phase. They will
           then be sent in dry form to the CNRS for analysis by scanning and transmission electron
           microscope.
