  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present pilot study will explore the range of mental and physical health benefits
      associated with a Rolfing®-based intervention program (&quot;Move in Mind&quot;). To assess the effects
      of this program on pain management and various psychological outcomes, the investigator's
      study will be offered to individuals with mild chronic musculoskeletal pain (e.g., lower back
      pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, knee pain, arthritic pain). Shortened from ten to six
      sessions and adapted to a group setting by Rolfing® instructor Monica Canducci, the
      intervention will be delivered weekly by Ms. Canducci, who is certified in Rolfing®. The
      program will target the potential associations of the Move in Mind program with better pain
      management (primary outcome) as well as increased body awareness and presence, increased
      well-being, and better stress management (secondary outcomes). Interested participants will
      be asked to complete a battery of questionnaires and psychometric scales to assess the
      variables of interest before (baseline) and after their participation in the Move in Mind
      program (six-week follow-up). A waitlist control group will also be assessed at baseline and
      follow-up and will then receive the Move in Mind sessions subsequently and also assessed
      after their participation.

    <description>The short-form McGill Pain Questionaire (SF-MPQ) is a 15-item self-report measure that assesses the quality and intensity of a patient's pain. Descriptors either represent the sensory dimension (items 1-11; e.g., &quot;Stabbing&quot;) or the affective dimension of pain experience (items 12-15; e.g., &quot;Punishing-Cruel&quot;). Patients respond to the SF-MPQ using an intensity scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe).</description>
