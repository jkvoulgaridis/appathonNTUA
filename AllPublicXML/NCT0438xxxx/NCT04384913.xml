      This prospective controlled double-blind randomized study compares kinematic and mechanical
      alignment in TKA (Total knee arthroplasty). A total of 120 patients will be included and the
      surgery will be performed using CT based 3D printed PSI(Patient Specific Instruments) Cutting
      guides.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is known, to significantly improve function and satisfaction in
      arthritic knee patients; nevertheless, a substantial percentage of these patients are not
      fully satisfied. Thus, several authors reported significantly improved outcomes after
      slightly under correcting varus knees after TKA. The concept of kinematic alignment (KA) even
      more addresses the patientÂ´s individual anatomy with three-dimensional restoration of
      individual axes, joint lines and joint envelope of laxity. The aim of this prospective
      randomized study was to demonstrate equivalence between mechanical and kinematic alignment in
      restoring knee function in terms of subjective and objective outcomes.

      In this prospective randomized controlled double-blind study 120 patients with osteoarthritic
      knees will be treated with a Medial Pivot TKA (Medacta Sphere GMK). The patients are divided
      into two groups. Group A receive the TKA using mechanical alignment principles, group B
      receive the kinematic alignment. The surgical technique was equal in both groups. CT-based 3D
      printed PSI cutting blocks were used for the saw cuts. Pre and postoperative standard x-rays
      were performed. To determine the subjective and objective outcomes the OKS(Oxford Knee
      Score), the KSS(Knee Society Sore), the FJS-12(Forgotten Joint Score) and the WOMAC Score
      were collected.

    <description>The FJS Knee was designed to assess patient outcome in patients undergoing conservative or operative treatment of the knee. This questionnaire shows its strengths in patients with a good level of knee function and a low pain level. It has been designed specifically to reduce ceiling effects commonly associated with many PRO measures in this patient group, e.g. when assessing short- to mid-term results in total knee arthroplasty patients.

    <description>The OKS questionnaire consists of 12 questions that cover function and pain of the knee. Each question is scored from 0 to 4 (0 being the worst outcome and 4 being the best). The overall score is the sum of all items and can range from 0 to 48, with higher scores corresponding to better outcomes. The OKS has a big ceiling effect and cannot differentiate between good and very good results. However, the most of the researchers world wide use the OKS as a reference.</description>

    <description>Patients in group MA (mechanical alignment) will be operated according to mechanical implantation technique. In the mechanical group, femoral and tibial cutting blocks will be designed for a 0-degree angle according to the mechanical axis. Femoral rotation will be aligned with the femoral trans-epicondylar axis. Tibial rotation will follow femoral rotation.</description>

    <description>Patients in group KA (kinematic alignment) will be operated according to kinematic implantation technique. The kinematic cutting blocks will be designed to resurface the femoral and tibial bones to restore each patientÂ´s pre-arthritic anatomy and Joint line. Based on a available CT dat the prearthritic anatomy is reconstructed by compensating bone defects and restoring the physiological cartilage height of 1,7mm. Femoral Flexion is evaluated by the anterior Cortex of the distal femur, tibia slope is defined to 3Â° due to ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) loss, but cab be adapted during surgery.</description>
