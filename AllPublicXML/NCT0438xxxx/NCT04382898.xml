      Open-label, multicenter, dose titration and expansion three-arm trial to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of W_pro1 cancer vaccine (W_pro1) in
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) W_pro1 in combination
      with goserelin acetate with or without cemiplimab, in patients with high-risk, localized
      prostate cancer (LPC)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  W_pro1 consists of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA [or RNA]) targeting 5 antigens
           expressed in de novo and metastatic prostate cancer that are separately complexed with
           liposomes to form serum-stable RNA lipoplexes (RNA-LPX).

        -  The RNA molecules are immune-pharmacologically optimized for high stability,
           translational efficiency and presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
           class I and II molecules. The vaccine is intended for intravenous (IV) bolus injection.

        -  The RNA-LPX cancer vaccine induces activation of both the adaptive immune system
           (vaccine antigen-specific CD8+/CD4+ T cell) as well as the innate immune system (TLR7
           agonism of single-stranded RNA). The physiology of efficient induction, expansion and
           differentiation of antigen-specific T cells is associated with programmed death
           receptor-1 (PD-1) upregulation on these T cells. Thus, the cancer vaccine is expected to
           have a synergistic mechanism of action with anti-PD-1.

        -  In summary, the mechanism of action of W_pro1 both in monotherapy and in combination
           with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab, together with carefully selected
           and refined clinical setting presents a unique opportunity for patients with different
           stages of prostate cancer.

                  corticosteroid therapy or steroid taper.

               3. Patients with central nervous system symptoms should undergo a computed
                  tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude new
