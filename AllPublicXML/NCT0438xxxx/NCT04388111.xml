  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research team wants to investigate if an intraosseous injection (directly into the bone
      marrow) of morphine during primary total knee replacement helps with post-operative pain
      following primary total knee replacement surgery. For this study patients will either be
      randomized into one of two groups: Group 1: Receives an intraosseous injection of morphine
      (mixed with standard antibiotics) during their primary total knee replacement or Group 2:
      Serves as the control group and only receives an intraosseous injection of antibioitics
      during their total knee replacement. The research team will have patients fill out a symptom
      journal for two weeks following their surgery to measure pain levels and pain medication
      consumed throughout the day as well as nausea and other symptoms. Additionally, the research
      team will take blood samples both intraoperatively and post-operatively (10 hours post-op) to
      measure the level of inflammatory markers as well as morphine.

    <description>Patient will fill out Visual Analog Scale pain scores three times a day for 14 days (day 1 as day of surgery) post-op in a pain journal. Levels will be compared between study groups. A higher score indicates a higher self-perceived level of pain and a lower score indicates a lower perceived level of pain for the patient.</description>
