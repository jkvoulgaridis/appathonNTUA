  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) is a very common problem in newborns, and has been
      associated with poor neurodevelopment, cognition, and school performance. At-risk newborns
      (infants of diabetic mothers [IDM], large [LGA] and small [SGA] for gestational age infants,
      and late preterm [LPT] infants) undergo a hypoglycemia screening protocol that involves
      numerous intermittent needle sticks to test glucose levels on bedside glucometers; however,
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM, currently not approved for clinical use in babies), via a
      small sensor placed in the thigh (only 1 needle stick), would likely decrease pain while
      providing continuous glucose levels. This study will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and
      precision of CGM in at-risk newborns, and determine if this method would decrease the amount
      of painful procedures and episodes of hypoglycemia missed by intermittent sampling.

      As part of regular medical care, participants will undergo intermittent blood glucose
      screening with heel sticks as per the current hospital standard of care protocol. Regular
      medical care involves checking the participant's blood glucose via heel stick every few hours
      using a bedside glucometer, with another heel stick to confirm low values in the laboratory.
      If the participant has low values, he/she may be treated with oral glucose gel, feedings of
      breast milk or formula, or intravenous (IV) fluids in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
      (NICU). This research study involves placing a CGM device in addition to undergoing the
      current blood glucose screening protocol and treatment.

      As soon as possible after birth, a continuous glucose monitoring device (Dexcom G6) will be
      placed on the participant's thigh by a research team member, and will blindly continuously
      record glucose levels that will be analyzed after discharge. Everyone who agrees to
      participate in this study will have placement of this experimental device.

      The investigational device will stay in place for the same amount of time that a participant
      is undergoing blood glucose monitoring as per the current standard of care protocol, for a
      maximum of 7 days. A participant may need to have his/her blood glucose checked after 7 days
      for regular medical care (and not for research), because his/her glucose concentrations are
      still low. Being in the research study will not affect a participant's medical care, and will
      not affect how long he/she needs blood glucose monitoring or treatment.

      A research team member will place and remove the CGM. Nurses will evaluate the site of the
      device for signs of irritation, infection, bleeding, and any other issues at least 3 times
      per day. After discharge from the hospital, data will be collected from the participant's
      medical record and participant's mother's medical record, including the participant's sex and
      birth weight, blood glucose values, details of feedings, treatments given for low glucose
      concentrations, and NICU admission data. Data that will be collected from the participant's
      mother's medical record includes age and race, prenatal data, medical history, and medication
      use. The participant's parents will be asked to fill out a short survey about their
      experience with this device when it is removed.
