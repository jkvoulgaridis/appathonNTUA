  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain which is associated with disabling seizures and affects
      100,000 people under 25. Many children with epilepsy also have a learning disability or
      problems with development. Although better outcomes occur in children who are successfully
      treated early for their epilepsy, 25% continue to have seizures despite best medical
      treatment.

      One potential treatment is a neurosurgical operation to remove parts of the brain that
      generate seizures. A proportion of these children have electrodes inserted into their brains
      as part of their clinical assessment, termed stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG), to help
      localise these regions. Subsequent surgery is not always successful - up to 40% of children
      will have ongoing seizures 5 years after surgery.

      The planning of where to place SEEG electrodes relies on experts (neurologists,
      neurophysiologists and neurosurgeons) using information from multiple sources, which are used
      to generate hypotheses about where the seizures are coming from. The main components are the
      patient's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and video-electroencephalography (EEG)
      recordings during seizures. Using this information, between 5-18 electrodes are implanted and
      the recordings continue for 5-15 days in hospital. A focus is identified in about 75% of
      cases which means that the focus is sometimes missed.

      This prospective single arm pilot study aims to assess a new automated lesion detection
      algorithm, MELD, designed to identify focal cortical dysplasias (the most common pathology
      associated with focal epilepsy in children) on otherwise 'normal' MRI scans. The
      investigators will assess whether MELD can be used to improve the targeting of abnormalities
      in children undergoing SEEG recording at Great Ormond Street Hospital

      Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain that is associated with disabling seizures. It affects
      100,000 children in the UK, 25-30% of whom will be classed as drug resistant.3 In these
      children, there is increasing evidence that resective epilepsy surgery in appropriate
      candidates can lead to seizure freedom and improve quality of life and cognitive outcomes.4-6
      However, about 30% of children do not achieve seizure freedom following epilepsy surgery and
      data suggests that these figures are not improving over time despite increasing use of
      intracranial evaluation via stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). 7

      The planning of where to place SEEG electrodes currently relies on an expert
      multidisciplinary team consisting of neurologists, neurophysiologists and neurosurgeons.
      Information from multiple sources, mainly the patient's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
      and video-electroencephalography (EEG) recording, are used to generate hypotheses about the
      location of the clinical seizure onset zone (SOZ). Using this information, between 5-18
      electrodes are implanted and the recordings continue for 5-15 days in hospital. In a
      retrospective review of 75 SEEG cases, a focus was identified in about 77% of cases which
      means that the focus is sometimes missed.

      This prospective single arm pilot study to aims assess a new automated lesion detection
      algorithm, MELD, designed to identify focal cortical dysplasias (the most common pathology
      associated with focal epilepsy in children) on otherwise 'normal' MRI scans.1 This algorithm
      was developed in-house by collaborators in this grant application. In our subsequent
      retrospective study of 34 SEEG patients, the algorithm colocalised with the SEEG-defined SOZ
      in 62% of all patients with a cortical SOZ and 86% of all patients with a histologically
      confirmed focal cortical dysplasia.2 Importantly, there were 3 patients whose SOZ was thought
      to be missed on SEEG who had MELD-identified lesions that were not implanted. In order to
      improve the algorithm, investigators have subsequently launched an international multicentre
      collaboration (https://meldproject.github.io//) to increase the number of lesion positive and
      control scans available to train the algorithm, improving its sensitivity, specificity and
      accuracy. This project has gathered over 550 lesional and 350 control scans, which will be
      used to train the algorithm. The prospective MAST Trial is therefore the ideal next step in
      the evaluating the utility of the MELD algorithm in identifying abnormal areas of the brain
      that could be responsible for seizures.

    <description>Following routine clinical planning, the MELD algorithm will be run on the enrolled patient's scans. Up to 3 extra electrodes may be used to target lesion clusters identified by the algorithm such that the investigators will record from the top 3 clusters, with the aim of improving the rate of identification of a focal seizure onset zone in patients undergoing SEEG.</description>

    <description>During the routine SEEG planning meetings, the planning of SEEG trajectories, including the number and location of electrodes, will follow the usual clinical pathway and be planned according to the expertise of the attending neurosurgeon, neurophysiologist and neurologist at the multidisciplinary team meeting. Once the trajectories have been planned, anonymised scans for each patient (linked to them via a unique study ID) will be run through the MELD classifier and the top 3 MELD identified lesion clusters will be considered for further implantation.
These top 3 MELD classifier identified clusters will then be merged with the existing clinical plan to assess if each of the clusters are already being sampled by an SEEG electrode. If there is already an electrode in each lesion, no adjustments will be made. If there are clusters that are not being recorded from, and it is technically possible, extra electrodes (up to 3) will be added to record from these additional locations.</description>
