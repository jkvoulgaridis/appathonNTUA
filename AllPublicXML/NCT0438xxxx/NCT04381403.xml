  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is amongst the most prevalent oral diseases worldwide and in North
      America. According to the 2007/09 Canadian Health Measures Survey, 16% of Canadian adults and
      24% of older adults, 60 to 79 years of age, were found to have moderate periodontal disease.
      Moreover, 11% of Canadian adults were found to have calculus scores in the highest range. On
      the other hand, recent reports on the prevalence of periodontitis in the US showed that 47.2%
      of adults aged 30 years and older have some form of periodontal disease and 70.1% of adults
      65 years and older have periodontal disease. The estimates also showed that the expenditure
      for periodontal treatments in the US is about approximately $ 14.3 billion.

      Since dental calculus plays an important etiological role in initiation and progression of
      periodontal diseases. Investigation and investment on preventive technologies to prevent the
      periodontal disease are important for any health care system and its end-users. Furthermore,
      the removal and prevention of dental calculus using an effective toothpaste could reduce the
      need for professional periodontal interventions or the time of these treatments that in turn
      reduces their cost and other burdens on patients.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of D-Tart toothpaste in removing dental
      calculus compared to Crest® (Complete Whitening plus Scope, tartar control, Procter &amp; Gamble,
      Cincinnati, OH), anti-tartar toothpaste with similar pH and texture to D- Tart toothpaste.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years and over, to ensure compliance with the study instructions

          -  Systemically healthy to exclude the possibility of calculus formation due to disease;

          -  Has at least 20 sound natural teeth including all lower anterior teeth, the main
             location of calculus build up;

          -  Having the history of previous calculus formation (at least 1.5 mm of calculus width)
             on the lingual surfaces of the mandibular anterior teeth after 3- 6 months of
             receiving a professional prophylaxis treatment, for better assessment of the
             toothpaste effectiveness;

          -  Agree to follow the study instruction: adherence to study arm, for the study timeline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy: pregnant women at high risk of developing gum inflammation that usually
             occurs during pregnancy, which could introduce bias to the study;

          -  any physical handicap, psychological or health conditions that might jeopardize the
             ability of the patient to brush his/ her teeth, these complications cause bias in the
             study;

          -  Antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs are taken within 1 month prior to the study, to
             avoid bias when assessing the gum health;

          -  Currently using Chlorhexidine oral products, since these products can affect biofilm
             and calculus formation, therefore they can introduce bias in our assessment of
             calculus removal by our toothpaste;

          -  Sensitivity to tartar-control toothpaste;

          -  Patients currently receiving dental treatment that would result in the removal of
             plaque or calculus and compromise our ability to measure calculus removed by the
             toothpaste;

          -  unable to return for evaluations/study recalls, to avoid the significant loss in the
             number of participants; 9) Having the diagnosis of Periodontal Screening and Recording
             scale (PSR) of 4, these type of patients have advanced periodontitis with a high risk
             of tooth loss (periodontal pockets of 6 mm and more) and could bias the treatment
             outcomes.
