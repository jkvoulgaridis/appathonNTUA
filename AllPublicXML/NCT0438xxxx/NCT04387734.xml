  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if people with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) can
      improve ambulatory functions after one-year treatment with Ocrevus in comparison with
      platform therapy. Sixty qualified individuals with RMS will be evenly randomized into two
      groups: Ocrevus and Platform. Each group will receive the respective treatment following the
      FDA regulations over the one-year course. Their ambulatory functions will be assessed five
      times three months apart. In addition, they will receive brain MRI scans three times six
      months apart. Their ambulatory functions and MRI measurements will be compared between groups
      over time to fulfill the purposes of this study.

             protocol assessments;

          2. Ages between 18 and 55 years old at screening. It is unknown if ocrelizumab is safe or
             effective in children. A previous Phase III clinical trial has proven the effects of
             ocrelizumab in this age group [4]. Clinical studies of ocrelizumab did not enroll
             sufficient numbers of older adults;

          3. Clinically confirmed active, relapsing forms of MS (RMS) based on the revised McDonald
             criteria;

          4. Can walk at least 25 feet independently with or without assistive device at screening
             (or the Expanded Disability Status Scale between 1 and 6.5);

          5. Can stand independently for at least 30 seconds;

          6. Not pregnant at screening and throughout the study

               -  A negative urine or serum pregnancy test must be available for premenopausal

                  they have undergone surgical sterilization;

               -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from
                  heterosexual intercourse) or use one method of contraception with a failure rate
                  of &lt; 1% per year or a barrier method supplemented with spermicide. Contraception
                  must continue for the duration of study treatment and for at least 24 weeks after
                  the last dose of study treatment;

                    -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is
                       postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (â‰¥ 12 continuous
                       months of amenorrhea with no identified cause of other than menopause), and
                       has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of the ovaries and/or
                       uterus);

                    -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year
                       include bilateral tube ligation, male sterilization, established hormonal
                       contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine
                       devices, and copper intrauterine devices;

                    -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                       duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                       patient. Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                       contraception;

                    -  Examples of barrier methods supplemented with the use of spermicide include
