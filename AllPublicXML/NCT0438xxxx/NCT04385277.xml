      This phase II trial studies how well dinutuximab, irinotecan, and temozolomide after
      intensive therapy works in treating patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Dinutuximab
      represents a kind of cancer therapy called immunotherapy. Unlike chemotherapy and radiation,
      dinutuximab targets the cancer cells without destroying nearby healthy cells. Chemotherapy
      drugs, such as irinotecan and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Giving dinutuximab together with irinotecan and temozolomide after intensive
      therapy may work better in treating patients with high-risk neuroblastoma compared to
      dinutuximab alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the feasibility of administering dinutuximab in combination with irinotecan
      and temozolomide in the frontline Post-Consolidation setting in patients with high-risk
      neuroblastoma who have undergone Induction and Consolidation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profile of dinutuximab in combination with irinotecan and
      temozolomide in the Post-Consolidation setting.

      II. To describe the event-free survival and overall survival of patients who receive
      dinutuximab in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide in the Post-Consolidation
      setting.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profiles associated with chemo-immunotherapy in the
      Post-Consolidation setting according to the type of prior therapy.

      II. To describe response to chemo-immunotherapy in the Post-Consolidation setting using the
      revised International Neuroblastoma Risk Classification (INRC) in patients with evaluable or
      measurable disease at study entry.

      III. To characterize immune and cytokine profiles in patients receiving Post-Consolidation
      chemo-immunotherapy.

      IV. To bank serial blood samples to investigate the relationship between factors related to
      the tumor, host, and immune environment and clinical outcomes in patients treated with
      chemo-immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) or via enteral tube daily and irinotecan
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes daily on days 1-5, dinutuximab IV over 10-20 hours daily
      on days 2-5, sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) or IV over 2 hours daily on days 6-12, and
      isotretinoin PO twice daily (BID) on days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5
      cycles (up to 6 cycles for isotretinoin only) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30,
      36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 months.
