      MAIN OBJECTIVE: to assess whether an exercise protocol on the lumbar musculature by adding
      manual therapy techniques on the diaphragm muscle has the same or greater effect on chronic
      non-specific lumbar pain than an isolated exercise protocol.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the effectiveness of a lumbar exercise protocol in chronic
      non-specific low back pain in isolation; To evaluate the effectiveness of both therapies in
      improving joint range in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain and, finally, to
      assess catastrophism and the avoidance of lumbar mobility when carrying out loaded movements.

      HYPOTHESIS: that a lumbar exercise protocol combined with manual therapy treatment on the
      diaphragm is equal or more effective on pain in patients with chronic nonspecific low back
      pain than treatment with the same lumbar exercise protocol in isolation.

      METHODOLOGY: A prospective randomized clinical trial with two types of intervention (lumbar
      exercise protocol and manual diaphragm therapy) will be carried out. The variables to be
      measured are pain, disability, mobility and kinesiophobia. It will be performed in two groups
      of 21 people who are of legal age, who have low back pain of more than 3 months duration and
      which is of non-specific origin.

      The patients will be randomized and divided into two groups A (control) and B (experimental).

      Group A will undergo an exercise protocol.

      Group B will undergo the same protocol plus manual therapy techniques on diaphragm muscle.
      Study participants will have treatment twice a week for 8 weeks, the first information
      session and the second measurement-evaluation session in the first week of treatment. In the
      following 3 weeks the session will last 40 minutes for both groups. In the 4th week the
      established measurements will be carried out again.

    <measure>Low-back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline disability at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators use a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to determine the intensity of the patient with lowback pain.The VAS is a 100-mm line, oriented horizontally, with one end representing &quot;no pain&quot; and ten the other end representing &quot;worst pain.&quot; Subjects will be asked to rate their current pain with a mark on the scale.</description>

    <measure>Disability with Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline disability at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a questionnaire used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain.The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel.Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible</description>

    <measure>Lumbar range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline disability at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mobility. It will be measured using an electronic inclinometer.The TiltMeter© -advanced level and inclinometer app is an inclinometer app of iPhone®. The investigation has demonstrated that the app possesses good to excellent reliability (ICC ≥ 0.77) and concurrent validity with a gravity-based inclinometer (r ≥ 0.86) for measuring standing isolated lumbar flexion and extension range of movement</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline disability at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesiophobia was measured by an 11-item version of the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-11). The 11 items of the scale each have 4 response options; all anchored with the answers &quot;strongly disagree&quot;, which scores 1 point, and &quot;strongly agree&quot;, which scores 4 points. The total sum score is calculated and can range between 11 and 44 points. A high score indicates strong fear of movement/(re)injury, i.e. high kinesiophobia. TSK-11 has been psychometrically evaluated and has shown good construct validity and reliability among older people (i.e. internal consistency (Cronbach alpha, 0.74-0.87) and test-retest reliability (ICC r = 0.747)</description>
