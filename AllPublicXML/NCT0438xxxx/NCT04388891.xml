  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ReHapticKnob is a robot for hand rehabilitation after stroke. We aim to investigate the
      feasibility of minimally supervised therapy with the ReHapticKnob with stroke patients in a
      rehabilitation clinic, evaluate the usability of the ReHapticKnob (user interface and
      implemented exercises which were adapted for independent usage), and quantify the dose of
      additional robotic therapy that patients perform in a minimally supervised setting.

      Minimally supervised therapy means that after a training phase, where the therapists teach to
      the patients how to perform the exercises with the robot, the patients can autonomously train
      with the robot during free time without being directly supervised. Our hypothesis is that
      minimally supervised therapy might be a possible way to increase therapy dose for stroke
      patients, with the potential to further improve recovery of hand function with minimal
      additional burden for therapists and for the healthcare system.

    <description>The therapy with the ReHapticKnob is performed in the clinic in addition to the conventional therapy. During the supervised and semi-supervised phases (first 2 weeks), the intervention dose is 5 sessions of approximately 45 minutes per week. During each session, the robot proposes a set of 3 exercises, each lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. During the minimally supervised phase (third and fourth week), the duration of the ReHapticKnob therapy is not specified, since the patient can decide by him/herself when to use the device, e.g. during freetime or during the weekend.</description>
