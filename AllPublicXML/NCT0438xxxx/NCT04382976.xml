  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the incidence and the risk factors of nephrocalcinosis in very
      preterm infants using patient data collected during hospitalisation at the Neonatology
      Centre.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nephrocalcinosis in preterm infants develops as a result of imbalance between the factors
      promoting or inhibiting formation of kidney stones. It is caused by intensive treatment as
      well as functional and morphological kidney immaturity. There is a correlation between the
      prevalence of nephrocalcinosis and low gestational age.

      The study aims prospectively to assess the incidence and the risk factors of nephrocalcinosis
      in very preterm infants less than 32 weeks of gestation.
