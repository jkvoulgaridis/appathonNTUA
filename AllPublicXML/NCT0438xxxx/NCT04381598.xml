  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increase in the incidence of diabetes and obesity, among other artificial sweeteners
      the need of natural non-caloric sweetener with acceptable taste and without any adverse
      effects is demanding.So,the use of stevia presents beneficial effects to general and oral
      health and its properties could result potentially effective in the treatment of periodontal
      diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stevia is considered as a novel molecule, because it is 100% natural and non caloric
      sweetener, with more sweetness than sucrose, without any adverse effects. It also
      demonstrates multiple benefits like anti-plaque effect, anti-diabetic effect,
      anti-periodontophatics properties, anti-hypertensive properties, anti-cariogenic properties
      etc. There are many studies conducted on stevia in humans, which justifies my study.

    <description>Stevia has an anti-plaque effect because of its ability in decreasing the formation of bacterial insoluble polymers.It significantly decreases the production of TNF-R and IL-1a and slightly decreases the production of NO in stimulated cells with LPS and THP-1 showing its anti-inflammatory properties.These characteristics in combination with anti-diabetic properties could results in the effective treatment of periodontal diseases.</description>
