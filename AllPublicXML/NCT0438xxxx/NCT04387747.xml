    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia in stroke patients; to
      determine the relationship between sarcopenia and duration of stroke, age, gender, etiology
      of stroke, ambulation status, spasticity, nutrition and malnutrition

    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia was defined as a loss of skeletal muscle mass and decreased muscle strength. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia following stroke, to
      investigate the relationship between sarcopenia and duration of stroke, age, sex, etiology of
      stroke, ambulation status, spasticity, nutrition and malnutrition. Demographic
      characteristics, duration of stroke, sarcopenia presence (walking speed ≥ 0.8 m / s, SARC-F
      score ≥4, short physical performance battery score ≤ 8, thigh circumference &lt;33cm (The data
      for Turkey) &lt;31cm (European data)) were recorded. Hand grip strength (jamar) measured from
      the intact hand and TANITA BIA analysis were planned for all patients.

      Ambulation level with Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), nutritional status with
      24-hour dietary recall (24HR) method, diagnosis of malnutrition with Glim Criteria,
      spasticity with Modified Ashworth Scale, motor development for stroke patient Brunnstrom
      staging, screening for frailty with Frail questionnaire activity of daily living were
      evaluated with Barthel Index.

    <measure>Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 interview day</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. FAC stage 0 indicates the non-functional ambulation, and stage 5 indicates the independent walking at each speed and on ground.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>24-hour dietary recall (24HR) method</measure>
    <time_frame>1 interview day</time_frame>
    <description>24-hour dietary recall method consists of precisely recalling, describing and quantifying the intake of foods and beverages consumed during the day before the interview, from the first intake in the morning until the last foods or beverages consumed at night.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Glim Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>1 interview day</time_frame>
    <description>The five criteria for malnutrition include non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass as phenotypic criteria, and reduced food intake/assimilation and inflammation/disease burden as etiologic criteria. It is proposed that the diagnosis of malnutrition be based upon the presence of at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>1 interview day</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L is used to evaluate the quality of life. This scale scores five health conditions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) through evaluation in 3 levels (no problems, some problems, extreme problems).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 interview day</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index measures the activity limitations in patients with neuromuscular disease. The Barthel Index are assessed, including toileting, bathing, eating, dressing, continence, transfers, and ambulation. A client scoring 0 points would be dependent in all assessed activities of daily living, whereas a score of 100 would reflect independence in these activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brunnstrom's staging</measure>
    <time_frame>1 interview day</time_frame>
    <description>Brunnstrom's staging is used to evaluate the sequence of motor development and reorganization of the brain after stroke in six stages. Stage 1: Flaccidity; Stage 2: Spasticity Appears; Stage 3: Increased Spasticity; Stage 4: Decreased Spasticity; Stage 5: Spasticity Continues to Decrease; Stage 6: Spasticity Disappears and Coordination Reappears.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 interview day</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity. Scoring: 0: No increase in muscle tone; 1: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension; 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM; 2: More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved; 3: Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult; 4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension.</description>
