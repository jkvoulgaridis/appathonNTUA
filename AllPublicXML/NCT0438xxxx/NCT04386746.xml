  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-arm, two-stage, open-label, phase 2 study investigating the safety and efficacy of
      intravesical gemcitabine/docetaxel for bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-naïve patients with
      non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). All participants will receive an induction course
      of gemcitabine/docetaxel instillations followed by maintenance instillations if initial
      efficacy is seen. In addition to providing initial efficacy data, this study will provide
      safety and long-term efficacy data on the combination regimen studied. A tolerable safety
      profile and demonstrated efficacy would support a potential, randomized phase 3 trial
      comparing the experimental combination therapy and standard of care intravesical BCG therapy.

               4. Note #1: Low-risk tumors as defined above are not eligible

               5. Note #2: Mixed histologies are permitted, provided a component of urothelial
                  carcinoma is present

               6. Note #3: All patients with high-grade T1 (HGT1) should undergo a restaging TURBT

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (WHO) performance status 0, 1, or 2

          3. Age ≥ 18 years old at time of consent

          4. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test or
             female pre-menopausal patients is required. Women will be considered post-menopausal
             if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The
             following age-specific requirements apply:

               1. Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               2. Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

          5. Subjects who give a written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with muscle-invasive (i.e. T2, T3, T4), locally advanced unresectable, or
             metastatic urothelial carcinoma as assessed on baseline radiographic imaging obtained
             within 90 days prior to study registration. The required radiographic imaging
             includes:

               1. Abdomen/Pelvis - CT scan

               2. Chest - chest x-ray or CT scan

          2. Subjects with concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis) urothelial
             carcinoma of any stage.

             a. Note: Subjects with history of non-invasive (Ta, Tis) upper tract urothelial
             carcinoma that has been definitively treated with at least one post-treatment disease
             assessment (i.e. cytology, biopsy, imaging) that demonstrates no evidence of residual
             disease are eligible.

          3. Subjects with another active second malignancy with an estimated overall survival from
             the second malignancy of &lt; 12 months. Subjects with another second active malignancy
             that are deemed to have an estimated overall survival of &gt;12 months are eligible.

          4. Subjects who have received the last administration of an anti-cancer therapy including
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting
             study drug, or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy.

          5. Subjects who have had radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have
             not recovered from radiotherapy toxicities.

          6. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.

          7. Subjects unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

          8. Patients with prior systemic gemcitabine or docetaxel use for a non-bladder malignancy
             may enroll and receive treatment.
