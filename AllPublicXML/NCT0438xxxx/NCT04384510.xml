  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this project is to study diagnosis and management approaches of PAS and to assess
      safety and efficacy of different conservative approaches compared to planned hysterectomy. We
      aim at improving selection process and patient counselling for women who would like to
      consider alternatives to hysterectomy. To achieve these objectives, creation of an
      international database collected by PAS-experienced centers that represent all continents
      would promote conduction of large studies that provide higher level of evidence on different
      options of management of PAS

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is a complex placentation disorder associated with high
      maternal morbidity; complications of PAS include hemorrhage, blood transfusion, multiple
      organ failure, and death

        -  The incidence of PAS has been increasing steadily in response to the increase in
           cesarean delivery rate

        -  Available evidence supports planned preterm cesarean hysterectomy with the placenta left
           in situ as the standard treatment of PAS

      However, hysterectomy is traumatic to many women due to its operative sequences, impact on
      fertility, and disruption of self-image. Therefore, several conservative management options
      were proposed as an alternative to hysterectomy

        -  Although many of conservative approaches yielded satisfactory results, their
           implementation as a part of standard protocols has been limited

        -  There is primarily because evidence supporting most of these approaches is limited to
           case series, which is insufficient to support their safety. As a sequence, clinical
           trials are challenged by the lack of the margin of safety that would support ethical
           rationale of future studies. Availability of large multicenter studies is anticipated to
           provide robust evidence regarding optimal management of PAS and appropriate patient
           selection for conservative management
