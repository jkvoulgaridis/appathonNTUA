    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single-center study of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) in urothelial
      carcinoma patients who failed at least one line of platinum based chemotherapy and one line
      of immunotherapy of targeted therapy.

      Patients will undergo a baseline evaluation including imaging, blood and urine samples, EVG
      and physical examination to confirm suitability for the study.

      Eligible patients will undergo surgery to collect a tumor sample for TIL culturing.

      Patients will receive an autologus TIL infusion once the cells have been properly cultured.

      Following the infusion, patients will receive a high dose of IL-2.

      Following the intervention, patients will be monitored to evaluate study endpoints.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed Urothelial Carcinoma

          2. Progressed on first line platinum-based chemotherapy and on second line immunotherapy
             or targeted therapy (FGFR inhibitor)

          3. Measurable metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma with at least one lesion that is resectable
             for TIL generation.

          4. Patients with one or more brain metastases less than 1 cm each, and any patients with
             1 or 2 brain metastases greater than 1 cm must have been treated and stable for 4
             weeks.

          5. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          6. Willing to practice birth control from the start of chemotherapy until 120 days after
             release from the hospital.

          7. Life expectancy of greater than three months

          8. Willing to sign a durable power of attorney

          9. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document

         10. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1

         11. Hematology:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm3 without support of filgrastim

               -  Normal WBC ( &gt; 3000/mm3).

               -  Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dL

               -  Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3

         12. Serology:

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune competence and thus can be less responsive
                  to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seronegative for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. (patients who recovered from
                  previous infection and have no detected HBSAg or HCV RNA are allowed).

         13. Chemistry:

               -  Serum ALT/AST less than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dL

               -  Total bilirubin no more than x1.5 times the ULN, except in patients with
                  Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3 mg/dL.

         14. Negative pregnancy test in women of child bearing potential because of the potentially
             dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus.

         15. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients' toxicities must have
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).
             Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures with the past 3 weeks, as long
             as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Upper tract Urothelial Carcinoma

          2. History of nephrectomy

          3. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction
             regimen on the fetus or infant.

          4. Systemic steroid therapy required (patients that require replacement therapy for
             adrenal insufficiency may be enrolled if steroid treatment dose do not exceed 10 mg of
             prednisone or equivalent).

          5. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a
             positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac
             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.

          6. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease
             and AIDS).

          7. Opportunistic infections (the experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may
             be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its
             toxicities.)

          8. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study, including history of an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin or gentamicin
