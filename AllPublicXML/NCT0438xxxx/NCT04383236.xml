  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of host-modulating bacteria for therapeutic purposes is one of the strongest
      emerging fields. Probiotics are live microorganisms, which, when administered in an adequate
      amount, confer a health benefit on the host The study aimed to explore the effectiveness of
      probiotics in the treatment of the common ulcerative condition; minor recurrent aphthous
      stomatitis (RAS). We included sixty adult (group A) and 60 children patients (group B) with
      diagnosis of minor RAS . Both groups were divided into two subgroups, AI and BI (test
      subgroups ) and AII and BII (control subgroups). For test subgroups, probiotic lozenges were
      consecutively administered twice daily, for five days. The size and pain level of ulcers were
      recorded on treatment days 0, 3 and 5. The outbreak frequency of RAS within 6 months was
      investigated for all subgroups.

      The study aimed to explore the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of minor
      recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). We performed a randomized, controlled clinical study.
      Sixty adult (group A) and 60 children patients (group B) with diagnosis of minor RAS were
      included. Both groups were divided into two subgroups, AI and BI (test subgroups) and AII and
      BII (control subgroups). For test subgroups, probiotic lozenges were consecutively
      administered twice daily, for five days. The size and pain level of ulcers were recorded on
      treatment days 0, 3 and 5. The outbreak frequency of RAS within 6 months was investigated for
      all subgroups. Compared to baseline, an improvement was evident for all subgroups. However,
      for effectiveness in pain reduction, a statistically significant difference in favor of AI
      was observed for all evaluation periods when compared to control subgroup. Regarding
      effectiveness in ulcer size reduction, a statistically significant difference in favor of BI
      was observed at day 5 when compared to control subgroup. No significant difference was
      observed in the effectiveness index between subgroups AI and BI (test subgroups) except in
      effectiveness in pain reduction at day 3. The outbreak frequency decreased significantly in
      subgroup BI. We concluded that topical application of probiotics decreased pain intensity and
      accelerate RAS healing. The effectiveness in pain reduction is more evident in adult patients
      while acceleration of healing is more evident in children. Probiotics could be a
      well-tolerated, topical therapeutic agent in the treatment of minor RAS

    <description>The index ulcer's size was measured on treatment days 0, 3 and 5. The investigators measured the maximum and minimum diameters when the ulcer has an oval shape, using a calibrated dental probe with millimeter markings. The two measurements were then be multiplied to represent the cross-sectional areas of the ulcer.</description>
