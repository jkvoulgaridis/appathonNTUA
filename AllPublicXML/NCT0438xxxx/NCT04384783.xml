  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growth hormone (GH) has been used in the field of assisted reproduction technology for over
      30 years. Studies for GH have been exploring in the applicable population, drug dosage,
      starting time and time limitation. In previous clinical applications, it worked as an
      adjuvant drug for improving ovarian reactivity. With the development of basic research and
      clinical applications, the improvement effect on egg quality is gradually recognized.
      However, which protocol of GH may work well and maximize the clinical effect remains mystery.
      The investigators' previous self-controlled retrospective research about 380 cases treated
      with GH found that the average daily injection of GH dose of 2IU for about 6 weeks can
      significantly improve embryo quality and clinical pregnancy outcomes of the patients with low
      ovarian response. The new POSEIDON standard clearly groups people with low prognosis and
      better classifies heterogeneous people, which may help classifying the specific subgroup that
      benefit most from GH of poor ovarian response (POR). The investigators design a prospective
      cohort study to explore whether GH low-dose long-term pretreatment can improve the outcome of
      assisted pregnancy and its possible mechanism in people with low ovarian reserve.
