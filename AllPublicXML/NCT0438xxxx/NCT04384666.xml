  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, 2-sequence, 2-treatment cross-over study in healthy adult
      subjects. Rotigotine PK profiles will be obtained from all subjects after both a single dose
      of 28 mg LY03003 and 1 week of 4 mg q24h NEUPRO® patch. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 1
      of the 2 treatment sequences.

      Sequence 1

      Period 1:

      Subjects will check into the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day 0. On Day 1, subjects will
      receive the first 4 mg NEUPRO® patch in the morning. On Days 2 to 7, subjects will receive a
      4- mg NEUPRO® patch every 24 hours (+/- 30 minutes) on one of the 7 designated patch
      application sites (see Section 12.2). On Day 1, serial PK samples will be collected within 30
      minutes prior to patch application and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 hours post patch application. On
      Days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, one PK sample will be collected pre-patch (&lt;30 minutes pre-patch)
      application only. On Day 7, the subjects will receive the NEUPRO® patch and serial PK samples
      will be collected pre-patch (&lt;30 mins pre-patch) application and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20,
      24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 36, and 48 hours post-patch application Subject will stay at CRU till Day
      14 to complete the End of Treatment ( EOT) procedures and prepare for the LY03003 treatment
      in Period 2 on the next day.

      Period 2:

      On Day 1 in the morning, subjects will receive a single-dose IM injection of 28 mg LY03003.
      Serial PK samples will be collected within 30 minutes pre-dosing and at 0.5, 1, 6, and 12
      hours post dosing on Day 1. On Days 2 to Day 8, Day 10, Day 12, Day 15, Day 17, and Day 22,
      one single post-dose PK sample will be collected at the following corresponding hours: 24,
      48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 216, 264, 336, 384, and 504 hours post dosing. Subjects will stay
      at CRU till Day 22 to have PK collected and EOT activities completed. Subjects will be
      discharged on the same day. A 7-day safety follow-up period will be followed with a call on
      Day 29.

      Sequence 2 Period 1 Subjects will check into the CRU on Day 0. In the morning of Day 1,
      subjects will receive a single-dose IM injection of 28 mg LY03003. Serial PK samples will be
      collected within 30 minutes pre-dosing and at 0.5, 1, 6 and 12 hours post dosing on Day 1. On
      Days 2 to Day 8, Day 10, Day 12, and Day 15, Day 17, and Day 22, one single postdose PK
      sample will be collected at the following corresponding hours: 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168,
      216, 264, 336, 384, and 504 hours post dosing. On Day 22, Subjects will have PK samples
      collected and EOT activities completed. Subjects will stay at the CRU until Day 29 and
      complete a 7-day washout period and to prepare for NEUPRO® patch treatment in Period 2 on the
      next day.

      Period 2 On Day 1, subjects will receive the first 4 mg NEUPRO® patch in the morning. On Days
      2 to 7, subjects will receive a 4- mg NEUPRO® patch every 24 hours (+/- 30 mins) on one of
      the 7 designated patch application sites (see Section 12.2). On Day 1, serial PK samples will
      be collected within 30 minutes prior to patch application and 2,4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours
      post patch application. On Days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, one PK sample will be collected pre-patch
      (&lt;30 minutes pre-patch) application only. On Day 7, the subjects will receive the NEUPRO®
      patch and serial PK samples will be collected pre-patch (&lt;30 minutes pre-patch) application
      and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 36, and 48 hours post-patch application.
      Subjects will stay at CRU and continue the safety follow-up period until Day14. On Day 14,
      subjects will complete EOT activities, followed by being discharged from the study on the
      same day.

             stay at the CRU during in-subject stays required by the protocol;

          7. All female subjects (childbearing potential and non-childbearing potential) must have
             a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening. In addition, female subjects must
             meet 1 of the following 3 conditions: (i) postmenopausal for at least 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause, (ii) surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion) based on
             subject report, or (iii) if of childbearing potential and heterosexually active,
             practicing or agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception. Highly

             contraception method if the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the
             female subject and the vasectomized partner has received medical confirmation of
             surgical success. Highly effective methods of contraception must be used for at least
             21 days prior to study drug dosing, throughout the study, and for another 90 days

             acceptable form of contraception (such as partner's use of a cap, diaphragm, sponge,
             spermicide, or hormonal contraception. Of note, male and female condom combination is
             NOT acceptable)during any sexual activity (e.g. vaginal, anal, oral) with women with
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) even if the subjects have undergone a successful
             vasectomy or if their partner is already pregnant or breastfeeding, from study drug
             dosing, throughout the study, and for another 90 days after the end of study.
