    <textblock>
      Neonates could be infected by non-polio enterovirus easily. Some of the neonates may develop
      fatal complications within one week. The objective of this study were as following: 1.To
      understand the composition and epidemiological characteristics of enterovirus infection in
      pregnant women in some areas of China; 2.To understand the transmission from mother to their
      neonates; 3.To understand the pathogenic spectrum composition, epidemiological
      characteristics and clinical characteristics of enterovirus infection in neonates; 4.To
      understand the genetic variation and changes of enteroviruses; 5.To establish a quality
      management system for maternal and neonatal enterovirus laboratory testing and monitoring.
