  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the administration of Toripalimab (anti-PD-1 antibody,
      JS001) combined to metronomic Vinorelbine may be an interesting therapeutic option for female
      patients with HER2- metastatic breast cancer. The approach suggested here is to deplete and
      active the immune response of these patients. The combination of Toripalimab and Vinorelbine
      would provide a higher gain in anti-tumor response in these patients than in those with
      chemotherapy alone.

      The investigators proposal is to conduct a multicentric, single arm, Phase II trial in HER2-
      patients with metastatic breast cancer, aiming to evaluate the clinical activity of the
      combination therapy Toripalimab + metronomic Vinorelbine. Patients will receive Vinorelbine
      (40 mg/day, tiw, per os) and Toripalimab (240 mg every 3 weeks, intravenously [IV]). The
      adverse events of the two drugs are well known.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both study drugs will continue to be administered as long as patient experience clinical
      benefit in the opinion of the investigator or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease
      progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic
      data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent.

             studies, and rapid progression of disease. Visceral crisis is not the mere presence of
             disease of visceral metastases, but implies important visceral compromise leading to a

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before the beginning of
             treatment with study drug. Less than 30 days since receipt of any other
             investigational product or device.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drug.
