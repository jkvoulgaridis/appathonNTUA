  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ebola and HIV are found predominately in the same regions of the world and countries in
      sub-Saharan Africa are most affected by both diseases. For Ebola, no approved therapies
      exist. However, new investigational drugs are being evaluated to understand if they are
      effective against the Ebola virus. Remdesivir is an anti-Ebola investigational drug for the
      treatment of Ebola. Little is known about how the blood levels of remdesivir relate to how
      effective it is in patients with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy. This study will explore
      how commonly utilized ART (tenofovir/lamivudine and atazanavir/ritonavir) affect the drug
      levels of remdesivir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open-label, randomized, fixed sequence, single intravenous dosing
      study to assess the effects of antiretrovirals on remdesivir pharmacokinetics.

      The selection of healthy volunteers, as opposed to patients with HIV, avoids the greatest
      possible extent confounding factors, such as enzyme or transporter activity alteration in
      inflammatory states, concomitant medications potentially impacting drug disposition and other
      factors which are commonly present in a population of patients and cannot be easily
      eliminated.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective

        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of single intravenous doses of remdesivir in adult
           healthy volunteers

        2. To evaluate the intracellular pharmacokinetics of single dose intravenous remdesivir
           with or without co-administration of oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir/lamivudine
           with patients serving as their own controls

      Secondary objectives

        1. To evaluate the difference in plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics of intravenous
           remdesivir among healthy volunteers receiving tenofovir/lamivudine versus healthy
           volunteers receiving tenofovir/lamivudine plus atazanavir/ritonavir tablets.

        2. To generate a population pharmacokinetic model to describe inter-individual variability
           in intracellular pharmacokinetics of remdesivir

      Exploratory objectives

      1. To describe polymorphic variants of relevant kinases that activate TFV and explore
      possible consequences on remdesivir PK.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the participant has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          2. Participants who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          3. Healthy men and women aged 18 to 55 years of age, and in good health as determined by
             past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and
             laboratory tests at screening.

          4. At screening, and all other visits, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure
             and pulse rate) will be assessed in the sitting position and again (when required) in
             the standing position. Sitting vital signs should be within the following ranges:

             I. axillary body temperature between 35.5-37.0 °C II. systolic blood pressure, 90-139
             mmHg III. diastolic blood pressure, 50-89 mmHg IV. Pulse rate, 50-90 bpm. If pulse
             rate is between 40 and 50 bpm, the Investigator may decide to enroll the subject if
             he/she has history of athletic practice or other regular high cardio-vascular activity
             and ECG assessment is within normal range.

             Subjects should be excluded if their standing vital signs (relative to sitting) show
             findings which, in the opinion of the Investigator, are associated with clinical
             manifestation of postural hypotension (i.e. absence of any other cause). The
             Investigator should carefully consider enrolling subjects with either a &gt; 20 mmHg
             decrease in systolic or a &gt;10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, accompanied
             by a &gt; 20 bpm increase in heart-rate (from sitting to standing).

          5. Subjects must weigh at least 40 kg to participate in the study and must have a body
             mass index (BMI) within the range 18-30 Kg/m2. BMI= Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2

          6. HIV antibody negative at screening.

          7. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective
             contraception method (eg. IUD or hormonal contraceptive implant, complete abstinence
             (if genuinely followed)) or consistent use of a barrier method such as male or female
             condoms plus oral progestin contraceptives for the duration of the study.
             Non-surgically sterilized men must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse for the
             duration of the study or use condoms for contraception for the duration of the study.

          8. Hemoglobin concentration equal or greater than 10 g/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant disease affecting cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal or neurological
             symptoms which in the clinician's medical judgment could be worsened by participating
             in this study or the presence of medical or surgical conditions which could prevent
             the subject from complying with study procedures.

          2. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels above 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) or total
             bilirubin &gt; 1.3x ULN

          3. Serum creatinine levels above 1.5x upper limit of normal

          4. Evidence of QT prolongation on electrocardiogram (ECG) QTc (Rate adjusted QT interval)
             &gt; 450ms (men) or 460ms (women)

          5. Pregnant women or female subjects who are unwilling to use a suitable contraceptive
             method for the duration of the study (IUD or contraceptive implant)

          6. Likely to be poorly adherent based on clinician's medical judgement

          7. Known to be current injection drug user
