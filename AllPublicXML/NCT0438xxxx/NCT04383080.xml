      The advantages of laser acupuncture are a non-invasive, painless, low risk of infection and
      high safety. Laser acupuncture as a treatment tool has the following advantages1.Painless, 2.
      Non-invasive treatment, the subject is highly accepted, the risk of infection and needle
      stick is low, 3. Very few side effects such as fainting, bleeding, 4. The therapeutic dose is
      easy to operate, and the instrument output frequency, power and time can be controlled.
      Through the clinical physiological function test plus the verification and analysis of the
      quantitative test values, it will be more able to define the new role of laser acupuncture
      treatment in patients with heart failure from the perspective of Chinese medicine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From the perspective of ancient books, the discussion of heart failure in the etiology and
      pathogenesis of traditional Chinese medicine was first seen in the &quot;Shu Wen&quot;. It is clearly
      pointed out that &quot;heart qi&quot; is the basic pathogenesis of heart failure. The &quot;qi&quot; and &quot;blood&quot;
      of Chinese medicine are closely related. The blood line is driven by the gas, the blood is
      bloody, and the qi deficiency is unable to push the blood to blood. If the qi deficiency, it
      would lead to blood stasis; There were studies have indicated that traditional acupuncture
      treatment can increase exercise tolerance and adjust autonomic nerve activity in patients
      with chronic heart failure, and can reduce their readmission rate and mortality rate in
      patients with acute heart failure. Studies using laser acupuncture to treat patients with
      heart failure have also found that they can increase the subject's six-minute walking
      distance.
