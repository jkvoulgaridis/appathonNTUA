  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of short-term fasting in patients with skin
      malignancy that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic) treated with
      a PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,
      nivolumab, cemiplimab, avelumab, atezolizumab, or durvalumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Undergoing short-term fasting prior to treatment with one of these PD-L1 or PD-1
      inhibitors may potentially reduce the side effects of immunotherapy or even improve the
      effectiveness of immunotherapy in patients with skin malignancy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of short term fasting in combination with PD-1
      inhibition therapy for patients with advanced malignancy.

      Ia. To estimate the percentage of patients who adhere completely to short term fasting (STF)
      in combination with PD-1 inhibition therapy for 3 cycles.

      Ib. To estimate the percentage of patients who develop unacceptable fasting-related toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure how many patients can adhere with STF for at least 2 cycles in combination with
      PD-1 inhibition.

      Ia. To estimate the percentage of patients who adhere to STF in combination with PD-1
      inhibition therapy for at least 2 cycles, or a total of at least 6 out of 9 days.

      II. To measure all grades of fasting-related toxicity. IIa. To estimate the percentage of
      patients who develop any grades of fasting-related toxicity, including acceptable
      fasting-related toxicity.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The efficacy of combining STF with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition will be assessed by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 response rate, as measured at
      the time of tumor assessment after 3 cycles of treatment.

      II. The immune-related toxicity of combining STF with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition will be recorded
      at the start of each cycle, and graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) v 4.0.

      III. Quality of life during STF combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition will be recorded using
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) version 4, questionnaire tool.

      IV. Fasting-related biomarkers to measure the impact of STF during PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition
      include measurement of serum insulin/IGF-1, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, MAPK pathway signaling,
      and markers of oxidative stress.

      V. Immune biomarkers will be analyzed using immunohistochemistry and ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      expression studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo STF for 47-48 hours prior to immunotherapy and for 24 hours after
      immunotherapy with standard of care pembrolizumab given intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes,
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes, cemiplimab IV over 30 minutes, avelumab IV over 60 minutes,
      atezolizumab IV over 60 minutes, or durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 3. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up in 3-6 weeks.

             feels may pose an unacceptable risk for enrollment should be excluded. (Candidates who
             are overweight and have intentionally lost weight via diet or exercise should be
             excluded, for instance)

          -  Subjects on medications that may not be safely stopped during the fasting portion of
             the study, or which may not be safely consumed without food

          -  Prior history of syncope with caloric restriction in the past or other medical
             comorbidity which would make fasting potentially dangerous

          -  Prior treatment with other immune modulating agents within fewer than 4 weeks, prior

             chemotherapy, other anti-cancer therapy or any other investigational agents while on
             this protocol

          -  Radiation therapy, non-cytotoxic agents or investigational agents in the 4 weeks prior
             to the first dose of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition

             Patients must have recovered from any major complications before registration

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. use
             of disease modifying agents or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or
             pituitary insufficiency, etc) is not considered a form of systemic treatment

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Positive pregnancy test, active pregnancy or nursing/breast-feeding, due to the
             potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm
             nursing infants

          -  History of solid organ or bone marrow transplantation
