        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must meet the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders, Fifth Edition) criteria for ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) diagnosis.

          -  Participants must have normal physical examination findings and clinical laboratory
             test results for their age group or abnormal results judged not clinically significant
             by the investigator.

          -  Negative serum hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) pregnancy test at screening (all
             female participants that have reached menarche).

          -  BMI greater than the 5th percentile for age and gender based on CDC (Centers for
             Disease Control and Prevention) growth charts.

          -  Participant (if reached his spermarche or her menarche), must agree to sexual
             abstinence or to use an approved birth control method for the full duration of
             participation in the study. The investigator and each participant will determine the
             appropriate method of contraception for the participant during their participation in
             the study.

          -  Participant's parent(s)/legal representative(s) must be capable of giving signed
             informed consent , which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions
             listed in the ICF and in the protocol as explained by the investigator. Written
             informed consent from the participant's parent(s)/legal representative(s) must be
             obtained prior to any study-related procedures.

          -  Assent (unless local regulations require consent) must be obtained for all
             participants participating in the study.

          -  Participant must have a parent or legal representative who is willing and able to be
             responsible for safety monitoring of the participant, provide information about the
             participant's condition, oversee administration of study intervention, and accompany
             the participant to all study visits. The caregiver can be the participant's
             parent(s)/legal representative(s). Written consent from the caregiver must be
             obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of intellectual disability (IQ &lt; 70) documented by school record,
             neuropsychological testing or medical records.

          -  Participant has a history of meeting DSM-5 diagnosis for any substance-related
             disorder (except caffeine- and tobacco-related) within the 3 months before the

          -  Participant with an acute or unstable medical condition, including (but not limited
             to) inadequately controlled diabetes, hepatic insufficiency (specifically any degree
             of jaundice), uncorrected hyper- or hypo-thyroidism, acute systemic infection, renal,
             gastrointestinal, respiratory, or cardiovascular disease.

          -  History of seizures, with the exception of febrile seizures.

          -  History of tumor of the central nervous system.

          -  Previously taken cariprazine or previously participated in an investigational study of
             cariprazine.

          -  Participant is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or
             participation in such a study within 3 months of Study Day 1.

          -  Participation in a blood or plasma donation program within 60 or 30 days,
             respectively, prior to Study Day 1.

          -  Positive UDS for substances of abuse at the Screening Visit or on Study Day -1.

          -  Known allergy or sensitivity to the study intervention or its components.
