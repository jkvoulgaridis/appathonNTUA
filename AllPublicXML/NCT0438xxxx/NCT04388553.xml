  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement is a common orthopaedic procedure that improves pain and mobility in a
      variety of pathologies like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and avascular necrosis.
      Post-operative complications, for instance, venous thromboembolism and chest infection have
      long been documented in literature. These complications can have a bearing on long term
      survival, and may be prevented by early mobilisation. Therefore, pain control plays an
      important role in enhancing post-operative recovery, which may also shorten length of stay
      and reduce overall cost.

      Multimodal analgesia is applied to these patient, with combination of opioid, oral adjuvant
      and regional anaesthesia. Each of the components has its own limitation; for opioid,
      post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and respiratory depression limits its use, and
      adjuvants like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are contraindicated in certain
      patient populations (renal impairment, ischaemic heart disease, coagulopathy). Various
      regional techniques like femoral nerve block, fascia iliaca block, lumbar plexus block,
      paravertebral block and epidural anaesthesia are proposed but may be limited by incomplete
      coverage (due to the innervation by femoral and obturator nerve for the anterior aspect of
      the joint and sciatic nerve for the posterior aspect, with contribution of lateral cutaneous
      nerve of thigh for the wound), the invasive nature of the regional technique (psoas haematoma
      for lumbar plexus block, epidural haematoma for epidural anaesthesia (EA)) or cardiovascular
      effects like hypotension from EA.

      Erector spinae block, first introduced by in 2016 as a chronic pain intervention, was also
      used in hip surgery from a case report in 2018. However, currently the evidence for lumbar
      ESP block is limited mainly to case reports, while randomised control trial is scarce. More
      concrete data are required to determine the efficacy of this novel technique.

      It is postulated that single shot lumbar ESP injected at L1 level can 1) reduced
      post-operative pain score 2) reduced post-operative 24 hour opioid (fentanyl) use. This study
      is conducted in Tuen Mun hospital (TMH) and Pok Oi hospital (POH) in Hong Kong. Patient are
      recruited for the study during pre-anaesthetic assessment, and they are counselled for risk
      of general anaesthesia and erector spinae plane block (i.e. local infection/bleeding, injury
      to neighbouring structure, local anaesthetic toxicity).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a pilot study regarding opioid use for patient after THR, the sample size for either
      treatment or control arm is calculated to be 35 patients per group to achieve adequate power
      to detect such a difference.

      Sealed opaque envelopes with allocation inside is prepared forehand and is subsequently drawn
      on the day of surgery. The attending anaesthetist receives the envelope right before
      induction, and opens the envelope after the patient is put under general anaesthesia (GA). If
      the operation is cancelled or the patient cannot use PCA post-operatively (e.g.
      post-operative mechanical ventilation) or post-operative delirium), the envelope is put back
      into the pool.

      After the patient is put under GA and turned lateral, the envelope is opened. For the
      treatment arm, lumbar ESP block is performed while for control arm no regional anaesthesia is
      performed nor saline is injected into the ESP. Before proceeding to ESP block, the back is
      cleaned with aseptic technique and draped. 40 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine (or maximum of
      2mg/kg body weight made up to same volume) is injected into the ESP.

      After the injection, the surgeon is told not to infiltrate any local anaesthetics into the
      incision site or the wound. Intra-operatively, intravenous fentanyl is given as the only
      analgesic by the attending anaesthetist. Post-operatively, the patient is given fentanyl PCA
      of standard setting anaesthetist). Oral paracetamol of 15mg/kg (maximum 1g) is given four
      times a day post-operatively, while other adjuvant like NSAID and gabapentinoid are not
      prescribed for the time being.

      The patient is assessed by an independent assessor from the acute pain service team 24 hours
      after the operation, who is blinded from the allocation result. Primary outcomes, that are
      post-operative 24 hour PCA fentanyl use and pain score in numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0
      to 10 at rest and upon mobilisation are assessed and documented in the electronic system and
      also the patient chart. Secondary outcomes like presence/absence of PONV and knee flexion
      power in MRC scale are also noted.

      The data are collected by the investigator and input to Excel 2003. 2-sided student's t test
      is used to compare the primary outcomes and also knee flexion power between treatment group
      and control group, while the rate of PONV between two groups is compared by Chi-square test.
