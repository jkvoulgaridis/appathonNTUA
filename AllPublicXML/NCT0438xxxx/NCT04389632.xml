  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will look at a drug called SGN-B6A to find out whether it is safe for people who
      have solid tumors. It will study SGN-B6A to find out what its side effects are. A side effect
      is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. It will also study whether SGN-B6A works
      to treat solid tumors.

      The study will have two parts. Part A of the study will find out how much SGN-B6A should be
      given to participants. Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SGN-B6A
      is and if it works to treat solid tumors.
