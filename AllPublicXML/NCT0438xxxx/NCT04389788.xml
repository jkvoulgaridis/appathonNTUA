  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH) is a common condition in dermatology practice.
      Periorbital hyperpigmentation is defined as bilateral, round, homogeneous pigmented
      macules.The etiology of POH is multifactorial including genetic and enviromental factors.
      Many treatment options are avaiblabe with variable efficacy and safety in different patients.
      Therefore, the investigator's study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined
      microneedling with topical Glutathione versus Carboxy Therapy in treatment of patients with
      periorbital hyperpigmentation.

    <textblock>
      Periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH) is a common skin condition which has a great negative
      effect on the patient quality of life. Many factors contribute in the pathogensis of POH
      which lead to developement of several treatment options with no treatment option has a great
      sucess in improving the POH and patient quality of life. Our current study tries to explore
      the efficacy and safety between 2 treatment methods in a split face study.

      Microneedling is a process of making small punctres into the skin through small needles by
      device which is called a Dermapen. This microneedling method is beleived to be associated
      with improving the skin quality through increased collagen. This microneedling will be
      followed by topical application of glutathione which is a commong antioxidant with whitening
      effects.

      Carboxy therapy is a new emerging treatment option in many dermatological diseases. It will
      be used in POH patients as it will be able to increase blood flow in periorbital area and
      improve the skin qulaity.

    <description>High-resolution photographs of both sides of the face were taken. Using a physician visual analog scoring system, 2 independent blinded dermatologists will rate the patient's overall aesthetic improvement as follows 1 (worse), 2 (no change), 3 (&lt;30%), 4 (30-60%), and 5 (&gt;60%)</description>

    <description>Dermoscopic evaluation was done using dermalite connection kit for Samsung galaxy. 2 independent blinded dermatologists will rate the patient's overall aesthetic improvement as follows
Vasculature improvement (No 0, Yes 1) &amp; percent of improvement.

    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire (DLQI) is 10 questions were asked to the patients and score is 0-3 for each question. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <description>The right eye of the patients received carboxy therapy for 6 sessions every 2 weeks. The used device is locally manufactured by a national company for esthetic and dermatological devices. Carbon dioxide gas was subcutaneously injected at the lateral one-third of each eye lid (5 cc gas in each puff according to standardized flowmetry) using insulin syringe. Compression of the injected area will be avoided to prevent rapid leakage of the gas.</description>
