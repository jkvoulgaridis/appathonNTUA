    <textblock>
      A 6-month randomized clinical trial to evaluate a home activity control system (Beprevent) in
      the management of the patient with DM2, through the individualized labeling of objects
      related to them. The study will include 20 patients with DM2 (10 in the intervention group
      and 10 in the control group) who live alone or with people who can´t move on their own. Data
      will be recorded to measure the degree of satisfaction of professionals and participants in
      the study, and clinical and epidemiological data at the start of the study (in its baseline
      situation) and at the end of the study (at 6 months), to assess the changes produced and
      Compare them between both study groups.

    <description>The Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ-24) is a questionnaire made up of 24 questions about basic knowledge of the disease (10 items), glycemic control (7 items) and prevention of complications (7 items). The questions are closed, with answer options &quot;yes, no and I don't know&quot;. Its maximum score is 24. The patient has better knowledge about diabetes the higher the score.</description>
