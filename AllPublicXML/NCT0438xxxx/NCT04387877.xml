    <textblock>
      Deep gluteal syndrome describes the presence of pain in the buttock caused from
      non-discogenic and extrapelvic entrapment of the sciatic nerve. Several structures can be
      involved in sciatic nerve entrapment within the gluteal space [1]. There are many anatomical
      variations between the sciatic nerve and piriformis muscle (PM) [2]. Some authors have
      associated deep gluteal pain syndrome with piriformis syndrome (PS) [3]. Chronic buttock pain
      caused by the musculoskeletal pathologies of the PM such as myofascial pain or pinching of
      the sciatic nerve by the PM during certain leg and hip maneuvers [4]. In most cases, PS is
      widely believed to be myofascial in origin [5].

      Treatment of PS starts with conservative pharmacotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs, muscle relaxants, and neuropathic pain agents and continues with physical therapy,
      which includes stretching of the PM to correct the underlying pathology [6]. If the
      conservative regimen fails, then more aggressive therapy, such as local injection of PM,
      which may reconfirm the diagnosis through therapeutic success, should be performed [7].

      Myofascial release is a specific manual therapy method claimed to be useful for treating
      skeletal muscle immobility and pain by relaxing contracted muscles, improving blood, oxygen,
      and lymphatic circulation, and stimulating the stretch reflex in muscles [8]. The Graston
      Technique (GT) is a form of manual therapy known as soft-tissue instrument-assisted
      mobilization. It is one of a number of manual therapy approaches that uses instruments with a
      specialized form of massage/scraping the skin and miyofascia gently [9]. This technique seems
      to have the therapeutic effects of inhibiting the adhesion of tissue, increasing the number
      of fibroblasts, and promoting collagen synthesis [10].

      Gait analysis has been widely used in the diagnosis of locomotors pathology and the
      assessment of treatment. But study of gait on deep gluteal syndrome remain unclear. 3-D
      motion analysis can be used to measure the kinematic and kinetic together with
      temporal-spatial parameters data of patients with deep gluteal syndrome during walking.
      Patients with deep gluteal syndrome show significant increase gait speed and cadence, and
      peak extensor moments with increased flexion, abduction and internal rotation at the hip
      during the whole gait cycle [11].

      Shear Wave elastography is an imaging technique which quantifies tissue stiffness by
      measuring the speed of shear waves in tissue. It is a new advanced dynamic ultrasound
      technique that provides information about the stiffness / consistency of the tissue by
      measuring the degree of strain in the tissue without external force [12].

      The aim of this study is to investigate the additive effect of GT to the exercise program in
      patients with deep gluteal syndrome on pain and disability.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), measures the level of disability. It consists of 10 items questioning the severity of pain, self-care, lifting and carrying, walking, sitting, standing, sleep, the degree of pain change, travel and social life. Its Turkish version is validated in 2004. Items are scored between 0 and 5, and the total score is multiplied by two. The maximum score is &quot;100&quot;. As the total score increases, the level of disability increases.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale consisting of a 10-centimeter line that evaluates the intensity of pain. Starting point of scale, 0 = no pain, end point 10 = expressed as the most severe pain encountered in life. Patients are asked to mark the severity of pain on the line. When calculating, the distance between the marked point and the starting point is measured in centimeters. Increasing the score means that the pain intensity increases.</description>

    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile</measure>

    <description>Nottingham health profile is a general quality-of-life questionnaire that measures health problems that a person perceives and how these problems affect normal and daily activities. The questionnaire consists of 38 items and evaluates 6 dimensions related to health: energy, pain, emotional reactions, sleep, social isolation and physical activity. Questions are answered as yes or no. Scoring is done in every section between 0-100. 0 indicates the best health status, 100 worst health status. The total Nottingham Health Profile score is obtained from the sum of the sub-scores. Turkish validity and reliability were shown in 2000.</description>

    <description>Thickness and shear wave elastography (SWE) of tensor fascia lata (TFL), proximal and distal part of iliotibial band (ITB) on the affected side of the body in side lying position were evaluated at rest using GE LOGIQ E9 XDclear ultrasound device equipped with lineer array transducer (9L-D, B-mode, frequency 9-5 MHz). We measured shear wave velocity (SWV) (expressed in m/s) and young modulus (in kPa). Three 5 mm diameter region of interest (ROI) was located most homogeneous part of the color map. For sufficient image quality and shear wave signals a large amount of gel was used and minimum pressure was applied on the probe. The positions of transducers were selected after browsing previous studies and testing on different subjects. The same specialist performed all the evaluation on the same subjects before and after treatment.</description>
