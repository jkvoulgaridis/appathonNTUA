    <textblock>
      A total of 201 participants, treatment-na√Øve and experienced, with chronic HCV GT4 infection
      were allocated into two groups based on the type of the regimen used. All eligible
      participants were treated orally with SOF plus daily oral weight-based RBV (24 weeks; group
      1), or SOF plus daily oral SMV (12 weeks; group 2).
