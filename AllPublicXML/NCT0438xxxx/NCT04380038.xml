      Often when people with asthma get a virus caused by the common cold (rhinovirus), they also
      experience an increase or worsening of their asthma symptoms. The purpose of this study is to
      see if the study medication dupilumab helps prevent those with mild to moderate asthma from
      having increased asthma symptoms, after being exposed to an experimental rhinovirus
      inoculation. This is a study about dupilumab which is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of moderate to severe asthma. Dupilumab is a
      medication that blocks pathways that cause asthmatic inflammation in the lungs, leading to
      symptoms and worsening lung function. During this study, subjects will be given either
      dupilumab or placebo and will subsequently be exposed to the the &quot;common&quot; cold virus
      (rhinovirus). The virus that the investigators are using has been safely used before in many
      studies like this involving thousands of volunteers, and the safe use of the virus in this
      research study has been reviewed by the FDA. The investigators will track asthma symptoms
      during the study with lung function tests, questionnaires, specimen collection, biomarkers,
      and physical exams. For data analysis the investigators will assess the samples collected to
      determine changes in the treatment groups. The investigators will also asses the symptom
      scores and deviations from baseline measures for lung function.

      Rhinovirus (RV) is responsible for up to 70-80% of asthmatic exacerbations in children and
      adolescents requiring urgent care or hospitalizations. Understanding the mechanism by which
      this otherwise relatively innocuous infection produces asthma exacerbations is essential
      towards mitigating these episodes. Two theories have been proposed to explain this
      phenomenon. One is that asthmatics have defective innate and adaptive immune responses to
      viral respiratory infections, leading to increased viral-associated pathology with an
      associated enhanced inflammatory response. An alternative - and not mutually exclusive -
      explanation is that RV indirectly exacerbates an ongoing allergic response to bystander
      allergens. Dupilumab blocks type 2 inflammatory responses and is known to prevent asthma
      exacerbations. It both attenuates the reduced innate immunity observed in asthmatics and also
      reduces the ability to engage a type 2 allergic inflammatory response to bystander allergens.
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that RV mediated worsening of asthma will be
      attenuated in the presence of dupilumab. This study examines cellular and molecular mediators
      of these interactions, which could help understand the intimate mechanism(s) underlying
      dupilumab's protective effect in asthmatics.

      A total of 60 patients with mild persistent asthma will be enrolled and randomized in this
      study (30 active treatment and 30 placebo).

      The double-blind, randomized design minimizes any sources of bias. The placebo group provides
      a reference for the interpretation of study results, so the net effect of dupilumab could be
      discerned. The dupilumab dose regimen selected for this study (300 mg q2w after an initial
      loading dose of 600 mg) is consistent with the approved dose for patients with asthma. The
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on innate antiviral and
      type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, epithelial barrier repair, and adaptive immune responses
      following rhinovirus infection in asthmatic patients. The exploratory objectives include
      evaluating the effect of dupilumab in reducing the severity of rhinovirus-induced respiratory
      symptoms, its effect on lung function (eg FEV1, FEV1/FVC) and asthma control. As well as
      evaluating the effect of dupilumab on other biomarkers and viral load. The sample size was
      selected empirically, informed by similar successful studies conducted in the past. For
      example, in a previous double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of omalizumab in the
      prevention of RV-induced asthma exacerbations, a total n of 20 (10 per group in the final
      analysis) was sufficient to achieve a secondary endpoint based on FEV1/FVC ratio). These data
      demonstrate the intrinsic power of the viral challenge model. The population included in the
      current trial has been further enriched (mild to moderate persistent asthmatics, on ICS ±
      other long-term controllers).
