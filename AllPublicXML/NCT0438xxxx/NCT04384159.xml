  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serial combination of biological and elastography tests is accurate to diagnosing advanced
      fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. In this study, the
      investigators compared the diagnostic performances of a 2-step strategy using either
      vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) or bidimensional shear wave elastography
      with Supersonic imagine (2D-SWE-SSI), and analysed the added-value of a 3-step strategy.

      The investigators retrospectively selected all consecutive adult patients with suspicion of
      NAFLD who had undergone liver biopsy from November 2011 to July 2019 in 2 French academic
      centers, Angers and Bordeaux university hospitals. A total of 577 patients were included.
      Among them, 291 had been previously included in a prospective study comparing diagnostic
      performances of several non-invasive tests in NAFLD patients. Inclusion criteria were:
      Ageâ‰¥18yo, 2D-SWE-SSI and VCTE performed within the two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Exclusion
      criteria were high alcohol consumption (i.e., &gt;21 drinks, on average, per week in men and &gt;14
      drinks, on average, per week in women), associated causes of liver disease (alcoholic, viral,
      or other causes of liver injury), other aetiologies than NAFLD on pathological examination,
      and a liver biopsy length of less than 10 mm and/or fewer than 6 portal spaces and/or more
      than 2 fragments, except for in cases of cirrhosis.
