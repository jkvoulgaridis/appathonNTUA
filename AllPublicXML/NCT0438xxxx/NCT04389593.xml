      This prospective pilot study evaluates the comparative and additive diagnostic performance of
      Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and corrected-T1 (cT1) for the detection and staging of
      fibrosis and inflammation in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), using histology as the
      reference standard.
