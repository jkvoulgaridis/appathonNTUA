  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are computer-based systems that acquire brain signals,
      analyze them, and translate them into commands that are relayed to an output device to carry
      out a desired action. BCIs represent a very active and promising field of research among
      devices for people with severe motor disabilities. As the currently available systems
      correspond to research prototypes, they are not adapted to daily live situations. On the
      other hand, some systems have recently been commercialized, principally for video games but
      they are not satisfactory for use as a substitute technology in disability.

      A BCI's prototype for alternative communication using a virtual keyboard, the P300 Speller,
      has been developed by the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology
      (Athena team - Nice University). This prototype includes an EEG-cap with gel based active
      electrodes. A recent study conducted on 20 patients with ALS (University Hospital, Nice)
      demonstrated the usability of the system and the patient satisfaction concerning the ease of
      use and utility. To achieve a system that can be used in daily live in severely disabled
      patients, technical developments are necessary.

      The investigators have conceptualized and developed an ergonomic, comfortable, headset,
      including dry electrodes to allow a prolonged use of the system.

      The purpose of the study conducted all along the development of the headset is to improve the
      developed system until a successful system is achieved. This study is a monocentric usability
      study conducted on ALS people.
