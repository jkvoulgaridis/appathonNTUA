  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-group, small-scale, open-label study (N= 25 to 50) will evaluate the impact of
      combination zonisamide and bupropion on the process of switching from combustible cigarettes
      (CC) to an e-cigarette. There will be a data collection period of at least five days to
      obtain baseline data on use of combustible cigarettes. Participants enrolled in the study
      will receive a G6 e-cigarette at V2 for ad libitum use. After the first week of e-cigarette
      use, (at V3) participants will be given zonisamide (100 mg/daily) and will begin
      extended-release bupropion dosing (150 mg each morning days 1-3, then 300 mg/daily) in
      addition to continued use of the G6. At each visit, participants will receive enough
      zonisamide, bupropion, and Halo G6 cartomizers to last until their next study visit. Halo G6
      and combination zonisamide and bupropion use will continue until the participant returns for
      the End-of-Study visit (V7).

    <description>Characterize changes in the two primary scales of the Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ), assessing smoking satisfaction and psychological reward, compared between cigarettes smoked after meals versus all others smoked during the day, examining how this difference changes after zonisamide/bupropion usage. The mCEQ uses a 7-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=Very little; 2=A little; 3=Moderately; 4=A lot, 5=Quite a lot; 6=Extremely) to measure the following subscales: Satisfaction, Psychological Reward, Enjoyment of Respiratory Tract Sensations, Craving Reduction, Aversion.</description>

After the first week of e-cigarette use, (at V3) participants will be given zonisamide and bupropion in addition to continued use of the G6. Use of these study drugs will continue for 12- weeks with a target complete switch date (from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes) one week after study drug initiation.</description>
