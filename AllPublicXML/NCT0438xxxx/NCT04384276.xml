  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-site, experimental, pilot study in infants identified from 0 - 3 months of age
      who present to the Cleft and Craniofacial Clinic with a cleft lip and/or palate will compare
      weight outcomes of infants who used the Weigh Easy system to monitor weight and historical
      infants whose weights were monitored without the Weigh Easy system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited at the earliest possible visit to the Cleft and Craniofacial
      Clinic. At this visit, families will complete the consent process. After consent is obtained,
      the study team will ensure that the family is signed up for the Patient Portal and will
      provide a demonstration of how to safely obtain a weight using the Weigh Easy scale and the
      infant's car seat. In addition to the luggage scale, a handout will also be sent home with
      the family, including instructions and safety tips for weighing their infant and instructions
      for submitting a weight via the Patient Portal.

      Families will be asked to submit a weight, obtained with the Weigh Easy scale, via the Weigh
      Easy eClipboard message on a weekly basis for 3 months.

      Three months after the family is enrolled onto the study, the family will be provided the
      Parental Satisfaction Survey to complete. This will occur at a clinic visit, in the event
      that a standard of care visit occurs within the window for the visit. If a clinic visit is
      unavailable, the surveys will be emailed to the family and three reminders will be sent if
      the survey is not completed in a timely manner.

    <intervention_model_description>A single experimental group will be enrolled prospectively to use the Weigh Easy system. Due to the potential impacts of weight gain within this patient population and the lifelong implications of early malnutrition, we do not feel we can safely randomize a prospective control group. As a result, a retrospective control group will be enrolled to enable a comparison of outcomes between those families using the Weigh Easy system and those who did not. All patients, both retrospective and prospective, will be treated according to the standard cleft lip and/or palate treatment protocols and followed by the registered nutritionists who routinely participate in the Cleft and Craniofacial Clinic</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Weigh Easy Parental Satisfaction Survey will be used to create a satisfaction score for each family participating. Answers to this survey will be built using a five-point Likert scale. Minimum score: 4, Maximum score: 20, with higher scores indicating lower parental satisfaction. The survey will be administered at a standard of care appointment three months after enrollment (± 1 month) or via email if an appointment is unavailable during this window. This variable will be measured for the prospective cohort only.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled onto this arm of the study will use the Weigh Easy system for weight tracking in the first three months of life. Weights will be measured in home using the Weigh Easy scale and transmitted to the study team via the Weigh Easy eClipboard message. A notification scheme will be activated for weights found to have plateaued or decreased to ensure that the infant's standard of care nutritionist and provider are able to follow up and recommend additional interventions to counteract the weight change.
After three months, families will complete a satisfaction survey to determine if the Weigh Easy system was preferable or if there are any improvements that could be made.
All other aspects of the patients' care will follow the standard of care for cleft and craniofacial diagnoses and will be guided by the nutritionists specializing in cleft and craniofacial care.</description>

    <description>By use of a small user-friendly luggage scale, the family can easily and safely obtain a weight within the comfort of their own home. Using the Weigh Easy eClipboard, a message will be sent to the family on a weekly basis via Cerner's Message Center that will include a link. The link will be used by parents to enter and submit the patient's current weight. Upon submission, the weight will be transmitted into the patient's EMR after it's reviewed and accepted by a member of the study team. When the weight is received in the system, an alert will be triggered that will notify the study team of its arrival. While the Weigh Easy eClipboard function does qualify as a device, as the investigators will be making clinical decisions based off of the data received through the form, the device is not being used investigationally on this study. The eClipboard function is a standard part of the Cerner framework and has been previously investigated and vetted by for safety and efficacy.</description>
