  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to compare the effectiveness of injected levobupivacaine
      and liposomal bupivacaine in the treatment of pain and disability in patients with lateral
      epicondylitis.

      Primary outcome is pain (VAS) at 1 week and at 1 month after injection. Secondary outcomes
      are the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand DASH (Quick DASH) and Oxford Elbow
      Score (OES) and a record of time off work due to lateral epicondylitis in days at 1 week and
      at 1 month.

      The study will be a cross-over trial

      This project compares bupivacaine and long acting liposomal bupivacaine in the treatment of
      pain and disability related to lateral epicondylitis.

      The investigational medicinal products will be Chirocaine, ABBVIE OY, Espoo, Finland
      (levobupivacaine) and Exparel®, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany, N.J. (liposomal
      bupivacaine).

      The design of the study will be an off-label, investigator initiated, randomized, controlled,
      double-Blind cross over treatment trial. Exparel (liposomal bupivacaine) will be the
      medicinal product in the intervention arm, whilst Chirocaine (levobupivacaine) will serve as
      the active control.

      Patients for the study will be recruited from the patients referred to the hand surgery
      outpatient clinic at Turku University Hospital, Finland.

      During the pilot phase of the study, four patients will be recruited, after which power
      analysis is done. The main study will include up to 50 patients, 25 patients in each study
      arm. Patient enrollment will start immediately after the all the relevant permits have been
      obtained (estimated September 2020).

      Normal distribution of data will be tested by Shapiro-Wilks test. The mean and Standard
      Deviation will be reported for normally distributed data. For data not distributed normally,
      the median and inter quartile ranges of the data will be reported. Independent samples t-test
      will be used for between-group comparison (normal distribution). The Mann-Whitney test will
      be used for non-normal data.

      The results will be published in a peer reviewed international academic journal.

    <intervention_model_description>The trial will be a crossover study. During the pilot phase, we will recruit up to 6 patients, after which we will do a power analysis. In the main study, up to 25 patients will be randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 will receive an injection af levobupivacaine (Chirocaine) into the lateral epicondylitis. The outcomes are assessed over the next month and then they are given the injection of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel).
Normal distribution of data will be tested by Shapiro-Wilks test. The mean and Standard Deviation will be reported for normally distributed data. For data not distributed normally, the median and inter quartile ranges of the data will be reported.
Independent samples t-test will be used for between-group comparison (normal distribution). The Mann-Whitney test will be used for non-normal data.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A nurse at the outpatient clinic will choose an envelope with the randomization information and assign the patient into their groups. The same nurse will prepare the injection, mask the syringe with a tape and give it to the doctor who will administer the injection. The same injection technique will be used for both drugs.</masking_description>
