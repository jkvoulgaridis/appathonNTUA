  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical implantable electronic devices, such as permanent pacemaker, implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy are used in current daily
      practice for patients with bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmia, or heart failure. The rapid
      progress of permanent pacemaker function is growing to replace human's degenerating
      electrophysiology of heart.

      The ability of physical work is an important cornerstone of quality of life. In daily
      activities, rate response to higher rate is importance for patients with bradycardia who can
      not accelerate their heart rate. And rate-adapting pacing of permanent pacemaker is a design
      to increase heart rate pacing according to physical activity or emotional activity. Patients
      with rate-adaptive pacing will get more cardiac output and overcome the physical activity
      such as stair climbing. But there are few studies to evaluate whether the rate-adaptive
      pacing of permanent pacemaker will improve the quality of life in people with bradycardia.
      The aim of this study is to compare turn-on with turn-off this function (DDDR vs DDD) whether
      rate-adaptive pacing will improve quality of life in patients with permanent pacemakers.

    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire consists of eight health concepts (1) physical functioning, (2) role limitations due to physical health, (3) bodily pain, (4) general health perceptions, (5) vitality (energy/fatigue), (6) social functioning, (7) role limitations due to emotional health, (8) general mental health (psychological distress/wellbeing) which are expressed as a score on a 0-100 scale for each of the eight health concepts. The maximum score of 100 means no disability in five of the scales (Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, Social Functioning, and Role Emotional) and indicates not the absence of disability, but the presence of a positive state of health in the other scales (General Health, Vitality and Mental Health).</description>

    <description>Rate-adaptive pacing is a function of permanent pacemaker to accelerate patients' heart rate when they are walking, stair climbing, running or carrying on intensive physical activity. Appropriately, the function is similar to human's electrophysiology of sinus node but it may be difficult to replace sinus node's function totally. For example, the acceleration or deceleration slope when exercise beginning or cessation is not always the same or consistent in different patients and different time.</description>
