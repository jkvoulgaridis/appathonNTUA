  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although individualized or goal-directed approach has been advocated, a reliable index is
      still required to help monitor the volume status timely and efficiently. Dynamic indexes,
      such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), have been shown to
      be clearly superior to more commonly measured static preload variables, such as pulmonary
      artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) and central venous pressure (CVP). The reliability of
      dynamic indexes in monitoring the volume status and predicting fluid responsiveness have been
      validated. Fluid optimization guided by SVV and PPV is beneficial to hemodynamic stability
      and can decrease mortality and reduce postoperative complications. However, the usefulness of
      dynamic indexes in elderly patients has not been previously investigated. This study aimed to
      evaluate whether dynamic indexes PPV and SVV can reliably predict fluid responsiveness in
      elderly patients, and to determine their thresholds in elderly patients.
