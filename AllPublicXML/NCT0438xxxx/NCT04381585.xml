  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADO is a bone regeneration technique, introduced by Chin and Toth in 1996 based in a
      biological process used for regenerate and consolidate bone between two bone segments
      obtained after osteotomy.These segments have been gradually separated by the process of
      distraction. ADO can be performed both horizontally (AHDO) and vertically (AVDO).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distraction osteogenesis (DO) can be used to regenerate missing hard and soft tissue,
      Distraction osteogenesis relies on the body's ability to generate bone as two segments of
      bone are &quot;distracted&quot; apart. The osteotomies are created and the distraction device is
      placed. Typically, there is a latency phase of one week were a Ô¨Åbrovascular bridge is formed
      in the osteotomy site. This provides a template to generate new bone as the segments are
      distracted apart during the activation phase. Once the desired distraction has occurred, the
      device is left in place for a period of time. Once consolidation (typically 2 to 6 months)
      has occurred, the distraction device can be removed and implants can be placed. Chiapasco
      compared GBR to DO and found that both are equally effective in alveolar bone augmentation
      for implant placement and further stated that the long-term prognosis of vertical bone gain
      in DO is more predictable.

    <description>Degree of inflammation: degree of inflammation around the orthodontic implant was recorded by using the modified gingival index; 0 = normal gingiva; 1 = mild inflammation- slight change in color, slight edema, no bleeding on tissue manipulation. 2 = moderate inflammation- redness, edema and bleeding on tissue manipulation 3 = severe inflammation- marked redness and edema with ulceration and tendency for spontaneous bleeding.</description>

    <description>A mini distractor will be used to move bone. Distraction osteogenesis originally developed for the severe craniofacial malformations has been adapted to correct vertical defects of the oral bone to improve bone volume for dental procedures.
However, the design of the distractor
has not evolved to adapt to a much smaller surgical site such as bone ridge in the oral cavity which necessitates a smaller screw.
are bulky, cumbersome to place, and cause significant discomfort to the patient.
has an extraoral component jutting out of the mouth to which a key (blue object) is attached to turn the screw to move bone fragments. Our Solution and the Innovation is to remove the extra-oral component by reducing the size and permitting an atraumatic placement of the screw under the gingiva (gum) thereby lessening irritation for the patient.</description>

    <intervention_name>A MINI DISTRACTOR WITH A SUBMERGED ACTIVATION COMPONENT</intervention_name>
    <description>Mini distractor is used to regenerate alveolar bone which is resorbed due various reasons. The distractor uses a winch-like submucosal activation component which is buried in the tissue; Flicking the winch turns the screw which moves the segment upwards in the direction of black arrow increasing height.</description>
