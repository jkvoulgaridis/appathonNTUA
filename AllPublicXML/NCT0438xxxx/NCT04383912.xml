  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brow lift is a surgical procedure that has been practiced for several decades. A typical
      indication is brow ptosis, which can be secondary to involutional changes or facial nerve
      palsies. Several techniques have been described, including direct, mid-forehead, coronal, and
      endoscopic approaches. Of these options, the direct brow lift allows for predictable
      post-operative brow contour and excellent control over the degree of lift achieved. As with
      any surgical procedure, with direct brow lift comes known undesirable post-operative
      outcomes, the most common of which is forehead paresthesia from supraorbital nerve damage.
      Other complications include alopecia and brow asymmetry. However, one of the main critiques
      of direct brow lift remains the poor cosmesis that can result from scarring just above the
      brow. A study conducted by Cho et al. concluded that of the main surgical techniques
      currently employed for treatment of brow ptosis, direct brow lifts held the highest rates of
      visible scarring.

      Scarring can significantly impair an individuals' quality of life. This is particularly true
      of facial scarring, which is often difficult to conceal. Much research has been conducted in
      the area of treating postoperative, traumatic, and burn-related scarring. Cadet et al
      completed a randomized controlled trial using topical silicone gel for direct brow
      lift-related scarring, given the known benefit of silicone gel sheeting for the same, but did
      not find a significant difference between treatment and control groups. Some effective
      techniques described in the literature to date include long-pulsed non-ablative Nd:YAG laser,
      as well as intralesional steroid injection. On the rise are studies looking into the use of
      botulinum toxin A for treatment of unfavourable scarring and improved facial cosmesis.

      Botulinum toxin is a neuromodulatory agent that has garnered usage in a variety of
      therapeutic and cosmetic settings. More recently, injection of botulinum toxin as a means to
      reduce scarring and improve outcomes in wound healing has been investigated. Several studies,
      including two large metaanalyses, have shown this to be an effective method of treatment.
      Proposed mechanisms include increased apoptosis and suppressed proliferation of fibroblasts
      treated with botulinum toxin, modulated via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. Park et al added to
      the in vitro literature by demonstrating that fibroblasts treated with botulinum toxin A
      produced fewer extracellular matrix proteins and pro-fibrotic factors compared to untreated
      cells. Another underlying mechanism that results in suboptimal wound healing is the constant
      contraction and relaxation of facial muscles, causing repetitive microtrauma that ultimately
      increases inflammation and impairs wound healing. It therefore stands to reason that by
      temporarily paralyzing local musculature during the post-operative period, collagen
      maturation can take place uninterrupted by excessive tensile forces.

      Despite scarring being a widely known and undesirable complication of direct brow lift
      surgery, there have been no studies to date examining the use of onabotulinum toxin injection
      to reduce said scarring and improve outcomes. With this double masked, prospective,
      randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to determine whether injection of
      onabotulinum toxin immediately following direct brow lift surgery can improve scores on
      validated patient and observer scar scales.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a double masked, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Participants will function as their own internal control, with one side (i.e. brow) being randomized to the treatment arm, and the other to placebo.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Computer randomization software will be used to determine whether the right or left side will receive onabotulinum toxin injection. The contralateral side will receive a placebo injection of equal volume (normal saline).
The health care professional assisting with the procedure will not be masked to randomization. He/she will draw up the onabotulinum toxin A and placebo in two separate identical syringes marked A (right side) and B (left side). They will reference a form showing the results of the computer generated randomization, which will be kept in a study chart separate from the patient's normal oculoplastic visits. They will sign this form, as well as record the lot number of the onabotulinum toxin A and normal saline.
The oculoplastic surgeon will visually divide each incision in half, and inject half of the volume of syringe A at each side of the right direct brow lift incision, and half of the volume of syringe B at each side of the left direct brow lift incision.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>1 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>At 1 month following surgery, photographs will be taken of both brows. The patient will then be given a mirror, and under consistent lighting conditions and in a private setting, will complete the Patient Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), after adequate explanation of each parameter. These scores will be combined for a total score ranging from 7 to 70, again with lower numbers indicating higher patient satisfaction. A masked lay observer (consistent person with every patient) will also complete the VAS.
The above step will be repeated at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery, as well as the following additional steps. Scars will be graded by a masked observer using the Observer Scar Assessment Scale (OSAS), Observer Modified Scar Assessment Scale (OMSAS), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). These scores will be combined for a total score ranging from 11 to 81, with lower scores indicating better outcome.</description>

    <description>Pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative (at month 1, 3, 6, and 12) photographs will be taken for all participants. ImageJ software will be used to analyze the photos and measure the degree of brow lift achieved on each side, to ensure this has not been affected by botulinum toxin injection. This will be measured from the pupillary light reflex to the upper border of the eyebrow (in mm). These measurements will be done by a masked observer.</description>
