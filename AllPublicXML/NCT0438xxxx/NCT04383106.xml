  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel colonization with anti-microbial resistant bacteria increases the risk of clinical
      infections. Infections caused by anti-microbial resistant bacteria have been associated with
      increased mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and increased costs. In addition, with the
      emergence of carbapenemase resistant bacterial species, there may not be any effective
      therapy for patients infected with such resistant species.

      Bowel colonization with anti-microbial resistant bacteria is an established risk factor for
      infections due to resistant bacteria, especially in transplanted patients and in intensive
      care unit. In this study we will study whether bowel colonisation in Acute on Chronic Liver
      Failure patient increases the risk of infection development in extra intestinal sites.
