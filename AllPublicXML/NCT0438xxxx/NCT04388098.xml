    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the dental caries experience, periodontal health and salivary
      properties of asthmatic and non-asthmatic children ⁄ adolescents.

      A total of 108 children aged from 7 to 16 years old were included in this study and equally
      divided into two groups: Group I (asthmatic children) and Group II (healthy control). All the
      children were clinically examined to assess their dental caries experience and periodontal
      health condition. A trained and calibrated examiner (kappa = 0.95) performed the dental
      caries examination according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Dental caries
      status was recorded using the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth (dmft/DMFT) and
      decayed, missing or filled surface (dmfs/DMFS) indices. Periodontal health was assessed by
      gingival index [GI] and plaque index(PI). An interview was conducted with parents/guardians
      and a structured questionnaire was employed to parents in addition to medical records.
      Stimulated salivary samples were collected and assessed for salivary flow rate, salivary pH
      and buffering capacity.

    <description>Caries experience of asthmatic and non-asthmatic children was recorded using the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth (dmft/DMFT) and decayed, missing or filled surface (dmfs/DMFS) indices. The gingival index (GI) was used to assess the gingival condition according to the criteria of Loe and Silness as follows: no gingival inflammation (&lt;0.1), mild inflammation (0.1-1.0), moderate inflammation (1.1-1.9), and severe inflammation in case of marked gingival redness and edema with spontaneous bleeding and ulceration (2.0-3.0) Plaque index(PI) was used to assess the amount of dental plaque.The measurement of the state of oral hygiene by Silness-Löe plaque index is based on recording both soft debris and mineralized deposits on the following teeth: A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth.</description>
