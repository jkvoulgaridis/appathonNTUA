      The present prospective clinical study was directed to evaluate efficiency of three different
      aligning arch wires during initial orthodontic leveling.

      The sample of present study included 30 patients, 15 females and 15 males; with a mean age
      was 17.81 ± 1.96 years. They were randomly allocated into three equal groups, according to
      the type of the aligning arch wire as follows:

        1. Group A: in which 10 patients, with a mean age was 17.27 ± 1.95 years, were treated with
           conventional singlestrand NiTi arch wires.

        2. Group B: in which 10 patients, with a mean age was 17.33 ± 2.42 years, were treated with
           Niobium-titanium-tantalum-Zirconium (Gummetal) arch wires.

        3. Group C: in which 10 patients, with a mean age was 18.70 ± 1.49 years, were treated with
           multistrand NiTi arch wires.

      Mandibular orthodontic study models were taken every 4 weeks and laser scanned to obtain 3D
      digital models during the 3 months observation period of the study. The changes in LII were
      determined at every 4 weeks observation intervals. Moreover, the changes in inter-canine,
      inter-1st premolar and inter-molar widths before and after three months were evaluated and
      compared among the three groups of aligning arch wires.

      Data were collected and statistically analyzed via Statistical Package for Social Science
      (SPSS, version 23). One Way ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis tests were used to assess the
      difference among the three studied groups and paired t-test was used to assess the difference
      and percent of changes within each group before and after three months observation period.
