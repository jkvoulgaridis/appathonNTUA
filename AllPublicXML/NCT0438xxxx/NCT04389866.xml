  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical study to demonstrate a reduction in jowling and laxity of the
      jawline that can be achieved following facial volume enhancement using Juvederm Voluma. The
      secondary measure will be if this can be achieved with Jawline injection only, or if a
      superior result can be obtained with both cheek and jowl injection.

      This study is proposed to evaluate the best protocol for achieving improvement in the sagging
      jawline.

      JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC will be injected in each of 16 women with sagging of grades 1-3 using a
      published jawline evaluation scale.

      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups:

      Patient Group 1: JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected
      into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preauricular area) (the latter area will be
      added if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl attenuation)

      Patient Group 2: JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-3 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected
      into the lateral cheek (zygomatic) area plus JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe
      is 1 cc) will be injected into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preauricular
      area) (the latter area will be added if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl
      attenuation)

      High-resolution photographs from multiple angles will be taken in identical lighting and
      position with the VISIA CR and with the Fotofinder at 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Additional
      real-time video telemedicine visits will take place at 6 months and 12 months. In addition, a
      72-hour safety phone call will be completed with the subject after each injection session.
      All visit timing will be based on the last injection session. 2 blinded dermatologists will
      rate the patient's severity of jowling based on the Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) (1) at the 2-
      and 4-week visits. The patient will also rate their jowling based on the JRS as well as their
      satisfaction with the procedure.

             may have been delayed as necessary to accommodate this 10-day washout period)

         23. Patients who received any investigational product within 30 days prior to study
