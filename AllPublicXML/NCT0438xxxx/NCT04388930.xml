  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human gastrointestinal tract harbours ~40 trillion microbial cells, far outnumbering the
      cell number, and therefore the genetic content of its host. How this genetically diverse
      bacterial (collectively referred as 'microbiota') co-resident modulates host homeostasis is
      largely unknown. We are increasing gaining a better understanding how the microbes modulate
      mucosal and systemic metabolic/immune and organ systems including the kidney, heart and the
      brain. Therapeutic targeting of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota may help improve
      clinical outcomes in conditions as diverse as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
      In contrast to other organ systems, studies investigating the role of the microbiota in
      modulating clinical outcomes in renal transplantation lags behind.

      The aim of the study is to examine (a) how alterations in the urinary and GI microbiota and
      associated metabolites impact on host immunity after renal transplantation, and (b) whether
      such changes are correlated with post-transplant complications, such as rejection,
      development of de novo donor specific antibodies, metabolic complications (e.g
      post-transplant diabetes) and infections. Participants will be followed before and up to
      twelve months post-transplantation, and, longitudinal microbial data will be correlated with
      in-depth immune phenotyping and clinical end-points to define the impact that changes in
      urinary and GI microbial ecology have on kidney transplant outcomes.
