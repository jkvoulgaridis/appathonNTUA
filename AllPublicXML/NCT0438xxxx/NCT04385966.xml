  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic shoulder surgery involves dynamic and severe postoperative pain. Interscalene
      brachial plexus block (IBPB) provides adequate analgesia but the spread of local anaesthetics
      administered causes a phrenic nerve block which entrains a non-negligible incidence of
      Hemidiaphragmatic paralysis acute (HDPA).

      This is a comparative, prospective, Unicenter, double-blind, two-arm, randomized and
      controlled clinical trial. 48 patients will be included.

      This RCT would demonstrate a low volume dose IBPB decrease the HDPA after IBPB in patients
      undergoing SAS, by using spirometry and ultrasound and it will not provide inferior
      postoperative analgesia according to opioid requirements of postoperative PCA in comparison
      to standard volume dose used in current practice.

      Arthroscopic shoulder surgery involves dynamic and severe postoperative pain. Interscalene
      brachial plexus block (IBPB) provides adequate analgesia but the spread of local anaesthetics
      administered causes a phrenic nerve block which entrains a non-negligible incidence of
      Hemidiaphragmatic paralysis acute (HDPA).

      The primary study objective is to determine the HDPA diagnosed by using diaphragmatic
      thickness index in Ultrasound (US) after Low Volume (10 mL) versus Standard Volume (20 mL) of
      Levobupivacaine 0,25% for IBPB. Secondary end-points are 1) HDPA diagnosed by using FVC and
      FEV1 in spirometry, 2) HDPA diagnosed by using diaphragmatic excursion in US, 3)
      postoperative pain regarding time to first analgesic consumption and 24-hour cumulative total
      consumption of Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump of Morphine IV and (4) postoperative
      harms between two trial-arms.

      This study is a comparative, prospective, Unicenter, double-blind and two-arm RCT. 48

    <masking_description>After randomization, only Interscalene Block performer staff will know which intervention group is assigned to the participants. Spirometry and ultrasound assessments will be conducted by only one blinded anesthesiologist of Assessment staff who will not be communicated to IBPB staff. Recruitment and Assessment staff and participants will not be allowed to receive any information about the group allocation. Study unblinding will occur when every ultrasound and Spirometry assessments have been completed after 24-hour follow-up postoperative closeout. After follow-up finished, every study data will figure in the patient medical record. Code breaks should occur only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment is absolutely essential for further management of the patient as an allergy episode. The Research staff will be encouraged to maintain the blind as far as possible. Unblinded IBPB staff will manage the emergency.</masking_description>
