    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TAK-981 in
      combination with pembrolizumab in participants with select solid tumor indications and to
      establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) during Phase 1b of study and to evaluate the
      preliminary efficacy of TAK-981 at the RP2D in combination with pembrolizumab in participants
      with select solid tumor indications in Phase 2 of the study.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 is being tested to treat
      people who have select advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will include a dose
      escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

      The study will enroll approximately 101 patients, approximately 32 participants in the dose
      escalation phase and approximately 9 to 23 participants in each of the 3 cohorts of dose
      expansion phase. Participants will receive escalating doses of TAK-981 and fixed dose of
      pembrolizumab until RP2D is determined:

      • Dose Escalation: TAK-981 + Pembrolizumab (fixed dose)

      Once RP2D is determined, participants of select advanced or metastatic solid tumors will
      receive TAK-981 in below defined cohorts in the expansion phase:

        -  Expansion Phase: Non-squamous NSCLC

        -  Expansion Phase: Cervical Cancer

        -  Expansion Phase: Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC)

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 48 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
      progression-free survival follow-up for maximum up to 12 months after last dose of study
      drug.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
