  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the elderly population in China has reached 241 million, and there are more than
      20 million elderly surgical patients every year, accounting for about 25% of the surgical
      population. However, there is no research report on the anesthesia related risk factors of
      death of elderly patients in hospital. The purpose of this study is to analyze the
      perioperative data of multicenter database, and to explore the anesthesia related death risk
      factors of elderly patients with noncardiac surgery in the investigator's country, especially
      within 24 hours after surgery, so as to help improve the anesthesia management technology of
      elderly patients during surgery, improve the medical quality of perioperative period, and
      improve the prognosis of patients.
