  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) are the major long-term complication of intrauterine procedures
      and are associated with pelvic pain, menstrual disorders, obstetrical complication and
      infertility.

      Womed Leaf is a medical device specifically designed for intrauterine use that prevents
      intra-uterine adhesions. It is a film that acts as a mechanical barrier to keep uterus walls
      separated during healing. It is then naturally discharged through the cervix and vagina in
      less than 30 days.

      The PREG1 clinical investigation is designed to evaluate Womed Leaf safety under clinical
      conditions, in women scheduled for a hysteroscopic myomectomy as well as its efficacy.

      Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) are defined as &quot;fibrous strings at opposing walls of the uterus
      and/or cervix leading to partial or complete obliteration of the cavity&quot;. IUAs are the major
      long-term complication of intrauterine procedures and are associated with pelvic pain,
      menstrual disorders, obstetrical complications and infertility.

      Womed Leaf™ is a sterile, degradable polymer film specifically design for intrauterine use.
      It is inserter in the uterus like an intrauterine device. Once released it will self-deploy
      into the uterine cavity to form a mechanical barrier keeping uterus walls separated during
      healing, for several days, thus preventing the formation or recurrence of intrauterine
      adhesions. It is degraded and discharged naturally through the cervix and vagina in less than
      30 days.

      The PREG1 clinical investigation is a prospective multicenter, single arm study, designed to
      evaluate Womed Leaf safety under clinical conditions, in women scheduled for a hysteroscopic
      myomectomy as well as its efficacy in preventing IUA at second look hysteroscopy.

    <description>At the end of the hysteroscopic myomectomy, Womed Leaf is delivered in the uterus thanks to a 5mm diameter, flexible inserter. Then an endovaginal ultrasound will be performed to assess the positioning of the uterine film.
Another ultrasound will be performed at 2 hours, prior to patient discharge in order to record images of the uterine film deployment.
A second look hysteroscopy will performed at 4-8 weeks to evaluate the presence of intrauterine adhesion.</description>
