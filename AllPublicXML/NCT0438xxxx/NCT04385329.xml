  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled study in to investigate if a shock wave treatment
      extended to the gastrocnemius-soleus trigger points (TrP) is more effective than a standard
      treatment exclusively targeted at the plantar fascia in a population affected by unilateral
      plantar fasciitis with concomitant sural myofascial pain syndrome.

    <measure>Change in FFI-foot function index</measure>
    <time_frame>FFI was administered at baseline, at two months time point and at three months time point</time_frame>
    <description>Foot Function Index is self-administered questionnaire designed to measure foot performances in relation to symptoms. Foot Function Index is structured in two sections of nine items each, investigating foot pain (FFI-A) and function (FFI-B) respectively. The total score of each section ranges from zero (no pain/no functional limitation) to 100 (intolerable pain/complete inability). The two scores were separately analysed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PPT-pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>PPT was recorded at baseline, at two months time point and at three months time point</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) of the gastrocnemius-soleus trigger points was assessed by means of a digital hand-held algometer (see procedures for details). PPT is the minimal force that induces pain and its measurement is useful to quantitatively evaluate the effect of a treatment on trigger points</description>

    <description>Enrolled subjects were treated with focused shock wave therapy, once a week for three consecutive weeks, by a specialized physician with more than five years of expertise, using a device powered by a piezoelectric generator (PIEZOSON 100PLUS, Richard Wolf®). At each treatment session, with the patients lying in prone decubitus position, the enthesis of the plantar fascia and the gastrocnemius-soleus trigger points were clinically targeted and treated with a perpendicular technique.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult age (18 to 75 years) and written informed consent;

          -  Unilateral heel pain of four weeks or longer duration;

          -  Pain to digital pressure in the insertional area of the plantar fascia at the
             calcaneum;

          -  Sonographic examination showing a plantar fascia thickness greater than 3.8mm (see
             procedures for details);

          -  Concomitant presence of a sural myofascial pain syndrome (SMPS), diagnosed on the
             basis of the finding, at the physical examination, of trigger points of the
             gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex, according to Travel and Simons' original
             description.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No corticosteroid injections or other physical therapies since the onset of the
             current pain episode (except pharmacological pain treatments and foot orthoses);

          -  No general contraindication to shock wave therapy (pregnancy, bleeding disorders or
             anticoagulant drug usage, cancer in the focal area);

          -  No clinical signs of lumbar radiculopathy at physical examination;

          -  No ankle osteoarthritis, diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings;

          -  No previous fractures or surgery in the affected ankle and foot;

          -  No rheumatologic diseases, no plantar fibromatosis
