      Hydroxychloroquine is widely used to treat autoimmune diseases. Clinical investigation has
      found that a high concentration of cytokines were detected in the plasma of critically ill
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, therefore, hydroxychloroquine as anti-inflammatory agents
      may reduce this response in accord with their use in autoimmune disease where the cytokine
      response can be reduced.

      Favipiravir is an antiviral drug developed in Japan that the data sheet notes that it is a
      pyrazinecarboxamide derivative with activity against influenza viruses, west nile virus,
      yellow fever virus, foot and mouth disease virus as well as against flaviviruses,
      arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphaviruses. In February the drug was used for COVID-19
      disease in China and was declared effective in treatment, and a report published (in press)
      comparing Favipiravir with Lopinavir /ritonavir suggested that Favipiravir was superior for
      prevention of disease progression and viral clearance.

      The objective of this pilot study is to compare 3 arms: hydroxychloroquine; favipiravir;
      supportive treatment only, in symptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in an open label
      randomized clinical trial. The difference between groups will allow an effect size to be
      determined for a definitive clinical trial

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) and has developed into a pandemic with serious global
      public health and economic sequelae As of April 27, 2020 over 2,973,000 cases have been
      confirmed worldwide leading to over 206,000 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).
      There is no current vaccine available, but there have been a number of reports of chloroquine
      and hydroxychloroquine having antiviral properties with efficacy against COVID-19 disease.
      Chloroquine is used in the treatment of malaria and amebiasis and is still used in the
      prophylaxis of malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is a derivative of Chloroquine that has
      been demonstrated to be much less (~40%) toxic than Chloroquine in animals.
      Hydroxychloroquine is widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, due to its immunomodulatory
      properties, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, with an excellent
      safety profile. In vitro studies have suggested that their mode of action in COVID-19 disease
      is to block the transport of SARS-CoV-2 from endosomes to endolysosomes, which appears to be
      a requirement to release the viral genome as in the case of SARS-CoV. Clinical investigation
      has found that a high concentration of cytokines were detected in the plasma of critically
      ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that cytokine storm was associated with
      disease severity; therefore, Chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine as anti-inflammatory agents may
      reduce this response in accord with their use in autoimmune disease where the cytokine
      response can be reduced.

      Favipiravir is an antiviral drug developed in Japan that the data sheet notes that it is a
      pyrazinecarboxamide derivative with activity against influenza viruses, west nile virus,
      yellow fever virus, foot and mouth disease virus as well as against flaviviruses,
      arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphaviruses. Its mode of action is through inhibition of
      viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In February the drug was used for COVID-19 disease in
      China and was declared effective in treatment, and a report published (in press) comparing
      Favipiravir with Lopinavir /ritonavir suggested that Favipiravir was superior for prevention
      of disease progression and viral clearance.

      A large pragmatic clinical trial is being undertaken globally by WHO, the solidarity trial,
      and application has been made in Bahrain to be part of that study. In the solidarity study
      there are to be 4 arms; chloroquine phosphate alone, remdesivir, lopinarvir with ritonavir or
      lopinarvir with ritonavir plus interferon. It may therefore be seen that this Favipiravir
      does not replicate the features of the solidarity trial.
