      Clinical study to investigate the safety and the efficacy of the URECA CTO Device during
      recanalization and mechanical re-entry into the true lumen after passing the
      occlusions/calcifications (chronic total occlusions) in the peripheral vasculature.

    <textblock>
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) restricts blood supply to the lower limbs. The disease
      causes obstructions that can affect blood vessels in both the proximal and distal regions.
      When these vessel obstructions exist for more than 3- 6 Months they are classed as chronic
      total occlusions. Without sufficient collateral formation this can lead to to chronic
      limb-treatening ischemia (CLTI), which is characterized by chronic pain and tissue loss.
      Without revascularization this frequently leads to amputation. The purpose of this clinical
      study is to investigate the safety and the efficacy of the URECA CTO Device during
      recanalization and mechanical re-entry into the true lumen after passing the
      occlusions/calcifications (chronic total occlusions) in the peripheral vasculature.

             participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not completed
             the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the endpoints of this study;
