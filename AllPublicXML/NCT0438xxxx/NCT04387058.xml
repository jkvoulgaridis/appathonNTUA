  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decompensated cirrhosis is associated with sarcopenia. TIPS is an efficient treatment of
      portal hypertension. Based on our retrospective data, TIPS induces in 30% of cirrhotic
      patients metabolic disorders associated with diabetes or pre-diabetes. The main objective is
      to measure the cumulative incidence of diabetes and pre-diabetes 6 months after TIPS
      insertion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on our retrospective data, we expect that one-third of cirrhotic patients develop
      glucose dysregulation after TIPS. A better knowledge of the metabolic disorders related to
      the TIPS could allow to prevent the deleterious effects of the TIPS on the disease (decrease
      of the insulin-sensitivity, fat gain ...), by simple interventions on diet or physical
      activity. We will assess the incidence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, and the influence of
      TIPS on nutritional status and sarcopenia. Patients will be follow-up 6 months after TIPS. We
      will explore the hormonal mechanisms that explain these changes.
