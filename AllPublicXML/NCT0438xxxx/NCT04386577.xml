  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259) was a randomized clinical trial in
      25,871 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin
      D3 (2000 IU) or fish oil (1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids) reduces the risk of developing
      cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these
      illnesses. This ancillary study is being conducted among participants in VITAL-CTSC cohort
      and will examine whether vitamin D or fish oil supplementation has beneficial effects on
      cellular aging.

      This project is an ancillary study based on the parental study &quot;the VITamin D and OmegA-3
      TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259)&quot; at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Centre (CTSC)
      and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Our research focuses on the separate and synergistic
      effects of vitamin D and omega -3 supplements on telomere length, a cellular aging marker,
      using de-identified samples from VITAL-CTSC cohort.

      Aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation decreases leukocyte telomere
      length attrition. The investigators will determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on
      telomere length attrition over time (Baseline, Year 2, and Year 4); 2) To test the hypothesis
      that marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation decreases LTL attrition. The investigators
      will determine the effect of marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on telomere length
      attrition over time (Baseline, Year 2, and Year 4); 3) To determine to what extent the
      effects of vitamin D or omega-3 supplementation on inflammatory cytokines and CVD risk
      factors are mediated by telomere length attrition over time; 4) To explore the synergistic
      effects vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.

    <description>We will examine the changes in plasma markers of inflammation (CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) in plasma samples collected at the baseline, year 2 and year 4. We will
examine whether change in LTL is a mediator of change of inflammatory and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.</description>

At baseline, year 2 and year 4 of the trial, a subcohort of 1,054 VITAL participants living within driving distance of Boston, Massachusetts received detailed in-clinic health assessments at the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) of Brigham and Women's Hospital. During CTSC visits, participants have a clinical exam, including measurement of height, weight, other anthropometrics, blood pressure, and physical performance. They also provide fasting blood and urine samples, and undergo 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing, lung function testing (spirometry), electrocardiograms, bone mineral density testing, 2D-echocardiography, and assessments of thinking and mood.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators recognize and fully support the principles of resource and data sharing that have been endorsed by the NIH. Since VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the investigators will not be able to share any unblinded data involving randomized treatments with internal or outside investigators while the trial in ongoing (with the exception of the Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board). However, the investigators will maintain our strong commitment to the full communication of important study results to participants and the scientific community through rapid publication of primary findings, presentations at major meetings, as well as through appropriate lay interviews and lay publications.</ipd_description>
