  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether FABALOFEN 60 is bioequivalent to JAPROLOX速 TABLETS
      after a single oral administration of each loxoprofen formulation in healthy subjects by
      assessing of pharmacokinetic properties including AUC, Tmax and Cmax and to evaluate the
      safety of test drug FABALOFEN 60 and reference drug JAPROLOX速 TABLETS during drug
      administration.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single-dose, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover study in
      24 fed healthy subjects with an at-least-6-day washout period. The drug level in serum is
      detected by High-performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to determine Cmax, AUC0-t and Tmax.
      Safety are evaluated during drug administration, blood sampling time, washout period and 1
      week after the end of blood sampling for any adverse drug reactions.
