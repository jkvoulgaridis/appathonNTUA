      To develop a balance device that will work with the inertia sensor to quantitatively assess
      the balance of individuals and investigate the validity and reliability of the balance data
      of the device.

      In this study, we aim to develop a balance assessment system that will measure the balance
      quantitatively. For this balance assessment system, a balance board will be developed that
      will work with inertial sensors and detect the oscillations of the individual trying to stand
      on balance. The validity and reliability of the balance score determined by the analysis of
      the oscillation data of this balance board will be investigated.

      Our hypothesis is that the correlation between the balance score revealed by the newly
      developed evaluation system and the results of clinical and instrumental balance assessment
      methods will be significant. For this, one commonly used clinic and one instrumental balance
      assessment method will be used. Star Excursion Balance Test as a clinical balance assessment
      method and Balance Master device (BMc) as an instrumental balance assessment method were
      evaluated. Limits of Stability Test (LOS) and Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction
      in Balance (mCTSIB) were used in the BMc.

    <description>The Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) is a dynamic test that requires strength, flexibility, and proprioception. It is a measure of dynamic balance that provides a significant challenge to athletes and physically active individuals. The test can be used to assess physical performance, but can also be used to screen deficits in dynamic postural control due to musculoskeletal injuries (e.g. chronic ankle instability), to identify athletes at greater risk for lower extremity injury, as well as during the rehabilitation of orthopeadic injuries in healthy active adults.[</description>

    <description>The Balance Master (Neurocom International, Inc Clackamas,) device is a computerized posturography device. The device consists of a fixed support surface consisting of a force table and individuals, a variety of ground elements and a computer screen that will provide visual feedback and conduct test protocols. Posturography tests a person's ability to integrate visual, vestibular and somatosensory inputs and suppress inappropriate sensory information. Thus, it can quantitatively score the person's balance and examine balance problems in detail with the tests it contains. There are various protocols that evaluate balance differently in Balance Master (BMc). Limits of Stability Test (LOS) and Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (mCTSIB) were used in the BMc.</description>
