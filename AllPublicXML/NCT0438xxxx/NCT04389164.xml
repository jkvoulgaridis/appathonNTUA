  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic scar is an inevitable outcome of wound repair. It affects the appearance and
      some scar contracture often leads to joint dysfunction.Patients have low quality of life,
      long treatment cycle, heavy social burden and high medical costs.Skin grafting is currently
      the gold standard for scar repair.However, there are often insufficient skin sources, easy to
      scar recurrence, lack of skin accessory organs.The application of composite skin graft can
      reduce the recurrence rate of scar healing and relieve the deficiency of skin source.However,
      its survival rate is not high, and acellular allogeneic dermal scaffolds are expensive, heavy
      medical burden.Therefore, how to effectively repair the wound surface after surgical excision
      of scar is the main problem to be solved urgently.

      Dermal loss is the main cause of unsatisfactory scar repair and recurrence.The previous
      clinical study of the research group found that the application of autologous epidermal basal
      cells and autologous skin graft obtained in real time during the operation could effectively
      improve the survival rate of skin graft in the treatment of wound surface (Brit J Surg,
      2015).Furthermore, it is suggested that the application of autologous scar dermal scaffolds
      can achieve the control of skin damage in the skin harvesting area and the orthotopic
      transplantation of autologous scar tissue dermal scaffolds, which can effectively reduce the
      economic burden of patients.Therefore, the researchers wondered whether the construction of
      tissue-engineered skin orthotopic transplantation with autologous epidermal basal cells and
      autologous scar dermal scaffold combined with autologous scar dermal scaffolds to repair the
      wound after scar resection could improve the survival rate of skin graft and reduce scar
      recurrence.To this end, we plan to carry out multi-center, prospective, randomized,
      controlled clinical trials, aiming at proposing more effective surgical treatment guidelines
      for the repair of hypertrophic scar, improving the survival rate of composite skin graft, and
      solving the current clinical problems of hypertrophic scar repair.

    <description>The thickness of scar tissue in the middle of the dermis is removed by a roller cutter with a thickness of about 0.01 -- 0.02mm. After cleaning, the dermis can be used for punching and mesh drawing in the dermal rolling machine.Autologous epidermal basal cell suspension was prepared according to the description of autologous epidermal basal cell extraction box.The size of the remaining skin should be the same as the wound surface. After washing with normal saline, the wet yarn should be wrapped for later use.The autogenous scar dermal scaffold was prepared and transplanted onto the wound surface. The autoepidermal basal cells prepared were sprayed or coated between the mesh and the dermal scaffold. Autologous skin slices were transplanted onto the wound surface and fixed with pressure bandaging.</description>

    <description>scar excision. The thickness of scar tissue in the middle of scar is removed with a roller cutter and the thickness is about 0.01 -- 0.02mm.
take autologous skin slices of the patient with an electric skin knife, cut out a small piece of skin, and prepare autologous epidermal basal cell suspension for use;The rest of the skin should be the same size as the wound.
the prepared autogenous scar dermal stent was grafted onto the scar resection wound surface, and the prepared autoepidermal basal cells were sprayed between the mesh and on the dermal stent, and autologous skin slices were grafted onto the wound surface and fixed with pressure bandaging;
after the operation, the outer dressing should be changed regularly according to the conventional treatment, and the wound surface condition should be observed and recorded according to the experimental scheme.</description>
