    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to gain more information on patients who are treated with
      Metformin for their Type 2 Diabetes. Adult female and male patients with a prescription of a
      Metformin containing drug will be invited to the study in a public pharmacy after the
      decision for treatment with Metformin has been made by the treating physician. The pharmacist
      will provide interested participants access to a special phone App and participants are asked
      to complete via this phone App a questionnaire on their health situation with special focus
      on their Type 2 Diabetes. This includes questions on complications and self-care activities
      in relation to their diabetes, questions on quality of life and health history. There will be
      no extra visit to the treating doctor or a pharmacy. The study is aiming to have the
      questionnaire completed by 300 participants.

    <description>The SDSCA measure is a brief self-report questionnaire of diabetes self-management. It assesses the number of days per week in which respondents engage in diabetes health-related behaviors in the areas of general diet, diabetes-specific diet, physical activity, blood-glucose testing, foot care, and smoking. Minimum score 0. Maximum score 77. Higher scores indicate better self care.</description>
