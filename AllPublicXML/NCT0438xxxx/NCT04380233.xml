  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 13 weeks randomized, double-blind and placebo parallel-controlled trial will be conducted
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Zhizhu Kuanzhong Capsule in the treatment of
      functional dyspepsia-postprandial distress syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo parallel-controlled International
      clinical trial of Zhizhu Kuanzhong Capsule in treating patients with Functional
      Dyspepsia-Postprandial Distress Syndrome (FD-PDS).

      In this study, Hong Kong Baptist University will collaborate with Xiyuan Hospital of China
      Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, and will be recruiting 60 FD-PDS patients as study
      subjects in Hong Kong, out of the total sample size of 480 patients.

      The study includes a 1 week run-in period, 8 weeks double-blind treatment period and a 4
      weeks of follow up period for each eligible subject. Eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned to either the trial drug or the placebo.

      6 follow-up visits and 1 telephone follow-up will be scheduled for each subject on the -7
      days (visit 1), enrollment on day 0 (visit 2), 14th day (visit 3), 28th day (visit 4), 42nd
      day (visit 5, telephone follow-up), the 56th day (visit 6) and the 84th day (visit 7)
      respectively.

      Urine, stool and blood samples will be collected from each subject on visit 2 and visit 6 for
      blood, urine, stool, liver and kidney function tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>For 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with the functional dyspepsia-postprandial distress syndrome are self-rated on the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for the degree of discomfort with both symptoms of postprandial fullness and early fullness, with subjects indicating the degree of discomfort on a 10 cm ruler marked 0- &quot;Asymptomatic or No Discomfort &quot;and 10- &quot;Extreme Severe or Extreme Discomfort &quot;at its head and tail, respectively. The record is made on the diary card once a day and 7 days a week.
The integral average for the sum of VAS for both two symptoms over the past week is evaluated based on the diary card content, and a 50% decrease from baseline in the integral average at 8 weeks is recorded as a response. The proportion of the response at 8 weeks after randomization is considered primary efficacy endpoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of individual symptoms of Functional Dyspepsia</measure>
    <time_frame>For 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects were evaluated using a symptom diary for Functional Dyspepsia based on the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for gastrointestinal symptoms, including postprandial fullness discomfort, early satiety, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, epigastric burning sensation, nausea, excessive eructation, heartburn, vomiting, regurgitation, dysphagia, rass, abdominal enlargement, and defecation smoothness. Subjects indicated their discomfort on a 10 cm ruler marked 0-&quot;asymptomatic or no discomfort&quot; and 10-&quot;very painful or extremely uncomfortable&quot; on the head and tail respectively. The rating is made once a day and 7 days a week. The investigator used the average of the weekly VAS scores recorded in the subject's diary card as the symptom intensity score for this week, with one VAS score per week. The change of VAS score of each symptom at 8 weeks after randomization relative to the base</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Treatment Evaluation scale (OTE)</measure>
    <time_frame>For 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The overall treatment efficacy is evaluated using a 7point Likert Overall Evaluation Scale (OTE). The clinical investigators asked the subjects the following questions at the visit: &quot;In the last week, how much have your dyspeptic symptoms been alleviated as compared to pre-treatment?&quot; There are 7 options: ① the symptoms improved significantly, ② the symptoms improved, ③ the symptoms improved slightly, ④ the symptoms did not change, ⑤ the symptoms aggravated slightly, ⑥ the symptoms aggravated, ⑦ the symptoms aggravated significantly. At the last visit time point of the treatment cycle, patients who selected ① —② were defined as treatment responders, and those who selected ③ —⑦ were defined as non-responders. The response rates at 8 weeks between the groups were compared for differences.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, week 4 and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>HAD Rating Scale scores are recorded at baseline, week 4 and week 8 during the double-blind treatment respectively. 14 questions are asked about the subject's emotional changes that best match his/her mood since the last month.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SFNDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, week 4 and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form-Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SFNDI) is recorded at baseline, week 4 and week 8 during the double-blind treatment respectively. 10 Questions are asked about how the subject's stomach pain, discomfort, or other epigastric symptoms over the last 14 days have affected his/her life.</description>

    <description>The investigational drug is a new pure type of gastrointestinal function modulator traditional Chinese medicine, composed of 4 kinds of Chinese herbs: Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, Fructus Aurantii Immaturus, Radix Bupleuri and Fructus Crataegi. The preliminary clinical trial showed that it has a good therapeutic effect on FD patients, its Fructus Aurantii Immaturus promotes gastric emptying by stimulating the cells to release motilin, thereby significantly improving patients' symptoms of fullness, epigastric pain, eructation, and nausea and vomiting.</description>
