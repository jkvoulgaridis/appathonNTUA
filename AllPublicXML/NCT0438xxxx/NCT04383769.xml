      This study is a prospective observational cohort. The target study population is PLHIV who
      receive ART at hospitals and community-based organizations (CBOs) in Chiang Mai, Ubon
      Ratchathani, Chonburi, and Songkhla. Participants will receive ART service in the same
      standard as in the hospital setting. Secondary data will be collected from the medical
      records already existed in the hospital and CBO systems.

      DSD-ART service at the Hospital

        -  Medical examination: All clients who receive ART service at the hospital and agree to
           participate in the research project will be interviewed to collect personal information
           and receive physical and laboratory examination in order to assess eligibility in
           research participation. If ineligible, the clients will be referred to the standard of
           care.

        -  Preparation and DSD-ART service offer: PLHIV who are eligible to participate in the
           research will receive counselling to assess the supports the clients need and will be
           offered various models of DSD-ART service. The clients may choose the model that is most

    <description>data will be collected from the medical records already existed in the hospital and community-based organization (CBO) systems and entered into case report form (CRF). The expected number of participants is 5000. For each participant, the data will be collected prospectively for 24 months and retrospectively up to 5 years from the screening date. This study has no intervention and will not alter ART services whether be standard or DSD-ART at hospitals.</description>

        Data officer will collect secondary data regarding ART refill, laboratory test, counseling,
        doctor visit for HIV-related conditions, such as adverse drug reaction, opportunistic
        infections, and comorbidities, from the medical records already existed in the hospital and
        community-based organization systems and entered into the case report form. The identity of
        the clients will be untraceable since UL, which is a unique letter code assigned to each
        participant using Thai initials and date of birth translated into English alphabets, will
        be used as an individual identifier. The data will be collected prospectively for 24 months
        and retrospectively for up to 5 years from the screening date.
