  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra System comprised of the Quantra
      Hemostasis Analyzer with the QStat Cartridge in trauma patients and obstetric patients with
      postpartum hemorrhage.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The QStat Cartridge was developed to
      monitor hemostasis in patients that may experience a range of coagulopathies of various
      etiologies including fibrinolytic defects. This includes the trauma, obstetric hemorrhage and
      liver transplant populations. The cartridge consists of four independent channels each
      containing different sets of reagents, which provide four measurements performed in parallel
      yielding five parameters that depict the functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      This prospective, observational pilot study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra
      System with the QStat Cartridge as compared to comparable measures using conventional
      viscoelastic testing methods.

        Potential study participants will be adult (&gt;18 years) trauma patients or obstetric
        patients with postpartum hemorrhage where visicoelastic testing is performed as standard of
        care to assess coagulopathy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Subject is a trauma patient experiencing major trauma (preferably requiring the
             highest level of team activation) with active bleeding or deemed at high risk of
             significant bleeding according to mechanism of injury.and is a candidate for a ROTEM
             test to be performed to access coagulopathy.

        OR

        -Subject is an obstetric patient experiencing post-partum hemorrhage based on one of the
        following conditions: estimated blood loss during delivery &gt;1000 mL; placental abruption
        with hemorrhage of any quantity; clinically suspected DIC; pregnancy resulted in fetal
        demise with hemorrhage of any quantity; or is under consideration for administration of
        tranexamic acid for treatment of hemorrhage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is younger than 18 years of age

          -  Subject presents for a procedure intended to abort a pregnancy for reasons other than
             medical necessity

          -  Subject is known to have received antifibrinolytic therapy immediately prior to
             presentation to trauma unit

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in a distinct study that might confound the results of
             the proposed study

          -  Subject is affected by a condition that, in the opinion of the clinical team, may pose
             additional risks.
