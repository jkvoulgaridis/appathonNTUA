  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lot consistency, immunogenicity and safety of
      three lots of Sabin strain inactivated polio vaccine (Vero Cell) (sIPV) manufactured at
      commercial scale by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., and evaluate the non-inferiority of
      investigational vaccine against a post-market inactivated polio vaccine.

      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, and positive-controlled clinical trial. A total
      of 1300 infants aged 2 months will be enrolled and assigned to 4 groups in a ratio of 1:1:1:1
      to receive vaccination of 3 lots of investigational sIPV and control IPV manufactured by
      Sanofi Pasteur S.A respectively. Each subjects should finish the three-doses primary
      vaccination at the schedule of 2,3,4 months of age. Thirty-days safety observation after each
      dose of vaccination will be carried out. Venous blood should be collected from all the
      subjects before and 30 days after the three-doses primary vaccination, for the neutralizing
      antibody assay, and further to evaluate the immunogenicity.
