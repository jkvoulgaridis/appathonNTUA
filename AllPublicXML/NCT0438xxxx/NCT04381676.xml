  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the flipped classroom approach compared to the traditional
      classroom approach in teaching horizontal strabismus in ophthalmology residency didactics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ophthalmology residents (post-graduate years 2-4) from 11 institutions were invited to
      participate. Participating residents were taught esotropia and exotropia topics sequentially,
      randomized by order and classroom style (flipped classroom vs. traditional lecture) one to
      three weeks apart. Participants were assigned a pre-class video lecture prior to the flipped
      classroom in-class case-based activity. The traditional classroom included a preparatory
      reading assignment and an in-person lecture delivered by the same instructor. Participants
      completed three identical 5-question content assessments (pre-test, post-test, and 3-month
      retention) and opinion surveys following each classroom.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to complete both a written (Likert-scale) survey in the classroom and an additional online survey (Catalyst WebQ, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) following the classroom session. These surveys asked residents to rate their preference for traditional vs. flipped classroom format, the effectiveness of preparation and classroom material, and the advantages and disadvantages of the flipped classroom format</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge Acquisition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Before class), immediately after completing the class, 3 months after class</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were assessed a total of three times for each course (esotropia and exotropia): once prior to starting the class (pre-test), once immediately after completing the class (post-test), and once three months later. All assessments consisted of 5 OKAP style questions created by fellowship trained ophthalmologists. These test questions were previously piloted. Residents were allotted 5 minutes to complete each test.</description>

    <description>In the Flipped Classroom, participants form groups of 2-3 and are instructed to work together through clinical cases of the in-class case based activity, committing to group answers to the clinical questions before advancing to the next case. At the end of class, the faculty instructor facilitated a short interactive group discussion.</description>
