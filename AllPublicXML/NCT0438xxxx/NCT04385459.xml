    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR) with concomitant coronary artery
      disease (CAD) are known to have higher mortality rates compared to patients without CAD. This
      same phenomenom has not been clearly mapped in patients with CAD that goes through a
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A narrowing of the aortic valve, aortic stenosis, is a relatively common condition among the
      elderly. When the narrowing gets too severe, symptoms such as loss of breath, angina and
      fainting can occur, so called symptomatic aortic stenosis. Since the 60's, surgical aortic
      valve replacement (sAVR) has been the treatment of choice for severe aortic stenosis. A large
      setback of this method is that a third of these patients could not undergo the treatment due
      to too high surgical risk.

      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have steadily gained ground in the treatment
      of severe aortic valve stenosis during the last decade. The procedure, which is a minimal
      invasive type of surgery, introduces a new aortic valve through a catheter, usually
      transfemorally. Patients with an underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing sAVR is
      known to have higher mortality rates postoperatively. However, it is not clearly known how an
      underlying CAD affects the long term results after a TAVI-surgery. It is therefore our goal
      to contribute with the mapping of how a CAD affects the long term results for patients with a
      severe aortic valve stenosis that undergoes TAVI.
