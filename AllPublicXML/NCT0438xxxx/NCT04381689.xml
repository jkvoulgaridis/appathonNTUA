             the study period.

          -  Subject who had received immunosuppressant or immune modifying drug within the last 3
             months prior to administration of the study vaccine

          -  Subject who had previously received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products within
             the last 3 months prior to administration of the study vaccine, or is expecting to be

          -  Subject with other clinically significant medical or psychological condition who in
             the investigator's opinion would not be suitable for the study.
