  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized, double blind, Phase 2 trial for patients receiving
      transplants from 7 of 8 HLA matched donors, in which an extended dosing regimen of abatacept,
      and a short-term dosing regimen + placebo, when added to standard calcineurin inhibitor +
      methotrexate-based prophylaxis, will be compared for their ability to improve outcomes in
      patients with a minimum follow-up of one year post-transplant. All patients will receive 4
      doses of abatacept (Days -1, +5, +14, +28). Prior to the fifth dose, patients will be
      randomly assigned to the 4-dose abatacept arm and receive 4 doses of placebo or 8-dose
      abatacept arm and receive 4 more doses of abatacept. The primary endpoint of the study will
      be severe AGVHD-free, severe CGVHD-free, relapse-free survival (SGRFS). The study will end
      when the last patient has reached 2 years after transplant. Results will first be calculated
      and the study unblinded when the last patient has reached one year post-transplant.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be at least 2 years old and weigh 10 kg.

          2. Must have a willing unrelated adult donor (bone marrow or peripheral blood). Donors
             may have a single mismatch (i.e. be a 7/8) and this mismatch may be at the allele or
             antigen level; however, donors with allele level disparity should be given preference
             over those with antigen level disparity. Patients for whom a donor is available with
             disparity only in the host versus graft direction (because of recipient homozygosity),
             will not be eligible, since this mismatching does not increase the risk for GVHD.
             Centers may perform extended typing (e.g. DQB1 and DPB1) according to institutional
             practices and use these results in selecting donors; however, it is recommended that
             this extending typing be used only to select between donors who are equally well
             matched with the recipient at the A, B, C and DRB1.

          3. All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional
             guidelines.

          4. Must have a hematologic malignancy treatable by HCT (except for those stipulated below
             under study Exclusion Criteria), which is in remission by standard testing (no
             patients in relapse will be included).

               -  If the patient does not meet defined eligibility requirements, the PI/study
                  committee must be contacted to determine eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with the following hematologic malignancies will be excluded: Chronic
             Lymphocytic Leukemia, Myeloma and Primary Myelofibrosis.

          2. Relapse of their primary malignancy.

          3. For patients with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) with pre-transplant MRD testing
             performed as standard practice at the treating institution, patients with MRD &gt;0.01%
             will be ineligible.

          4. For patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with pre-transplant MRD testing as
             standard of practice at the treating institution, patients with any MRD status are
             eligible and should be enrolled at the discretion of provider.

          5. For patients with MDS, those with &gt;5% blasts will be excluded.

          6. Prior allogeneic HCT.

          7. Uncontrolled viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoal infection at the time of study
             enrollment.

          8. HIV infection.

          9. Serious psychiatric disease including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe
             depression.

         10. Prisoners or others who are compulsorily detained.

         11. Any patient with a known or suspected inherited predisposition to cancer should be
             discussed with the study team prior to screening for eligibility.

               1. Patients with a known inherited or constitutional predisposition to transplant
                  morbidities, including, but not limited to Fanconi Anemia, Dyskeratosis
                  Congenita, Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome and Down Syndrome will be excluded.

               2. Patients with known inherited or constitutional predisposition to non-hematologic
                  cancers including, but not limited to Li-Fraumeni syndrome, BRCA1 and BRCA2
                  mutations will be excluded.

               3. Patients with an inherited predisposition to leukemia or otherwise hematologic
                  malignancies that have not been associated with predisposition to transplant
                  morbidities or non-hematologic cancers will not be excluded.

         12. Patients with active non-hematological malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers)
             or those with non-hematological malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers) who
             have been rendered with no evidence of disease, and are disease free for &lt;2 years.

         13. Incompletely treated active tuberculosis Infection.

         14. Pregnancy (positive serum b-HCG) or breastfeeding.

         15. Estimated GFR of &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m2.

         16. Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 50 (using M-Mode if assessment is done by ECHO)

         17. T.bilirubin &gt; 2 × upper limit of normal or ALT &gt; 4 × upper limit of normal or
             unresolved veno-occlusive disease.

         18. Pulmonary disease with FVC, FEV1 or DLCO parameters &lt;45% predicted (corrected for
             hemoglobin) or requiring supplemental oxygen. Children who are developmentally unable
             to perform pulmonary function testing will be assessed solely on their need for
             supplemental oxygen.

         19. Karnofsky performance score or Lansky Play-Performance Scale score &lt;80

         20. Presence of antibodies to a mismatched donor HLA antigen (please refer to Section
             3.4.g).

         21. Patients who have developed severe AGVHD, severe CGVHD or relapse will be excluded at
             the time of randomization.
