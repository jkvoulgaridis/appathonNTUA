  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2A, single dose, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of a low-dose, 40-minute infusion into the veins (intravenous infusion or &quot;IV&quot;) of
      ketamine in children with ADNP syndrome (Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein). The
      study team will enroll 10 participants, ages 5 to 12, at Mount Sinai. The study participation
      is expected to last 4 weeks and will include 5 scheduled clinic visits in order to complete
      safety monitoring, clinical assessments, and biomarker collection. At the conclusion of this
      study, the study team expects to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of low-dose ketamine
      in children with ADNP syndrome. Additionally, the study team anticipates identifying
      meaningful signals of efficacy in clinical outcome measures using RNA and DNA sequencing to
      analyze ADNP protein expression and DNA methylation profiles, a natural process by which
      methyl groups are added to the DNA to change its activity, in order to assess sensitivity to
      change with low-dose ketamine treatment and inform future phase 3 studies. Ketamine is not
      currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat this syndrome, but it is
      approved for use in children in other situations, for example in anesthesia.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scale at weeks 1, 2, and 4 compared to baseline. The Systematic Longitudinal Assessment of Adverse Events (SLAES) is a comprehensive form that assesses medical and behavioral conditions that were present at screening and/or baseline. Conditions are considered treatment emergent if their severity increased significantly after the participant had taken at least one dose of the study treatment. Treatment emergent adverse events will be tracked considered in the adverse event safety analysis. Severity of adverse events are categorized as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or resulting in death and the treating physician indicates if the adverse event was related or unrelated to study drug.</description>
