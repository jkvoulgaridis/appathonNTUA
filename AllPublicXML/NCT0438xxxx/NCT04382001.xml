  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, women will be required to wear a chest heart rate monitor and wrist heart rate
      monitor daily and collect daily early morning urine samples for the duration of one complete
      menstrual cycle. This will enable comparisons between data collected from the heart rate
      monitor and hormone analysis in urine samples to be made.

      This study is a prospective observational study of women's heart rate and heart rate
      variability throughout one complete menstrual cycle. A minimum of 10 volunteers aged 18 years
      of age or over will be recruited via a variety of methods according to the criteria detailed
      in section 9. They will be required to wear a chest heart rate monitor and wrist heart rate
      monitor for 1 hour each day, and throughout the night for one menstrual cycle. In addition, a
      daily early morning urine sample will be collected throughout the study.

      Urine samples will be returned to SPD on a regular basis for measurement of urinary hormones
      related to pregnancy and fertility. Data collected via the monitors including heart rate and
      heart rate variability will be downloaded for comparison.
