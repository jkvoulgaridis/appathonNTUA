      In this study, subjects with spontaneous or tuberous sclerosis complex associated
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) who have not been started on therapy with mTOR inhibitors such
      as sirolimus or everolimus to undergo a PET/CT scan using an novel PET tracer that may better
      evaluate disease activity in LAM subjects both before and after the initiation of mTOR
      inhibitor therapy will be enrolled. The procedure for each scan will be similar, involving
      one administration of the novel tracer C11-glutamine followed by a whole body PET/CT scan.

      Objectives This is a hypothesis-driven prospective pilot study of the targeted PET reagent
      11C-Glutamine in LAM.

      The objective is to test the hypothesis that 11C-Glutamine PET/CT will demonstrate uptake
      within the lungs and/or associated neoplasm of patients with LAM and that this effect will be
      modified by treatment with mTOR inhibitors.

      Rationale Our rationale is that 11C-Glutamine PET/CT may provide an improved ability to
      diagnose LAM, as well as predict and monitor treatment response to mTOR inhibitors.

      Aims Test the hypothesis that 11C-Gln PET imaging of the lungs in humans will reflect the
      known &quot;glutamine addiction&quot; seen in mechanistic preclinical studies of LAM. As a result, PET
      imaging will show increased tracer uptake in affected areas of diseased lungs and will show
      reduced uptake after initiating treatment with mTOR inhibitors.

      Approach: We will evaluate 11C-Glutamine PET/CT uptake in patients with known LAM, and if
      possible, we will test subjects again after 8 weeks of mTOR inhibitor therapy (either
      sirolimus or everolimus).

    <description>While these imaging techniques have not been used in normal populations, the pulmonary uptake of patients with known intraabdominal malignancy will serve as control for evaluation of any potential uptake. When comparing treatment effects, each patient can serve as their own control as they will have already had imaging completed prior to the initiation of therapy. VEGF-D levels will be collected from clinical laboratory assessment or will be collected at time of enrollment, and relative elevation of VEGF-D will be compared to the relative uptake of tracer within the pulmonary parenchyma of each individual patient.</description>
