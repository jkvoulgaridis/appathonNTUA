  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' disease is the main cause of hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease has a prevalence of
      0.5% in the general population. As a non-surgical treatment, antithyroid drug (ATD) and
      radioactive iodine treatment have been proposed and ATD is the first-line treatment in Korea.
      However, ATD has a rare but fatal side effect of agranulocytosis. Furthermore only half of
      its users maintain long-term remission and frequent recurrence is a problem to this disease.
      Therefore it is essential to distinguish between patients who respond well to ATD and those
      who resist it. The aim of this study is to verify the changes in gut microbiome in Graves'
      disease patients before and after six-month treatment with ATD. Patients first diagnosed with
      Graves' disease will participate in the study. The study design is a prospective longitudinal
      trial. The patients are asked to have their gut microbiome analyzed before and after the
      treatment of Graves' disease with ATD. Primary endpoint is the changes of analyzed gut
      microbiome before and after ATD treatment. Secondary outcome is to find species that can be
      used as a biomarker to differentiate the patients refractory to ATD.
