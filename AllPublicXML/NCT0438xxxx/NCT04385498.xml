  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) randomized pilot feasibility trial (n=40) to
      refine the the Brief Relaxation, Education and Trauma Healing (BREATHE) Ethiopia intervention
      and explore effectiveness and implementation. Fifty patients will be enrolled across the
      pre-pilot and the pilot to account for potential treatment dropout.

        1. Primary outcomes: Change in hypothesized treatment mechanisms: (1) increased knowledge
           about PTSD; reductions in (2) PTSD-related stigma; (3) trauma-related cognitions; and
           (4) self-reported arousal; (5) increased use of stress management strategies; and (6)
           reductions in physiological arousal as measured by increased heart rate variability.

        2. Secondary outcomes: Change in symptoms and functional impairment. Reductions in (1) PTSD
           (2) depression and anxiety symptoms, and (3) functional impairment.

        3. Process evaluation: Mixed methods multi-stakeholder process evaluation of the
           implementation of the intervention as measured by the RE-AIM framework (Reach,
           Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance). We will collect qualitative data
           on Adoption and Implementation (e.g. facilitators and barriers to intervention delivery)
           and quantitative assessment of patient and provider participation and retention (Reach),
           satisfaction (Adoption) and fidelity (Implementation).
