  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There was no evidence to suggest that a shortened fluid fast results in an increased risk of
      aspiration, regurgitation or related morbidity compared with the standard 'nil by mouth from
      midnight' fasting policy. However, there is no available data regarding the safety and
      efficacy of fasting approach in patients undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device
      (CIED) procedures. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that a non-fasting protocol is
      non-inferior in regard to safety to a fasting protocol (current practice) in patients
      undergoing cardiac device implantation procedures
