      A phase 1/2, open-label, study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of APR-246 in
      combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with solid tumor malignancies. The study will
      include a safety lead-in portion followed by a phase 2 expansion portion in specific disease

      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      APR-246 (eprenetapopt) in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with solid tumor
      malignancies. In the safety lead-in part of study (phase 1), the safety and the recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of APR-246 will be investigated.

      In the expansion part of the study (phase 2), both safety and efficacy for the combination
      therapy will be investigated in the 3 cohorts.
