    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of DS3201 when given together with
      and ipilimumab for the treatment of patients with prostate, urothelial, or renal cell cancer
      that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). DS3201 may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving DS3201 and ipilimumab
      may help to control the disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and confirm the safety and tolerability of
      valemetostat (DS3201) given in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic
      aggressive variant prostate cancers (AVPC), urothelial carcinomas (UC) and renal clear cell
      carcinomas (RCC).

      II. To screen for associations between changes in the tumor microenvironment and clinical
      outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the immunologic and molecular effects on tissue samples of participants treated
      with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and RCC.

      II. To estimate the time to treatment failure (TTF) of patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and
      RCC treated with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab.

      III. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and RCC
      treated with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab (in patients with AVPC ORR will be
      reported separately for prostate specific antigen [PSA], circulating tumor cells [CTC] and
      measurable and non-measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      [RECIST] 1.1).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of valemetostat.

      Patients receive valemetostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and ipilimumab
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1 and 3. Cycles repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 and 60 days after the last
      valemetostat dose and/or 100 days after the last ipilimumab dose and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

                  abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study

                  bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute myocardial infarction, ST-T
                  interval changes suggestive of active myocardial ischemia, second- or
                  third-degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or
                  tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is &gt; 470 msec, this
                  interval should be rate-corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting
                  Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) should be used for decision making and
                  reporting. If QTc exceeds 470 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be
                  repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used
                  to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be
                  over read by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding
                  participants. Cases must be discussed in detail with the principal investigator

             the presence of a positive HCV Ab, HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels will be
