    <textblock>
      This is a cross-over, open-label, single-group study. The study subjects were children 12
      months to 12 years of age who will be vaccinated with a single dose. The duration of
      follow-up for safety evaluation and immunogenicity (on a small group) is 6 weeks (+ 2 weeks).

      The main target:

      • Evaluating the safety of live attenuated Varicella vaccine [Oka / SK], lyophilized powder
      and solvent for subcutaneous injection (SKYVaricella inj.) in healthy Vietnamese children
      from 12 months to 12 years, with a single injection.

      Secondary target:

      • Assess the immunogenicity of live attenuated Varicella vaccine [Oka / SK], lyophilized
      powder and solvent for subcutaneous injection (SKYVaricella inj.) in a small group of healthy
      Vietnamese children from 12 months to 12 years, with a single injection.

      The Safety of Skyvaricella Injection:

        -  The incidence of a chickenpox-like local rash (injection site) or chickenpox-like rash
           (disseminated) between 1 and 6 weeks after vaccination

        -  The incidence and severity of events (local and systemic) within 30 minutes after
           vaccination

        -  The incidence of expected systemic and local adverse events within 7 days after
           vaccination

        -  The incidence of serious adverse events and Unexpected adverse events within 6 weeks
           after vaccination The Immunogenicity of Skyvaricella Injection: seroconversion rate by
           Fluorescent antibody to membrane antigens (FAMA) test 6 weeks after investigational
           vaccination
