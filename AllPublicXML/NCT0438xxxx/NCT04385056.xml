      Investigate the safety and tolerability of umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem
      cells to treat patients with Bradykinesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the pathophysiological changes that result in the symptoms of bradykinesia are poorly
      understood, an inflammatory component appears to be involved. Human umbilical cord-derived
      allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have documented anti-inflammatory properties, which suggest
      these cells may be effective at treating Bradykinesia. It is understood that perinatal
      products are potent immune modulators. It is believed that the positive symptomatic effects
      are secondary to the modulation of the immune system, and specifically the reduction in
      pathological inflammation. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells to treat patients with Bradykinesia.
