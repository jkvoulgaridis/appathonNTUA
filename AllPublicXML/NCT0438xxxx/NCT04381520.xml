      Heat-sensitive moxibustion is considered to be effective for primary hypertension in hospital
      setting. This study aims to investigate whether heat-sensitive moxibustion
      self-administration is effective for lowering blood pressure and improving quality of life
      for patients with primary hypertension in community setting using a multicenter, prospective,
      non-randomized study design

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hypertension is a global health issue with high incidence; it affected approximately
      1.13 billion people worldwide and directly or indirectly causing an 10.4 million of death
      yearly. The routine drugs for primary hypertension are limited by adverse effects and
      expensive costs. Therefore, complementary and alternative medicine with good efficacy and
      safety and low expenditure is still needed for primary hypertension, especially in
      poverty-stricken areas.

      Heat-sensitive moxibustion is an innovative therapy developed on the basis of traditional
      moxibustion. Compared with traditional moxibustion, heat-sensitive moxibustion advocates
      finding heat-sensitive acupoints where patients have special reactions to moxibustion heat,
      including diathermy, heat transfer, soreness, etc. The application of moxibustion on
      heat-sensitive acupoints (i.e., heat-sensitive moxibustion) has been shown to be more
      effective to traditional moxibustion for many diseases, including primary hypertension.
      Moreover, compared with acupuncture, heat-sensitive moxibustion has a main advantage that
      moxibustion does not require professional qualifications and patients can self-administer
      moxibustion after professional training. However, the current evidence is generated only from
      hospital settings. Therefore, this study is specifically designed to investigate whether
      heat-sensitive moxibustion self-administration is an effective intervention for lowering
      blood pressure and improving quality of life for patients with primary hypertension in
      community setting.
