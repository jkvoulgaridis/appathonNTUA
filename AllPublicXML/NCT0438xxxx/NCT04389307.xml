  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom complex defined as urgency, with or without urge
      urinary incontinence (UUI), usually with frequency and nocturia, in the absence of urinary
      tract infection (1). Currently, a wide range of therapeutic options exist for the treatment
      of OAB. These include first‐line conservative (physical) therapies which focus on electrical
      stimulation (ES) and behavioral therapies such as lifestyle modifications, bladder training
      (BT), pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback, second‐line therapies which
      are pharmacologic, and third‐line therapies which either neuromodulate or chemodenervate the
      bladder (1-5).

      ES is one of the techniques used in urogynecological physiotherapy, which uses implanted or
      non-implanted electrodes. Depending on how electrodes are applied, a differentiation is made
      between transcutaneous ES (via suprapubic attachment of electrodes, vaginal/anal plug
      electrodes, etc.) and percutaneous ES (of the tibial nerve, electroacupuncture, etc.) (23).
      Intravaginal ES (IVES) is a conservative treatment option, described more than 40 years ago.
      Cure and clinical improvement rates vary between 60% and 80%, and no harmful side effects
      have ever occurred (6). Being a conservative treatment, IVES is often recommended in cases of
      mild or moderate cases of UUI and OAB, for detrusor inhibition. It has been suggested that ES
      probably targets the detrusor muscle or pelvic floor muscle or afferent innervation in UUI
      (7,8). There is controversy in the scientific literature regarding its effectiveness as
      monotherapy (23). According to the Europian Association Urology (EAU) Guidelines; in adults
      with urinary incontinence, IVES may improve urinary incontinence compared to sham treatment.
      Despite that, there is no IVES among the EAU recommendations in patients with OAB or UUI due
      to insufficient data (2). At this stage, studies are needed to determine whether it will be
      effective to use IVES in combination with other conservative treatment options.

      In clinical practice, BT and IVES are frequently used together in the treatment of women with
      OAB, but the evidences/results of the combined (BT+IVES) use of these two treatment options
      are so rare that they can be neglected in the literature. Up to our knowledge, there is only
      one study including BT+ES treatment arm (one of the four treatment arms) in women with
      idiopathic OAB in the literature (9). In Berghmans et al's study, BT+ES was not found to be
      effective both from BT alone and from the untreated control group. While interpreting the
      results of this study, it should be take into consideration that patients treated received
      relatively few treatment sessions (nine treatment sessions, once weekly) in this study. In
      addition, in the light of our clinical experience, we think that this issue is still open for
      research. Moreover, there is no recommendation on conservative combinations in the guidelines
      due to insufficient data.

      Our study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial that compares the efficacy of
      BT and BT plus IVES in women with idiopathic OAB. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
      efficacy of BT with and without IVES on incontinence-related QoL and clinical parameters in
      women with idiopathic OAB.
