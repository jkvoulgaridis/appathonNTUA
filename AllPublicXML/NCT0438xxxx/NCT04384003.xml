  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Football is an increasingly popular exercise and common practice in adolescent and elite
      athletes. However, these athletes tend to have injuries involving the lower extremity and
      foot. Recent literature has proposed a promising concept of core stability on the arch of the
      foot and proximal hip control exercise for a knee injury. They have highlighted that foot
      core training begins with targeting the plantar intrinsic muscles through exercise
      intervention, which may enhance the capacity and control of the foot core system. Moreover,
      it is hypothesized that the 'complexity algorithm' of exercise intervention for proximal hip
      control may provide more sufficient effects in musculoskeletal pain in the lower extremity.
      However, some conflicting issues such as assessment and training of foot intrinsic muscle in
      functional positions are still largely lack of device and research to elucidate the
      underlying mechanism of its development and integrated exercise interventions proximally and
      distally on these athletes.

      Firstly, the investigators aim to design and development of novel intrinsic foot muscle
      assessment and training device in sporting tasks and to examine feasibility and reliability
      of muscle stiffness in foot and hip joint before and after exercise intervention using shear
      wave ultrasound elastography (SWUE) in athletes without and with foot and ankle overuse
      injuries; second, investigators will investigate whether immediate and persistent alteration
      after the integrated therapeutic exercise on motor control and muscle stiffness.

    <description>Electromyographic activity (EMG) of AbdH, TA, PL, SO, gluteus medius (Glut Med) and gluteus maximus (Glut Max) will be recorded bilaterally using pairs of surface electrodes. Motor coordination of these muscles will be evaluated through assessment of temporal and spatial parameters of EMG during functional tasks such as kicking in one leg standing. The primary outcome measure will be percentage of EMG relative to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) on the same side. In order to remove the potential for investigator bias, all data will be presented individually without identification of the muscle, order of trials or whether the trials precede or follow the intervention.</description>
