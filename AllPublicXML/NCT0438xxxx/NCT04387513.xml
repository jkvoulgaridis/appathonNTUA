  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical delay in severe endocardits, with neurological complications, is still debated.
      Early surgery, if indicated, permits to avoid new embolic events, or to fix valvular damages,
      but can create or increase a cerebral hemorrage.

      Hypothesis Cardiac surgery, as soon as possible, if indicated, would reduce mortality, in
      severe left endocarditis, with neurological complications.

      Primary objective To assess the impact of early versus late cardiac surgery on mortality at 1
      year, in patients with severe endocarditis, with neurological complications.

      Primary endpoint:

      1) Mortality at 1 year

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Analyze the factors associated with neurological degradation

        2. Evaluate the neurological tolerance of cardiac surgery.
