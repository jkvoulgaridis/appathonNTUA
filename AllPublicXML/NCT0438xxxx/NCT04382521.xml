  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      efficacy of an adaptive text message intervention (TMI) to promote well-being and health
      behavior adherence in 60 patients with two or more cardiac risk conditions (hypertension,
      type 2 diabetes, or hyperlipidemia).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an adaptive text message intervention (TMI) that uses
      participant feedback for individual messages and progress towards health goals to deliver
      increasingly personalized positive psychology (PP) and health behavior text messages over
      time. The investigators aim to examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      efficacy in a randomized, controlled pilot trial in 60 adults with two or more cardiac risk
      conditions (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or hyperlipidemia).

    <description>This is an 18-item instrument that measures three dimensions of locus of control. It assesses people's beliefs that their health is or is not determined by their own behavior. The survey has three subscales: internality of health locus of control, powerful other locus of control, and chance locus of control. All items are measured on a 6-point Likert scale, and our main subscale of interest will be internal locus of control, which will be a sum of scores from questions 1,6,8,12,13,17 (range: 6-36). Higher scores indicate higher locus of control.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a three component intervention consisting of (1) daily, adaptive text messages related to Positive Psychology or health behaviors, (2) twice weekly text messages related to a specific health behavior goal, and (3) three brief check-ins (at baseline, week 4, and week 8 of the intervention) with a study staff member to discuss progress towards health behavior goals. During the brief check-ins, the study staff member will inquire about: (1) medical conditions, (2) adherence gaps, (3) personal health goals (including weight goals), (4) motivation, self-efficacy, and barriers to reaching health goals, (5) preferred activity types (e.g., walking), and (6) sources of sedentary time (e.g., computer, TV). This information will be added to the algorithm for each individual and we will deliver tailored daily text messages for our participants.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiac risk conditions. Participants will have two or more of hypertension, type-2
             diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Patients will have met 2+ of 2017 AHA-ACC criteria for
             hypertension (SBP ≥130, DBP ≥80), 2018 ADA criteria for type-2 diabetes (e.g., A1C
             ≥6.5%), and 2013 AHA-ACC criteria for hyperlipidemia (e.g., LDL cholesterol ≥190), via
             medical record review, with confirmation by healthcare providers as needed.

          -  Low physical activity or elevated sedentary leisure time (SLT). Low activity will be
             defined as ≤75 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA), representing ≤50%
             of recommended MVPA, and elevated SLT will be ≥120 min/day, which is linked to adverse
             medical health. As initial screens for both MVPA and SLT, we will use the
             International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Patients reporting ≤75 min/week
             of MVPA or ≥120 min/day of SLT will wear accelerometers for 10 days to confirm low
             MVPA/high SLT (patients will indicate their leisure time hours to allow assessment of
             SLT during those hours).

          -  Suboptimal diet. Participants must also report either fewer than 5 daily servings of
             fruit/vegetables (measured by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System's [BRFSS]
             Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Module) or have a score of ≥70 on the MEDFICTS scale
             for fat/cholesterol intake, representing high risk. We will require diet and activity
             deficits to ensure that a broad range of messages will be relevant to every
             participant as we explore the utility of individual messages and patterns of message
             selection in this initial study.

          -  Ability to receive text messages. Participants must have a cellular phone that
             receives texts and that they use at least daily. We will remunerate them the cost of
             receiving the messages as needed.

          -  Ability to read in English or Spanish. Text messages will be available in English and
             Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Existing coronary artery disease (CAD; diagnosed via cardiac catheterization using
             standard coronary artery stenosis definitions or prior ACS).

          -  An unrelated condition limiting physical activity.

          -  Participation in programs focused on cardiac prevention or well-being (e.g., cardiac
             rehabilitation).

          -  A cognitive disturbance precluding participation or informed consent, assessed using a
             six-item screen designed to assess suitability for research participation.
