  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SNG001 is an inhaled drug that contains a antiviral protein called interferon beta (IFN-β).
      IFN-β in produced in the lungs during viral lung infections. It has been shown that older
      people and people with some chronic diseases have an IFN-β deficiency. Many viruses inhibit
      IFN-β as part of their strategy to evade the immune system.

      Addition of IFN-β in vitro protects lung cells from viral infection. IFN-β protects cells
      against the MERS and SARS coronaviruses (close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
      COVID-19).

      SNG001 is an inhaled formulation of interferon beta-1a it is currently in Phase II clinical
      trials for COPD patients.

      Synairgen has conducted randomised placebo controlled clinical trials of SNG001 involving
      &gt;200 asthma and COPD patients. These trials have shown that SNG001 has:

        -  been well tolerated during virus infections

        -  enhanced antiviral activity in the lungs (measured in sputum and blood samples)

        -  provided significant lung function benefit over placebo in asthma in two Phase II
           trials.

      Synairgen believes SNG001 could help prevent worsening or accelerate recovery of severe lower
      respiratory tract illness in COVID-19 patients.

      Patients who are in hospital or non-hospitalised but are a high risk groups (e.g. elderly or
      diabetics) will be invited to take part in the trial. The patient would receive either SNG001
      or placebo once daily for 14 days. The severity of the patients condition would be recorded
      on a scale developed by the World Health Organisation and the patient would be asked
      questions about their breathlessness, cough and sputum every day, as well as assess their
      general medical condition and safety.

      If SNG001 proves to be beneficial it would be a major breakthrough for the treatment of
      COVID-19.
