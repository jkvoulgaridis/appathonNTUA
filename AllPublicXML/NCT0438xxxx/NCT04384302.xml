  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed protocol is going to study the importance of wide spread of visual functions
      defined by but not limited to visual perception, visual function, visual exploration,
      involved in the performance of beach tennis. The investigators intend to examine the basic
      and important visual function that are required for the better performance in the field. The
      aim is to assess the efficacy of general training that uses the visual channel as the main
      one. The investigators suspects the improvement in the visual and motor skills after a
      predefined 8 weeks of visual training.

Each visual training will last for 15 minutes and should be performed by the participant in their home (using the telemedicine devices to control the conduction of each exercise) 3 times a week.</description>
