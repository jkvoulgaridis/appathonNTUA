  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the short term effects (12 Weeks) of
      Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) on Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the extent to which L. plantarum PS128 can improve symptoms
      in PD patients. L. plantarum PS128 is a psychobiotic that regulates the level of dopamine in
      specific brain regions. Patients with PD will receive PS128 treatment for 12 weeks. Symptoms
      of PD will be clinically evaluated before and after the treatment, and the results will be
      compared.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12 assessed on medication</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS scores is a rating tool used to gauge the course of Parkinson's disease in patients. The minimum total score possible is 0 and the maximum total score possible is 199. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRSIII)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12 assessed both off and on medications</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS III scores is subscores of UPDRS, it indicates motor function of PD symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient &quot;ON-OFF&quot; diary recording</measure>
    <time_frame>Record for 3 consecutive days prior to Baseline and Week 12 visits by patient-self</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;ON-OFF&quot; motor fluctuations are rapid changes in mobility during which PD patients report sudden shifts from adequate mobility to mobility, usually within a few seconds or minutes. The 24-hour diary is divided into 30-minute sections and only mark one answer for each half hour period. It is to know how much time each patient spends in the different Parkinson's states.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Nonmotor Symptoms: 30-item Screening Questionnaire (NMS-Quest) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12 assessed on Medication</time_frame>
    <description>NMS-Quest is a 30-item Screening tool for non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The minimum total score possible is 0 and the maximum total score possible is 30. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 assessed on Medication</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC consists of one item taken from the clinical global impression and adapted to the patient. The minimum total score possible is 1 and the maximum total score possible is 7. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
