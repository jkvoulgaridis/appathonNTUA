  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury occurs in up to 30% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Cardiac
      surgery associated-acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is characterized by a sudden and sustained
      decrease in renal function with insufficient elimination waste products. The problem is that
      postoperative diagnosis of CSA-AKI is delayed because it relies solely upon the slow and
      unreliable rise in serum creatinine (SCr) levels that may lead to delayed start in treatment
      and increased risk of adverse outcomes. We hypothesize that Matrix Metalloproteins (MMPs) -2,
      -9 and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) are associated with and earlier
      detectors of CSA-AKI compared to levels of SCr.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), although essential to the performance of most cardiac
      operations, has been shown to cause injury to other organs, particularly to the kidneys and
      brain. Matrix Metalloproteins (MMPs) are ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes that degrade
      extracellular matrix and have been shown to be involved in injury to transplant kidneys. To
      date, no interventions are available to decrease the risk of cardiac surgery associated-acute
      kidney injury (CSA-AKI).

      NGAL is a known indicator of injury to kidney, thus making it a promising biomarker for
      CSA-AKI. It may be that a single biomarker will not be sensitive and specific across the
      spectrum of CSA-AKI. This research investigates MMP-2, -9 and Neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and their association with and earlier detection of
      CSA-AKI compared to levels of SCr.

      We hypothesize that increased activity of MMPs are associated with CSA-AKI. Furthermore,
      MMP-2 and/ or -9 may be predictors and/ or biomarkers for the early detection of CSA-AKI
      compared to serum levels of creatinine.
