  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of Quad Shot radiation therapy using 2 different treatment
      schedules to find out what effects, if any, this treatment has on people with advanced NSCLC
      who are receiving systemic therapy for their cancer. The Quad Shot treatment schedule reduces
      the number of days needed to deliver the radiation treatments, which may be less disruptive
      to systemic therapy schedules.

    <description>In this trial, patients with centrally located lung tumors will be treated with up to 3 cycles of Quad Shot Radiation. Radiation treatment will be given within 1 week of administration of chemotherapy. Quad Shot radiation will involve: 3.7 Gy twice daily x 2 days for a total dose of 14.8 Gy per cycle. The next cycle will occur after a 21-28 day break. The first group of patients will be treated with 2 cycles of quad shot radiation, followed by a 3-month observation period post-RT to allow a complete evaluation of acute toxicity. The next group of patients will be treated with either 1 cycle or 3 cycles of quad shot radiation. The minimum accrual is 4 patients with an expected accrual of 16 patients. Twenty additional patients will be recruited to an expansion cohort.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer with metastatic disease detected
             on cross-sectional imaging with a plan for one of the following systemic therapies:

               -  Carboplatin/paclitaxel

               -  Carboplatin/paclitaxel/pembrolizumab

               -  Carboplatin/pemetrexed

               -  Carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab

               -  Cisplatin/pemetrexed

               -  Cisplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab

          -  Patients eligible for the systemic therapy regimens notes

          -  Patients with Stage IV NSCLC who have symptomatic (defined by patient-reported cough,
             dyspnea, or hemoptysis) or near-symptomatic (determined radiographically to be
             threatening the airway, esophagus or vasculature) centrally located.

          -  KPS ≥ 60

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients at reproductive potential must agree to practice an effective contraceptive
             method.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment site that precludes developing a
             treatment plan that respects normal tissue tolerances.

          -  Serious medical co-morbidities precluding radiotherapy.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
