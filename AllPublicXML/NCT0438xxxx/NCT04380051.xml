  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attachment is built primarily on the first interactions of the first 9 months of a baby's
      life. These first interactions and their effects of stress, pleasure and displeasure are
      retained to establish some of the baby's attachment behaviours and future relationships with
      others.

      Extreme prematurity strongly modify these first interactions between parents and child. Very
      preterm child is separated from his parents and is placed in a stressful, technical and
      potentially painful environment.

      Early interventions stimulate neuroplasticity and can positively affect the neurological
      development of very preterm infant. Tactile stimuli such as skin-to-skin contact and massages
      carried out by parents can be pleasant experiences that can support early interactions
      between parents and child.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate impact of a sensory-tonic stimulation on development of
      parent-infant interaction and on social cognition in very premature children.

    <description>Two free play sequences of 15 minutes will be filmed. The Coding Interactive Behavior (CIB; Feldman, 1998) contains 43 items (22 relating to parents, 16 relating to child and 5 related to parent-child dyad. Each item is rated from 1 (a little) to 5 (a lot). The Coding Interactive Behavior has 6 dimensions. The dimension &quot;social commitment of the child&quot; will be the primary outcome for this study.</description>
