  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common problem with haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and arterio-venous
      grafts (AVG) is stenosis, which can lead to inadequate dialysis, and eventual access
      thrombosis. Conventional plain old balloon angioplasty is associate with high recurrence
      rates of stenosis and repeated interventions. The advent of successful drug-eluting
      technology in the treatment of the coronary vascular bed and subsequent positive accumulating
      evidence in the peripheral arterial circulation has prompted the use of drug coated balloons
      (DCB) in the access fistula circuit for venous stenosis and in-stent restenosis. Recent
      studies suggest that DCBs may significantly reduce re-intervention rates on native and
      recurrent lesions. The restenosis process is in part or in whole the result of neo-intimal
      hyperplasia (NIH) and NIH is considered the main culprit in access circuit target lesion
      stenosis. NIH is the blood vessel's healing response to the barotrauma from the angioplasty
      process. A critical component of NIH is the cellular proliferative stage with mononuclear
      leucocytes identified as the primary inflammatory cell type involved. The rationale for drug
      elution is to block the NIH response with an anti-metabolite such as paclitaxel. It is
      important to emphasize that the role of drug elution in the treatment of vascular stenosis is
      not to obtain a good haemodynamic and luminal result but to preserve a good result obtained
      during POBA from later restenosis due to NIH and minimise reinterventions and readmissions to
      hospital for what is a frail population of patients.

      A meta-analysis performed by Khawaja et al. seemed to suggest that DCBs conferred some
      benefit in terms of improving target lesion primary patency (TLPP) in AVFs. An updated
      meta-analysis performed by our own institution recently showed that DCB appears to be a
      better and safe alternative to conventional balloon angioplasty (CBA) in treating patients
      with HD stenosis based on 6- and 12-months primary patency and increased intervention free
      period.

      The Passeo-18 Lux (Biotronik Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (Singapore)) drug-coated balloon (DCB) is
      packaged with a low dose of paclitaxel. Recent studies have shown that low dose coating of
      paclitaxel with this DCB is useful for preventing restenosis, decrease lumen loss and target
      lesion revascularization in the peripheral vasculature6 but has not been tested in the
      dialysis access circuit.
