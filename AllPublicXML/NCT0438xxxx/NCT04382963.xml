      This project will develop a &quot;Stroke Awareness Team&quot; including training of Oneida Health
      Service Coaches working in partnership with the UW team for a population-based health
      awareness program. This team will develop a series of Oneida Nation Healthy Living and Stroke
      Awareness Events (from now on health events) to provide education as to the severity of the
      problem as well as our standard therapies for lifestyle change and risk factor avoidance.
      This will include education of the healthy members of the tribe including the children to
      identify signs of stroke and TIA in their elders as well as to develop healthy lifestyles at
      the earliest of ages to influence the elders to modify their risks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 100 high risk tribe members and 20 low stroke risk tribe members. Each
      of these will be further studied for their atherosclerotic load by ultrasound assessments
      (noting plaque presence, plaque area and measurements of plaque stability or instability
      during pulsation [carotid strain imaging] of the carotid and vertebral arterial systems.
      Enrolled participants will also receive assessment of stroke-related vascular cognitive
      decline, serum analysis for glucose, cholesterol, microRNA and key proteins felt to be
      biomarkers of stroke.

      These high risk participants will be divided into two groups, stratified by gender, age,
      history of cerebrovascular events, and the presence or absence of atherosclerosis in their
      carotid bifurcation including equal numbers of participants that in spite of high risk, have
      not yet deposited plaque.

      One group will receive advice about standard therapy and information as to a health awareness
      and the risk factor guidelines. Study team physicians will provide advice about standard
      therapy based on participant risk factors. Health awareness and risk factor guidelines refer
      to AHA educational materials; these educational documents will be provided to participants,
      if relevant. These educational materials address topics such as cooking healthfully,
      improving cholesterol levels, the impact of cholesterol on risk, the importance of physical
      activity, reducing high blood pressure, and the effects of smoking. These tools provide
      information on the health effects of a medical condition or habit, and then provide tips on
      how to improve health. For example, the &quot;How Can I Reduce High Blood Pressure?&quot; educational
      document, first provides readers with information on what health conditions high blood
      pressure can cause, and then provides steps on how to reduce high blood pressure. These steps
      include advice on how to lose weight, limit sodium, and limit alcohol. These documents will
      be provided based on physician assessment of participant Stroke Risk Quiz. Participants can
      take these educational documents and their Stroke Risk Quiz results to their PCPs. If there
      are incidental findings during examination, these will be communicated in writing by the
      study team physicians. A letter will be provided to the participant as well as their PCP if
      indicated in their consent form.

      The other group will receive the same plus intensive initiation of the American Heart
      Association Guidelines for Management of Risk Factors with quarterly group and weekly,
      individual face-to-face coaching meetings on lifestyle change and adherence to treatment. A
      subset of 10 participants in the intensive intervention group will also undergo an annual
      reassessment at the Year 1 timepoints, including health assessment, health history, carotid
      ultrasound, cognitive testing, and continued coaching. These participants will be selected
      based on their carotid strain values. Low risk participants (Group 3) will undergo the same
      study events as Group 2, except without receiving advice about eliminating stroke risk
      factors.

      At the end of 2-year follow-up, all groups will be reassessed for adherence to the program,
      atherosclerotic plaque progression or regression and its stability, serum biomarker response
      to therapy interventions, successful risk factor modification, vascular cognitive decline and
      incidence of stroke and TIA. Intention to treat analysis will estimate the efficacy of health
      coaching and will use G-estimation to correct for issues of non-compliance and
      discontinuation. Groups will be compared for change in both risk factors and outcomes.

      Intensive intervention coaching sessions will occur at least quarterly. Health coaches will
      contact participants weekly to check-in on the status of goals and provide support. Health
      coaches will contact participants using the manner most appropriate for each individual
      (phone, email, or in-person). The aim is to plan health coaching sessions as often as
      necessary in order to help participants meet the goals that they set at the beginning of the
      study. For some individuals, meeting goals may require weekly coaching sessions. For other
      individuals, it may require less coaching. Ideally, subjects will be interacting with the
      same coach throughout their participation. However, in the event of vacation, illness, or
      other circumstances, the other health coach may reach out to participants to check-in or may
      conduct coaching sessions.

    <ipd_description>Following transparency and reproducibility guidelines (NIH NOT-OD-15-103), the data resulting from this research proposal will be made publicly available. This will help ensure that other researchers are able to reproduce and/or extend our findings, and will enhance the scientific rigor of this proposal. Data will be made available for download to any individual or organization who requests data and abides by a data-sharing agreement that will be developed. This agreement will require that the data be used solely for research, that individuals or organizations secure the data using conventional electronic safeguards, and that once data analysis is complete, the data be destroyed. In general, data acquired in this study will be made available publicly after initial key manuscripts have been accepted for publication. Manuscripts will include relevant methodological details to allow for reproducibility by other researchers and the ability to extend or findings.</ipd_description>
