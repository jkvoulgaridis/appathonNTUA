          2. Confirmed diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with HCV genotype 2 infection. Chronicity is
             defined as having proven clinical evidence of chronic hepatitis, e.g. a duration of
             disease longer than 24 weeks before dosing, OR positive for anti-HCV antibody and HCV
             RNA at screening with biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis C, OR fibrosis.

          3. Compensated liver disease defined by normal or elevated ALT ≤10 x ULN, total bilirubin
             level &lt;2 mg/dL (except in Gilbert's syndrome), normal albumin, normal INR (INR ≤1.5)

          4. Interferon treatment naïve: never received any interferon.

          5. No other known form of chronic liver disease apart from chronic hepatitis C infection.
