  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of intratracheal tube-induced laryngeal irritation, including coughing,
      bucking, and cardiovascular stimulation, on emergence from general anesthesia has been
      reported to occur in 38% and 96% of cases. This may cause agitation and unstable hemodynamics
      during anesthesia recovery, and can lead to complications, such as laryngeal edema, sore
      throat, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and anastomotic bleeding. Accordingly, many
      anesthesiologists have been seeking methods through which such laryngeal irritation can be
      attenuated, thus allowing for a smoother extubation. Furthermore, it has contributed to the
      aggravation of cough reflexes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several strategies have been reported to facilitate smoother extubation, such as intravenous
      lidocaine, remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine is a potent, alpha-2-selective
      adrenoceptor agonist that causes sympatholytic, sedation and analgesia without respiratory
      compromise. The sedative properties of dexmedetomidine are largely due to effects on the
      locus ceruleus, producing a level of consciousness mimicking natural sleep Delivering
      dexmedetomidine intravenously to attenuate airway and circulatory reflexes during extubation
      has been extensively evaluated in clinical studies. Recent studies have also indicated that
      the intranasal application of dexmedetomidine is significantly useful and effective in the
      achievement of improved sedation and analgesia) and offers a safety profile similar to
      traditional sedatives ( ketamine and midazolam). Additionally, intratracheal local anesthetic
      instillation has been reported to be effective in preventing laryngeal reflexes. However,
      both the efficacy and safety profile of intratracheal dexmedetomidine applications are
      largely unknown and the technique has not been specifically investigated.
