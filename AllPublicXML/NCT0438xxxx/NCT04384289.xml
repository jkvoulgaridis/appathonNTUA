    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Nurse Led Transitional Care Model (TCM) on the functional
      autonomy, quality of life and rehospitalization rates of elderly patients undergoing open
      heart surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rate and number of successful cases in open heart surgery has been increasing due to the
      advances in medical technology and surgery. To improve patient convalescence results and
      reduce rate of post-discharge readmission to hospital and unplanned post-discharge
      rehospitalization, home-care and follow-up process of patients should be managed
      successfully.

      A total of 66 elderly patients who agreed to participate in the study between November 2017
      and December 2018 were randomly assigned to the intervention (n: 33) and control (n: 33)
      groups. Patients in intervention group were given care based on the TCM until the post
      discharge 9th week starting from date of hospitalization. Patients in control group were
      given standard care services. Functional autonomy and quality of life levels of patients were
      evaluated at admission to the clinic and at the post-discharge 9th week whereas their
      repeated admission rates to the clinic and re-hospitalization rates were evaluated at post
      discharge 2nd, 6th and 9th weeks and finally 6 months. The CONSORT checklist was used to
      check the procedure.

    <time_frame>Baseline(up to 24 hours after the admission) and Week 9 after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF) is a validated, self reported instrument assessing 25 functions of the individual including daily life activities, communication and mental functions. Possible scores range from 0 to -87. A total score below -5 obtained by the elderly person indicates that the patient is at the risk of losing his/her functional autonomy. Change = ( Week 9 after discharge score -Baseline score)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline(up to 24 hours after the admission) inquality of life on the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale at 9th week after discharge.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(up to 24 hours after the admission) and Week 9 after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Quality of Life Scale is a validated, self reported instrument consists of 36 items in total, assessing the health status in eight aspects namely; physical function (10 items), social function (2 items), role limitations due to physical problems (4 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), mental health (5 items), energy/vitality (4 items), pain (2 items) and overall health items (5 items). Each part of the scale is evaluated differently and hence does not have a total score that can be calculated. Change = ( Week 9 after discharge score -Baseline score).</description>
