  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in
      combination with concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by either pembrolizumab with
      olaparib placebo (Arm 1) or with olaparib (Arm 2) compared to concurrent chemoradiation
      therapy followed by durvalumab (Arm 3) in participants with unresectable, locally advanced
      NSCLC. Arms 1 and 2 will be studied in a double-blind design and Arm 3 will be open-label.
      The primary hypotheses are:

        1. Pembrolizumab with concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by pembrolizumab with
           olaparib is superior to concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by durvalumab with
           respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)

        2. pembrolizumab with concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by pembrolizumab is
           superior to concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by durvalumab with respect to PFS
           and OS
