  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated exposure to trauma is an unavoidable part of the job for firefighters. Because of
      this, many Canadian firefighters screen positive for posttraumatic stress disorder/injury
      (PTSD/I). Unfortunately, like the general population, firefighters face many barriers to
      accessing mental health care. As a result, additional efforts are needed to increase timely
      access to effective PTSD/I services that are delivered in a way that reduces confidentiality
      and stigma risk.

      This research study will test the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of distance-delivered
      Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) delivered by a paraprofessional for firefighters with
      PTSD/I. NET is an evidence-based intervention approach developed specifically for PTSD/I
      resulting from repeated and continuous trauma. The intervention will be conducted via
      videoconference with a trained paraprofessional supervised by a clinical psychologist. The
      NET intervention will consist of 12 weekly 90-minute videoconference sessions.

      Approximately 25 firefighters will be recruited to participate in the study. To test the
      efficacy of the intervention, participants will complete self-report questionnaires about
      PTSD/I and other mental health symptoms pre- and post-intervention as well as two- and
      six-months following intervention completion. Participants will also complete an open-ended
      interview at the end of the intervention to assess feasibility and participant satisfaction.
