  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present project is to elucidate the neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying
      value (choice preference) and attention (choice randomness) processing in humans. More
      specifically, the investigators test whether dopaminergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic
      interventions affect neural and behavioral processing of valuation and attention during
      decision-making. The investigators do this by up-regulating dopaminergic, noradrenergic or
      cholinergic neurotransmission pharmacologically through administration of methylphenidate,
      reboxetine, or nicotine.

      To simultaneously assess and dissociate choice preference and randomness in stable
      environments, the investigators plan to use two tasks: (1) a variant of the RISKGARP task, a
      well-established risky decision-making task and (2) a modified Becker-DeGroot-Marshak task
      that measures choice preference and the width of preference representations with the range of
      willingness to pay procedure (range-WTP). Note that wider representations should result in
      more choice randomness. The investigators will assess choice randomness also by repeating the
      same decision questions several times within each task and by relating the preferences
      measured by the RISKGARP task to those measured by the range-BDM task by using the same
      options in both tasks. To assess the impact of changing environments and learning on choice
      preference and randomness, participants will perform two established exploration/exploitation
      tasks. One (3) is a foraging task that has been combined with different pharmacological
      manipulations and the other (4) is a variant of the four-armed bandit task, which allows
      distinguishing value- or information-based exploration from random choice.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-participant study. In this experiment. Participants will receive a preferential dopamine reuptake inhibitor, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, a natural nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, or placebo under double-blind conditions.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Choice data</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants perform decision-making tasks after drug/placebo administration in the main experimental session lasting about 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Choice data made by participants are measured from the experimental tasks. More specifically, the investigators calculate choice preferences, such as the percentage of trials in which participants chose options with probabilistic outcomes in the RISKGARP task and the bids they made in the Range-WTP task, the percentage of exploitative/explorative choices in the four-armed bandit task, and the leaving time in the foraging task. Moreover, the investigators determine choice sub-optimality, such as the number of choices violating transitivity in the RISKGARP task, the inconsistency of bids in repeated trials in the Range-WTP task, the percentage of selecting the worst option in the four-armed bandit task, and the difference between optimal leaving time and actual leaving time in the foraging task.</description>

    <measure>Response time data</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants perform decision-making tasks after drug/placebo administration in the main experimental session lasting about 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Response times are measured from experimental tasks. The investigators calculate how long participants take to make decisions in each trial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The size of pupil dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Pupil size is measured in the main experimental session before drug/placebo administration and through study completion lasting about 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Pupil size is measured using eye-tracker while participants perform the experimental tasks. Baseline pupil size is also measured before the drug/placebo administration.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Computational parameters estimated from experimental data</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants perform decision-making tasks after drug/placebo administration in the main experimental session lasting about 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Computational parameters are estimated from the data of participants during the decision-making tasks. Specifically, mathematical models will be applied to above-mentioned choice data and/or response time data. The estimated parameters reflect choice preference and stochasticity and are complementary to the descriptive measurements mentioned above. For example, utility functions will be estimated and the choice preferences are described by the concavititvity of utility functions.</description>
