  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. The purpose of the
      current study is to evaluate the usage and acceptability of the Soberlink's blood alcohol
      concentration (BAC) unit in collaboration with Aware treatment to assess increased sobriety
      within patients suffering from alcohol use disorder (AUD).

      The specific AIMS will be:

        1. To determine the effectiveness of Soberlink's ability to increase abstinence

        2. To evaluate the impact of Soberlink's device on the participant based on their quality
           of health and sobriety.

        3. To evaluate the extent to which need for higher levels of follow-up care and treatment
           is reduced for individuals who have had access to the Soberlink device.

    <description>The Alcohol TLFB is a drinking assessment method that obtains estimates of daily drinking and has been evaluated with clinical and nonclinical populations.
Using a calendar, people provide retrospective estimates of their daily drinking over a specified time (previous month). The Alcohol TLFB allows several dimensions of a person's drinking to be separately examined: (a) variability (i.e., scatter); (b) pattern (i.e., shape); and (c) extent of drinking (i.e., elevation; how much).</description>

    <measure>Alcohol Abstinence Self-efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale is a 40 question 5 point Likert scale questionnaire where 0 indicates not at all, and 4 indicates extremely. The scale has 4 subfactors (negative, social/positive, physical, and craving/urges) each with 5 questions. Each subfactor score has a range between 0-40. Scores with higher ended number indicate higher levels of lack of self-efficacy.</description>
