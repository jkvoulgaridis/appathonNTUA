  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effectiveness of a culturally adapted version of the Mother-Infant
      Transaction Program (MITP) among Chinese mothers with premature infants in public hospitals
      in Hong Kong.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants at two public hospitals in Hong Kong were identified by ward nurses.
      Mother-infant dyads with infants born at 36 weeks or earlier were assessed for eligibility.
      Data collection was conducted after obtaining written consent from the mothers. Mother-infant
      dyads who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to either the intervention or
      the treatment-as-usual control group. Each dyad was assessed at six time points, i.e.,
      baseline, immediately after intervention/TAU, and when the infants were at the
      gestation-corrected ages of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

    <description>Four sessions were delivered to the mothers one-on-one based on a manualized protocol while the infants were still in the neonatal intensive care units. These coaching sessions included psychological care for the mother and topics on recognizing premature infant's characteristics, understanding and recognizing signs of infant stress and infant's engagement and disengagement cues, principles of graded stimulation, and how to optimize interactions and avoid over-stimulating the infant.</description>
