  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized trial examined the effect of MIND diet intervention on
      cognition and brain structure changes of healthy obese women over three months. The
      intervention group was lea to calorie-restricted modified by the MIND diet, and the control
      group received a calorie-restricted standard diet. The primary end-point was an assessment of
      cognitive performances measured with a comprehensive cognitive test battery. Secondary
      end-points were voxel-based morphometry to quantify the differences in brain structures. Our
      results revealed MIND diet could improve working memory, verbal recognition memory, and
      attention, more in comparison with the control group. Results also suggest that an increase
      in inferior frontal gyrus in the MIND diet group. Our study, for the first time, underlined
      that good adherence to the MIND diet as well as calorie restriction could reverse the
      destructive effect of obesity on cognition.

    <description>All of the participants were tested on a complex paper-based battery of neurocognitive tests to examine changes in cognitive performance in different domains at baseline and after three months follow up. These tests include Forward Digit Span Task (FDST), Backward Digit Span Task (BDST), Letter Number Sequencing Task (LNST), Symbol Digit Modality Task (SDMT), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and Stroop task.</description>
