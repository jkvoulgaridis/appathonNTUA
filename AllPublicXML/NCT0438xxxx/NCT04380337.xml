  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to evaluate whether both chemotherapy and radiotherapy can
      lead to higher rates of clinical complete response leading to organ preservation in human
      subjects with cancer. The objective is to learn if this treatment approach may safely be used
      as an alternative to the standard treatment for rectal cancer and to know the quality-of-life
      in these patients.

      Primary Objective: To assess clinical complete response of an organ preservation approach
      using short course radiation followed by intensified chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objective: To assess safety in all enrolled patients, local regrowth rate and other
      cancer specific outcomes (metastasis-free survival, colostomy-free survival and overall
      survival), longitudinal health-related quality of life of this organ preservation approach

    <description>Treatment will comprise 6 daily fractions of radiotherapy at 5 Gy per fraction followed by 4 months of FOLFOXIRI. Patients who have performance status or conditions that may preclude use of FOLFOXIRI may be treated with FOLFOX or XELOX. Those who achieve a clinical complete response will be considered for organ preservation approach. All other patients will receive standard of care total mesorectal excision (TME).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1.Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of rectum (non-metastatic, &gt;T2N0 or low T2N0
             rectal cancer) not eligible for up-front organ preservation surgery as deemed by
             multidisciplinary evaluation

          -  2.At least 18 years of age

          -  3.For women of childbearing potential or who are not postmenopausal (see Appendix B
             for Definition of Menopausal Status), a negative urine or serum pregnancy test must be

             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the
             duration of study participation and for up to 4 weeks following the study. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  4.ECOG 0, 1, or 2

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(SGPT) &lt;
                  3X upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine &lt;1.5X upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance (CrCL)&gt;50 by
                  Cockcroft-Gault

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1.Prior pelvic RT or chemotherapy for rectal cancer.

          -  2.Upper T2N0 rectal cancers eligible for sphincter-preservation surgery

             intercurrent illness including but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  5.Any concurrent malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix. Patients with any previous malignancy without evidence of disease for

          -  6.Known hypersensitivity to 5-FU compounds.

          -  7.Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded. Women of child-bearing potential who

             pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks after the study are
             excluded. (This applies to women who have experienced menarche and have not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization or are not postmenopausal).

        Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
        treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, known HIV-positive patients with detectable viral
        loads and/or receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study.
