      Routine microscopic examination of the hernia sac is controversial. While some centers do not
      recommend a routine microscopic examination in inguinal hernias in adult patients, they
      recommend them in abdominal wall hernias. The investigators aimed to discuss the pathology
      results and unexpected histopathological findings who underwent abdominal wall and inguinal
      hernia operation in the light of the literature.

      The hernia is defined as the passage of an organ or tissue from one anatomical region to
      another. Hernia sacs are sent to the pathology department, although there is a difference
      between clinics. Routine microscopic examination of the hernia sac is controversial. While
      some centers do not recommend a routine microscopic examination in inguinal hernias in adult
      patients, they recommend them in abdominal wall hernias. Here, the investigators aimed to
      discuss the pathology results and unexpected histopathological findings who underwent
      abdominal wall and inguinal hernia operation in the light of the literature. Patients who
      have operated hernia and sent hernia sac for histopathological examination were
      retrospectively screened. Emergency and elective operated patients were included. Hernia
      repairs without pathology were excluded from the study. Patients' gender, age, operation
      notes, and pathology results were analyzed. Pathology results were analyzed in two groups as
      expected findings and unexpected findings. In our study, the probability of encountering an
      unexpected pathological result was found to be quite low in the pathological evaluation of
      the hernia sac. Although it may cause additional workload and cost, all hernia sacs should be
      sent to routine pathological examination. The investigators believe that making savings in
      these areas through further investigation after the decision of the pathologist.
