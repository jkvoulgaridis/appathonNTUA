  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the effect of a low starch diet (reduction of at least
      40%) in the gut bacteria modulation, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae, and its relation to
      disease activity, functional impairment and quality of life in patients with Ankylosing
      Spondylitis (AS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease characterized by
      axial inflammation and with unknown aetiology. The immune system dysregulation is known,
      where genetic factors play a key role, in particular, the susceptibility associated to the
      HLA-B27 allele. The presence of this genetic marker, seems to trigger an abnormal response of
      the individual, under the action of determine microorganisms, and probably, the combination
      of these two factors may contribute to the manifestation of the disease, through the
      induction of an immune and cytolytic response, leading to tissue injury and promoting the
      inflammation. Intestinal microbiota involvement in spondylarthritis is a controversial issue,
      however, was observed an increased concentration of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria in the
      faeces of AS patients. It has been suggested that an intervention aiming these bacteria's
      starving could benefit the reduction of the inflammatory processes and be a part of AS
      treatment. The bowel microflora depends on dietary intake, like undigested starch, for their
      growth. Some studies have highlighted the relation between the intake of starch and the
      disease activity. The modulation of the microbiota, particularly, the reduction of
      Klebsiella, may be beneficial as a complementary approach to AS therapy.

      A sample of 300 patients with AS, followed-up at Portuguese Institute of Rheumatology in
      Lisbon, will be randomly assigned in two groups. The group A will adopt a balanced diet based
      on the general recommendations for healthy eating by the World Health Organization, for a
      period of 6 weeks. In Group B will be implemented an individual balanced low starch diet,
      which is characterized by the significant reduction of starchy food, of at least 40% of the
      total daily ingested starch.

      The change in biometric data, body composition, intestinal Klebsiella will be related to food
      intake, disease activity and quality of life assessments. These data will be compared between
      the 2 groups (diet A versus diet B), obtaining measures on the effect of each diet on the
      analyzed variables.

    <description>The BASDAI is a six question, participant-reported measure of overall disease activity that probed the level of fatigue, neck/back/hip pain, peripheral joint swelling and pain, localized tenderness, as well as morning stiffness severity and duration. The mean measurement (score) of questions 5 and 6 is added to the scores from questions 1 to 4 and divided by 5 to calculate the total BASDAI score. It is scored on a numerical rating scale that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (severe symptoms), higher scores indicating severe disability due to AS disease. Data are presented as mean total BASDAI score +/- standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (at baseline and the end of follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales. The PCS had 4 subscales: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, and general health perception. The MCS had 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; 0= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health and well-being.</description>
