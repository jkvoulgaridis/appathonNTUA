  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication is an efficacious treatment strategy for adolescents with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), however use significantly declines during
      adolescence when the consequences of ADHD are most severe (e.g. dropping out of school,
      delinquency, etc.). The Unified Theory of Behavior Change (UTBC) has been proposed as a
      conceptual model to explain the mechanism underlying ADHD medication adherence and to guide
      the development of interventions to improve the continuity of treatment. The UTBC is a
      well-established and empirically tested model that identifies factors that influence an
      individual's intention to perform a behavior as well as factors that influence whether a
      behavior is actually carried out. Indeed, the research team's preliminary data support the
      relevance of pre-intention factors and implementation factors for medication continuity among
      adolescents with ADHD. Currently, no evidence-based interventions target medication
      continuity for adolescents with ADHD. The objective of this study is to test a
      multi-component intervention that systematically identifies and targets aspects of the UTBC
      model most relevant for each adolescent with poor ADHD medication continuity. The central
      hypothesis is that the tailored intervention will support ADHD medication continuity. The
      study will objectively test the central hypothesis by conducting a randomized controlled
      trial among adolescents with poor medication continuity to test whether the intervention
      engages the mechanism underlying medication continuity and improves outcomes.

Each subscale produces a score which ranges from 1 to 4 with higher scores indicating more of that behavior.</description>

    <description>Medication continuity tools integrated within the mehealth for ADHD software will assess factors influencing medication continuity for each adolescent and recommend tools to address relevant factors. Tools include 1) a system to track outcomes and resolve uncertainty about the need for and/or benefit from medicine, 2) a module to address stigma, 3) a module to help manage side effects, and 4) reminders to take medicine and/or request refills.</description>
