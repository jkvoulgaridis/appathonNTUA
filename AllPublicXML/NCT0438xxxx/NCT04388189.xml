  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LEAP-DB study will be conducted to validate the utility of EEG biomarkers as an aid to
      antidepressant treatment selection in adults with MDD.

    <textblock>
      The LEAP-DB study is an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, blinded study to evaluate the
      performance of EEG-based biomarkers in predicting treatment outcome. Study participants will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either duloxetine or bupropion and followed for 8
      weeks.

    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) is a 16 item self-report scale that measures depressive symptoms. The QIDS assesses the severity of all DSM-V criterion items required to diagnose a major depressive episode. It asks the patient to rate each of 16 items on a scale from 0 to 3. Additionally, it states the frequency and severity of symptoms that patients should consider while responding to items in the survey. Each item in the survey asks about depressive symptoms that the patient may have experienced in the past seven days.</description>
