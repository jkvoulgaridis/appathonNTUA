        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is &gt; 18 years old

          2. Presence of severe MR as read on a transthoracic echocardiographic study

          3. Mitral leaflet coaptation surface is sufficient to reduce mitral regurgitation without
             undue leaflet tension (approximate leaflet to gap ratio of 2:1) based on the judgment
             of the patient eligibility committee and the operating surgeon

          4. Degenerative mitral valve disease with mid-segment P2 prolapse

          5. Patient is able to sign informed consent and able to return for follow-up and is
             capable of participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is of the age where further growth is expected

          2. Active endocarditis

          3. Left ventricular or left atrial appendage thrombus

          4. Severe mitral annular and/or leaflet calcification

          5. Cannot tolerate procedural anticoagulation or post-procedure antiplatelet regimen

          6. Mitral stenosis

          7. Functional Mitral Valve disease

          8. Previous mitral valve replacement surgery

          9. Fragile or thinning apex

         10. Contraindications to transoesophageal echocardiography (atlantoaxial disease, severe
             generalized cervical arthritis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, significant dysphagia
             and odynophagia, has received extensive radiation to the mediastinum)

         11. Patient is pregnant or lactating
